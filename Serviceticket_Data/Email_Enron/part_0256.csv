On Tues and Wed  27-28 Nov 01 CAISO will be having ""focus"" group meetings on its proposal to begin assessing penalties on uninstructed deviations.

I have already briefed Foster and Williams III on this topic.

Tim Belden was unavailable last week but wants West Desk to be ""on"" this topic, particularly Mallory and Williams III.

I am out of town on Monday but would nonetheless want to have a meeting with Belden and Mallory on this topic to better focus our position and figure out who will attend the session in Folsom.

Attached is a white paper prepared by CAISO and my list of questions/issues.  If the white paper seems to formidable, there is a briefing chart available on the same topic on CAISO's website (Kit Blair has copies too).

  

Kara, please set up a call in number and get a small room at the above referenced time.

Alan"

Group,

Going forward we will be transacting with Enron Canada Corp on an over-the-counter basis.  We will provide them with a bid and an offer suitable for non-firm energy trades.  Enron Canada will contact us each morning to inquire about possibilities for export and import.  We should be familiar with the Alberta Power Pool forecast and be aware of the conversion from CDD to USD.  The lead or NW trader will provide Enron Canada with their estimate or feel of the market each morning and throughout the day.  

Enron Canada will be trying to obtain non-firm transmission nearly every hour.  WE need to tell them if this is an unwise practice from a risk-reward standpoint based on our understanding of the market, as they will lose around $7 per mw (CDD) on unused transmission with zero chance for return.  

Further, Enron Canada wants the opportunity to transact with other counterparties at the BC Border.  They will give us the first look, but if we cannot use their energy, they will contact WWP, IPC, TransAlta or other counterparty in an attempt to recoup some of their loss.  I do not see a need for this and I think it leaves us open to tainted customer relationships, financial loss, and embarrassment.  If we are in contact with Enron Canada before the fact (start of the day, top of the hour, etc.) we should be able to get them the best price for their energy.  Be very clear in your dealings with NW counterparties that you are buying or selling a non-firm product.  Determine a book-out price to solve problems with physical flow if necessary.  We are basically buying a put or a call and should pay our counterparty appropriately.

Finally, I would like to see improved communication with Enron Canada.  It appears we have limited our contacts within our own company and hindered the flow of information to both parties' detriment.  I feel we can do better.  I want to prevent a repeat of this weekend (ECC selling/buying from a counterparty in the US without our knowledge) and do not want the NW being scoured by both Enron Canada and Enron North America.  This is counterproductive for both parties for obvious reasons.  Providing a bid/offer and being prepared to act on it is a change in our relationship with Enron Canada.  This should force a renewed emphasis on communication and market fundamentals that can only be beneficial.  If you have questions or ideas regarding our relationship with Enron Canada, please let me know.

Thanks,
Bill"

Hi Bill,

I know you have been out and I will be out all next week so I will e-mail
these to you.

May 18th    HE 12 sale to PNM the 40 needs to be a 45 @ $120.00
May 18th    Got the note from ""you all"" that HE 16 PNM Cont, they show 0
and you show 13.  Need to know who is correct on this.
May 20th    Purchase totals not adding up
May 21st    Change HE 13 sale to PNM to a 20

and

May 13th   An on-peak schedule -32@Amrad ran on Sunday (13th) and shouldn't
have.  PSCO had done a month long tag that was incorrect.
                     What we agreed on was to by the -32 HE 7-22 @ $30.00
from them.  Need you to please add this to the model and ENPOWER as a
                      real-time deal.

If you have any questions, Roger will be filling in for me.

Thanks,

Hi Bill,

When you get a chance can you correct this day?

HE 14 sale to CISO/Powerx 20 MWH should be @ $250.00
HE 15 sale to CISO/Powerx should be a 0 MWH (Cut at top of hour)
HE 11 and 12 sale to CISO/Powerx 25 MWH's should be @ $215.00

Also,  do you know what the 25 MWH FC/PV swap deal  with AEP/APS is.  We
don't show this in our EMS.  Could it be one of Enron's deals and on the
model
by mistake??  Prices are $350.00 and $520.00???

Thanks,

Kathy

Good morning Bill

On 4/28 could you move the -100 bookouts for HE 5 & 6 for $6.00 to the top
for direct bill.  Any cuts on the PSCO deals we are keeping together.

Also, today is the end of the month.  I will probably be checking out with
Amy (Kelley's replacement in Houston) Wed. or Thurs. so will need all the
models corrected by then.

Thanks,

Kathy"

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
Metal Bulletin - Iron and Steel Awards for 2000
Pushiest Entrant: Enron, the US commodity trading company, which promised it would revolutionize the steel business by offering futures in hot rolled coil via its online market place.

The EIM Fundamentals Analysis group is excited to announce that Dave Allan has joined as a Director, responsible for all Forest Products lines.  He comes to EIM with 20 years of experience in the Forest Products industry, of which 14 were spent at Abitibi and 6 with Pulp and Paper Week.  Please join us in welcoming Dave.

The Siebel Team (""The Force"") continues to work towards program implementation of its customer management system in early May, with training to begin at the end of April.  Stay tuned for updates.

Enron Global LNG
Enron Global LNG is positioning itself to be a creator and leader of a global wholesale LNG market.  The rising prices of natural gas in the United States and concerns over future energy supplies have created a bullish outlook for LNG in the U.S. and around the globe.   LNG has played a major role in serving energy needs in many parts of the world, but its place in the U.S. energy picture has been limited. An LNG market that spans the globe can supply vast amounts of otherwise stranded gas to the world's growing appetite for cleaner burning fuels.   Enron Global LNG sees great opportunity for Enron's wholesale energy business model to help shape yet another energy market.


IN THE NEWS

Enron Corp. Says First-Quarter Profit Rose 20 Percent 
Houston, April 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, said first-quarter profit rose 20 percent as sales almost quadrupled. Profit from operations rose to $406 million, or 47 cents, from $338 million, or 40 cents, in the year-earlier period.

First-quarter revenue surged to $50.1 billion from $13.1 billion as Enron boosted the volume of power sold in North America by 90 percent. Enron had a first-quarter gain of $19 million, or 2 cents a share, for an accounting change, making net income $425 million, or 49 cents a share. There were no charges or gains in the year-earlier period.

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron America's Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge. 

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America's sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization. 

Questions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to:
Joe Deffner		853-7117
Alan Quaintance	345-7731"

Hello --

It's that time of year again.  The mid-year PRC will be starting soon.  I have yet to get the official documentation from the A/A program so if you can do the following for me I'd appreciate it.

Please:

1.) Let me know who your immediate supervisor is. Name, phone, etc.
2.) Let me know whether you are still being represented by me...the only way you wouldn't be is if you were promoted to associate at year-end
3.) Let me know what you've been up to by giving me a few paragraphs on:
What you're currently doing -- responsibilities, highlights, specific deals or actions
What you've been doing since year-end (I would assume it's the same but some people may have rotated, etc.)
Then please list at least two people I can call to follow-up...please provide their phone numbers.


Thanks and I will be setting up appointments during late May.

Jon

		4 tickets in the lower level, parking included

Package 2:	Blazers vs. Minnesota Timberwolves

If you donated money or a gift and were not able to enter your name into the drawing, please us know--we would be more than happy to add your name.  

Also, we have requested receipts from the Salvation Army for the cash donations that were received. If you would like a receipt for your donation, please contact Grace directly. 

PLEASE NOTE: Many employees who are no longer with the company took part in our Enron Elves efforts. Recognizing their contributions, we will be including them in the drawing.

The Fall Associate and Analyst Recruiting Super Saturdays are scheduled for Saturday, Nov 10 and Saturday, Nov 17.  The candidates arrive on Friday, are given a tour of the Floor and then presentations will be held thereafter.   The November 10 Event will be Analyst-level candidates.  The November 17 Event will be Associate-level candidates.

Now, here's the real info!    :  )

On both Fridays (Nov 9 & Nov 16) we will be sponsoring a get together (Happy Hour) at the Heathman for all the Associates & Analysts .  This means FREE drinks and food from 4:30 PM ---> 6:30 PM.  This will give you an opportunity to meet the candidates, check them out and if necessary ""sell"" them on Enron.

We will be sending out more reminders and confirmations, but block out your calendars for these two Fridays.  Let me know if you have any questions!

Time:		8:00am - 5:00pm

Course Description
This course builds on our Applied Energy Derivatives program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective.  Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring / marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.  Applied Energy Derivatives, or its equivalent is a prerequisite for this program; no other advanced preparation is required.  CPE Credits: Accounting & Auditing 2; Consulting Services 1; Management 1; Specialized Knowledge & Applications 12.

At the conclusion of this course, participants will be able to:
Decipher the role of the price curve, volatility, and time in determining the intrinsic value and time value of an option premium
Understand how a dealer 'trades volatility' and dynamically hedges an option
Recognize the limitations of traditional option pricing models when applied to energy
Annualize a periodic (e.g. monthly) volatility and vice versa
Create synthetic puts and calls using put-call parity to exploit mispriced options
Incorporate volatility term structures, ""smiles and skews"", in analyzing deals
Establish a delta-neutral hedge of an option and calculate the cost of changing prices on that hedge position
Comprehend the relationship between gamma and actual price volatility and its consequent implications for a dealer's earnings
Anticipate the irregular changes in gamma by stress testing option portfolios, thereby allowing more informed position management
Interpret an aggregated risk management report for an option portfolio and the positive or negative values for delta, gamma, theta, vega and rho
Structure an option on a swap to create innovative hedges for customers
Create extendable and cancelable fixed price deals
Embed a swaption sale to create sub-index physical supply to a user
Compare the merits and earnings opportunities among various alternatives available to a customer seeking to reverse an existing swap position
Determine the cash value of a swap terminated before its end date
Apply swaps with off-market fixed prices to monetize value in existing contracts or to provide for the cash/borrowing needs of a customer
Combine off-market swaps in complex structures: e.g. ""blend-and-extend"""

			Open Enrollment for your 2002 Health Benefits begins Monday, October 29, 2001!  

Q. 	WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
A. 	If you plan to make changes to your existing benefit coverage, you will need to make changes during Open Enrollment which begins 	Monday, October 29, 2001 at 8:00 AM (Central) and ends on November 12, 2001 at 5:00 PM (Central)
	
	To facilitate these changes, you received an Open Enrollment Benefit Packet at your home address.  This packet contains a personalized 	worksheet and the Enron Instruction Guide to help you make your selections.  
	(If you have not received your Info Packet, please let us know ASAP! ) 


Q.	WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?
	1.  If you are satisfied with your current elections and do not need to make changes, do nothing.  Your current choices will automatically roll 	over to 2002. 

	2.  If you plan to make changes to your coverage, you will need to either access the Intranet website at work:  benefits.enron.com    
	or at home at  www.Enron.BenefitsNow.com   or call the Phone Enrollment Line at (800) 332-7979, Option 5.


Q. 	I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS.  I NEED MORE INFORMATION. 
A.	If you have more questions or need more information, you may attend our Open Enrollment ""Brown Bag"" Info Session being held on Friday, 	October 26 @ 11:30 PM in the Mt Hood Conference Room.  

See you then!

This information was sent by Tim Belden and Chris Calger earlier in the year. I am sending it again for the benefit of our new hires and as a reminder to be responsible while enjoying this evening's event.

============

Over the last couple of years we have had numerous social events including holiday parties, post-quarterly meeting outings, and going away parties. While I hope that people thoroughly enjoy themselves, I ask that you keep in mind that we all have to act professionally and responsibly during and after these events. I have been working with Chris Calger and Amy FitzPatrick to put together some guidelines for company-sponsored social events:

The company will provide soft drinks, beer and wine. You may choose to order other beverages at your expense.
Functions will run for a specified period of time. If there is an open bar, we will establish a time certain after which Enron will not pay for any additional drinks.
If you require assistance getting home, please contact a taxi and submit the fare for expense reimbursement with no questions asked. The last thing in the world we want is to have people break the law or put their safety and the safety of others in jeopardy.

============

PLEASE NOTE: We now have cab vouchers available for our company events. Please check with your admin assistant to obtain a voucher, or see me at the event--no questions asked.

Thanks,
Grace

Here is the G&A Expense worksheet to use as a guide for next year's budget.  I've tried to put as many notes into your assumptions as I could find.  For the 2002 plan, I already input salaries adjusted for merit increases (4.25%) and special pays.  Please update the rest of the 2002 plan column and enter all assumptions used to calculate the amounts.  Some examples of assumptions are if you know you are going to attend certain conferences, have a customer outing, plan travel expense per employee, or add additional headcount.  If you could please complete this and send back to me by the end of the week, it would be greatly appreciated.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Grace,
Hello, were very excited that you have decided to except our invitation!!
Due to the large traffic of companies that week because of the business
career fair, we will be having two speakers at the meeting on September 26
(your company and Enterprise).  Since Enterprise accepted first we will have
them present first.

We were thinking that we would a lot you both up to 45 minutes.  It doesn't
have to be that long though.  Feel free to present whatever you would like.
Some examples of what you could talk about... your companies history,
positions recruiting for, what your looking for in a candidate, what a makes
a resume stand out, a questions and answer section, etc.

Feel free to bring treats, or little company toys like the ones handed out
at job fairs.  I think Enterprise was thinking about bringing pizza.

Feel free to contact me with any other questions.  I will get in touch with
you when the date gets closer to finalize everything.

Sincerely,
Colleen Gibson

Bill: I've checked the information for the WSU Student Marketing meeting on 9/26, and it will take place at the WSU campus (so: no driving to Lacey, WA!). I have not yet heard back from the president of the organization, but will let you know the details when I find out what they are. The meeting begins at 7:00pm on the 26th--drive down that morning? I'll follow-up with you later.

Dear Grace,

I hope your summer is giving you some opportunities to enjoy nice weather.

We've had an interesting inquiry from a national business publication;
they're looking for stories about people who've been through our negotiation
courses who feel the course played a significant role in their professional
-- or personal lives.

Can you think of anyone from Enron/Portland who might be interested in being
interviewed?

Please give my regards to the 'gang'.  I look forward to working with you
again.

Cordially,
Steve

Effective with the November 15 payday, electronic viewing and printing of

feature allows you to view your pay information at a time convenient for
you.  Later this year, you will be able to view this information from your
home on your ClickAtHome computer.

The following is information to help you view this document beginning on
November 15.  To access and print your pay advice from eHRonline:

     1.   Log-on to eHRonline with your ""P"" number and password.
     For more details on how to log-on to eHRonline, see
     step-by-step instructions at
     http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/
     2.   Navigate to the pay advice using the following navigation
     menus:
?    Pay Information
?    Paycheck Inquiry
     3.   Select the appropriate payroll period.
     4.   Click on the Continue button.
     5.   Click on the payroll period link under the Period heading;
     a new window opens.
     6.   Select the Open this file from its current location option.
     7.   Click on the OK button; this starts Adobe Acrobat Reader.
     8.   View your pay advice.
     9.   Click on the Print icon from the main toolbar.
   10.    Verify/change the displayed printer.
   11.    Click on the OK button to print the pay advice at the
     designated printer.  For more details on how to view & print
     your pay advice from eHRonline, see step-by-step
     instructions at http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/

The advice information will remain on this site throughout the year
allowing you to view or print the information at your convenience.  You can
view a sample of the online pay stub by following this link to
http://hrweb.enron.com/, click on Payroll Services and then on Payroll
Forms.

If you'd like more details, there will be an Information Booth on November
13 through 15 from 11 am to 2 pm in the lobby of Enron North.  Come by and
visit with Payroll Representatives who will demonstrate how the process
works.

I believe CPE stands for ""Continuing Professional Education."" Basically, some certifications (CPA, CFA, Legal) require a person to complete a minimum number of training hours to keep the certification current. A CPE hour goes toward filling that requirement.

Please schedule an interview for this candidate to meet with me, Bill and anyone else that Bill recommends.   We need to treat this one 'right' - he is the brother of a VP in Houston........

Amy,
If Jesse is available I would like to add him to interview Kate Symes tomorrow in place of Geir, otherwise we'll keep it as it is...I sent an email to him already but have not heard back...perhaps Grace could help?
Also, if we could meet and talk about the transmission training on Friday and Saturday, I would like to give the administrative information to Eric Linder and Mark Guzman...
Please let me know when you might have a moment.
Thanks much,

Bill

Leaf -

I just received a call from payroll - they miscalculated your vacation payback.

Rather than the $1,113.66, you actually only owe $957.04 (they forgot to take away your OR state taxes in the first calculation).

Can you please write another check and we will void the first one?  Do you want the check returned to you?

Sorry for the inconvenience.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Derivatives I - Applied Energy Derivatives
Presented by Paradigm Strategy Group

Date:  		Monday, June 4th and Tuesday, June 5th
Time:		8:00 am to 5:00 pm

This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today.  An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Participants attending this seminar will be able to:

Formulate customer hedge strategies based on a solid understanding of risk; its impact on capital structures and approaches to its mitigation.
Develop and interpret forward prices in the context of arbitration disciplines, as well as understand the divergences from these disciplines that are characteristic of energy prices.
Identify marketing opportunities through an understanding of both the forward curve and the distortions created by the physical system of production and transportation.
Assemble the pricing of a transaction from a benchmark price curve.
Devise cost-reducing deal structures for gas storage from an understanding of price curves and their components.
Exploit differences in locational pricing with insights into the relationship between basis and transportation/transmission.
Structure a natural gas and power swap to hedge a company's risk position, explaining its risks and benefits as a risk management tool.
Price a swap from the price curve and customize the structure to meet various customer needs including earnings, cash flow and embedded financing. 
Apply basis swaps to either mitigate locational risk or to achieve a more favorable risk/reward position by altering the index location.
Attain a fluency in language concepts and hedging application of options.
Package strips of options to create caps, floors and zero-premium collars.
Create structures that provide energy users with sub-index pricing using embedded options.
Recognize options embedded in common supply contracts and their pricing implications, including swing, double-ups and index contracts with maximum prices, etc.

We had some problems with Netscape on Saturday.  The El Paso scrape was down from 5AM through the end of my night shift.  Dave Steiner was notified early in the afternoon and I was told it was a problem in Houston.  The problem should be solved by Sunday.  Problem it caused:  I was not able to download HA finals from the ISO and finals were not created."

REAL TIME TRADERS,

SPS HAS MANAGED TO OVER SCHEDULE BY 100MW PER HOUR ON PEAK HOURS SUNDAY 1/20 AT PV THEIR EDDY/PV SWAP WITH EPE. Steve at EPE has agreed to a leading deal with SPS where SPS/PSCO will supply 100 mw at PV real time to EPE. El Paso already has tags out there showing EPE as the source for SPS sales. 

SPS/PSCO will supply the energy to El Paso at PV and El Paso should show it going to their system. Steve was supposed to let the dispatchers know all the details.

All:

A more detailed version  of CAISO's MD02 proposal was released on Wednesday.  Below I am copying a summary prepared by Andy Brown who covers these matters for IEP.

It appears that the CAISO proposal will allow for SC's to go short or long in the R/T market (i.e., final schedules do not need to be balanced).  That's good.  

I think the most material issue at this point is how the forward capacity requirement (ACAP, akin to ICAP) will affect our trading.

GAC

What is CAISO proposing?

First off, there are ""target price"" and ""intra-zonal congestion management""
FERC filings that are apparently almost ready for a drop at FERC.  The
""comprehensive"" package would build off that.

In essencence, CAISO is proposing a capacity market (similar to what IEP
proposed at the CPUC ""Procurement OIR"") that has an ""available capacity
obligation"" (ACAP) on the load-serving entities (LSEs, aka the utilities and
electric service providers).  This is the solution to the ""all spot, all the
time"" design that was associated with the CPUC's ""mandatory buy/sell""
requirement and failure to provide forward reasonableness guidelines for the
utilities.  The LSEs would be required to show / specify to CAISO the ACAP
resources on a month-ahead basis equal to at least 115% of the coming
month's peak demand.  ACAP resources can be the LSE's own generation,
generation under contract, etc.  Failure to procure sufficient ACAP would
lead to penalties.  Also, CAISO appears to suggest that it would be in the
middle of arrangements between a LSE and the capacity supply as it would
penalize the supplier for failure to be available, operate as dispatched,
etc.  That wrinkle seems like it calls for 3 party contracts or some element
of complexity that shouldn't necessarily be required.  Its not clear from
the paper how costs for CAISO-dispatched ACAP resource would be allocated to
other SCs, particularly where a LSE contracted for the capacity, but CAISO's
running it to cover someone else's short energy schedule?  

It is not particularly clear how DWR resources fit into the mix (there seems
to be a contradictory statement in the paper).  However, CAISO is proposing
a two-year ""transition"" mechanism where CAISO would provide the ACAP
resources (based on their stellar creditworthiness?? or DWR resources??).
There could be tension here with the proposals at the CPUC proceeding.
Also, it appears that an argument can be made that DWR is a LSE under the
terms of AB 1x.  

CAISO is also moving toward a forward nodal-based congestion mechanism,
similar to the PJM type of design.  It is based on a 3000 bus network model
with simplified modeling of adjacent control areas.  Dispatch will be on an
optimized basis that on resource constraints (that appears to be dynamic)
including transmission capacity changes (increased ATC when ETC rights are
freed up, etc.) and generation availability.  There will be some degree of
node aggregation (in the form of demand locations and trading hubs).  It
appears that RMR contracts could disappear under this approach, although
that is not completely clear.

Creation of the forward congestion approach with security based optimization
effectively removes the need for the ""balanced schedule"" requirement.  Under
the proposal, CAISO would make trades happen in realtime through the
optimization to the extent not addressed through the forward markets. CAISO
calls for the resurrection of a day ahead energy market (FERC has called for
that).  CAISO says its open to that market being run outside of CAISO, but
that the need is for a centralized day ahead energy market that could help
shape resource needs.

CAISO would have the ability to dispatch identified ACAP resources not
already scheduled by the LSE.  They speak in terms of a ""residual unit
commitment"" requirement ... something akin to the ""long lead time"" proposal
under the ""must-offer"" requirement.  Their start and min load payment
proposal would be continued, subject to loosing it for unavailability or
participation in the market.  

Note that CAISO states they will need to mitigate bids due to ""locational
market power"", particularly in relation to congestion.  I thought that
locational market power was addressed via RMR.  This raises the ""black box""
issue if CAISO is going to say on a realtime basis that they have some
dynamic problem and only a particular generation asset could address the
problem so we're mitigating your bid curve based on some form of proxy
pricing mechanism.  To some extent, in a nodal system, CAISO could argue
that more folks have ""locational market power.""  We'll need to review other
markets' treatment of this issue.

The future of the AS markets is questioned in the paper, and there's the
specific suggestion that the replacement reserve market is unnecessary if
ACAP is put into place.  This is probably the largest hole in the paper,
because there's a clear implication that something should happen and
presumably CAISO has at least come up with some set of options on the issue
(i.e., kill AS, have AS markets but alter products, have one AS product but
expect low volume, etc).

One element that seemed missing was a discussion of demand response.  In
many respects that element has been consistently missing in the market, save
the extraordinary conservation last summer.  There is a suggestion that the
ACAP requirement could be addressed by demand response, but presumably that
would need to be demand that could be dispatched by CAISO, and those
resources are particularly limited under the current CAISO demand-side
design.  While efforts on interruptible programs has occurred at the CPUC,
it is not clear that the two entities are heading in the same direction.

It was noted earlier that the ACAP proposal is similar to what IEP (and
others) suggested at the CPUC Procurement OIR.  Based on a lone comment by a
CPUCer during the CAISO media call yesterday, the CPUC is very far behind
the curve on these issues, and there is absolutely no coordination on this
issue.  Given that the same ""solution"" is popping up in both venues, there
is a real need to make sure that the two pieces can fit together, while
avoiding a bureaucratic paralysis that could happen if a formal attempt to
""coordinate"" the venues is proposed.

I echo Jon Gail's disappointment about the winter season.  Jon Bloomfield 
and I are looking into scheduling a time to have a practice of some kind 
(most likely just pick-up soccer) that perhaps can meet regularly.  We will 
keep you posted.

As for the spring season, the registration deadline is February 18, so 
although the season doesn't start until April, the sooner you can send me or 
Jon your moneys, the easier it is on us.

Hope to be in touch with you all soon.  If you play on TBA, I'll see you 
tonight.

Hi Guys, 

The bad news is that we did not get a team in the 5 game winter turf season.
Since we have had a team the past two years and they had more teams than
they can accommodate we were put into a drawing with teams similar to us and
our number did not get drawn.  So we'll need to get our soccer some other
way.  Practices anyone?  Also many of us do play indoor at Portland Indoor
on FC TBA so if you are interested show up at the game. The first game of
the next season starts tonight at 10:15 I think the cost is $50 but ask Mike
B. or Ryan if there is still room and what the cost to play is.  For a
schedule go to www.pdxindoorsoccer.com.  As far as the money many of you
already paid, I propose to hold onto it and will use it to pay the Spring
season registration which starts in late April.  Let me know if that is a
problem for you.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.  

Jon

Hi Guys,

Not sure who is in charge of the indoor team but I noticed we have our first
game of the upcoming season this Thursday night at 10:15 against FC Cosmos.
For more info go to 
http://www.pdxindoorsoccer.com/

As for me my hamstring is slowly healing so I should be back out there
before too long.  Later.

Awww Jeahh.  It's nice to hear from you.  Ive 
been trying to get in touch with yall for quite 
some time.

Please reply back to this message and let me 
know how ""Things"" are.  Yes, the question is 
ambiguous, but try to go with it.

In response to ""What up?:""

Everything has reached a new status quo. I live 
in Gig Harbor and attend class at UW Tacoma 
(UWT for short).  Class is great and their are 
plenty of beautiful lasses for viewing 
pleasure.  Hopefully I will be out of GH soon.  
I will start looking for jobs in Portland, 
Seattle, and SF (possibly) in Spring.  I have 
not been working on my tan.

I would really like to visit the city of Roses 
in the next few weekends.  What are your 
plans?   I hope everything is well with you.  
Please write back soon.

Buenos Nachos,
Scott

All:

For those people wanting to learn more about Var calculation and application, I've put a copy of JP Morgan's RiskMetrics documentation on the P: drive under \MidMarketing\RiskMetrics. Of the five documents, Part 2 probably gets most directly at the questions that were being asked in Matt's seminar.

Dear Colleague,

This note is to inform you that, effective January 3, 2002, PIRA Energy
Group will terminate delivery of the Energy Retainer Services, which we
have been providing Enron for almost a decade.  This action is based on
the instructions we received from your company last month. Your Online
password will be deactivated and your emails will cease.

We hope not only that you have found value and use from our comprehensive
fundamental analysis of oil, natural gas, and electricity markets, but that
you have enjoyed working with PIRA and its staff.  We have certainly
appreciated our close working relationship with Enron and we regret the
disruption. We certainly hope that we can restart a relationship with many
of you who will remain with Enron or move on elsewhere. Should it be the
case that you require continued delivery from, and Online access to, PIRA's
services, please respond to this email or contact Jeff Steele at
(212) 686-6808, or jsteele@pira.com.

To all of you, we wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.

Group,

There is a new binder for EPE hourly deals for 2002. The deal sheets MUST be kept in this binder. We are currently missing the deal sheet for 12/30/01 to 01/01/02. Please be on the lookout for this sheet or sheets. Those who were on shift for that period will need to coordinate what deals were done and will need to reconstruct a sheet. 

These sheets are currently a main source of information on EPE for settlements. The deal sheets should be clear, concise, and should have information such as energy type, delivery point, who you spoke with and at what time.

I will be sending another email regarding EPE procedure and model updates for 2002.

Thanks,
Bill"

Group,
Enron is attempting to reconcile the daily activities of each counterparty with us. This includes when each counterparty cut us, and schedules that were moved. To facilitate these efforts please put all cuts and scheduling sheets in the accordion file on the RT overflow desk (where Kate used to sit).

Also, stay tuned for new information on EPE. Apparently the information communicated by Tony was not completely correct.

Thanks,

Group,
There have been a fair amount of changes to the schedule recently--we need to start tracking these ""off-schedule sheet"" changes.
So...
If you will be unable to work a shift it is your responsibility to find a replacement, and then let me know through a phone call or an email regarding the switch.

Thanks,
Bill

To whom it may concern:

For January 2, 2002, the in order to pass phase II within the CISO market, I agreed to take a schedule from the DA to the HA in NP15 with the APX.  The schedule is for 17mw on peak.  I built a load zone in PGE3 (ST Cali) and took the trade with the APX to zero.  Please be sure to reempliment the original schedule.  I spoke with Max @ the APX and the schedule was changed because the APX could not verify the schedule with their customer (Sierra Pacific Holdings).  If you have any questions please give me a call.

To the West Desk et al:

The FERC's west-wide price cap has been raised to at least $108/MWh beginning today through 30 April 02.  Please see the order excerpt below.  Although market prices are well below both the old and new cap, the new cap will give the markets more breathing room if there is an unexpected cold snap and/or supply disruption.

I am happy to report that the one of Enron's advocacy messages made it into the order: any change to the cap must be applied West-wide.  PNW parties and Duke were willing to settle with region-specific caps but FERC rejected that concept in favor of a single, West-wide value.

Alan Comnes

Relevant Passage:

""Effective on the trading day following the date of this order, through April 30, 2002, we will suspend the methodology used to calculate the current mitigated price and substitute the following West-wide winter season methodology. As a starting point, the
mitigated price will be set at $108/MWh. This is the actual mitigated price set using the current methodology during the last reserve deficiency on May 31, 2001, based on a gas index of $6.641/MMBtu, a generating unit with a heat rate of approximately 15,360 Btu/MWh and $6.00 for the O&M adder. The new interim mitigated price will supersede the existing mitigated price (approximately $92/MWh), which was set at eighty-five percent of the originally calculated $108/MWh mitigated price for application during non-reserve deficiency hours. We find this adjustment necessary to set the price for the winter period and to track changes in the gas indices.

The winter formula will maintain the current heat rate and O&M adder. The one variable in the formula will be tied to the current average of the mid-point for the monthly bid-week index prices reported for SoCal Gas (large packages), Malin and PG&E city-gate. Under the winter season formula, the mitigated price will be recalculated when the average gas price rises by a minimum factor of 10 percent (e.g., to $7.305/MMBtu) effective for the following trading day. The formula will also track subsequent
cumulative changes of at least 10 percent (including reductions of 10 percent, but not less than a floor of $108/Mwh). Effective on May 1, 2002, the summer methodology will be reinstated along with the current mitigated price of approximately $92/Mwh for non-emergency periods."""

Being that he realized he was wrong and appologized I wouldnt want to jeopardize any future realationship with LADWP over one instance with him as he has been okay in the past.  However you will need to still pull the tapes for Geirs conversation which occured somewhere between 16:00 and 17:30.  Thanks."

As per Fred's suggestion it is much better to buy from TEP at Springerville rather than PV.  It is less costly to bring it home.  The tag is much shorter but should be an easy modification from the one we usually use when we buy from TEP.  Also this causes fewer problems for both TEP and EPE dispatchers.

Thanks,

Ryan"

Just wanted you to know that EPE lost one of the Turbines hour ending 18 @ about 17:30 or so...I tried to buy power from everyone but to almost no avail (exept 50mw @ 53.00 integrated to a 13mw 3/4 past the hour)...Furthermore, I cut IID to a 100mw from a 120mw which integrated to a 115mw (being as I kept the first 100 whole),

For HE 19 I was forced to cut one of a 25mw purchase from PNM @ $32.00 to a 13mw because our imports were over capacity.  I also bought back 50mw from IID for HE 20 @ $40.00.

Please see the note for more details or the model and ask me with any questions

Susan -
I just tested the schedule pull again and found one more deal type we need to exclude - ANNUITIES. The download pulls in purchase and sale annuities as regular forward purchases and sales, recognizing the average price as the total annuity price, which is, obviously, wrong. Anyway, when you get a chance could you exclude these deals from the query as well?

Thanks,
Kate

HI Kate!

I changed the query for a couple of things.  It was averaging per deal rather than per MW.  The way a transmission schedule was excluded.  

I also excluded 0 price and 0 volume schedules (leet me know if this is correct).

Note:  still testing the code for the on peak and off peak average - so just review the hourly ones.

This is the last thing Susmitha sent me. If you look two e-mails down, you'll see the parameters I sent to her. The spreadsheet is still coming up with some weird numbers - all are much, much lower than actual average prices for these days. Would you mind taking a look at the query to see if all the appropriate deals are being excluded? Also, the spreadsheet doesn't pull in anything for the first half of November (i.e. when I try to download av. prices for 11/1/01, nothing comes up.)

Let me know when you get a chance to look at this. Thanks a lot!

Susmitha -

Bill sent me this spreadsheet to look over, and the prices it pulls look much too low to be an accurate average of our forward purchases and sales. My thought is that certain deals are being pulled into the query that should not be included. The deals in Enpower that need to be excluded from this query are:

1. Transmission
	- All deals under this heading in Enpower must be excluded
2. Forward 
	- All purchases and sales to counterparty ""California Imbalance"" must be excluded
3. Buy-Resale 
	- All deals with counterparty ""EPMI California Pool"" must be excluded

Please let me know if you have any questions about this, or if you'd like me to show you specific deals in Enpower to illustrate this.

Thanks,

Susan,
Thank you. This looks good. To answer some of your questions, price is per mw, not per deal. Transmission deals, EpmiCalPool deals, and sales or purchases from the counterparty California Imbalance in Enpower need to be excluded. 
Thanks,
Bill

Bill,

Here's an outline of what we talked about for the average price spreadsheet:

Pull deals for WHourly at Mid-Columbia, WSCC_N, NP15, SP15, and (Palo Verde +) WSCC_S
In a tabular format display:  Average price from the schedules for buys and sells for each hour in each region (i.e. Mid-Columbia, WSCC_N, etc.)

Underneath the table display:
On Peak average 
Off Peak average

for later:  (i.e. next version)
sort by groups:  24inc, EOL, EPEC

For clarification:
Average price is per MW not per deal?

I've asked Susmitha Nalluri to work on this for you.  She sits 2 desks down from me and works on the VMS team.  She has experience with spreadsheets, however she is not yet familiar with the EnPower view of the database.  I have given her a query to give her a jumpstart on pulling the data data you need from EnPower.  She and I have also met to go over where the data is being pulled from.  In my abscence she can go to Lei, Pete, Matt or David about questions regarding the EnPower Data.  I told her to feel free to ask you or Kate any questions.  I brought her down to meet you and Kate but did not realize you both (as well as most people) had left around lunchtime.

Kate,

I told her you would be bringing her more information on the Dow Jones sheet.  I forwarded Susmitha our earlier emails about it.

Susan -
I just tested the schedule pull again and found one more deal type we need to exclude - ANNUITIES. The download pulls in purchase and sale annuities as regular forward purchases and sales, recognizing the average price as the total annuity price, which is, obviously, wrong. Anyway, when you get a chance could you exclude these deals from the query as well?

Thanks,
Kate

Thanks.  Perfect timing, Kate.  Check the on and off peak.  Working on the archive schedule version - it's far too slow right now.

Susan -

This looks great. Now we've just got to tweak the on-peak and off-peak averages, and I think we'll be set. (Hopefully someone will get to use this someday!)

Thanks for your help,
Kate

HI Kate!

I changed the query for a couple of things.  It was averaging per deal rather than per MW.  The way a transmission schedule was excluded.  

I also excluded 0 price and 0 volume schedules (leet me know if this is correct).

Note:  still testing the code for the on peak and off peak average - so just review the hourly ones.

Susan -

This is the last thing Susmitha sent me. If you look two e-mails down, you'll see the parameters I sent to her. The spreadsheet is still coming up with some weird numbers - all are much, much lower than actual average prices for these days. Would you mind taking a look at the query to see if all the appropriate deals are being excluded? Also, the spreadsheet doesn't pull in anything for the first half of November (i.e. when I try to download av. prices for 11/1/01, nothing comes up.)

Let me know when you get a chance to look at this. Thanks a lot!

Kate

Susmitha -

Bill sent me this spreadsheet to look over, and the prices it pulls look much too low to be an accurate average of our forward purchases and sales. My thought is that certain deals are being pulled into the query that should not be included. The deals in Enpower that need to be excluded from this query are:

1. Transmission
	- All deals under this heading in Enpower must be excluded
2. Forward 
	- All purchases and sales to counterparty ""California Imbalance"" must be excluded
3. Buy-Resale 
	- All deals with counterparty ""EPMI California Pool"" must be excluded

Please let me know if you have any questions about this, or if you'd like me to show you specific deals in Enpower to illustrate this.

Thanks,
Kate Symes

Susan,
Thank you. This looks good. To answer some of your questions, price is per mw, not per deal. Transmission deals, EpmiCalPool deals, and sales or purchases from the counterparty California Imbalance in Enpower need to be excluded. 
Thanks,
Bill

Bill,

Here's an outline of what we talked about for the average price spreadsheet:

Pull deals for WHourly at Mid-Columbia, WSCC_N, NP15, SP15, and (Palo Verde +) WSCC_S
In a tabular format display:  Average price from the schedules for buys and sells for each hour in each region (i.e. Mid-Columbia, WSCC_N, etc.)

Underneath the table display:
On Peak average 
Off Peak average

for later:  (i.e. next version)
sort by groups:  24inc, EOL, EPEC

For clarification:
Average price is per MW not per deal?

I've asked Susmitha Nalluri to work on this for you.  She sits 2 desks down from me and works on the VMS team.  She has experience with spreadsheets, however she is not yet familiar with the EnPower view of the database.  I have given her a query to give her a jumpstart on pulling the data data you need from EnPower.  She and I have also met to go over where the data is being pulled from.  In my abscence she can go to Lei, Pete, Matt or David about questions regarding the EnPower Data.  I told her to feel free to ask you or Kate any questions.  I brought her down to meet you and Kate but did not realize you both (as well as most people) had left around lunchtime.

Kate,

I told her you would be bringing her more information on the Dow Jones sheet.  I forwarded Susmitha our earlier emails about it.

We are currently working on options to have the roles each of the resources you have identified performed by the resources in the Estate.  However, I do not feel that the accounts for the resources should be disabled.  There are possible situations where we will need to call on them for coverage and assistance in this transition.  I have not heard from anyone yet as to the expected transition time frame.  We are trying to get all issues resolved as quickly as possible.

Please respond is anyone has a different view.

Dave,

We are currently working on options to have the roles each of the resources you have identified performed by the resources in the Estate.  However, I do not feel that the accounts for the resources should be disabled.  There are possible situations where we will need to call on them for coverage and assistance in this transition.  I have not heard from anyone yet as to the expected transition time frame.  We are trying to get all issues resolved as quickly as possible.

Please respond is anyone has a different view.

Thanks - MO

All,


Legal has said that all EST accounts will be disabled this Sunday (sometime before Day 1). If any users require their EST account on Monday or beyond, they need to they would need to be cut off except for very critical cases. You likely have some of those cases. 

Here's what is needed required by each user requesting this:

1.	Send an email to Roberto DeLeon requesting an ""EST_"" account extension

2.	Please copy your local IT Support on the email (i.e. DL-IT Calgary or DL-Portland IT)

3.	In the email please state:
	Business reason for needing access
	Length of time needed.

Roberto, please advise if any points have been missed.


Thanks,

Dan

Take the Money and Run

Peak power prices for Wednesday delivery were mostly steady across the West
on Tuesday, largely due to a stagnant spot gas market and near-normal
temperatures.  ""Prices were trading in very narrow ranges at most of the
hubs today, and that made for a lackluster session,"" complained one
marketer.  NYMEX Henry Hub contracts for the front months closed lower on
Tuesday despite cold Northeast temperatures, likely due to more moderate
forecasts for next week, and on some technical selling.  March slipped 4.3
cents to close at 2.074$/mmBtu, while April shed 3.2 cents to end at
2.152$/mmBtu.  Most 2003 and 2004 contracts finished up slightly.  The EIA
recently said that it expects U.S. natural gas inventories to end the first
quarter at a record 1.46 tcf.  The low point for U.S. gas stocks at the end
of the winter heating season has averaged about 920 bcf over the past eight
years.  Weekly draws of 144 bcf would be needed over the nine remaining
weeks of withdrawl season to lower inventories to a more normal 1.0 tcf.
Not a likely scenario since draws for the nine-week period have averaged 63
bcf over the past five years.  In other industry news, lawyers for Ken Lay
have refused to accept a subpoena from a congressional committee requiring
his appearance at public hearings.  Mr. Lay's lawyers said they did not know
their client's whereabouts and could not accept any subpoenas on his behalf.
Peggy Peterson, a spokesperson for the House financial services committee
said, ""He [Lay's lawyer] tells us he does not know of Lay's whereabouts,
which we find quite puzzling to say the least.  Even if Lay is forced to
appear by a subpoena, many parties believe he would likely plead the Fifth
and not testify.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest were steady to slightly higher than
levels reported a day ago.  Amid continuing cold overnight temperatures,
light load goods traded slightly higher, and in a narrower range.  Flow
forecasts for Chief Joseph were little changed, coming in at 110 kcfs
Wednesday and Thursday, 105 kcfs Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday,
115 kcfs Monday, and 110 kcfs next Tuesday.  No news was good news on the
unit front Tuesday, with no new significant outages reported.  According to
Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the region was forecast to average
115 percent of normal through February 12, with the greatest demand expected
during the latter part of that period.

With little news, close-to-normal temperatures, and steady spot gas prices
at the SoCal border, day-ahead electricity prices edged up slightly in the
Golden State on Tuesday.  Heavy load transactions at NP15 went through from
24.25 up to 26.25$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done in the 24.25 to
24.75$/MWh range and the high end reached late.  Light load goods maintained
their recent strength, trading from 20.25 to 21.5$/MWh.  NP15
balance-of-February saw action around 22.75 to 23.25$/MWh.  ""I think some
traders had the March jitters, light and heavy firmed up some there today,""
commented one California player.  SP15 off-peak saw the most strength on
Tuesday, with deals going through as high as 22.95$/MWh for Wednesday
delivery.  There was little change in the generation landscape on Tuesday.
Pittsburg #7 (682 MW) returned to service from a maintenance outage that
began February 2.  Alamitos #3 (320 MW) ramped up to 240 MW, on its way back
from an outage that began January 26.  Forecasts for Wednesday called for
highs at southern load centers to reach the mid-60s, down slightly from
Tuesday's levels, with overnight lows in the upper-40s.  The state capital
anticipated a high of 58 degrees and a low of 36 degrees.  The most current
six-to-ten from the NWS predicted normal temperatures from February 11 to
15.

In the Southwest, peak power prices for Tuesday delivery were flat to
slightly lower to a day ago as weather conditions in cities such as Phoenix
were described as ""beautiful, sunny, and in the 70s.""  Heavy load energy at
Palo Verde ranged from 22.5 to 23.5$/MWh, with unconfirmed trades heard as
high as 24$/MW.  Mead commanded a premium to PV, but most of that energy was
reportedly bound for the Golden State.  In unit news, Coronado #1 (395 MW)
returned to full power Tuesday, following tube leak repairs that began back
on January 25.  Meanwhile, Coronado #2 (385 MW) slipped into a planned
maintenance outage slated to last until February 10.  Weather Derivatives
forecast heating demand in the desert region to average a mere 85 percent of
normal through February 10, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was
calling for mostly normal temperatures from February 11 through 15.

___________________________________________________________
Amid cold temperature forecasts, particularly in SERC, peak power prices
rose across the Eastern Interconnect on Tuesday.  ""It was good to see some
strength in the dailies, however short-lived it may be,"" said one Cinergy
player.  Firmer prices were seen in Balance-of-February and the March/April
contracts as well, despite another lackluster day in gas.  NYMEX Henry Hub
futures edged down again on Tuesday.  March fell 4.3 cents to close at
2.074$/mmBtu, while April lost 3.2 cents to end at 2.152$/mmBtu.

Amid much higher real-time prices, peak electricity prices edged up just
slightly in the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday.  Western PJM goods for Wednesday
delivery were bought and sold between 24.75 and 25.75$/MWh.  Traders mostly
expected prices to drop off with warmer forecasts for the end of the week.
LMPs reached a lofty high of 115$/MWh early Tuesday morning, but averaged
35.09$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  High temperatures were expected to warm into
the mid-40s on Wednesday and continue there through Saturday.  The latest
six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from February 11 to 15.

With unit outages and winter weather, heavy load energy costs made robust
gains in the Midwest on Tuesday, to the delight of sellers.  ""People have
really found their faith today.  Balance-of-Feb was up over a buck and
March/April surged a bit as well,"" crowed one trader.  Into Cinergy edged up
all day, trading between 22.75 and 26$/MWh, while Balance was heard from
21.1 to 21.35$/MWh and March/April saw action up to 21.25$/MWh.  Power
sellers were concerned with the higher transmission rates they were seeing
from the newly operating MidwestISO on Tuesday.  ""I'm seeing a base rate of
4$/MWh, and if you add in ancillary costs of 50 cents and recovery of old
costs at 2.5$/MWh, transmission is costing nearly 7$/MWh, compared to about
4$/MWh before.  That's going to hamper movement in and out of Cinergy, and
increase volatility in the market,"" predicted one in-the-know seller.  In
unit news, sources said Beaver Valley #2 (833 MW) has been off-line since
February 4.  Traders also said Cook #2 could be back as early as February
16, while the Rockport unit (1,300 MW) was expected to remain down into
mid-March.  High temperatures were predicted to warm slightly into the
upper-30s for Wednesday, and the most current six-to-ten continued to
forecast above-normal temperatures from February 11 to 15.

Bullish weather conditions sent day-ahead electricity prices higher in the
Southeast and Texas on Tuesday.  ""I saw some buyers today that have been out
of the market for a while,"" commented one SERC player.  Into TVA on-peak
pieces traded from 23 to 25$/MWh, with off-peak pieces equally strong from
16 to 19$/MWh.  Unlike northern hubs, Entergy dealers reported a weaker
balance-of-the-month market on Tuesday.  Wednesday forecasts called for well
below-normal temperatures across SERC and Texas, with highs mostly in the
mid-30s to mid-40s.  The mercury was expected to climb into normal territory
by Saturday and the up-to-date six-to-ten predicted above-normal
temperatures from February 11 to 15.

Bill,

Everything went smooth last night and this morning with El Paso and the ramps.  Due to the migration I am unable to send the EPE model to Kathy (file for Feb. did not pull into the M: drive).   I was also unable to get into CAPS (Trading cluster is not reconfigured).  I saved the model through my shift and now that I have logged off I am unable to log back on under my name.  I updated Geir's login last night (upon his request) and have limited access through his login.  Holden is aware of these problems.

Subject: Re: Shower tile

Hi Bill,
First let me explain that the sealer that was applied to your grout
simply
provides stain resistance.  That's it.  It does nothing to the strength
of
the grout and does not in any way prevent cracks in the grout.  The
cracks
are probably caused by settling.  If the cracks are in the wall seams
(where
the walls meet each other) this joint should be caulked with an
appropriate
caulking.  If your shower grout is a non-sanded type, a non sanded
silicone
should be used.  If your grout is a sanded type, a sanded siliconized
acrylic caulking that matches your grout color should be used.
Resealing
the shower grout can be done according to the directions of the sealer
manufacturer.  Some silicone based sealer will last 3 to 6 months in a
shower environment.  Expensive solvent based sealers may last up to 10
years.
If the cracks are between the tiles in the walls and not just in the
wall
seams then the grout should be repaired.  Don't caulk these joints or
any
joints on or near the floor.  If these areas stay damp, mildew will
usually
be a problem without good ventilation.  It would be difficult for me to
describe how to do the repair without actually seeing it (digital
camera?)
so I'll suggest you take a class at The Home Depot on how to grout tile.
Hope that helps Bill.

Ken Sherman

Subject: Shower Tile


I have had my shower tiled recently.  The grout was sealed (in place for
about 4 months now. I have noted a few minor hair line cracks in the
corners
of my shower in between a few of the tiles.  My question is how do I 1.)
repair the cracks, 2.) when should I reseal (how often).

Thanks for your help.  Please respond to bwilliamsjr4@attbi.com

I appreciate your web site.

Sincerely

Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Ken's Not Coming

Peak power prices for Tuesday delivery were slightly lower across the
Western U.S. on Monday, unquestionably the result of less weather-related
demand.  ""Temperatures are forecast to be normal to slightly above-normal
through the week in most regions, so we're feeling pretty bearish right
 now,"" commented one marketer.  A late-session rally for off peak power was
reported at the Mid-Columbia, but most players believed that one or two
parties must have been caught a little bit short given the mild weather and
abundant supplies.  Heating demand in the WSCC was only expected to average
94 percent of normal through February 11, and the latest six-to-ten-day
forecast was calling for mostly normal temperatures from February 10 through
14.  In other industry news, former Enron CEO Ken Lay told Congress on
Sunday that he would refuse to testify before two committees preparing to
hear his testimony.  As a result, the Senate Commerce Committee cancelled
Monday's hearing at which Mr. Lay was to have been the sole witness.  The
Senate Commerce Committee said it would meet Tuesday morning to subpoena Mr.
Lay.  Senator Byron Dorgan, the North Dakota Democrat who heads the
committee's consumer affairs subcommittee, said, ""We decided that we really
had no choice but to issue a subpoena to require his attendance.""  Mr.
Dorgan said he had been assured by some Republicans on the Commerce
Committee that they would vote in favor of a subpoena.

Tuesday's heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell slightly from levels
seen for Monday as regional temperatures had begun to moderate.  A late-day
rally occurred in the light load arena when some shorts reportedly entered
the market.  ""There wasn't a whole lot of activity for the off peak when the
session began, but later on it just shot up,"" said one Oregon-based utility
trader.  Heating demand in the region was forecast to pick up over the
coming weekend, rising to an average of 121 percent of normal next Sunday
and Monday.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised upward on Monday,
coming in at 110 kcfs through Thursday, 105 kcfs Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday,
60 kcfs Sunday, and 115 kcfs next Monday.  There were a few goings on in the
generation landscape Monday.  Bridger #1 (520 MW) was back in service, but
Bridger #3 and #4 (520 MW each) were brought down so engineers could perform
some ""boiler unplugging.""  The Wyoming-based units were both expected to
return to service sometime on Thursday.

Amid stagnant gas values and slightly below-normal temperatures, power
prices settled lower in the Golden State on Monday.  ""I think prices will
trend down this week, with the warmer weather,"" commented one California
player.  Heavy load goods at NP15 changed hands between 24 and 24.75$/MWh,
with unconfirmed trades heard as high as 26$/MWh.  Light load pieces were
bought and sold from 19.75 to 21$/MWh.  NP15 Balance-of-February was heard
near 23.25$/MWh.  Of hydroelectric interest, the California DWR listed
snow-water equivalents in the northern section of the state at 111% of
normal.  Spot gas values at the Socal border remained flat to Friday levels,
between 2.13 and 2.18/$mmBtu.  In unit news, gas-fired Alamitos #4 (480 MW)
returned to the grid on Monday, and Pittsburg #7 (682 MW) went down for
planned maintenance on Saturday.  On the weather front, Tuesday forecasts
called for highs to reach 70 degrees in L.A. and 58 to 61 degrees at
mid-state load centers.  Overnight lows were anticipated in the mid-30s to
mid-40s.  The five-day outlook predicted little change through Friday.  The
most current six-to-ten predicted normal temperatures from February 10 to
14.

With Phoenix forecast to see daytime highs in the 70s and overnight lows in
the 50s through the week, day-ahead electricity prices headed lower in the
Southwest on Monday.  Peak power at Palo Verde ranged from 23 to 24.25$/MWh
an average decline of 1$/MWh from levels reported for Monday.  Mead
commanded a premium to PV, with several players stating that the
higher-priced electricity was bound for the California market.  In unit
news, Coronado #1 (395 MW) was operating at 260 megawatts on Monday, but was
still having trouble ramping all the way to full power.  Meanwhile, Coronado
#2 (385 MW) was scheduled to come down early Tuesday for some planned
maintenance slated to last until February 10.  The latest six-to-ten from
the NWS was calling for above-normal temperatures in eastern New Mexico and
normal temperatures everywhere else from February 10 through 14.

As the expected colder temperatures materialized across the Eastern
Interconnect, peak power prices appreciated on Monday.  With the exception
of Texas, which tanked on low gas values, heavy load goods changed hands
firmly in the 20s everywhere.  Maintenance outages also contributed to the
bullish tenor of the day.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures slipped on
Monday, with March falling 2.1 cents to close at 2.117$/mmBtu.  April also
edged down a comparatively mild 1.4 cents to end at 2.184$/mmBtu.

Amid much stronger load forecasts and colder temperatures expected for
Tuesday, heavy load energy costs rose in the Mid-Atlantic on Monday.
Western PJM pieces were bought and sold in a narrow range from 24.9 to
25.3$/MWh.  LMPs bounced up and down three times in the late morning and
early afternoon on Monday, and averaged 22.38$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  On
the generation front, sources gave Keystone #2 (850 MW) a revised expected
off-line date of February 8.  The unit was reportedly slated to undergo 20
days of maintenance.  High temperatures were expected in the upper-30s on
Tuesday, and predicted in the low-40s by the end of the workweek.  The most
current six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from February 10 to
14.

Traders in the Midwest characterized the dailies as a ""wild ride"" on Monday,
with heavy load electricity prices strengthening considerably on the
aggregate.  ""Cinergy opened near 20, climbed to 22.5, came off, and leapt up
all the way to 24$/MWh at the end,"" said one Cinergy commentator on the day
after the Super Bowl.  While the dailies changed hands from 20 to 24$/MWh on
Monday, market players said the bulk of deals were seen around 21.5$/MWh.
Balance-of-February trades were heard between 20.25 and 20.5$/MWh.  In unit
news, Quad Cities #2 (789 MW) was off the grid for refueling and pump
repairs on Monday, with a tentative ETR of March 11.  Sister unit #1 (821
MW) was in start-up.  Fellow nuke LaSalle (1,144 MW) was also in start-up at
25% late Monday, and expected at full by mid-week.   Temperatures were
slightly colder than anticipated by Friday forecasts, with highs across ECAR
in the mid-30s and lows in the low-20s.  The outlook called for slight
warming, into the low-40s by Thursday, and the latest six-to-ten called for
above-normal temperatures from February 10 to 14.

The Southeast saw some strength on Monday as daily power prices responded to
the colder forecasts.  Into TVA day-ahead peak power prices were heard from
21 to 24$/MWh, with the low end reached late and the bulk of deals done in
the 22 to 22.25$/MWh range, according to traders.  Balance contracts into
TVA were heard trading between 20 and 20.15$/MWh.  Texas electricity prices
weakened on gas, with transactions heard between 18.5 and 19.35$/MWh.  ERCOT
balance-of-the-month saw action mostly from 18 to 18.6$/MWh.  Tuesday
forecasts called for temperatures well below normal across both regions,
with highs expected in the mid-40s.  SERC lows were forecast to drop into
the low-20s.  The most up-to-date six-to-ten predicted above-normal
temperatures from February 10 to 14.

MARKET NOTICE
February 4, 2002

The California Independent System Operator (ISO) is announcing the
Aggregated Distributed Generation Pilot Project (ADGPP).  The participation
of Generating Units in the ISO's markets is currently limited to units with
a rated capacity of 1 MW or greater.  The ADGPP is intended to demonstrate
the feasibility of allowing physically separated small units (less than 1
MW) to be aggregated as a means of reducing barriers to entry into the ISO
markets.  ADGPP is currently intended to operate as follows: 

*	Generation units with a rated capacity of less than 1 MW may
participate
*	Generators will be aggregated through an Aggregated Distributed Unit
(ADU), which will have an aggregated or total rated capacity greater than or
equal to 1 MW but no more than 10 MW
*	The total capacity for all units participating in this Pilot Project
is limited to 50 MWs
*	ADUs must contain generators that are in the same Demand Zone which
are not on opposite sides of constrained transmission elements
*	Each ADU must be scheduled in the ISO Energy or Supplemental Energy
Market
*	Near real-time operational data will be required from ADU
*	Prospective participants can propose unique methods and processes
for delivering the near real time operational data
*	Generators will be considered SC Metered Entities, therefore they
must have Local Regulatory Authority approved interval metering
*	Settlement will occur through submitting aggregated Settlement
Quality Meter Data (SQMD) by the SC representing the ADU

As noted above, units participating in the ADGPP will be allowed to
participate in the ISO Energy and Supplemental Energy Markets only and will
not be allowed to participate in the ISO's Ancillary Services markets.  The
increased participation in the ISO Energy and Supplemental Energy markets
will provide greater market depth and will increase competition by expanding
the pool of generation available within the ISO Control Area.  The ADGPP is
intended only to accommodate units less than 1 MW and is not intended to
facilitate ""portfolio bidding"" from Generating Units 1 MW or larger.

The ADGPP is also intended to improve the ISO's visibility of generating
resources within the ISO Control Area by demonstrating the functionality of
various basic-level operational data reporting processes which may be
proposed by the prospective participants.  These operational data reporting
processes should demonstrate the capability of delivering operational data
for the ADU to the ISO near real time and be economical from the small
Generator perspective.  The uniqueness of the operational data reporting
processes proposed will be one factor in selection of participants in the
program.  Thus, the project will also ensure that the participation of these
resources in the ISO's markets will occur without compromising system
reliability.

The ISO will be hosting a Workshop on Friday, March 8th to discuss the Pilot
Project details.  Please contact Sue Happ (916) 608-7059 for reservations.
Participation in the workshop will only be allowed if reservations are made
in advance. 

Workshop Objectives:  

Members of the ISO staff from Metering, EMS, IT Security, Operations and
Market Services will be available to provide a general description of the
Pilot Program and to answer any questions from prospective participants.  An
agenda and directions to the workshop will be provided on March 1st.   

Workshop Target Audience:  

Aggregators, Scheduling Coordinators and Prospective Generators.  

The ISO will allocate two hours on the agenda to interested Aggregators or
Scheduling Coordinators.  If you are interested in providing a presentation,
please Contact Ali Miremadi at (916) 608-7061 by February 22nd
.

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

Attached for your review are the finalized versions of the ISO Statement
Files Specification (v14.0), ISO Charge Matrix (v14.0 ) and overview
documents describing the key changes.  Draft versions of the same documents
were distributed in January for your review and comments.  Version 14.0 is
created due to changes in two settlement areas:
*	The existing Market Operations Charge (CT 523) will be replaced by
the new Ancillary Services and Real Time Energy Operations Charge (CT 524).
*	To facilitate automatic processing of Manual Line Item entries by
the SCs, ISO will impose more rigorous validations upon these entries when
they are created in the ISO Settlement System.

The above changes are scheduled to take effect on trade date 1/1/2002.  The
additional changes in the finalized versions are mostly minor corrections
and clarifications.

ISO has also added two new Manual Charge Types (CTs 691 and 692) in the
Charge Matrix:
CT 691 - Emissions Cost Payment; and
CT 692 - Start-Up Cost Payment.

These Charge Types were created as a result of the FERC's Order (dated
6/19/01) to reimburse generators for their Emissions and Start-Up related
costs incurred as a result of ISO dispatch.
 
Please send your questions and comments to Mr. C. P. Ng via email
(cng@caiso.com).  Thank you.

Task Force Taken to Task

Western heavy load energy costs for Monday delivery were mostly steady from
levels reported for the Friday/Saturday package as weather forecasts called
for warmer weather in the new week and spot gas prices remained relatively
stable.  Meanwhile, off-peak prices were largely stronger due to the
inclusion of the all-day Sunday piece.  According to Weather Derivatives,
heating demand in the WSCC was expected drift lower through the new week,
averaging only 96 percent of normal through February 8.  Additionally, the
latest six-to-ten from the NWS was predicting mostly normal temperatures
across the Western U.S. from February 7 through 11.  In other industry news,
a federal judge has ordered Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force
to explain the constitutional arguments behind its refusal to release
details of its meetings last year, which included executives from Enron
Corp. and other large energy firms.  The Bush administration has so far
refused to release details such as the names of people it consulted and the
subjects discussed in drafting George W's energy policy.

Peak power in the Pacific Northwest was little changed for Monday delivery
as forecasted normal temperatures continued to whittle away at heating
demand, though regional demand was expected to remain slightly above normal
through the new week.  While flow forecasts for the Columbia River were
downgraded slightly on Friday, they appeared to be more than ample enough to
satiate regional demand.  Flows at Chief Joseph were forecast to be 75 kcfs
Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 105 kcfs Monday, and 100 kcfs Tuesday through
Friday.  In unit news, Bridger #4 (520 MW) returned to the grid following
repairs to a plugged boiler that began on Wednesday, but Bridger #1 (520 MW)
slipped into the off-line category for tube leak repairs that were expected
to end on Sunday.  The return date for Colstrip #3 (700 MW) was reportedly
pushed back until February 10.  Utah-based Hunter #1 (446 MW) was scheduled
to come down for 24 hours of repairs beginning around midnight on Friday.
On a side note, BPA said Friday that it expects electricity customer McCook
metals to restart partial production at its idled Longview, Washington
aluminum smelter after a new ""take-or-pay"" contract kicks in on April 1.
Several regional smelters agreed to halt all aluminum production back in
March 2001 due to the electricity supply crunch in the Pacific Northwest.
Several analysts, however, were skeptical as to whether any smelters in the
region would be restarted this year.

With little change in the generation landscape, flat spot gas prices at the
SoCal border, and normal temperature forecasts for the new week, electricity
prices remained steady in the Golden State on Friday.  Light load prices
appreciated again on Friday, boosted by the all-day Sunday inclusion and
recent trends.  Heavy load pieces at NP15 traded between 24 and 27$/MWh, and
light load deals were done from 21.5 to 23.75$/MWh, picking up by more than
buck on both ends.  In political news, PG&E released the asset and debt
breakdown for its proposed spin-off companies.  In their plan, a generating
company would have $5.3 billion in assets and assume $2.4 billion in debt.
An electric transmission company would be valued at $1.6 billion and take on
$1.1 billion in debt.  Lastly, a gas transmission company would have assets
of $1.4 billion and assume $900 million in debt.  However, U.S. bankruptcy
judge Montali has not yet ruled on PG&E's reorganization plan, and for
fracturing of the utility to move forward, the SEC's approval would also be
required.  In unit news, hydro Big Creek Project PSP (1,020 MW) was only
down 150 MW, while gas-burner Alamitos #5 (480 MW) came off the grid for
planned maintenance.  California weather forecasts called for gradual
warming over the weekend, leading temperatures into just below-normal
territory for the early part of the new week.  Highs for Monday and Tuesday
were expected near 70 degrees in Los Angeles, while northern load centers
anticipated highs near 58 degrees.  The most current six-to-ten called for
normal temperatures from February 7 to 11.

Peak power prices in the Southwest were largely steady for Monday delivery,
but some late-day selling caused prices to end near session lows.  Heavy
load energy costs at Palo Verde ranged from 23.75 to 25.5$/MWh, with
unconfirmed deals as low as 22$/MWh reported about an hour after the normal
trading session had ended.  ""It's still supposed to be cold to start the new
week, but the worst of it is certainly over, or so our in-house forecasters
say,"" said one Phoenix-based trader.  Some traders believed unit outages
could keep supplies a bit tight to start the new week, but that forecasted
warming would keep most strength at bay.  Coronado #1 (395 MW) had its
return date pushed back once again.  The Arizona-based unit was now sporting
an ETR of 06:30 MST on Saturday, but parties with a share in the unit said
they had not scheduled with it in place.  Meanwhile, Navajo #2 (750 MW) was
set to enter a planned maintenance outage on February 2, with an official
ETR of February 25.

___________________________________________________________
With the return of winter weather and a rash of unit outages, peak power
prices strengthened across the Eastern Interconnect on Friday.  To the
relief of sellers, forecasts called for a dip in temperatures by Saturday.
""Get out and enjoy it, because tomorrow winter is back,"" recommended one
Philadelphia-based energy dealer.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures were
steady on Friday.  March was unmoved, closing at 2.138$/mmBtu, while April
rose less than a cent to end at 2.198$/mmBtu.

Heavy load electricity prices climbed back into the mid-20s in the
Mid-Atlantic on Friday, on expectations of stronger loads in the new week
and the possibility of a weekend outage.  Western PJM goods for Monday
delivery changed hands between 24.25 and 24.9$/MWh, gaining a robust 3$/MWh
at both ends of the spectrum.  LMPs appreciated on Friday after spending
most of the business day near 30$/MWh, but only averaged 24.47$/MWh.
According to sources, troubled coal-burner Keystone #2 (850 MW) was expected
off-line over the weekend for maintenance.  The unit was down earlier in the
week for unplanned repairs.  Temperatures in the comfortable 60s were
expected to disappear over the weekend.  Monday forecasts called for normal
conditions across PJM, with highs in the low-40s and lows in the low-30s.
The most current six-to-ten predicted above-normal temperatures from
February 7 to 11.

Expectations of early spring maintenance outages and colder weather
forecasts affected the grid on Friday, bolstering the dailies in ECAR.  Into
Cinergy deals were heard between 18 and 20.5$/MWh, firming up 65 cents to a
day ago.  In unit news, Missouri nuke Callaway (1,125 MW) was off-line on
Friday.  Quad Cities #2 (789 MW) was at 95%, powering down for a maintenance
outage expected to last through the end of February.  Sister unit #1 (821
MW) was still off-line early Friday, but expected to return over the
weekend.  Traders continued to keep their ear to the ground, hoping for
information on other upcoming maintenance outages.  Temperatures for the new
week were expected to drop back into the mid-30s across most of ECAR, with
overnight lows in the frosty low-20s.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS
called for above-normal temperatures from February 7 to 11.

With forecasts finally calling for cold temperatures and a stronger gas
market, peak power prices appreciated in the Southeast on Friday, while
Texas lost ground on little news.  Into Entergy day-ahead pieces were bought
and sold between 19 and 20.5$/MWh, while balance of February traded at a
slight discount around 18.9 to 19.1$/MWh.  ERCOT deals were mostly heard
between 19 and 19.75$/MWh on Friday.  SERC weather was expected to turn cold
with the new week, with overnight lows expected below freezing through
Tuesday.  Texas temperatures were expected to linger in the near-normal
doldrums.  The most current six-to-ten called for above-normal conditions in
Texas and northern SERC and normal temperatures in southern and coastal SERC
from February 7 to 11.

Bill:

For yet another day we seem to be having problems including all the schedules in our EPE schedule sheet.  Tag 52159 was not included (25mw schedule to LADWP).  I think part of the problem is some counterparties are not including EPMIWE as a PSE.  Fortunately, the dispatchers had the schedule and informed me of the problem.  I then called LADWP and WESCO to checkout with them.  If this did not happen we wouldn't have known what the deal was.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Bert"

Dear Green Roomers,

Registration for the spring season, which starts in April, is just around the corner, and we need to submit money to GPSD.  The cost of the ten-game is $50 per player.  Some of you have already paid $25 or so to Jon for the winter season, which unfortunately did not come to pass.  If I'm not mistaken, the following people have already paid: Jon Gail, Jon Bloomfield, Bill Williams, Jay Flint, Jake Fox, Rick Rezinas, Scott Gates, Scott H (the keeper) , Tristan Brunin, Frank Ma, and Declan.  These people need to pay and additional $25.  $50 for everyone else.

Please give me an email in the next week or two if you plan on playing, and send checks or money to the address below.

Additionally, you are encouraged to recruit solid skill players for the team.  Especially at the beginning of the season, more players is better, and fresh blood is always a way to build the team.

See you all soon,
Adam Van Loon

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop (stand alone computer).

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond"

SW Left Out in the Cold

Peak power prices in the Western U.S. rose for the typically-discounted
Friday/Saturday package on continued strong weather-related demand and
new-month buying.  While temperatures in the Northwest have already begun to
ease, the Southwest was forecast to remain firmly entrenched in heating
demand country through Sunday.  Slightly stronger spot gas prices may also
have lent support to the dailies.  Balance-of-February contracts were still
trading below the dailies, but most players believed spot electricity prices
would fall to meet the balance next week as warmer weather prevails.  In
other industry news, the General Accounting Office (GAO) said Thursday that
it would sue the White House to try to force Vice President Cheney to
release documents detailing contacts between corporate executives and the
administration's energy task force of which Cheney was the chairman.  David
M. Walker, the comptroller general of the United States and director of the
accounting office, said he intended to ask a federal judge to order Mr.
Cheney to give Congress the identities of energy industry executives who
helped the Bush administration formulate a national energy policy last year,
detailing the subject that each executive discussed with task force members.

The average price paid for day-ahead heavy load energy in the Northwest rose
marginally Thursday on the last remnants of the region's most recent cold
snap, as well as increased demand from the south.  Temperatures had begun to
abate on Thursday, and the region's major load centers were forecast to
return to normal territory by Saturday.  The much-anticipated release of the
February Early Bird Water Supply Forecast from the Northwest River Forecast
Center showed that supplies in the region had risen from the previous report
issued on January 9, but remained mostly below normal on the Columbia and
Snake Rivers.  April through September supply forecasts at The Dalles rose
from 93 to 97 percent, while Grand Coulee gained one percent to 95 percent
for the same period.  ""The report may show that water supplies are still
below normal, but there's still plenty of time to beef up these numbers, and
we're already leaps and bounds ahead of where we were at this time last
year,"" said one Northwest trader.  In unit news, a quasi-official ETR for
Colstrip #3 (700 MW) emerged on Friday, calling for the unit to be back up
between February 5 and 7.  Since we are talking about a Colstrip unit here,
we have opted to err on the side of caution and go with the 7th.

Despite the expectation of gradually easing temperatures over the weekend,
day-ahead power prices firmed up for the Friday/Saturday package in the
Golden State.  ""Gas came up a little and new month jitters had everyone on
edge,"" joked one California trader about the day's action.  SP15 saw the
most strength, with heavy load deals heard between 24 and 27.45$/MWh.
Similarly, NP15 peak goods changed hands from 24 to 27$/MWh, with the bulk
of transactions in the 25 to 26$/MWh range.  Traders said BOM was, not
unexpectedly, still trading at a discount to the dailies.  In political
news, Governor Davis formally requested a FERC investigation into alleged
price manipulation by Enron last summer.  Specifically, the Governor accused
Enron of pushing prices up on long-term contracts.  The CPUC reached an
agreement with the DWR, which would allow the department to issue bonds to
repay the California general fund for power purchases it has made.  To date
the DWR has bought $10 billion worth of electricity, and expects that total
to reach $18 billion by the end of the year.   On the generation front,
Alamitos #4 (320 MW) joined off-line sister units #3 and #6 off-line on
Thursday.  Smaller units Huntington Beach #3 (225 MW) and Southbay #4 (222
MW) also exited the grid for unplanned and planned maintenance,
respectively.  Friday and Saturday forecasts called for highs to linger in
the low-50s mid-state and the low-60s in the south, with overnight lows
expected to be in the chilly 34 to 41 degree range.  Predictions for the new
week called for near-normal conditions, and the latest six-to-ten called for
normal temperatures from February 6 to 10.

As Phoenix residents continued to bask in overnight temperatures in the
mid-30s, peak power prices continued to rise for the Friday/Saturday combo.
Temperatures were forecast to start warming up beginning on Sunday,
prompting traders to expect falling loads and prices next week.  Peak power
at Palo Verde ranged from 23.5 to 26.5$/MWh, with the bulk of deals going
through at the 25$/MWh mark.  Light load goods at the Southwest hub gained
as much as 2.5$/MWh with confirmed transactions anywhere between 16.75 and
19.5$/MWh.  In unit news, Coronado #1 (395 MW) was still having trouble
returning from a January 25 tube leak outage, but sources familiar with the
Arizona-based unit were confident that it would begin to ramp up at 06:00
MST on Friday (though they weren't willing to put money on it).  The latest
six-to-ten from the NWS continued to call for normal temperatures to blanket
the desert region from February 6 through 10.

With the return of ice storms in the Midwest and generally winter-like
conditions to the entire East, peak power prices strengthened on Thursday.
""Prices would have risen even more today, but recent bearish trends have
prompted a wait-and-see attitude among traders,"" commented one Cinergy
dealer.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures rose on Thursday.  March gained
5.8 cents to close at 2.138$/mmBtu, while April climbed 4.3 cents to end at
2.19$/mmBtu.

Expectations of colder weather in the Mid-Atlantic sent day-ahead
electricity prices higher on Thursday.  Western PJM goods changed hands
between 21.7 and 22$/MWh, while early deals for Monday delivery were heard
at 24.25$/MWh.  Traders said fewer Cinergy imports and more New York exports
were the real movers on Thursday.  Forecasts called for little change on
Friday, but substantial cooling over the weekend and into the new week.  The
most current six-to-ten from the NWS called for above-normal temperatures
for most of PJM and normal conditions along coast from February 6 to 10.

Amid cold weather and winter storms, heavy load energy costs jumped up in
the Midwest on Thursday.  Into Cinergy pieces for Friday were bought and
sold between 17.5 and 19.85$/MWh.  ""We only saw two trades below 19$/MWh
today, and most of our volume went through very close to the high end,""
commented one market player, an explanation echoed by most Cinergy traders
on Thursday.  Talk also centered on the new MidwestISO that will take over
transmission responsibilities on Friday.  Pointing to studies by the Edison
Institute and others, most traders thought any changes to the market would
happen gradually, and didn't expect any immediate affects on prices.  ""The
new rules will focus on generators for now,"" said one calm ECAR scheduler.
Next week deals also rose on Thursday, and were heard mostly between 20.15
and 20.35$/MWh.  ""The near term was modestly stronger today,"" summed up one
trader.  In unit news, Rockport (1,300 MW) was reportedly off-line for early
spring maintenance.  Also of note, ECAR load estimates were up from
approximately 31,000 for Friday to 34,000 for Monday.  Colder conditions
finally rolled into ECAR, with forecasts for Friday calling for temperatures
in the low-30s to mid-40s across most of the region.  The mercury was
expected to dip more in the new week, and the latest six-to-ten predicted
mostly above-normal temperatures from February 6 to 10.

Anticipation of a break in the bearish warm weather and rumors of units
coming off for early spring maintenance lent support to SERC and ERCOT spot
prices.  Into Entergy deals were heard between 17.6 and 20.25$/MWh, with
prices Into TVA and ERCOT also breaking into the 20s.  Strength in the
natural gas markets also cheered traders on Thursday.  Texas temperatures
took a dive on Thursday, with the cold front expected to spread into SERC
over the weekend.  The updated six-to-ten called for mostly normal
temperatures across SERC and Texas from February 6 to 10.

Just so there's no confusion: I, too, have accepted a position with UBS War=

While there are a few people who are still making up their minds, the rest =
of the people in our office will be working for the Enron estate.  It is no=
t entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power lo=
oks like for the Enron estate now.  As I understand it, there are two prima=
ry initiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.=
  The first is the disposition of our development projects that are already=
 well under way.  Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effor=
t together with the Portland asset development team.  This effort has been =
ongoing since December.  The second is the disposition of our west power co=
mmodity positions.  Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.=
  People working on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Ric=
hter, Ed Baughman among others.  I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul to=
 get advice on how people in Portland should proceed.  I would recommend ta=
lking to Ed, Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction.  I have placed a call to =
several of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response.  I =
am hopeful that they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinate=
 the power procurement and delivery efforts.

As most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron =
has already begun.  People who will continue to work for Enron will be loca=
ted on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor.  We hop=
e to make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week.  Moves within=
 the 3rd Floor will take place the following week.

The UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hur=
dle.  While I don't have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be on=
 or about February 6th.

Finally, I want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperation=
 over the last few weeks.  These have been really horrible times as the Enr=
on story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are f=
inding out about their future with Enron and UBS.  I know that this hasn't =
been easy for anyone.  I am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the a=
wesome team that we have put together.  Whether you are going to UBS, remai=
ning with Enron, or leaving the company, I wish everyone who worked on this=
 team the best in their future endeavors.  It has been a distinct honor to =
work with each and every one of you.

While there are a few people who are still making up their minds, the rest =
of the people in our office will be working for the Enron estate.  It is no=
t entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power lo=
oks like for the Enron estate now.  As I understand it, there are two prima=
ry initiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.=
  The first is the disposition of our development projects that are already=
 well under way.  Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effor=
t together with the Portland asset development team.  This effort has been =
ongoing since December.  The second is the disposition of our west power co=
mmodity positions.  Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.=
  People working on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Ric=
hter, Ed Baughman among others.  I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul to=
 get advice on how people in Portland should proceed.  I would recommend ta=
lking to Ed, Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction.  I have placed a call to =
several of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response.  I =
am hopeful that they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinate=
 the power procurement and delivery efforts.

As most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron =
has already begun.  People who will continue to work for Enron will be loca=
ted on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor.  We hop=
e to make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week.  Moves within=
 the 3rd Floor will take place the following week.

The UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hur=
dle.  While I don't have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be on=
 or about February 6th.

Finally, I want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperation=
 over the last few weeks.  These have been really horrible times as the Enr=
on story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are f=
inding out about their future with Enron and UBS.  I know that this hasn't =
been easy for anyone.  I am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the a=
wesome team that we have put together.  Whether you are going to UBS, remai=
ning with Enron, or leaving the company, I wish everyone who worked on this=
 team the best in their future endeavors.  It has been a distinct honor to =
work with each and every one of you.

Regards,
Tim

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge). "

Going Short for the Shortest Month

Day-ahead electricity prices in the Western U.S. were mostly higher
Wednesday on continued cold weather.  Some traders also said that rising
spot gas prices lent support to the daily power market.  ""The worst of this
cold snap appears to be over, but the market will likely take a day or so to
react,"" believed one marketer.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating
demand throughout the West was forecast to fall to below-normal levels over
the coming weekend, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for
mostly normal temperatures from February 5 through 9.  February contracts
were trading a buck or two below the dailies at all of the major Western
hubs on Wednesday.  ""Historically, February has been a lighter load month
than January, and that's why we're heading into the new month with a short
position,"" said one matter-of-fact trader.  In other industry news,
Wednesday's AGA inventory report showed that U.S. gas stocks fell 111 bcf
last week, right in line with most industry estimates.  Total U.S.
inventories of 2.294 tcf were still 1.053 tcf, or 85 percent, above last
year.  Of the 111 bcf taken out of storage last week, 19 were drawn in the
Western Consuming region.  Total inventories in the West stood at 360 bcf,
or 71 percent of full.  Western stocks were at 222 bcf the same week a year
ago, and have averaged 265 bcf over the past five years.

Peak power prices in the Northwest rose marginally for Thursday delivery,
despite a general sense that the worst of the cold snap was over.  ""We were
a little surprised to see prices rise today because it is supposed to begin
warming up, and we are fairly bearish heading into February,"" said one
Washington-based trader.  Heating demand in the region was forecast to
steadily drop from 119 percent of normal on Thursday, to 99 percent of
normal on February 6.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised upward
again on Wednesday, coming in at 115 kcfs Thursday, 110 kcfs Friday, 80 kcfs
Saturday, 65 kcfs Sunday, 110 kcfs Monday and Tuesday, and 105 kcfs next
Wednesday.  In unit news, Bridger #4 (520 MW) was shut Wednesday morning due
to a plugged boiler.  While no ETR was given for the Wyoming-based unit,
sources familiar with thermal plants said such a problem is usually fixed in
48 hours or less.  While Colstrip #3 (700 MW) remained down with no official
ETR, some parties believed it would not return until February 9.

Amid continued below-normal forecasts for Thursday and stronger natural gas
values at the SoCal border, day-ahead electricity prices for delivery on the
last day of January gained ground in the Golden State.  Traders noted that
spot gas and light load prices were particularly strong.  ""I was surprised
that gas was strong today.  The forecasts are warming gradually though, so
gas should start to ease soon and electricity prices should fall off,"" said
one California trader.  Prices at COB settled higher on Wednesday, with
heavy load deals heard between 21.25 and 22.95$/MWh and light load changing
hands from 18 to 19.5.  ""We saw an opportunity to make some money at COB
today,"" said one Western dealer.  February COB lingered about 2$/MWh cheaper
than the dailies, with peak products heard trading near 20$/MWh and off-peak
pieces reportedly going through from 16.75 to 16.95$/MWh.  Similarly,
front-month deals at NP15 were heard about a dollar cheaper than the
dailies, near 22.75$/MWh for heavy load goods.  CAISO reported little change
in the overall generation landscape on Wednesday, with a difference of less
than 100 MW off-line to a day ago.  Of note, San Luis (326 MW) exited the
grid for planned maintenance.  Thursday temperatures were expected to reach
highs in the low-60s at southern load centers, and about 50 degrees at
mid-state.  The five-day forecast called for gradual warming, with
temperatures still expected to be about four degrees below normal on Sunday.
The most current six-to-ten predicted normal temperatures from February 5 to
9.

While peak power prices in the Southwest dipped by 50 cents on both the high
and low ends, the bulk of deals were done at slightly higher levels than on
the previous day.  Continued cold weather and rising spot gas values were
the main factors lending support to the dailies on Wednesday.  Starting on
Friday, heating demand in the desert region was forecast to drop sharply,
dipping to below-normal levels by February 3.  Peak electricity prices at
Palo Verde ranged from 23$/MWh early, to a late-session high of 26$/MWh,
while February contracts were heard around the 21.65$/MWh mark.  Light load
goods for Thursday delivery traded from 14.75 to 17$/MWh, while February off
peak was seeing action near the 14.7$/MWh level.  There were no new outages
of consequence to report in the Southwest on Wednesday, but looking further
ahead, Palo Verde #2 (1,270 MW) was scheduled to shut for spring maintenance
from March 16 through April 20.  Weather forecasts called for gradual
warming over the coming weekend, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was
predicting normal temperatures from February 5 through 9.

___________________________________________________________
Amid expectations of continued warm weather through Friday and a natural gas
storage report within industry estimates, spot electricity prices were
mostly steady across the Eastern Interconnect on Wednesday.  Saturday
predictions called for below-normal temperatures, a break in the bearish
weather pattern that has been depressing demand and prices for much of
January.  The AGA weekly natural gas storage report listed a draw of 111
bcf.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures were mixed, with March picking up
1.3 cents to close at 2.08$/mmBtu, while April slipped 0.3 cent to end the
day at 2.147$/mmBtu.

While revised loads and forecasts met with skepticism from traders in the
Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday, day-ahead electricity prices climbed slightly
higher.  ""Loads and temperatures were revised upwards today.  There's
supposed to be some colder weather for the weekend, but bullish forecasts
have been pushed back all month, so we'll see if the cold actually
materializes this time,"" commented one PJM player with a wait-and-see
attitude.  Western PJM goods for Thursday delivery changed hands between
21.2 and 22.2$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done around 21.6$/MWh.  LMPs
gradually increased from 09:00 through 11:30 EST reaching a high of 44$/MWh,
but averaged only 20.17$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  In unit news, sources said
Keystone #2 (850 MW) returned to the grid on Wednesday, back from a two-day
maintenance outage.  High temperatures were expected in the upper-40s to
low-50s on Thursday, with overnight lows in the 35 to 42-degree range.  The
latest six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from February 5 to 9.

Peak power prices settled lower in the Midwest on Thursday, as continued
bearish fundamentals took their toll on the ECAR market.  Into Cinergy
pieces were bought and sold between 16 and 18.5$/MWh, with the low end
reached in late trade.  No new outages were reported on Thursday, although
traders continued to speculate that many marginal units were off-line for
load following.  Temperatures were predicted to be slightly warmer on
Thursday.  However, the mercury was expected to drop about 15 degrees on
Friday.  The most current six-to-ten predicted above-normal temperatures
from February 5 to 9.

With stronger than expected natural gas values, heavy load energy costs
edged higher in the Southeast on Thursday.  ""Prices were bouncing around
quite a bit today.  It was hard to figure out where things were,"" commented
one Entergy dealer.  Other sources said spring maintenance would start to
affect the market soon, as operators push repairs forward in light of low
prices and warm weather.  Into Entergy trades were heard between 16 and
17.5$/MWh, mostly in the 16s, while February changed hands from 18.35 to
18.5$/MWh.  Texas power remained steady, firming up a buck on the low end.
The bulk of Into TVA deals were done with a 17 handle, but early trades were
heard as low as 16$/MWh.  The updated six-to-ten called for mostly normal
conditions in SERC and Texas from February 5 to 9.

Bill,

As per our conversation today, I am sending you an outline of what we intend to be doing in Ercot and in particular on the real-time desk. For 2002 Ercot is split into 4 zones with TCRs between 3 of the zones. The zones are fairly diverse from a supply/demand perspective. Ercot has an average load of 38,000 MW, a peak of 57,000 MW with a breakdown of 30% industrial, 30% commercial and 40% residential. There are already several successful aggregators that are looking to pass on their wholesale risk to a credit-worthy QSE (Qualified Scheduling Entity). 

Our expectation is that we will be a fully qualified QSE by mid-March with the APX covering us up to that point. Our initial on-line products will include a bal day and next day financial product. (There is no day ahead settlement in this market). There are more than 10 industrial loads with greater than 150 MW concentrated at single meters offering good opportunities for real-time optimization. Our intent is to secure one of these within the next 2 months.

I have included some price history to show the hourly volatility and a business plan to show the scope of the opportunity. In addition, we have very solid analytics that use power flow simulations to map out expected outcomes in the real-time market.

The initial job opportunity will involve an analysis of the real-time market as it stands today with a view to trading around our information. This will also drive which specific assets we approach to manage. As we are loosely combining our Texas gas and Ercot power desks our information flow will be superior and I believe we will have all the tools needed for a successful real-time operation.

Let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,

Doug

DAILY BRIEFING -- Can UBS Tame Enron's Wild Traders?
Daily Briefing: NEWS ANALYSIS 
By Emily Thornton in New York, David Fairlamb in Zurich, and Stephanie Anderson Forest in Dallas 
Back in November, Dynegy (NYSE:DYN <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dyn&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dyn.html>) had what sounded like a great idea: Buy Enron's flagship trading business in natural gas and electricity, and immediately become the dominant force in those markets. Dynegy fled when Enron started to collapse under an avalanche of scandal. Now, Zurich [Switzerland]-based UBS Warburg (NYSE:UBS <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ubs&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/u/ubs.html>) is making the same bet, albeit for a lot less money. 
The question now: Will the conservative bank be able to impose Swiss order on the rogue Texas company's traders? On one level, the deal doesn't seem completely farfetched. Enron's gas and electricity trading actually seems to have made money. Other bankers who checked it out estimate the trading operations racked up $3 billion in pretax profits over the past two years [see BW, 2/11/02, ``Enron: How Good an Energy Trader?'']. 
Still, UBS had good reason to go for a deal that gave it 67% of future pretax profits for a pledge only to pay the salaries of 625 Enron employees. Obviously, the Enron name is mud, and getting people to trade with the company will be difficult enough. But managing Enron's swaggering traders -- its core asset -- could turn out to be even harder. 
CULTURE CLASH. Enron may be on its last legs, but its masters-of-the-universe culture lives on, say insiders. ``Even after going down in flames, a lot of these people have undiminished confidence in their ability,'' says a former Enron trader who asked not to be named. Competitors doubt that people who earned as much as $1 million a year in the freewheeling, high-risk Enron culture will be grateful to become a small piece of UBS's massive fixed-income business. 
Although many have signed contracts with UBS that prevent them from leaving Enron for an undisclosed period, ``they're all exploring their options,'' says one banker privately. Indeed, some traders are talking about trying to buy the trading unit back from UBS after it gets going again. UBS says it's not worried about rogue traders. ``We're confident in the people we have hired,'' says Michael Hutchins, global co-head of credit fixed income at UBS Warburg. 
For the scheme to work, however, UBS must persuade Enron's traders to accept its risk-management practices. And that will be tough: One reason Enron's traders made so much is that they took big risks. Analysts estimate that Enron was willing to put as much as $66 million at risk on a trade, vs. $12.2 million at Dynegy or $16 million at Duke Energy. UBS Warburg is willing to put up to $131 million at risk in all of its deals with a single trading partner, but insiders says its energy traders won't be allowed to risk ``anything like that'' on a single trade. UBS'ers abide by tighter controls than at Enron. 
``SMOOTHING ELEMENT.'' UBS officials insist that they have no rosy delusions about the investment. That's partly because they had been researching the energy-trading business for more than a year as a way of diversifying the bank's trading income. ``Earnings in the energy-trading business do not depend on developments in the capital markets, so they could work as a smoothing element,'' says UBS President Peter A. Wuffli. 
That's in fact what motivated UBS to send a small team down to Houston when Enron put the business up for sale after the bankruptcy filing. Even after federal antitrust authorities give the final go-ahead, the Swiss bank says it plans to take things slowly. ``We don't know how quickly this is going to start up,'' says UBS CEO John Costas. ``We'd be happy in the first year if this business is half as big as it had been historically.'' 
Still, anything associated with Enron is arguably fraught with risk at any price. ``It's not clear how successful UBS is going to be,'' says Jeff Dietert, an analyst at investment bank Simmons & Co. in Houston. ``And I think UBS knows that. That's why it wasn't willing to pay anything up front.'' 
Some industry insiders doubt that Enron's traders will prove to be exceptional under the new rules. But UBS isn't about to change its own way of doing business. ``Entering into energy trading does not mean extending our appetite for risk,'' says Wuffli. Swiss family Enron? Don't bet the chalet on it.

New CEO to Resurrect Enron

Heavy load energy costs for Wednesday delivery turned in mixed results in
the Western U.S. on Tuesday, reflecting varying weather forecasts in
different regions.  ""The average price in the Northwest was slightly lower
today because temperatures were forecast to rise tomorrow, while the average
price in the Southwest rose slightly on expected cooler temperatures,"" said
one weather watcher.  Off-peak prices, however, were immune to geographical
boundaries, rising at just about all of the Western hubs on the cold
weather.  ""There were a lot of people looking to secure off-peak power today
in order to meet demand,"" said one trader of the stronger light load prices.
Nonetheless, some players were surprised by Tuesday's strength, noting that
the worst of the cold was likely over.  Accordingly, Weather Derivatives was
forecasting a general decline in heating demand throughout the West over the
course of the week, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was predicting
mostly normal temperatures for the WSCC from February 4 through 8.  In
Enron-related news, ""Turnaround Expert"" Stephen Cooper was named interim CEO
of bankrupt Enron Corp. on Tuesday.  Cooper told Enron employees that their
company was in much better shape than some of the hundreds of other
companies he and his partners have represented in bankruptcies and
reorganizations.  ""They didn't start with nearly as strong a position as
this company.  They were able to emerge successfully from bankruptcy and I'm
confident that Enron will also,"" Cooper said in a company-wide voice mail on
Tuesday.  On Monday, about 400 former and current Enron employees filed suit
against several company officials and auditor Arthur Andersen in a federal
court in Houston, alleging that the defendants encouraged employees to buy
Enron stock without being notified about the company's precarious financial
condition.

Peak power prices in the Northwest fell by an average of nearly a buck on
Tuesday, likely due to forecasts indicating the worst of the region's most
recent cold snap had passed.  In addition, strong river flows made for
abundant hydroelectric generation.  Nonetheless, light load prices for
Wednesday delivery traded slightly higher than a day ago, on average.  ""It's
still cold at night, and a lot of the hydro is being pushed through during
the peak hours to meet demand, so we're just not seeing as many offers for
the light load hours,"" said one Northwest utility trader.  Flow forecasts
for Chief Joseph were ratcheted slightly upward on Tuesday, coming in at 110
kcfs through Thursday, 105 kcfs Friday, 80 kcfs Saturday, 65 kcfs Sunday,
110 kcfs Monday, and 105 kcfs next Tuesday.  According to Weather
Derivatives, heating demand in the region was forecast to be 124 percent of
normal on Wednesday, steadily falling to 99 percent of normal by February 3.
Meanwhile, the latest six-to-ten was calling for temperatures to be normal
in Oregon and Washington, and above normal in Idaho and Montana, from
February 4 through 8.

Amid below-normal temperature forecasts, flat spot gas values at the Socal
border, and firmer overnight heating demand, peak power prices were mostly
steady and off-peak prices strengthened in the Golden State on Tuesday.
Heavy load goods at NP15 changed hands predominantly between 23.5 and
24.25$/MWh, but one confirmed trade was heard at 26.5$/MWh.  Light load
pieces saw action from 18.25 to 19.75$/MWh.  Correction:  in the Energy
Market Report for January 28 we incorrectly reported that CPUC
administrative law judge Robert Barnett advised the commission to restore
the direct access provision, which was revoked September 20, 2001, allowing
industrial and household consumers to again chose their ESP through July 1,
2002.  In fact, Barnett's ruling would retroactively cancel direct access
from July 1, 2001 onward, nullifying contracts signed between July 1, 2001
and September 20, 2001.  ""This is not a restoration of choice.  This is a
post-birth abortion,"" emailed one reader.  Additionally, contracts penned
before July 1 but which didn't deliver power until after July 1 are also
cancelled under the new ruling.  ""To boil all this down to the simplest
terms, the DWR and the utilities are afraid that too much load switched to
alternate suppliers during that time frame (July through September).  Since
they bought too much power through high-priced contracts they have fewer
kilowatt hours to spread their costs against,"" summed up one market analyst
on the reason behind the new ruling.  The ruling is on the agenda for the
CPUC's February 7 meeting, at which point it could be enacted.  In unit
news, Calpine's Sutter Plants (546 MW) was almost back to full capacity on
Tuesday, generating at 525 MW.  Helms PGP #1 (407 MW) also returned to the
grid.  Wednesday forecasts called for temperatures to climb slightly, with
highs expected in the upper-40s to low-50s at mid-state load centers and
overnight lows anticipated near freezing.  The latest six-to-ten predicted
normal temperatures from February 4 to 8.


The average price for a 25-megawatt block of spot electricity rose
marginally in the Southwest Tuesday amid continued cold weather.  Heating
demand in the region was expected to remain well above normal through
Friday, but then drop to below-normal levels over the coming weekend.  ""It's
cold down here, especially at night, so we're having to buy to cover our
load,"" said one Phoenix-based trader shivering at the thought of overnight
lows in the 30s.  Peak power at Palo Verde saw action from 23.5 to
25.5$/MWh, with unconfirmed late-day trades heard as high as 26$/MWh.  There
was little in the way of unit news on Tuesday, except for word that
Arizona-based Coronado #1 (395 MW) was still having trouble making it back
online.  Weather forecasts called for gradual warming through the coming
weekend, while the latest six-to-ten was predicting a near-blanketing of
normal temperatures from February 4 through 8.

___________________________________________________________
With little change in market fundamentals to a day ago, peak power prices
posted mixed results across the Eastern Interconnect on Tuesday. Very warm
temperatures continued to smother demand across most of the East, while
cooler conditions were expected in ECAR and Texas, lending some support to
those regions.  According to traders, there were higher prices in the Summer
and Q4 term products on Tuesday.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures rose
on some short covering ahead of February's expiration.  The front month
crawled up 9.8 cents in its last gasp and closed at 2.006$/mmBtu, while
March gained 8.3 cents to end at 2.067$/mmBtu.

Weak demand pummeled the Mid-Atlantic again on Tuesday, sending day-ahead
electricity prices lower.  Western PJM goods for Wednesday delivery changed
hands between 21 and 21.5$/MWh, with the bulk of deals heard around
21.25$/MWh.  February settled about a dime lower to a day ago, at 23.4$/MWh.
LMPs softened on Tuesday, averaging 18.11$/MWh through 15:00 EST, after some
mid-morning, short-lived volatility.  Rumors circulated of an outage at
Keystone #2 (850 MW) on Tuesday, but confirmation was not available, and
little effect was seen on the market regardless, sources said.  Forecasts
for Wednesday called for about five degrees of cooling, with highs expected
in the 57 to 65-degree range and overnight lows in the upper-40s.  The
mercury was expected to settle five degrees lower on Thursday.  The most
current six-to-ten predicted above-normal temperatures from February 4 to 8.

Amid cooler forecasts for Wednesday, peak power prices strengthened in the
Midwest.  Into Cinergy pieces were bought and sold from 17 to 19.3$/MWh,
climbing almost a buck on the high end.  Temperatures were expected to drop
significantly on Wednesday, with highs forecast in the 39 to 49-degree range
across ECAR, with overnight lows about five degrees below there.  The latest
six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from February 4 to 8.

Peak power prices slipped in the Southeast on Tuesday, as warm weather kept
demand very soft.  ""It's gas close-out day so everyone's keeping an eye
turned to NYMEX.  A rally there could push spot gas higher tomorrow and thus
the dailies as well,"" said one SERC player.  Into Entergy deals were done
between 15 and 17.15$/MWh, settling to the low end late.  The February
contract weakened slightly on Tuesday, trading between 18 and 18.1$/MWh.
Texas power firmed up for Wednesday delivery, with much colder temperatures
expected across the Lone Star State.  The most current six-to-ten called for
mostly normal temperatures, with above-normal conditions in the north, from
February 4 to 8.

Bill and I are considering having Real time do the EPE preschedules since they are the ones that live and die by them anyway.  That way you would be released from that burden and any errors would be all on the ownership of RT.

After the Day ahead market ran, the Mirage branch group TTC in both
directions was changed from 70 MW to 0 MW for HE's 0700 through 2400 for
operating day 1/30/02.  The reason(s) for the change is:  transfer trip
forced out of service to Devers-Capwind.  The first applicable Hour Ahead
market to run with these values is HE 1200.  The ISO will update you of any
changes in line rating status.  Sent by Market Operations, inquiries please
call the Hour Ahead Desk.

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,

Please note the following due to the past two days schedules have been wrong in the EPE Schedules in Excel:

Tag number 6181 has been cancelled (50mw to the CISO).

Lending is wrong in the EPE schedules (it is 75mw from PSCO instead of 50mw).

SPS is wrong for HE 08 (it is 130mw instead of 100mw).

I thought you might like to since this is the only income we have currently for real-time and a major screw-up could hurt our relationship.

Regards,

Bert Meyers"

Group,

There are two new paths for EPE information.

The first is for EPE schedules:
This path is P:/Trading/Real Time/El Paso Schedules/Admin/El Paso Schedules/2002/Feb02/EPE_FEB_02

The second is for the EPE models:
M:/Electric/EPE/EPE 2002/Models/February02/...

The estate will be settling CAPS each day (creating DA and HA finals) beginning on Friday. 

Please work closely with John and Dave to get all problems resolved as quickly as possible.

Thanks,
Bill"

Enron-omic Stimulus?

Despite the continuing grip of a cold snap, and a rash of unit outages over
the weekend, most Western power prices for Tuesday delivery ended slightly
weaker in the first trading session of the new week.  ""Flows are up and
hydro's cheap,"" explained one marketer of the weather's inability to inject
strength into Western markets.  ""If the weather weren't as cold as it is,
the market could even be worse for sellers.""  As usual over the past few
months, references to Enron were peppered across the mainstream media on
Monday.  UBS Warburg, the Swiss bank that is in the process of purchasing
the now-defunct EnronOnLine, plans to have the trading business in full
operation by the end of February.  To staff the reborn operation, UBS
Warburg has offered contracts to about 625 of EnronOnLine's 800 former
employees.  The transaction is still pending the approval of various federal
agencies.  In another chapter of the Enron saga, Vice Chairman J. Clifford
Baxter's death was ruled a suicide by Harris County Medical Examiner Joye
Carter on Saturday.  Baxter was considered an important potential witness in
the Enron affair after whistle-blower Sherron Watkins cited his discussion
with then-CEO Jeff Skilling about the company's dubious accounting
practices.  A suicide note was found at the scene, but the details of the
note have not yet been released.  Equally serious are allegations made by
Rep. Henry Waxman of California, indicating that the White House had
apparently changed the contents of a draft energy proposal circulated
through Congress in March of last year to add a provision that specifically
aided Enron Corp. in India.  According to Rep. Waxman, ""the provision
appears to have been added to the plan during the period in which the White
House directly controlled the drafting.""  The Bush Administration has
understandably tried to distance itself from their biggest political
contributor, denying that its energy plan was crafted to help Enron.  In
related news, GAO head David M. Walker will likely sue Vice President Dick
Cheney for refusing to turn over documents relating to the VP's meetings
with Enron representatives last year.  It would mark the first time the
investigative arm of Congress sued another branch of the government for refu
sal to cooperate with an inquiry.  The Vice President insisted that the GAO
was overstepping its bounds. ""Their jurisdiction extends to agencies created
by statute. That's not me,"" asserted Cheney, ""I'm a constitutional officer.
And the authority of the GAO does not extend in that case to my office.""
Save it for the judge, Dick.  In gas news, NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas
futures fell hard in Monday trading, with the February contract losing 12.9
cents to settle at 1.908$/mmBtu, and the March contract close behind,
plummeting 12 cents to close at 1.984$/mmBtu.

Heavy load energy prices in the Northwest fell almost 2$/MWh on the low end
for Tuesday delivery.  Healthy hydro flows and a cold front that did not
quite live up to its prediction took the brunt of the blame.  Peak goods at
Mid-Columbia changed hands from 18.8 to 22$/MWh on Monday.  Flows at Chief
Joseph remained as strong as ever this year, coming in at 110 kcfs Tuesday,
105 kcfs Wednesday and Thursday, 100 kcfs Friday, 85 kcfs Saturday, 65 kcfs
Sunday, and 110 kcfs next Monday.  Temperatures were predicted to remain
well below normal through Friday, with lows expected to flirt with freezing.
The latest six-to-ten likewise called for temperatures to remain near to
below normal from February 3 to 7.  There were no new unit outages to report
on Monday.

Despite cold weather and a modest rise in natural gas values at the Socal
border, day-ahead electricity prices softened in the Golden State on Monday.
Heavy load goods lost about 2$/MWh everywhere, while light load prices took
a bigger hit, slipping almost 4$/MWH.  Peak power at SP15 traded between 23
and 25$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done closer to the high end, above
24.25$/MWh. In California politicking, the CPUC voted to reject a compromise
put forth by SDG&E parent Sempra Energy.  The proposal would have used $219
million of the $363 million earned selling power from five-year contracts at
wholesale prices last summer to pay down the balancing account, and thus
benefiting SDG&E rate payers, while allocating the remaining $144 million to
shareholders.  The CPUC said they think the courts will award a higher
number to the balancing account. Californians may soon be allowed to choose
their power provider again, if CPUC administrative law judge Robert Barnett
has his way.  The initiative, a cornerstone of the 1996 deregulation bill,
was revoked September 20, 2001.  However, consumers would have to hurry
their selection, as the option would be back in play for a limited time,
through July 1, 2002.  Barnett said competitive choice was essential to keep
utility customers from unfairly footing the bill for last year's energy
crisis.  On the generation front, Morro Bay #4 (336 MW) and Pittsburg #7
(682 MW) returned to service over the weekend.  Helms PGP #1 (407 MW) joined
sister unit #2 (407 MW) in the out of service category on Monday.  Alamitos
#3 (320 MW) exited the grid on January 26.  Hydro Big Creek (1,020 MW) was
derated, operating at 720 MW.  Sutter Plants (546 MW) was generating at 270
MW.  Tuesday forecasts called for temperatures to linger almost 10 degrees
below normal, with highs in the upper-40s to mid-50s across the state.  The
latest six-to-ten predicted below-normal temperatures from February 3 to 7.

The Southwest was a slight exception to the conditions prevalent across the
WSCC on Monday.  While temperatures were lower than on Friday, peak power
prices remained mostly flat.  Heavy load pieces at Palo Verde traded between
22.75 and 25.75$/MWh, a loss of 75 cents on the low end and no change on the
high.  Temperatures were expected to linger well below normal through
Friday, and the latest six-to-ten predicted likewise from February 3 to 7.
In unit news, coal-fired Navajo #3 (750 MW) returned to the grid Monday
morning, while the ETR for Coronado #1 (395 MW) was revised to early morning
Tuesday, January 29.  Fellow coal unit Huntington #2 (455 MW) also climbed
back onto the grid over the weekend after repairing a tube leak.

As unseasonably warm weather continued and traders harbored little hope of
an upside in the gas market, peak power prices remained mostly steady on
Monday across the Eastern Interconnect.  Traders reported light trading
volume and lots of sunshine outside their windows.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural
gas futures reached new contract lows on Monday, a familiar refrain heard
during the past week.  February lost 12.9 cents in its second to last
trading session, ending the day at 1.908$/mmBtu.  March plunged a similar 12
cents to close at 1.984$/mmBtu.

With a healthy generation landscape and temperatures more usual to late
spring blanketing the region, day-ahead peak electricity prices settled
lower in the Mid-Atlantic on Monday.  Western PJM goods for Tuesday delivery
changed hands between 20.95 and 22.1$/MWh, with most deals done in the 21.05
to 21.5$/MWh range.  Balance of the week trades were heard around 21.7$/MWh,
while balance of the month deals went through near 23.4$/MWh.  Despite an
unusual brief spike to 73$/MWh just after 13:00 EST, LMPs were averaging
21.26$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  Traders reported lackluster trading and no
new outages on Monday.  Tuesday forecasts called for high temperatures to
linger in the balmy 63 to 68 degree range across PJM, before cooling about 5
degrees on Wednesday.  The most current six-to-ten predicted normal
temperatures from February 3 to 7.

Despite record highs near 60 degrees and more of the same expected for
Tuesday, heavy load energy costs were flat to slightly higher in the Midwest
on Monday.  Into Cinergy deals for Tuesday delivery were heard between 17
and 18.5$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions from 17.75 to 18$/MWh.  Most
traders were surprised by the relative strength of the Cinergy hub.  ""I
suspect there are quite a few coal units turned off, and most maintenance
schedules have been pushed forward, since the generation clearly isn't
needed,"" commented one ECAR trader.  In unit news, Quad Cities #1 (821 MW)
remained down for pump support maintenance.  Sources said they expected
sister unit #2 (821 MW) to be taken off-line for the same repairs when #1
returned to the grid, possibly as soon as this week.  The south shore of
Lake Erie, a region where January snow is usually measured in feet, enjoyed
high temperatures in the low-60s on Monday and anticipated the same on
Tuesday.  Indeed, all of ECAR expected similar conditions for Tuesday, while
cooling into the upper-40s was forecast for Wednesday.  The latest
six-to-ten called for normal temperatures from February 3 to 7.

As weak weather-related demand dominated SERC and Texas, peak power prices
weakened on Monday.  Into Entergy deals were done between 15.5 and 18$/MWh,
with the low end reached late in the day.  ""I don't see any possibility of a
rally for February.  Gas was hammered again today; the market is very soft
right now,"" commented one SERC realist.  Tuesday was expected to see high
temperatures solidly in the 70s across SERC and Texas, with slight cooling
predicted as the week progresses.  The most current six-to-ten called for
normal temperatures from February 3 to 7.

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Notice to Market Participants

The latest revision to the Market Design 2002 (MD02) proposal is now posted
on the ISO Home Page at http://www.caiso.com Current Issues, then  Market
Design 2002.  Or try this link:
http://www.caiso.com/docs/09003a6080/13/d1/09003a608013d13f.pdf .  

Based on feedback at the focus group meetings and the ISO review of written
comments on the January 8 preliminary draft, the ISO has modified the
proposed MD02 timeline significantly.  

The ISO held four separate focus groups in Folsom on January 14-17, 2002 to
discuss the proposal and to solicit feedback on the proposed MD02 package.
Over 100 individuals participated in the meetings, either in person or by
phone.  They represented scheduling coordinators, investor owned utilities,
load serving entities, municipals, other control areas, and consumer
representatives.  In addition, many interested parties submitted comments
last week.  Two consistent messages the ISO received suggested that (1) the
timeline was too aggressive and (2) the Available Capacity (ACAP) proposal
needed additional work and explanation. 

In response to these concerns, the ISO has modified the timeline:
  
*	The Board will receive a status report at its regularly scheduled
meeting on February 7, 2002, but will not vote on the comprehensive design
package until its March 14 meeting.  The ISO plans two separate filings at
FERC, one in late March and one on May 1, 2002.    

*	The ACAP proposal will likely not be included in the Phase 1 FERC
filing in late March.  

Please see the revised MDO2 draft proposal now posted on the ISO website for
more specifics regarding the schedule for advancing the proposal to the ISO
Board of Governors and the FERC.  The ISO requests that any additional
comments from the public be submitted by Thursday, January 31, 9 a.m. (PST),
so they can be included in the Board discussion.  (Note the Thursday
deadline is an extension of the original Wednesday deadline discussed in
earlier messages)  Please submit to Byron Woertz at bwoertz@caiso.com.  

Again, the ISO would like to thank those who attended the MD02 focus groups
and/or submitted written comments.   The ISO will keep you posted on further
opportunities for review and feedback on details of the MD02 design.

With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power

Could Enron's Business Model Actually Work?

January 28, 2002 

By DANIEL ALTMAN


 

Is Enron (news/quote)'s business model still a good one?
With fuzzy financing and arcane accounting stripped away,
the answer may be yes. Despite Enron's collapse, its goal
of merging the best thinking in energy, finance and
information technology as an online commodity trader still
garners respect. 

""Enron failed because they were scamming, but the basic
virtual market part was fine,"" said Dale Kutnick, chief
executive and research director of the META Group
(news/quote), an information technology consultancy. ""There
is still a real market for virtual trading companies, no
question about it."" 

Enron traded contracts for electricity and natural gas and,
later, other products like rights to high-speed
telecommunications networks and financial hedges against
changes in the weather. It used a sophisticated online
platform backed by a financial apparatus meant to hedge the
company's bets. In the words of Kurt Launer, an analyst who
follows Enron for Credit Suisse First Boston, the company
had ""the pioneering online venture for real-time
availability of information"" used in trading commodities. 

*  
Enron's basic business model, in other words, may yet
serve as a model for other companies. In the wake of
Enron's bankruptcy filing, some of the best support for
that model model came from its competitors. 

Reliant Energy (news/quote) is one of several companies
that followed Enron in offering online exchanges for
electricity and natural gas. 

""Our commodity markets worked just fine the day after Enron
went away,"" said Joe Bob Perkins, president and chief
operating officer of the wholesale group at Reliant. 

""Everybody got gas, everybody got power, and prices stayed
basically the same,"" Mr. Perkins said. ""The loss of one
intermediary just proves that these competitive markets
work."" 

Other companies offering similar services rushed to fill
the gap after Enron suspended its trading. ""We've picked up
market share,"" said Stephen L. Baum, the chairman,
president and chief executive of Sempra. He noted, though,
that unlike Enron, ""our trading, although extremely
important and a big income earner for us, is not the
centerpiece of our business."" 

Another company that sees continued value in the Enron
approach is UBS Warburg, the Swiss investment bank, which
bought Enron's electricity and gas trading business in
bankruptcy proceedings and plans to restart them under its
own brand. 

""We're confident we can re-establish the business,"" David
Walker, a UBS Warburg spokesman, said. ""It is a first-rate
trading platform."" 

Similarities between UBS Warburg's financial derivatives
business and Enron's trading of energy contracts were one
factor that made the deal appealing, Mr. Walker said. ""The
characteristics of trading these types of products and
betting on interest rates, which is a core ability of UBS,
are similar,"" he said. ""They're kind of neighbors."" 

Mr. Kutnick, the research chief, added that Enron had
""outstanding"" information technology organization that was
backed by ""tremendous amounts of money."" In that way as
well, he said, the company ""was certainly comparable to the
best financial companies out there."" 

Because of Enron's technological advantage, Mr. Kutnick
predicted, UBS would have little difficulty regaining
Enron's market share. ""They were far enough ahead that it
shouldn't be an issue,"" he said. ""If you are a couple
seconds faster in terms of spotting and executing a market
inefficiency, obviously you're going to make money."" 

According to experts who consulted for Enron in the field
of finance, the company did not necessarily come up with a
lot of powerful new ideas. Its strength was in synthesizing
existing ideas, which sometimes led to innovative methods. 

""They took a lot of finance theory and applied it in the
context of their business,"" said Ramesh K. S. Rao, a
professor of finance at the University of Texas who once
consulted for Enron. ""There was no magic to what they were
doing."" 

Robert L. McDonald, a professor of finance at Northwestern,
advised Enron on the use of derivatives from 1993 to 1995.
He said the company needed advanced financial tools to
price its derivatives, which specified energy products to
be delivered at various times and sites while demand was
uncertain. ""That's a hard problem, so they were probably
breaking some new ground trying to deal with that,"" he
said. ""It's the kind of thing that's easy to describe and
may be hard to do."" 

Peter Tufano, a professor at the Harvard Business School
who studied Enron, said the company had been using what
would be considered ""best practices"" for using derivatives
by any ""serious financial firm"" in the early 1990's. 

Had Enron stuck to those practices, Mr. Kutnick said, it
might still survive today. 

""Enron could have done extremely well with betting on
market inefficiencies and hedging bets,"" he said. ""People
stop hedging because they get too enamored of their own
theories."" As a parallel, he cited Long- Term Capital
Management, the hedge fund, which failed in 1998 when it
could no longer cover the ever-higher risks it began
taking. 

Enron also betrayed its success, Mr. Launer said, by
throwing money at ventures that failed to generate cash
flow. For example, Enron spent around $2 billion on its
network capacity, or bandwidth, exchange, which never
turned a profit. ""The fact that Enron became a dot-com,
financed itself like a dot-com, and then suffered a demise
like a dot-com,"" he said, ""is one of the central parts of
this story."" 

But Enron's failed attempts to expand its online trading
system to products beyond electricity and natural gas might
not rule out future, similar endeavors. 

""In any commodity, there are always people who have too
much and others who have too little, so there's always
going to be a need for them to trade and exchange,""
Professor Tufano said. 

Mr. Launer suggested that Enron's efforts were simply
ill-timed. ""These things take a while to get going,"" he
said. He noted that the deregulation of electricity and
natural gas led to a long period during which the market
for energy products and their derivatives evolved. ""It does
take a while before users of a commodity get comfortable
with the idea that they should risk-manage and out-source
their use of that commodity.""

I just heard from Chris Lue, UBS HR, regarding the UBS New Hire paperwork.  All New Hire paperwork must be completed before 3:00 PM TODAY, Friday, 1/25/02 or UBS will be unable to process your payroll.  

These forms were distributed during the HR Benefit meetings held yesterday.  If you were unable to attend these meetings and are unsure about what forms need to be completed, please see either Grace or I ASAP.

Thanks!

All,

I added comment #5 for clarification.

Also, did the group decide to recommend that all tags be submitted in PPT?  If so, then comment #1 is incorrect and would need to be changed to PPT.

Jerry sent me a revised table to reflect our discussions yesterday.  I did

Great suggestion.  Yes, a meeting is needed, especially for same day
timelines.

May I suggest the conference center meeting rooms at the Portland Airport?
A fly-in, fly-out meeting 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.

If you have a better location or better idea, speak-up.  Otherwise, I'll
check on availability of a room.  Looks like we are down to the last two
weeks of this month - 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, or 27.

I'll try to send out a list of topics for an agenda tomorrow.

Bob and team -

If it works at all for the group - June 27th works great for me as I would already be in Portland and can attend this type of a meeting.  None of the other dates would work for me.

thanks - Jerry

I have attached BPA Transmission Schedulings' response to the questions
posed by Bob in his email dated May 21 below.  If the group feels it would
be helpful to meet to discuss the timeline issues, I am in support of that
effort.  Otherwise, I look forward to the responses from the rest of the
group.  Thanks, Sue.

I made a few suggested revisions in the attached tag time table.  BPAT is
supportive of the change to remove the preschedule flag and also to use the
LCA prevailing time.  Thanks for the opportunity to comment.

Jerry Dempsey has sent the attached regarding the preschedule flag in E-Tag.

What he is proposing is:
*	a revision to the timeline tables in A3A to enable software to make
the determination of whether or not a tag is for preschedule or real-time
(currently it is a flag set by the PSE creating the tag).
*	Referencing time in terms of the Load Control Area's prevailing time
(this fits the Authority Service is associated with the load control area
and it's the Authority Service that keeps the time).

It may be possible to get this revision worked in to the 1.7 release.

Process
Please review his proposal and comment.
Specifically, do you support the concept of removing the flag and using the
timing table logic?
Do you support adjusting times to reference the Load Control Area prevailing
time?

If we reach a consensus on this issue by the end of the week, we can forward
on a recommendation to Mark for distribution to the whole ISAS.  If there is
support from all of ISAS, then it can be taken to NERC IS/TISWG for
approval.

Please let me know by the end of business June 15, 2001.

	Has anyone, or everyone, read the latest business practice proposal
that was released by NERC on Tuesday? It is ESC's Scheduling and Approval
Practices submitted by the Multiple Task Groups - Scheduling Process,
Approval, Schedule Timing, Granularity and Ramping Task Groups.
	Specifically, they are recommending changing the ramp time to a
10-minute straddle ramp (:55 to :05). In addition, they're recommending
allowing schedule changes on the quarter (as already exists at :15, :30,
:45) with a 10 minute ramp. Their reasoning is, and this is a quote, ""large
generators that require longer Ramp times (e.g. 20 or 30 minutes), could
partially ramp for 10 minutes across the schedule start, then finish with
another 10-minute ramp across the next quarter to complete the full ramp.
This would accommodate areas such as Florida and WSCC, where longer ramp
times are needed.""
	Their asking for feedback for the public posting. This proposal has
a serious impact on our recommendations. Anyone have any comments? I'm
attaching a copy of the document. It's 21 pages long, about 15 of them on
frag tags. The ramping stuff and recommendations are the last couple of
pages.

Bob,
Sorry for the late response, I've been gone the last 10 days. I will not be
able to make the meeting on June 27. I do like Jack Dempsey's proposal. I'm
not sure I completely understand Mons' reasoning, but I believe the PSE
submission deadline should be left at 30 minutes for the following 2
reasons:

1. 3A1 is very explicit in its definition of transaction start time and
excluding the ramp time. If we change it to read ""20 minutes prior
    to start"" that would allow a tag to be submitted at 40 after.

2. If the 20 minutes verbage is to be used, then the the remaining verbage
defining transaction start time as excluding ramp time will
    need to be removed.

It was my understanding that both proposals intended to leave the real-time
deadline at :30 after.

However, I still have the same questions as a few weeks ago with respect to
the new BP's being put forth by the ESC/ESTF. Are we going to take into
account the BP's that the ECS/ESTF have put out/being commented on? The
schedule process BP has several ramping/timing changes, as well as frag
tags. They aren't asking whether or not we should adopt Eastern Connection
timelines, they're just doing it.

Personally, I don't think the majority of the WSCC's units can handle a 10
minute ramp, and the idea of finishing the ramp on the quarter is a prelude
to a perpetual time error correction and excessive inadvertent accounts.
However, that is being proposed.

I would appreciate someone else's opinion on where the proposed BP's fit in
with our goal.

Great suggestion.  Yes, a meeting is needed, especially for same day
timelines.

May I suggest the conference center meeting rooms at the Portland Airport?
A fly-in, fly-out meeting 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.

If you have a better location or better idea, speak-up.  Otherwise, I'll
check on availability of a room.  Looks like we are down to the last two
weeks of this month - 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, or 27.

I'll try to send out a list of topics for an agenda tomorrow.

Right.  Well, work is always crazy for you I suppose.  Yeah, I'm getting
ready to move.  This is my last week of work at the restaurant (thank god!)
and I have three weeks of class left.  I'll leave on the last day of class
(June 14) bright and early in the morning and drive west until I hit CO.
Still don't have a place to live, but I'm working on that.

I'll probably be coming back to Portland for a weekend or so during the
summer sometime so I'll look you up when I get there, if you want.

Good luck with work, I know you're doing a great job.

Christel

Hey. I saw this sunrise from my place this morning. Granted it didn't look as cool as it probably did from up here, but it was pretty sweet. It was so orange and pinkish. I wasn't here too late last night which ruled. Yeah, I went to Bally's and did the cross country machine and the stairmaster. Funny. I look like such a retard on those machines, but anyways. I guess that place it ok, but I just feel really self-conscious when I am there. At the Enron gym in Houston I just felt more at ease or something. I wanted to go into the free weight area to do some lunges and tricep work last night, but the meatheads scared me off. It was pretty lame I admit, but what can I say? Anyhoo, coffee sounds good to me as it usually does. Let me know when is good for you (maybe 9ish). "

I completely forgot about your trip to Vegas. I bet you didn't! Ha ha. Anyhow, I'm bummed that you are going to gone thursday and we won't be able to hang out at the Happy Hour. You'll be having a blast in Vegas though, so no biggie. Anyhow, I guess I'll see you tomorrow. Maybe we can go get a beer after work tomorrow night if you don't leave too early. If not, there will be much beer to drink when you get back into town next week.

So are you about to leave work or what? I really can't believe that it is already 4:30. Crazy. Anyhows, are you going to that Happy Hour deal on thursday night? Free drinks?! Should be a good time. I didn't make it to the last one and I was kinda bummed about it. 

I hope I can get outta here at a reasonable hour tonight. I'm gonna go pump some iron at Bally's with all the meatheads if I do. Should be pretty fun. See ya later! "

Good morning. I'm glad to hear that you are having a better day today. Me, too so far. Yeah, I stayed last night until like 7:45 and finished up that stuff with Mike Etringer. So today should be a bit more chill for me which is awesome. Anyhow, I hope nothing blows up over there for you. Maybe we can go to get some coffee later or something. Did you end up going out last night for some beers? I watched Alli McBeal and ate dinner. It was pretty exciting. "

Good morning,

I'd love to go get some coffee with you, but remember that annoying project that Mike Etringer wants me to work on for him? This morning I am kinda under some pressure to hurry up and try to get some stuff figured out so I really don't have much spare time right now. JA would flip out if I left for coffee now. Maybe later this afternoon? Or tomorrow morning? Anyhow, another ride sounds really cool. I had lots of fun. And yes, it would be cooler if I didn't have to worry about work. Let me know when you have extra time to go for a ride.
My weekend was pretty fun. I weed-wacked (is that a word?) my yard for the first time. It looks so bad. I so don't know anything about lawn care. Also I planted some herbs and stuff in my yard which I am sure my dog will destroy, but it s worth a try. Oh yeah, I also bought a snowboard. It's pretty cool. I bought some step-in switch boots, too. Cool, eh? 
So I'll talk to you later. Have a great day."

Hey Bill (or do you prefer William Williams the 3rd),

What's up?  I bet you didn't think I'd e-mail you.
Don't worry, I have nothing against players.  Just
kidding...

I hope you had a good time at the show last weekend.
Maktub were pretty cool.  I know they play around
Seattle frequently so I'll check them out again
sometime.  Maybe you'll luck out and they'll come to
Portland soon.  I'm sure you have a decent music scene
in Portland so you always have other options.  I've
found that you can find some really cool little bands
or musicians in the most random little bars and
restaurants.

I hope all is well in Portland at the moment.  Seattle
has been pretty sunny and warm so I can't complain.
I'm totally looking forward to summer.  There will be
something to do every weekend.  Thank god.  Time to
start taking all my ""sick"" days!

Have a good day.  Don't work too hard.   If you do,
make sure you play harder to make up for it.

Talk to you later.
Colleen (the first)

Subject:=09Loss Tag Reminder

Transmission Customers:

The Western Area Colorado Missouri control area (WACM) has just implemented=
 a new scheduling package and thought this would be a good time to offer a =
reminder about how loss energy tags for delivery to WACM are to be complete=
d.

1.  Please ensure that ""WACM"" is the last PSE on the tag.  This is importan=
t as it provides proper credit to the Transmission Customer for losses deli=
vered.
2.  In the 'Comments' field, please put the words ""WACM Losses"".  If the ta=
gs are for a real-time transaction from the previous week, please indicate =
the date; i.e., ""WACM Losses for MM/DD/YY"".
3.  Prescheduled transactions require a concurrent tagging of loss energy t=
o WACM.
4.  Real-time transactions require a return of loss energy to be accomplish=
ed same day, next week, same profile.
5.  It is allowable to combine losses due in any day/week/month/season on a=
 single tag if that is easier for you to do so.  WACM calculates the amount=
 of loss energy due from a Transmission Customer per day based on preschedu=
led transaction losses due on Day 0, plus real-time transaction losses due =
from day -7.

We are working with WACM Operations staff to see if, with the new schedulin=
g software implemented, we will be able to accept real-time transaction los=
s energy concurrent with the real-time transaction.  If we are able to effe=
ct that change, it will be posted on OASIS and we will get an e-mail off to=
 you immediately.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please give me a call or send a=
n e-mail.

The following day ahead tag# 24395 for the 11th was denied by WACM because it was submitted after the 3:00pdt tag deadline.  Tag# 24365 was the predecessor and was approved by WACM.  Still, WACM refuses to approve TAG#24395.  Please copy this tag and submit it as a real-time schedule on the 11th.  Sorry for the inconvenience I received ZERO cooperation from the control areas.   Please check out with each control area when submitting the new tag.  Per Mary at WACM, I could not tag this schedule day ahead.  

Thanks,

We had problems getting the tag approved.  This is a good path and should flow.  Both the generating and load control areas have a copy of this tag and have agreed to implement this schedule real-time even if the tag is denied.  I spoke with Brandi at WACM (970) 461-7277 and Theresa at WALC (602) 352-2552.  

If there are any issues regarding how the load PSE should be represented on the tag, John Dake at WALC said the CRSPM1 was the appropriate PSE for these tags and there is no reason the schedule should be denied.   

You can reach me on my cell at 807-7861 if you have any additional questions.  "

We are 7 MW long all hours at Montana System,  which is our buy from MPC, deal number 615780.1

The upstream is PSEI-DUKE-WWP-MPCO.

We put in a false schedule to Smurfit to get flat preschedule, and that tag is 23795.

When we get close to HE 0100 on Monday, that Tag needs to go away, and the energy needs to be sold.

Please don't say it was a false preschedule, just say that it was 'unexpectedly ramped down' or something.

Enpower accurately reflects the length at Montana System

This sheet is as complete as possible, and I am worried about it due to the following circumstances;

1.  The Dispatch sheet that comes to Real time was 25 MW flat on Sunday and LLH on Monday more than all the preschedules that were tagged today.

2.  The Four Corners values on that dispatch sheet changed between 5:15 and 5:42, from 10 mw long to flat. I tried to resolve the four corners schedules with PSCO, who  
told me they did not have a purchase from EPE in July.  I tried calling numerous people at their office and cell phone numbers and got forwarded to Enron each time. Lisa had a buy resale with PNM at four corners, but that booked out and did not seem to match the 10 long that I saw in the dispatch sheet.  I spoke with Pete, who assured me that the sale to PSCO was good for the summer.  

3.  I still was unable to resolve the 25 mw difference between the tags and schedules that we knew, and what the dispatch sheet said we should have for preschedule.  No EPE representative was available to tell me what they were expecting for the schedules, and I was referred by a Dispatch person to call on Saturday and speak to Carlos when he came in at 4 pm.  I was very uncomfortable doing this, and so in my desperation called Roger at home, who after some discussion with Steve at his home confirmed that the extrat 25 flat Sunday and LLH Monday was a deal that is supposed to begin on July 3.  I trust his assesment, and have removed the extra schedule from the sheet.



Between all of the preschedulers today at Enron, we have spent over 6 hours dealing with the EPE schedules today.  

The sheet is as complete as I possibly can find justification for.

Preschedule had a heck-u-va day on Friday.  Due to many problems, some of our tags were not completed until after the 3pm preschedule deadline.  Apparently, some of our counterparties automatically deny late tags, though they may be corrections of tags made prior to the deadline.  In any case, we have a list of tags that have been submitted as real-time tags and the schedules should be treated such.  The tags and paths are as follows:

Subject:	MEAD real time schedules

Cara.

I'm going home for the weekend and I thought I would let you know the
procedure to follow to get your schedules at MEAD scheduled real time.

These are the schedules that are in as a preschedule:
	TAG   0025726
	TAG   0025777
	MSCGO1 TAG MSCI113

The left over mw's, after these tags,  will all have to be submitted as a
realtime tag NO EARLIER THAN 4 HOURS BEFORE THE SCHEDULE RUNS.

You will have to call PSCO marketing realtime desk to tell them what you new
tags will be  303-308-6175.  They have a heads up from me as to what you
will call about.  If you do not call,  THEY WILL NOT PUT THE SCHEDULE IN, WE
WILL NOT GENERATE.

I understand EPMI's problem today.  I've been there when I worked for MIECO.
Our control area that we turn all our schedules into are kind of hard to
work with sometimes.  It is up to them weather or not a schedule gets put in
as a preschedule.  Before they go home every night, they must check out
preschedules with their adjacent control areas.  Since they work on an
hourly basis, and don't get bonuses,  they are not always willing to stick
around and wait on late tags.  Between 3:00pm and 4:00pm MDT, they take the
tags they have and start to check out with them.  Everything else must be
put in real time.  This sometimes makes our jobs harder but there is nothing
I can do about it.  I hope everything else goes well and these schedules get
put in.

There is a 25 mw heavy load schedule that BPA is generating (contract# 23299) and PGE sinks at system.   The schedule is going real-time because BPA transmission group did not build the proper account for this path.  We bought from BPA Deal # 308337.1 and sold to EPME Deal # 489735.1.  Please refer to EPME tag number #10416.  I spoke with Matt at BPA Power side who agreed this was a good schedule.  Be sure to call everyone in the path to check out.

Leaf,

Lisa Gang wanted me to tell the night shift that tag # 25883 is not a good tag.  We tried to cancel it but for some reason WALC denied our cancel request.  Cara already spoke to Leon @ PAC regarding this issue.  The reason this tag is not a good tag is the tranny request was duplicated in another tag (25825) which is a good tag.  If you have any questions please call Cara on her cell phone.

To Whom it may concern:

Tag 23841 was cut by 50 MW for HE 01 and HE 02.  Wally @ NEVP said he heard=
 of the cut @ 23:30 on 06/27/01 but he neglected to call us and tell us abo=
ut the cut.  The reason for the cut was PAC non-firm tranny being cut that =
PSCO bought.  However they sold us a firm product.  PNM didn't know about t=
he cut either until their reliability person told them they were pushing po=
wer on the grid (Approx. time of notification 01:20).  We booked out with P=
SCO and PNM for HE 01 and HE 02 on the 4C345 part of the transaction (deals=
 666385 and 666387).  For HE 03 25 MW was cut and we booked out with PSCO a=
nd PNM on the 4C345 piece of the transaction (deals 666385 and 666387).  PS=
CO resupplied the power for HE 03 from SRP @ Mead 230.   The same thing hap=
pened for HE 06 as HE 03.  SRP resupplied  the power for HE 06.  I bought b=
ack for HE 06 from PSCO @ 4C345 and resold the power to SRP.  The deals are=
 in the RT Inc. sheet for the 28th of June.  After the fact, I spoke with R=
yan @ PSCO and he agreed to be billed liquidated damages for HE 01 and HE 0=
2 on the MEAD 230 part of the transaction (06:00 on Kate Symes Phone).

Tag number 25430 was cut for HE 19 by 3 MW.  This was a buy from LV Cogen and a sell to SRP.  I resupplied the power from EPEC in the hour from El Paso Electric for $50 and gave it to SRP @ Palo Verde.  I spoke to Mike @ SRP for this deal and he agreed. In enpower I have made deals for a buy from EPE and a sell to LV Cogen under the ST West Services Book.  The deals are 666355 and 66356.

If you have any question please give me a call on the West short term services desk.

As the southwest heats up, or the ISO goes into stages of emergency, or path 15 is congested north to south we will want to get power from the northwest utilities down to APS and so on in the southwest.  We can do this many ways but one that I have discovered that may have much capacity is as follows.

1.  NW Utility to PAC on BPA(T)
2.  PACW to IPC(T)@Enterprise(ENPR) on PAC(T)
3.  IPC@ENPR to PAC(T)@Borah Brady(BOBR) on IPC(T)
4.  IPC@BOBR to Four Corners(FC3) on PAC(T)
5.  Sink with anyone at four corners or buy tranny over to palo or mead.

I'm not sure how long there is going to be room but for monday there is 400mw of room on this path.


Enjoy,

Slinger"

We have 10 MW of length from Sierra through the APX light load at $185.  Stan purchased this NP15 length from the APX and it should be scheduled DA by Jeremy.  There should be a ECTRT load zone in PGE3 with this length.  Use whatever opportunities are out there (dynegy across COB or a straight export) to maximize this position.  The deal numbers are: 581335-purchase from APX and 581356-desk to desk deal.  Please make sure this gets taken care of.

Hey Guys. 

I had a long talk with NCPA today and set up so that we again can do the ZP26/NP15 Buy-Resale on a Realtime basis. We are not doing a profit split this time, we are paying them $25/MW instead. This basically enables us to shift 21MW across PATH15 and not be subject to Congestion as NCPA has Grandfather Rights across the path. This is a sweet strategy when the SP15/NP15 spread is there and PATH15 is congested. NCPA's capacity is 21MW, but I would not recommend doing more than 20MW. There are others who know about this opportunity but are not currently using it (WESCO especially). So by doing only  20MW we do not remind them of NCPA. 

The way this works is that we call NCPA and ask their capacity across PATH15. And tell them you want to schedule the BR through whatever hour. 

IN CAPS:
We sell to NCPA in ZP26.  
We buy from NCPA in NP15.

We can buy SP15 to fill our ZP26 sale (we just shift the load from SP15 to ZP26, so enter a EPMI CALPOOL).
PG&E is NCPA's SC, so if you are not passing Phase two give them a call.



NCPA's tel#: (916) 786-3520
PG&E tel# : (415) 973-1969

If you guys have any questions  just ask me.

Geir "

When the Import is labeled as ""EPMI_CISO_**"" and the Export as ""CISO_EPMI_**,"" the ISO views these as unique imports and exports.  They will not be linked together for a wheel, thus causing ancillary services charges to occur.  

Thank you!"

Hey Guys. 

We have a new way to export from NP15 up to the Northwest. Cascade is a tie between CISO and PAC SYSTEM on the California Oregon border. There is currently 30MW Non-Firm Hourly transmission available on the tie.

The capacity constraint is on the PacifiCorp side of the tie,  and you can find the real number available on the PAC oasis site. Check under TRANSMISSION REQUESTS/ Offerings. The path name you need to check is W/PPW/CRAG-PACW//. Make sure you pick Hourly non-firm. 

On the CISO side the tie point is called CASCAD_1_CRAGVW by the CISO. 


Procedure:
Export at Cascade from the CISO. 
Buy PAC Transmission from CRAG to BPAT or whoever is picking it up from Pac System. 

Transmission costthrough PAC is only $5.84.

I know the NP15/MIDC spread is not as large as we have seen it in the past. It does on the other hand give us another option.

Geir

Hey Guys. 

We have a new strategy taking power from the south to the north. Right now Sierra Pacific will only let us schedule 12MW on the tie so do not try to schedule any more (The tie is only good for 17MW).

- Either do a export from SP15 to Silverpeak or put in a wheel going out at Silverpeak(From PV or FC).
- Buy transmission from SPP from  (www.swoasis.com ) CONTROL TO HILLTOP. ($6.90 on-peak, $3.90 off-peak)
- Buy transmission from PAC from MAL2 TO MAL5. ($5.84)
- Buy transmission from BPA from HILLTOP TO SNOHO or another Sink. (Account numbers below).

We need to bounce this of SNOHO before we send it back in at Malin. 

THIS SCHEDULE NEEDS TO BE TAGGED OR SIERRA PACIFIC GETS VERY PISSED OFF, THEY ARE NOT USED TO DOING TO MUCH REAL TIME. THERE IS A TEMPLATE FOR THIS SCHEDULE SO IT SHOULD NOT BE HARD. Call and confirm the request with both PAC and Sierra.



Also do not sell to a marketer(especially POWEREX) without sleeving. We do not want anybody else to know about the path. If Powerex sees this I guarantee that they would try to schedule this and we do not want competition. Right now the only person using the tie is SOCAL EDISON and they are flowing 12MW into Cali, going the opposite way of us way.  

It is available 24hrs a day so lets take advantage of it as much as we can.
If you have any questions over the weekend call me.

Account numbers:
SPP - PAC: 853724
SPP-SNOHO: 853703
SPP-PUGET: 853725

Bill:

Please note the following due to the past two days schedules have been wrong in the EPE Schedules in Excel:

Tag number 6181 has been cancelled (50mw to the CISO).

Lending is wrong in the EPE schedules (it is 75mw from PSCO instead of 50mw).

SPS is wrong for HE 08 (it is 130mw instead of 100mw).

I thought you might like to since this is the only income we have currently for real-time and a major screw-up could hurt our relationship.

Regards,

Bert Meyers"

Bill, 

There's going to be a NERC E-Tag survey on Saturday 17th for HE 1400 PST.  CA's will be reporting who is and who isn't in compliance.  I received a call today to remind us of this from PGE transmission.  Apparently, they have been noting, as practice who's in compliance and who isn't, and I guess our stats aren't looking good.  We just need to make sure we submit tags for every transaction whether is on time or late.

ST-WBOM is importing 20 mws for HE 2 and 3, and 10 mws for HE 4 and 5 at MEAD 230. I have made the Enpower deals (868223, 868224, 868234) to buy from PinWest and sell to the imbalance in SP-15. I have entered the schedule in CAPS and it should be good to go.

ST-WBOM also purchased 10 mws from Redding in NP-15 for HE 7-22 at $25. Chris Mallory brokered this deal.

Group,

We have returned to CAPS as of today. We will return to running the Enpower to CAPS report as usual. This will give us a chance to work the performance bugs out of FSP and improve our reconciliation methodology at the same time.

Kysa,

This is the methodology on the hourly index.  Please forward on to Bill and
have him look at it for his comments.  The methodology will be the same for
all the other indexes.  We would ideally like to launch this index by mid

All,
	Attached are two PDF files, one detailing why the CAISO is going to start assessing Grid Management charges to A/S self-provision, and one detailing the budget breakdown for 2002.  The good news is that their proposal to FERC is not as bad as the first one presented at the last Market Issues Forum, but the increases are still steep.  Page 10 of the budget attachment has a graph detailing the old and new rates.  All that is left is for FERC to approve it.  The proposed new rates for 2002 will be as follows: 

CC	Old Rate:	New Rate:	Percentage Increase:	
				
521	0.406	0.575	42.00%	
522	0.223	0.368	65.00%	
523	0.951	0.957	1.00%	


Please see the attached files for further details.  Let me know if you have any questions.

-Kit Blair

Here you go.....
A fruit is the matured ovary of a flower, containing the seed. After fertilization takes place and the embryo (plantlet) has begun to develop, the surrounding ovule becomes the fruit. Yum. I won't go on about the four types of fruit--simple, aggregate, multiple and accessory--which explain things like berries and pineapples.

A vegetable is considered to be edible roots, tubers, stems, leaves, fruits, seeds, flower clusters, and other softer plant parts. In common usage, however, there is no exact distinction between a vegetable and a fruit. The usual example is the tomato, which is a fruit, but is eaten as a vegetable, as are cucumbers, peppers, melons, and squashes. The classification of plants as vegetables is largely determined by custom, culture, and usage. 

Okay, now the part which may surprise you. A grain is described as the dry fruit of a cereal grass, such as the ""seedlike fruits of the buckwheat and other plants, and the plants bearing such fruits."" So, grain is also a fruit.

Keoni,
I thought your email regarding the running of CONG with a heuristic rather than optimal solution may address and solve the problem. I have not yet been able to pull up ""corrected"" prices but hopefully they will now reflect our bids. The problems I referred to in my phone message last week were similar to what my original email detailed. Basically, we were awarded mw's on a congestion management schedule and the published prices did not match our bids. Will the change in running the ""solutions"" change this? Our volume management group will then be inputing our bid price rather than the published congestion management price--as those prices are not yet published correctly. 

I will be in the office this week and can be reached at your convenience.

Thanks,
Bill

Murray,

Thank you for your interest in our group. I will certainly keep you informed of our next available opening. We will likely have some openings in February (it always seems to happen around that time). As you might assume, we are interested in hiring the best person for the job, if you were that person, then we would do our best to facilitate your move. 

Again, thank you for your interest, and if you have further questions just give me a call.

Bill

Hi Bill,

I wanted to let you know that I had a talk with John Zufferli and he is alright with me transferring to your office subject to you hiring me.

I really am excited about this possibility!  As I said on the phone on Wednesday, I would love to come and work for you in Portland.  When I saw the advertisement for the Real Time Specialist on the Enron website I had to call you to see if the position was still available.  Unfortunately it wasn't.

I learned so much when I came down in June to watch your traders.  I speak with them all a lot on the phone and I am continually striving to learn more about the power business south of the border.  In fact, now that there's potential to come work for you, I'm going to work even harder to learn more about west power trading.

Please keep me in mind when the next available real-time position comes up.  I would be happy to come work for you as early as the beginning of the new year.  Do you know when you will be in the market for another trader?  And more importantly, would you be willing to hire a Canadian?  I don't suppose there would be a problem getting a green card considering I would just be transfering offices for the same company.

Please let me know what you think.

Thanks a lot Bill, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Murray     "

Diane -

I'd like to clarify the type of information Real Time needs in order to fulfill positions for the short term desks. 	As we're all sadly aware, PGE has become increasingly frustrated with our confusion regarding delivery points when we do lending and parking deals with them, so it is imperative that any information included in an e-mail to Real Time corroborates with data entered into Enpower. Following are the discrepancies I see between Enpower and the information given to Real Time:
 
1. On Sunday, according to Enpower, STNW is long on peak @ PGE System. The deal number that would be relevant to Real Time in this case would be the purchase (855033, not 855032). That way we can link our real time sales to the day-ahead purchase in Deal Scheduling. Also, Diana confirmed that this length should be sold off @ Mid-Columbia, not PGE System, which is not what is shown in Enpower. 

2. On Monday, according to Enpower, STNW is short 53 mw on peak @ Mid-Columbia. The relevant deal number here would be 855044 - again, we only need to know the deal number that corresponds with your position. Also, since anything that alludes to the wrong hours, delivery point, or deal number only serves to confuse the traders on shift, I was thinking it might work better if we sat down and went over these positions together before sending anything out to the group. (This is what I do with Holden when STSW does lending or parking deals.)

Please let me know if you have any questions about this, or any suggestions about how to make this work more smoothly.

Thanks,
Kate

Bill -

It has come to my attention that several members of the Real Time group would prefer an outing that involves running, hiding, and shooting balls of paint at each other instead of engaging in polite conversation while cordially sipping cocktails at McMenamin's Edgefield. They do not want time to get to know each other in a civilized setting outside of work. They want to beat the living crap out of each other. I am merely letting you know so I can win a bet for $7,000.

Bill -

Would you like me to work with Cara on this? I know you initially asked Mark Guzman to test it, but it appears she may be looking for some kind of feedback soon. Like I said, I tried getting into it today to go through the format, but was unable to. So my question is - where is this on our priority list?

Good Afternoon,

I was able to import all of the Palo Verde Heavy Load schedules into Path Confrimation!  

The sorting and Pathing looks right.  After routing the screen froze completely, but routing was done. I had to end task to get out of the PSW, and we will look at why this error occurred.


With Real time Approval,  If this month goes well for me at PV we will attempt to put everyone on the system starting December 1.  If I do not hear anything from real time, I will assume passive approval has taken place.

There are still some issues with running the build route report, but they are being worked on now.  

I am routing day-ahead to test, but am wanting direction from real time as to whether to route ahead or after the day. Right now the only deals un-routed on PV Heavy are the Parking Deals from PNM and EPE


Thanks,

Cara"

Subject:  HE 19 purchase from SRP


To whom it concerns,

I had a discrepancy with SRP for a purchase in the hour for HE 19.  I
spoke to SRP at 4:55 and again at approximately 5:02 about purchasing
energy for HE 19.  HE 20 was not part of the discussion.  I spoke to
them about the hour we were ramping into and the hour we were in each
time I spoke with them.  I decided to leave the 25mw purchase in and
review the tapes.  I have made a note of this on the model for 10/28/01.
Sorry for the inconvenience.


Thanks,
Darin L. Presto

If you would like to add EES Hourly data into your daily mail-out - and feel comfortable that EES won't bombard you with silly questions at the end of the month - then go ahead and send this to them as well. Let me know if that works for you, or if you have any questions.

I have received documents from Settlements indicating the annuities per your 10/10 email (as attached below) have been captured as upcoming prior month adjustments (i.e. pmas).  These are the pmas associated with El Paso clean up for Feb, March, and June 2000 ONLY.   The annuities you entered for Sep and Nov 2000 shall come later but possibly after this month-end (10/31).

The total impact of Feb, March, and June 2000 annuities will be +$108,388.02.  Although they will come through on regular desk analysis for 11/30, since I have received documents from Settlements indicating this $108,388.02 have been captured successfuly, if you like we can take it early, which means taking it on 10/31.  Let me know if you have a preference.

Also, at this moment I am working on all other pma items which you shall expect to go into your P&L this month-end.  As soon as I have them ready I'll send you the details for review.

Subject:	RE: El Paso Annuities - Year 2000

Kate and Bill:

I have received documents from Settlements indicating the annuities per your 10/10 email (as attached below) have been captured as upcoming prior month adjustments (i.e. pmas).  These are the pmas associated with El Paso clean up for Feb, March, and June 2000 ONLY.   The annuities you entered for Sep and Nov 2000 shall come later but possibly after this month-end (10/31).

The total impact of Feb, March, and June 2000 annuities will be +$108,388.02.  Although they will come through on regular desk analysis for 11/30, since I have received documents from Settlements indicating this $108,388.02 have been captured successfuly, if you like we can take it early, which means taking it on 10/31.  Let me know if you have a preference.

Also, at this moment I am working on all other pma items which you shall expect to go into your P&L this month-end.  As soon as I have them ready I'll send you the details for review.

-Fran

A quick reminder.
All El Paso Electric Deals and related deals for El Paso Electric (ie buying from SRP selling to EPE--anything with a group of EPEC in Enpower) need to be in MST. These deals should be scheduled in MST on the deal scheduling portion of Enpower as well.

Dear Mr. Williams:

I am contacting you at the suggestion of Hollie Krebs.  I would like to arrange a brief meeting in which I could obtain your expert advice and insight on your company and the industry in which you operate.

I am in the networking phase of searching for a new career opportunity.  Hollie and I discussed some aspects of her career as a marketer of utilities.  She mentioned that, with my background, your industry would be excellent to evaluate.  Hollie spoke very highly of you and your company.  She thought that I would learn a great deal from your expertise.

Please understand that I am not expecting you to know of a job opening nor am I asking you to help me find one.  I believe your guidance will help me to further develop my career strategy.  I am enclosing my resume for you to critique. Please be candid with any advice and/or ideas that you may have.

During the last eleven years, I worked as General Manager of Sunset Office Outfitters and Office Manager of Chemcentral Corporation-Portland.  The president of Sunset recruited me to help turn around his business. My primary responsibilities at Sunset Office were to correct serious personnel and financial problems, create policies and procedures to allow the company to refocus on marketing.  Chemcentral is a large, international chemical distributor.  My duties as Office Manager were to generate and analyze financial statements, manage personnel issues, create and monitor company policies and procedures.  Both companies provided great learning experiences for me.  My combined administrative and sales experience should prove very beneficial in my next position.

I realize your time is very valuable.  You mentioned that you will call me today around 3:00 p.m.  I would like to arrange a brief appointment at a time that is convenient for you.  My questions deal primarily with your education, career path and your opinion on what career(s) I should be pursuing.  I will talk to you soon and thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Ken McClintock"

Bobette from Powerdex will want to speak to you regarding timelines, templates, etc. to set up an hourly index to be published the next day. I gave her your name because of your past experience in deal control. She will likely be calling around 9:30 or 9:45.

Subject: Bill, it's Bobette, with the hourly index template


 
It's attached, and I appreciate your feedback (particularly re: a doable filing time for your shop). Included is COB, even though I'm not sure there's enough liquidity to support it. Time will tell. Thanks for the comments on Mid-C; I'll carry on with that as a point, although I'll probably have to define it (perhaps list the buses?) to calm players' concerns.
 
This template is for participants, whom will be kept confidential at all times. I will use purchases and sales, but won't reveal which is which or the identity or positions of any participants. For this index to have any value, accurate numbers must be provided. I assure you, I will respect confidentiality--those who don't, don't deserve to stay in business.
 
I will send you confidentiality agreements and the index methodology for your records, if you like, but first, there will be a beta-testing period during which the methodology may be tweaked. (For example, players may decide they would like to see bal-day deals included within the indexes. We did not include them in the indexes I developed for the Eastern Interconnect, however.)
 
Powerdex has been set up for the purpose of doing these hourly indexes, and integrity is key here. It is my intention for it to be a useful, accurate, comprehensive and independent service. Please let me know what you require from me. It's always a pleasure talking with you.

Kate and Bill:

I have received documents from Settlements indicating the annuities per your 10/10 email (as attached below) have been captured as upcoming prior month adjustments (i.e. pmas).  These are the pmas associated with El Paso clean up for Feb, March, and June 2000 ONLY.   The annuities you entered for Sep and Nov 2000 shall come later but possibly after this month-end (10/31).

The total impact of Feb, March, and June 2000 annuities will be +$108,388.02.  Although they will come through on regular desk analysis for 11/30, since I have received documents from Settlements indicating this $108,388.02 have been captured successfuly, if you like we can take it early, which means taking it on 10/31.  Let me know if you have a preference.

Also, at this moment I am working on all other pma items which you shall expect to go into your P&L this month-end.  As soon as I have them ready I'll send you the details for review.

As most of you are aware we changed time zones on Sunday. We are back in Pacific Standard Time. As such, we are once again in a different time zone than some of our counterparties. Please specify Pacific time zone in your summary of your deal at the end of each phone call--translate the deal to Mountain time only if necessary. We must be very clear on this going forward or disputes will be numerous and we will not be able to resolve them. See me if you have any questions regarding this expectation.

We are still short 50 mws in ST-WBOM on peak Friday and Saturday at $27.60.

For Friday only (as of right now) I have picked up 10 mws of energy flat (24hr schedule). I bought this energy from the APX-deal #840719 at $25. We will be long 10 mws each hour in position manager in SP-15 as a result. Please sell this energy in the off-peak (on-peak will go to fill our W-BOM short). I have scheduled an HA 24 purchase from the APX 1 and have put the energy into the ST-WBOM load zone. 

Do call with questions.

Alan,

I have a few questions regarding the emminent implementation of the new target pricing mechanism.
1. Does uninstructed energy still get paid (if not, we cannot hedge financials)
2. The CISO Table 1. lists an unintended consequence as "" Target price may be manipulated due to no obligation to deliver""
	Why is there no obligation to deliver?
3. Is there still a load deviation penalty? Or would that be considered seperately?

Thanks for the help.

Bill

All:

Note that the plan to clear overlapping incs and decs is NOT the immediate change.  In the short run, CAISO will imput supplemental bids at cost based on heat rates, gas prices, etc. (Read the bottom half of this first).

I am attaching an other CAISO document on this topic.

If you want a briefing on these changes, please let me know.

Other than the imposition of penalties, I think we are generally supportive of the L-T fix, which will be made via a tariff change (i.e., we will have an opportunity to comment).

Subject: CAISO Notice - Implementation of Revised Target Price
Methodology


MARKET NOTICE
October 24, 2001
Implementation of Revised Target Price Methodology
ISO Market Participants:
SC Settlements Contacts:
Effective Monday, October 29, 2001 the California Independent System
Operator Corporation (""ISO"")  will revise its methodology for calculating
the Target Price (""TP""). Provided below is a background on TP, a brief
description of the ISO's current thinking about a long-range solution and
potential implementation schedule, and the ISO's current short-range TP
methodology to be implemented on October 29, 2001.   
Background
The ISO operates a Real-Time Market for Imbalance Energy (""IE"")  based on
bids submitted by Market Participants seeking to sell incremental and/or
decremental Imbalance Energy.  In many cases, bids have a ""price overlap,""
which occurs when some Scheduling Coordinators (""SCs"") are willing to buy
real-time energy (i.e., they have submitted decremental IE bids to reduce
their generator output) at prices higher than the prices at which other SCs
are willing to sell real-time energy (i.e., they have submitted incremental
IE bids to increase their generator output).  
In March 1998, the ISO instituted the TP to eliminate the price overlap
described above. The TP is a calculated price between the highest
decremental bid and the lowest incremental bid.  All incremental bids above
the TP are adjusted down to the TP and all decremental bids below the TP are
adjusted up to it.
Though designed to resolve the price overlap, there are certain difficulties
with the TP as it was implemented.  The major problem was that the ISO
cannot ""clear the overlap,"" i.e., accept all overlapping bids and require
the bidders to actually buy and sell at these prices.  SCs can, and do, use
the inability of the ISO to clear the price overlap to manipulate the TP by
submitting unrealistically high offers to buy and unrealistically low offers
to sell, knowing that the ISO can not require the bidders to fulfill their
bids. 
In April 2000, the ISO sought to eliminate this gaming opportunity by
changing the formula f74or calculating the TP.  As a result, there were many
hours when the TP -- and the published price for Real Time Energy
transactions - was zero.  Thus, while the revised methodology reduced gaming
opportunities, it also produced unrealistic real-time prices that distorted
incentives for SCs to bid into the ISO's Real-Time Market.
Long-Range Solution
After extensive internal review and discussion with Stakeholders, the ISO
has concluded that the best solution is to accept overlapping bids, thus
entirely eliminating the need for the TP.  At its September 20, 2001
meeting, the ISO Governing Board approved this concept.  This long-range
solution will require an ISO Tariff and certain computer software changes
and will not be implemented until approximately Summer, 2002.   Detailed
below is the ISO's interim, short-term TP methodology that will become
effective three business days after this Market Notice, on October 29, 2001.
Short-Range Solution
Also described in the ISO staff memorandum presented at the September 20,
2001 ISO Governing Board meeting and as discussed at the October 3, 2001 and
11, 2001 Market Issues Forum meetings, the ISO will implement an interim
solution to address some of the difficulties with the current methodology
until the ISO can implement the longer-range solution.  Thus, by this Market
Notice, Market Participants are noticed that the ISO will implement the TP
methodology described herein effective Monday, October 29.  
The revised methodology is similar to the original TP methodology, but
features several important enhancements to limit gaming opportunities by
incorporation of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (""FERC"") orders for
price mitigation, limiting the ability of Participating Generators and
Participating Loads to set the TP, and permitting only feasible bids to be
eligible to set the TP.  
Under the original TP methodology, as established in March 1998, a TP
replaced all bid prices within the incremental - decremental price overlap.
The TP was calculated as the market-clearing price (""MCP"") that would result
if the overlapping incremental and decremental bids were matched with one
another and Dispatched in merit order through BEEP.  Graphically, this
Target Price can be calculated as the intersection between the incremental
supply curve and the mirror image of the decremental supply curve over the
price axis, as shown in Figure 1. 

 <<...OLE_Obj...>> 
Figure 1. Price overlap elimination by Target Price

The interim, or short-range, TP methodology differs from the original TP
methodology in the following ways: 
*	Only bids from Generating Units under Participating Generator
Agreements (""PGA"") or Loads with Participating Load Agreements (""PLA"") will
be eligible to set the TP.  This restriction is needed to ensure compliance
with FERC requirements that only participating resources are eligible to set
the MCP.  When the ISO does not Dispatch Imbalance Energy, the TP will
become the MCP.  Thus, only Generators with PGAs and Loads under PLAs will
be eligible to set the TP.  For this reason, inter-tie transactions will not
be eligible to set the TP.
*	Only capacity that can be Dispatched within 10 minutes will be
eligible to set the TP.  This requirement ensures that the TP can only be
set by Generating Units that actually can be Dispatched to meet California's
Load.  This capacity will be based on the total of all Energy and Capacity
products and services bids submitted by each Generating Unit.    For
example, a Generating Unit with a 1MW/minute ramp rate can only increase or
decrease its output by 10 MW within a 10-minute interval, regardless of the
combination of Ancillary Services capacity and Supplemental Energy bids it
has submitted  Thus, its qualifying capacity would be 10 MW.  Priority in
allocating bids to the qualifying capacity will be based first on lowest bid
price, and then on increasing qualities of service.  Although only
qualifying capacity will be considered in the TP calculation, all bids
within the price overlap will be adjusted to the resulting TP.
*	As a final adjustment, the TP will not be higher than the lowest
available gas-fired resource proxy price, as calculated for the
corresponding hour, unless such a proxy price is below the bottom of the
price overlap.  In any such case, the TP will be set to the lowest
incremental Energy bid. The Target Price will also not exceed the applicable
Price Cap.  This provision will ensure that bids dispatched under the TP
will conform to the FERC's requirements on market mitigation pricing.
The short-term TP methodology will use the following equation:
	TP? = max{0, min{TP, LPP, PRC }, LIP}	(1)
where:
TP?	is the adjusted Target Price;	
TP	is the Target Price that clears the price overlap;	
LPP	is the lowest proxy price (applicable to gas-fired resources)	
LIP	is the lowest incremental price.	
PRC	is the applicable Price Cap.

Good to hear you're a big believer in time off. How about a compromise? I'll wait until the middle of next month, and then I'd like to take off Nov. 12-16. That way, I'll be available to settle October, November, and hopefully many months to come. Sound good? Let me know. And I appreciate your understanding.

It is the end of the month and just like everyone else in your group you are needed to be at work at certain times. Granted, renewed motivation can be a great thing to help you attack various job functions with vigor, and I am a big believer in it. We have in the past discussed that I would prefer  that you take personal days/vacation days in the middle of the month and at the end of the week. If you would like to plan a longer vacation in advance, again like everyone else in your group, please just let me know.

I'm glad to know that I have only one purpose here. If that's the case, then maybe I should just start taking the other three weeks of the month off. And the purpose was NOT not to settle October - which is of course something I await with bated breath. The purpose was to relieve some of the pressure I'm starting to feel and ideally return with renewed motivation to do my job well. While I realize this should be something I do all the time, without occasional days off for incentive, I think you can understand that sometimes it just doesn't work that way. I can hardly believe I'm so indispensible you couldn't survive two days without me with a week's notice. Come on....

If you are flexible, I would prefer if you took the 8th and 9th of November off. This would allow us to settle up PMA's at the end of October and make sure we are settled going into November.

We have in the past discussed that I would prefer  that you take personal days/vacation days in the middle of the month and at the end of the week. If you would like to plan a longer vacation in advance, again like everyone else in your group, please just let me know.
I appreciate your understanding.

I'm glad to know that I have only one purpose here. If that's the case, then maybe I should just start taking the other three weeks of the month off. And the purpose was NOT not to settle October - which is of course something I await with bated breath. The purpose was to relieve some of the pressure I'm starting to feel and ideally return with renewed motivation to do my job well. While I realize this should be something I do all the time, without occasional days off for incentive, I think you can understand that sometimes it just doesn't work that way. I can hardly believe I'm so indispensible you couldn't survive two days without me with a week's notice. Come on....

Kate,
If you are flexible, I would prefer if you took the 8th and 9th of November off. This would allow us to settle up PMA's at the end of October and make sure we are settled going into November. 

Let me know if this is what you would like to do.

Thanks,
Bill

All,
Please be advised that the SI Server Certificates on the primary SI site in
Folsom will expire in about a month.  We are planning to install ISO
issued/trusted Certificates on the Folsom SI servers as we have already done
on the Alhambra server several months ago. We presently use Verasign as the
Third Party Trust.  We would like input from you as to any known issues with
authentication at the Alhambra SI site and any impact you may have seen
after our implementation there.  Please provide feedback to me via e-mail
prior to this Wednesday's TSWG meeting and I will consolidate concerns so
that we may discuss these in that forum.

Bill Williams,
 
    As you know, the Dow Dawgs are an Investment Club at the University of Washington.  KC Anderson informed us of your interest in coming to one of our meetings.  My officers and I are happy to hear of your interest and would like to help you get the word out about Enron. 
    We were hoping you could make it to our next meeting Wednesday (10/24) 5-6pm.  We will, however, work with your schedule and move the meeting to a different day next week.  The sooner we hear back from you the sooner we can schedule a meeting room and advertise to students.  This would also be an excellent opportunity for you to highlight any career or internship opportunities at your company.

For those on night and day shift on Saturday/Sunday the emergency back-up generators will be tested. The testing will occur from 5 AM to 10 AM on Sunday morning. Dave Steiner has assured me that RT will be unaffected and Dave will be on hand to help if anything is needed. I think we should work to have everything submitted early to the CISO, tags made, etc. At least for HE 6, HE 7 and HE 8. This should give us some extra time if something goes wrong when they switch to the back-up power.

Subject:	CAISO OOM  Procedure

This is a procedure that we received from the CAISO via WPTF and Sue Mara.  It is a draft.

It fits with a more formal procedure posted last friday but shows some detail on what parties consuming R/T energy will be charged. Basically they will be charged a combiniation of the MCP and OOM costs.

Note that CERS pays OOM suppliers on a bilateral basis within 20-30 days.  Sounds like a good market to sell to while it lasts.

St-WBOM is long again for HE 2 through HE 5 at PV from PNM at a price of $15.50. We will be 20 mws long each hour for a day total of 80. Same deal # as yesterday--#826094. If you could adjust your sheets for tomorrow I would appreciate it.

Remember, we are also short 50 mws for Monday in SP-15 at $27.60

Here is some input from Tony at EPE regarding running their system. I think the EPE system was run very well on October 18th, but aside from that, this email shows how closely they are watching our performance and what they expect. Let's do our best to continue to provide them with good service.

Subject: DISPLACING GAS-FIRED GENERATION


 Bill,  thanks for the visit we enjoyed it.  It is always helpful to talk
face to face and have some frank discussion regarding   our current
business relationship.  Hopefully, we'll be able to reciprocate with a
visit in the near future.

On a different matter, I was going over some recent historical data and
have come across some instances where I believe we have room to displace
gas-fired generation with inexpensive purchased power.  In order to do
this, we need to tighten up our real-time operations.  By this, I mean to
start putting all our gas-fired generation down to their minimums and
replacing it with purchased power (this would apply to the early morning
hours only, since we have some take or pay gas we still have to burn some
base gas but this can be done during the day when prices are higher and our
loss will be less).

For example,  Thursday October 18, the unit commitment called for purchases
of around 330 MW during the early hours (see attached unit commitment for
amounts and times).  We only purchased 130 MW net during this time frame.
So we ended up generating around 200 mwh at around $44/mwh when purchase
power  was available for $19/mwh.  Furthermore, there was a sale for HE
06:00 to ENRON/CAISO for $22/mwh.  When we enter this sale into our costing
model, the sale will result in a loss of approximately $1,000 for EPE Power
Marketing since the model will use marginal cost (gas-fired generation) to
cost this sale.

Please look into this matter and  call me if you have any questions or wish
to discuss it further.

Group,

Our deal with EES has changed. As Ryan indicated in his email we are now charging $3 for EES up to 100 mws, above 100 mws to  200 mws we are charging $4, above 200 mws per hour we are charging $5.  However, when we have transacted with EES for a peaker product or day-ahead schedule we will not integrate our fee into their price for that quanity of mws. I will indicate in an email to you when this occurs. This is a bit complex but if you have questions just let me know.

Also, EnMax has recently been buying energy from us at the BC Border. This turned out to be a ""Canadian"" firm purchase on the part of Enmax. Please do not fill any sale to EnMax with MPC energy. We need to treat EnMax just like ECC. We should buy an option or a call and then exercise that option. MPC does not have this capability and should not be used in this manner.

Finally, the NW evening peak has arrived. The NW has been extremely tight through morning and evening peaks, often over $30 to pick up...

Any questions, just let me know.

Thanks, 
Bill"

Tim,

Probably 3 to 5 months ago David Poston demonstrated a new position manager=
 to work with both FSP and Enpower. David Poston showed the position manage=
r to me, Cara Semperger, and Phil Platter. Dave suggested that the new posi=
tion manager would replace the current stand-alone position managers in CAP=
S and Enpower. When Dave and I ran through the demonstration, I was told th=
at the East desk had driven most of the development work to date. The funct=
ionality of the position manager in the stage Dave presented to me seemed u=
seful, with little development needed for us to implement it. The position =
manager looked like it would offer several improvements over Real-Time's cu=
rrent position and report reconciliation methods. My impression of the appl=
ication was that it would be a portion of FSP when implemented and was not =
a stand alone application. Within a week after demostrating the new positio=
n manager, Dave relayed to me that production of the position manager would=
 be delayed until after FSP was in production. As a result of the FSP delay=
, I have heard nothing of the position manager and have had no input on it =
since that first meeting. I think this application (as I saw it last) has t=
he potential to improve our reports and reduce our time spent running them.=
 This application should be of benefit to preschedulers, risk and deal cont=
rol. Now that the position manager is back on the table, I would like the r=
eal-time group to be involved in the implementation of this portion of FSP =
and work to improve its ability to act as a report reconciliation tool.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Thanks,
Bill"

Kysers and Mary-

ST-WBOM is long at PV parking with PNM for HE 2 through HE 5, 20 mws each hour--for Friday and Saturday. The price of the power after the parking fee is $15.50. The deal number is 826094. This deal is just hanging out there under W-BOM and should make us 80 mws long at PV on Friday and Saturday. 

Also--we are still short the two BOM pieces in SP-15 for a total of 50 mws each hour on peak-Friday and Saturday- average price of $27.60. You would have the deal numbers on this one.

Keoni,
I am not concerned with the improperly posted ATC's. I am concerned that our bids to relieve congestion were awarded but that the respective dollar value for those bids was incorrect. We have had problems in the past with misentry of our congestion management bids. However, in this case, the awarded congestion management bids look correct to me, and it appears that the CAISO published price is not appropriate for the amount of mws flowed. I would like to figure this out as soon as possible so that we can fix any problems that might exist on our end.

Please give me a call when you have a chance.

Group,

Going forward we will be delivering parking or taking lending energy at one point per schedule with Portland General. We will either deliver or take energy from them at Portland General System. OR we will deliver or take energy from them at Mid-C. 

PGE real-time has had difficulty with scheduling the energy in real-time to or from a point other than originally prescheduled. Therefore ONLY schedule the energy to or from the originally prescheduled delivery point. In the case below we would deliver the energy to Portland General System--NOT the MID-C.

We should continue to be flexible at PGE's request. Please see me with any questions.

Thanks,
Bill

Group,

We are starting to see some market changes as we transition into the winter=
 months.

First:
With EPE we will start seeing a severe morning ramp. We will have to carefu=
lly manage the units to prevent ""swinging"" them and increasing the chance o=
f a unit outage. As the EPE loads plummet off-peak, we should consult the u=
nit commitment, and depending on market conditions look to take units off-l=
ine and/ or put units on manual and buy energy back. Recently we have sold =
energy from EPE at a loss rather than putting costly gas turbines on manual=
 (Newman 1, 2 and 3), reducing them, and buying that energy less expensivel=
y in the market. Our relationship with EPE is at a critical stage, they hav=
e a new vice-president and will be hiring new management to lead their mark=
eting group. We would like to be a part of EPE's marketing effort going for=
ward, but need to continue to prove that our level of service cannot be mat=
ched either in-house or by other marketers. I look to each member of the gr=
oup to be a part of this effort and to work closely to run the EPE grid as =
efficiently as possible.

Second:
The morning ramp will soon be upon us in the Northwest. It will become very=
 difficult to get energy in the Nortwest for HE 6 through HE 10. We should =
look for congestion possibly on the COI and the DC. Also, as lights and hea=
ters come on in the evening, there should be another jump in load at HE 18 =
through HE 20. Enron Calgary will also be looking for energy these hours. B=
e sure to take this load movement into consideration if you lock a price in=
 with ECC.

Finally:
We will have a meeting on TUESDAY--November 6th at 4:30 in the afternoon--(=
the first Tuesday as usual) to discuss market changes, peformance reviews a=
nd the final two months of the year.

Please see me with any questions regarding the system.

Thank you.

Bill

Steve,

Good afternoon, I have attached a draft of the Control Area Services Agreement to this email. Please take a look at it when you have a moment and let me know what you think about it. I understand we may not implement it for a while. However, I thought having an agreement in place might provide us with more flexibility and the ability to take advantage of opportunities as this month winds down. I appreciate your time and feedback.

Thank you,

Bill

In response to ""What up?:""

Everything has reached a new status quo. I live 
in Gig Harbor and attend class at UW Tacoma 
(UWT for short).  Class is great and their are 
plenty of beautiful lasses for viewing 
pleasure.  Hopefully I will be out of GH soon.  
I will start looking for jobs in Portland, 
Seattle, and SF (possibly) in Spring.  I have 
not been working on my tan.

I would really like to visit the city of Roses 
in the next few weekends.  What are your

Please write back soon.

It's attached, and I appreciate your feedback (particularly re: a doable filing time for your shop). Included is COB, even though I'm not sure there's enough liquidity to support it. Time will tell. Thanks for the comments on Mid-C; I'll carry on with that as a point, although I'll probably have to define it (perhaps list the buses?) to calm players' concerns.
 
This template is for participants, whom will be kept confidential at all times. I will use purchases and sales, but won't reveal which is which or the identity or positions of any participants. For this index to have any value, accurate numbers must be provided. I assure you, I will respect confidentiality--those who don't, don't deserve to stay in business.
 
I will send you confidentiality agreements and the index methodology for your records, if you like, but first, there will be a beta-testing period during which the methodology may be tweaked. (For example, players may decide they would like to see bal-day deals included within the indexes. We did not include them in the indexes I developed for the Eastern Interconnect, however.)
 
Powerdex has been set up for the purpose of doing these hourly indexes, and integrity is key here. It is my intention for it to be a useful, accurate, comprehensive and independent service. Please let me know what you require from me. It's always a pleasure talking with you.

John,
 
Goodness! Great questions!..I could answer some in 5 minutes but others would be a 2 hour discourse. First, I did get both your resume and letter and have taken it to our Human Resources department. I currently have 11 people on rotation(shift work), and 10 is the appropriate number for me to have on shift. One of my employees is interviewing for another opening on the floor on Friday and two others are looking to move. Julie Kearney (in our human resources department) will be gone today through Wednesday of next week. So by Thursday of next week we should be able to set up an interview schedule and go from there. 
 
I have answered a few of your questions in your email below. We can go over the others when we speak next. Thanks for the good questions.
 
Bill

Hi Bill - 
I read through the stuff you gave me and I do have a few questions... First, did you get my resume and letter, and did they download OK?  I am looking forward to the interview and, assuming I do well, am anxious to get started.  So let me know about a timeline when you can, please. 

What kind of affect will a west-wide RTO have on Enron?  I saw in a couple of the newsletters that FERC is pushing hard for it.  -A west wide RTO is very good for Enron as it would facilitate moving energy around the grid and contribute to marketing efficiency.

""Wood also proposes FERC initiate a rulemaking on market design and structure, to translate the eight RTO functions in Order No. 2000 into concrete protocols for the RTO organizations.""  Is there anywhere I can find out what the 8 RTO functions are?  You should be able to find more information regarding RTO's on the nerc and ferc websites (national energy reliability council and federal energy regulatory commision) 

A lot of information in the newsletters was about natural gas and the volatility in its cost.  Do you do any trading in gas?  We do not trade gas on real-time, but some of the forward traders pick up gas positions to hedge themselves against price volatility on the power side.
 
Canada -- New Alberta Power Plant.  Do you move any Canadian electricity?  We sell energy to Canadian entities frequently, though we do not schedule the energy into Canada. We deliver the energy to them at the BC-US border. 

The CPUC has suspended direct access switches.  What kind of impact does this have on trading?  How does California's Department of Water Resources and its liabilities fit into the mess in CA?  This requires a bit more of an explanation than I have a chance for here. 

Northwest utilities claimed they took an unwarranted $500 million beating in the 6 months of high spot prices.  A judge said they were ""just and fair.""  Will the denial of this claim affect the trading floor?  Yes, it means we do not have to spend months unwinding trades. In short, its good for Enron--and everyone else who bought and sold energy in the NW. 

Enron and PGE... There is a pending sale of PGE to NWN.  Will this have any effect on you?  To put it bluntly, will you still be able to hire from the outside?  Will the sale do anything to the $100 million line of credit that PGE obtained from Enron?   The sale to NW natural will not affect us other than driving up our stock price. 

How close are we to having BPA's transmission system under FERC jurisdiction?  What does Enron think of that, or do they care?
Dynegy, Exelon, Entergy, Cinergy -- who are these guys?    Dynegy and Exelon are power companies (like Enron)-Entergy and Cinergy are trading regions. And we would love to have BPA under FERC jurisdiction but it will likely not happen soon. 

""Exelon said ... it would reduce its ... 2001 estimates due to power market volatility and ... it would cut an (additional) 450 positions.""   Does Enron employment fluctuate with the market, or did Exelon just do a shitty job?  That would be the latter. 

SoCalEd owes Enron a bunch of money.  What happens if it goes bankrupt?  How does that affect Enron overall, and would it change the daily trading process?  -Bankruptcy of SCE would not affect our trading, but I am not aware of what our exposure to SCE is. I believe it is minimal on the trading desk. 

Tell me about Qualifying Facility (QF) suppliers. This will take a while.

How will ""green power"" enter into your mix?  It doesn't yet. ""Green power"" just makes Oregonians and those in Northern California feel good. 

""Cal-ISO's director of grid planning ... testified that the cost  (of 1500 MW of new capacity) is justified as a way to prevent power sellers' market power and to deal with drought conditions in the PNW and CA that limit hydroelectricity production.  Those two issues loomed large as contributing factors in CA's energy crisis...""  As California creates new capacity, will that impact the ability of traders to do what they do, or will they just have more power to deal with? A long or short market is just a part of trading. For example, the market is currently experiencing some unit outages and has exhibited some volatility as a result. There is still a ton of capacity and the market is not moving as drastically as it might have.

All for now.  Thanks for the information. The acronyms are incredible.  It was like these things were written in a foreign language.  Looking forward to hearing from you.   The acronyms are incredible, but they all make sense after a while. 

John

Keoni,

Here are the details on our sale to CERS for HE 14 at Palo Verde devers.
 
I spoke with Linus at CERS at approximately 11:50--At that time I sold him 90 mws at $29 delivered at PV for HE 14, I told him the energy was coming from the CAISO.

I then called Mike at SRP marketing after speaking with Linus. For HE 13 I had sold Mike 75 mws. I told him the schedule would be going to a zero for HE 14.

I called the CAISO to notify them my export EPMI_CISO_SALSA would be going to CERS at PV devers and not SRP.

I began speaking with Bhavin at the Palo Verde desk at 12:20 regarding scheduling of the energy to CERS at PV devers.

I told Bhavin the export -EPMI_CISO_SALSA- would be going to CERS and that it was effectively a net schedule(90 mws out at PV devers/90 mws in at PV devers).Bhavin asked that I call a counterparty with a control area interest at PV and show the schedule going to and coming from a control area.

I acknowledged this request and called El Paso Electric to attempt to show the schedule to them and from them. I was not comfortable with this step as I viewed it as unnecessary and told EPE I would call them back. I then called SRP transmission to discuss the schedule with them. At approximately 12:40 I discussed the 90 mw net schedule with SRP transmission. SRP control said a net schedule would show as zero.

I then spoke with EPE and told them to forget the schedule.

I called Bhavin back and told him SRP was aware of the schedule.
Bhavin told me that he would make a note of the schedule and show it as net scheduled.

At 13:02 Bhavin called me back and told me he was not checking out with SRP at PV devers.
I called SRP transmission and went over the schedule one more time. SRP transmission still showed the 75 mw schedule from HE 13. I told SRP transmission that the 75 mw schedule was no longer flowing to him. He told me he would call his marketer.

While transacting for HE 15, I again spoke with Mike at SRP marketing and Mike told me he had missed telling his transmission to pull out the 75 mw schedule.

I believe the original problem was the net scheduling and that it was compounded by miscommunication on SRP's end. It should be noted that Bhavin was polite and professional throughout my conversations with him. 


I think the ability to net schedule at tie points is important.  My feeling is that the CAISO schedulers should have the same scheduling capabilities at the tie points as those schedulers outside the CAISO. Please let me know what you find out regarding this practice. If you have any questions for me please let me know.

Thank you for your help.

Steph,
Great to hear from you. I got a call from Scotty this weekend but have not had a chance to give him a call back yet. Enron selling PGE has had no real effect on me. It should be good for our stock price though. One can hope anyway.
Glad to hear you guys are doing well. Let me know when you guys are coming down...you can definitely stay at my place--its not big but I will have a futon for a bit longer. You may prefer the Paramount hotel--its right next door.
And my liver will likely always be in shape.

Take care.

How is the swinging Portland ladies man?  Thought I would see how you are 
doing in light of Enron selling Portland General....are you still employeed? 
  I am sure you are since you have made them lots of money!  How is your 
place?  Any new girls?  I must say that I miss hanging out in Portland and 
causing trouble.  I am sure you have carried on the tradition.  Things in 
Seattle are good.  Scott is living on Eastlake and taking some computer 
classes.  Work for me is the same.  We will be coming to visit soon so start 
getting your liver in shape!  Hope you are well.

Finance is fine with the change order inclusive of Scott's comments.  Please send us an executed copy, as we are obligated to pass it on to the banks.  How will the payment of the additional $6,000 be handled?  Will the next progress payment (23.5% of purchase price, scheduled for Dec 1, 2001) be based on the new price + the ""catch-up amount"" ($2,850,560.30)?  Please let us know so E-Next can budget accordingly.  Thanks,

Subject: A/S inter-SC trade


Scenario 1
EPMI makes a forward deal with Duke to provide its ""obligation"" for A/S.
Essentially EPMI is trading off its ""obligation"" to Duke using inter-SC
template which references the SC (Duke) that is taking on the obligation.
No energy is scheduled by EPMI, just the indication that the obligation is
going to Duke.  The energy curve is scheduled by Duke only.  EPMI can not
schedule the energy. Duke is responsible for providing the energy and
receiving the payment or No Pay.  Although, Duke has various options as to
how they will take care of the traded obligation.  Suffice it to say EPMI
only has to trade their obligation and it is then Duke's obligation to deal
with as they choose.  If Duke chooses to let the ISO provide for that
obligation then there would not be any energy or No-Pay issues.

Scenario 2
EPMI has a resource within its portfolio that will self provide the
obligation for A/S.  EPMI puts in a schedule indicating which resource, the
capacity that will be self provided, and the energy that will be bid in.
EPMI recieves the payment for the energy and any No Pay charges.  


Hope this helps.

Could you meet with me regarding congestion revenue for 10/05?
We had two wheels that were not in the inc sheet but were awarded by the CAISO and are in finals in CAPS. The wheels were EPMI_CISO_GREEN for HE 17 and HE 18. We were awarded 38.96 mws for HE 17 and 31.92 mws for HE 18. Both wheels were awarded at $54.90.
We should receive revenue of $3891.31 from these wheels.
Please give me a shout with questions.
Thanks,

FYI -

I left a message with Rich Brueger @ MPC regarding power we resupplied at Montana System on 8/1, HE 13. I'm giving you the same information I left with him in case any questions arise in my absence. Fortunately, there is a detailed cut note in the Lotus database, so you can refer to that if I've missed the mark entirely. Out of Montana's 62 mw of choice customer load that hour, we resupplied 41 mw. Following is the breakdown of sink counterparties:

Luzenac America, Inc. - 5 mw
Smurfit-Stone Container Corp. - 25 mw
Express Pipeline Partnership - 6 mw
Cenex Harvest States Coop. - 5 mw

Deals entered real time to resupply are 714148 (Buy PGE @ Mid-C) and 714150 (BPA tranny Mid-C to Montana System).

Todd,
From an information standpoint this looks good. I would recommend using an appendix for the WSCC members, the FERC ruling, the NERC glossary and any other lengthy terms or charts. You might look to organize the paper from a broad overview of the electrical market in the west (including basic descriptions, timelines, fundamentals, etc.) down to a specific description of what you did at Enron. The content of the paper looks good and I am comfortable with you submitting what you have.
If you need any thing else regarding your paper just let me know.
 
Thanks,
Bill

<<...OLE_Obj...>> The Wholesale Power Marketing Group Invites You To Be Our Guest For The  2001 Fall Energy Fiesta! 

The Wholesale Power Marketing Group cordially extends this invitation to join us Wednesday evening, October 10th through noon Friday, October 12th as a guest at our annual 2001 Fall Energy Fiesta!   This is an occasion to meet all the members of our team, tour our trading floor, explore possible business opportunities and of course, enjoy Albuquerque's historic International Balloon Fiesta!   As our guest, we will provide, at no expense to you, the following:

        

<<...OLE_Obj...>> 
          
          -  Tickets to the Balloon Fiesta 

-  Balloon rides (weather permitting) 
- Ground transportation to and from the airport and throughout your stay 
-       Shared lodging in a Class A Recreational Vehicle on-site at the Fiesta 
-       Meals  
-       Day sight-seeing and shopping trips to Santa Fe or complimentary golf 
-       Fiesta memorabilia 

You will be responsible for your travel to and from Albuquerque. 
I have attached an RSVP form for you to fill out with certain information that is needed prior to your arrival.  Please fill it out and wither email it to me at sstephe@pnm.com < <mailto:sstephe@pnm.com>> or fax it to me at 505/855-6240.

Thanks. 

<<RSVP Form.doc>> 

And........If you decide to go, 

1.  Please email me, call me or fill out the attached form and fax it back to me with your travel information as soon as you know it, so we can arrange times to meet you at the airport. 

2.  In October, Albuquerque can be very cool.  Please bring a light jacket and/or sweater, and some warm clothes, as many of the events we will be hosting are outside.

3.  You will be lodging in a Class a RV on site at the Balloon Fiesta, with one of our other guests.  There will be 3 RV's that we have secured for our guests (6 guests in all), and these RV's will be parked in our own reserved area of the Balloon Fiesta.  This way, there will be no ""early rising"" to attend balloon events, as some of the start times for ascension events are 5:45AM - 7:00 AM!  And you will be in midst of all of the excitement.  These RV's are top of the line: roomy, comfortable, and well-stocked with all the necessities (snacks, drinks, toiletries, sheets, blankets, towels).

4.  All meals will be hosted by us, either at local restaurants or they will be professionally catered to our area. 

We will also host an outing to Santa Fe; sightseeing and museums, or you can play golf instead (please indicate in your reply if you will be renting clubs or bringing your own).    We would also like to treat you to a balloon ride (weather permitting) if you are so inclined.  Just please note it on the attached sheet.

And last but not least, we would like you to provide us with your sweatshirt size so we can send you home with an official Balloon Fiesta sweatshirt.

I have enclosed a schedule of events for you to know what will be happening here at the Balloon Fiesta while you are here.

<<wave 2 schedule of events.doc>> 

All of us at PNM's Wholesale Power Marketing are thrilled that you are coming!  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.

Bill,

I would like to sit down and discuss the $5.00/MW charge that is being associated to each EES transaction.  Since Tim Coffing is now up here and managing our intra-month portfolio, I feel the ability to manage a retail position is better than what it was and the volatility in the wholesale market has come off quite a bit.  I would like to discuss this further with you sometime today.

Let me know when you are free.

Thanks,
Jeff

Bob,

We would have the following hourly physical products out until 6 PM CST (4 PST) on Friday--HE 17 through HE 20 Palo Verde; HE 17 through HE 20 MID-C; HE 19 through HE 20 SP15; HE 19 through HE 20 NP15. We can then suspend or inactivate these products at 6 PM. All other physical products will have already been suspended or inactivated before 6 PM CST (HE 12 through HE 17 etc.).

If you have any questions, please let me know.
Thank you for the help.

The compensation issue is still under review by our management.  The T&M rates AMEC has provided for the Pre-NTP PSA are all we have from AMEC at this point.  We do not have the NTP rates worked out for Exhibits yet. The current document is still in draft form and we are considering your wording, however our management is adamant at achieving an all-in rate per hour for the NTP PSA, so we consider this to be an open issue until we see your lump sum price estimate.  I assumed your position is that 60% is ""deemed"" to be what I refer to as the Variable Rate in the attached document.  Mike

Mike ,as we have discussed several times Amec will perform the work based on trhe rate schedules provided ton date with a lump sum based on the estimated hours times these rates.This does not mean we will provide the profit/overhead /bare wage breakdowns as described herein.We also said we would execute work in overrun at 60% of the scedule rates.This is what was discussed and written into the latest documents we reviewed last Friday.I am available in Toronto for awhile this a.m. at 905-8295400 ext.2489 if we need to discuss again.

In order to further clarify our understanding of how the payment 
mechanism would work in the exhibits of the PSA, I am attaching a 
summary of the preferred method for compensation under the Pre-NTP and 
NTP phases of the PSA's.  In particular, on the NTP Lump Sum price 
determination, we would prefer to see the breakdown of manhours in the 
format previously transmitted (by task by month), and by Engineering 
Discipline.  The Canadian rate structure you provided had about 15 or 
more categories of Engineering Disciplines, and this should be used to 
reflect the all-in hourly rates times the manhours in each category 
which will equate to the estimated Lump Sum price noted in the 
attachment.  

Your organization chart reflects all personnel in Vancouver being 
assigned to the project team, except the Customer Sponsor.  We would not 
expect to have to pay for the sponsor's cost, nor any travel time for

In order to further clarify our understanding of how the payment mechanism would work in the exhibits of the PSA, I am attaching a summary of the preferred method for compensation under the Pre-NTP and NTP phases of the PSA's.  In particular, on the NTP Lump Sum price determination, we would prefer to see the breakdown of manhours in the format previously transmitted (by task by month), and by Engineering Discipline.  The Canadian rate structure you provided had about 15 or more categories of Engineering Disciplines, and this should be used to reflect the all-in hourly rates times the manhours in each category which will equate to the estimated Lump Sum price noted in the attachment.  

Your organization chart reflects all personnel in Vancouver being assigned to the project team, except the Customer Sponsor.  We would not expect to have to pay for the sponsor's cost, nor any travel time for personnel to/from Atlanta.

We are getting clarification from LED if the actual driving of the test piles will be included in your deliverables or will be done directly by LED during the Oct 1-31 period.  Will advise.

Mike ,as we have discussed several times Amec will perform the work based on trhe rate schedules provided ton date with a lump sum based on the estimated hours times these rates.This does not mean we will provide the profit/overhead /bare wage breakdowns as described herein.We also said we would execute work in overrun at 60% of the scedule rates.This is what was discussed and written into the latest documents we reviewed last Friday.I am available in Toronto for awhile this a.m. at 905-8295400 ext.2489 if we need to discuss again.

There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like ""Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!"" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. 

If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively.

If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network.

Thank you.

If Bill finds this language agreeable, you can cut and paste my revision and send it to the customer, with the following caveats that you must communicate to the customer:

1.  We can do the load following service under the WSPP.  We cannot commit to term transactions without an EEI Master Power Purchase and Sale Contract in place

2.  If the customer is interested, we can negotiate a more formalized contract for this service.

3.  I reserve the right for Credit or Legal to change our mind about this arrangement and require a more formal contract at any point in the future.  If I change my mind, though, I'll give everyone plenty of notice.

4.  If the customers' lawyers or contracts personnel have any questions about this arrangement, or doing business with Enron in general, I am available to meet with them by phone or in person.

Steve

Enron is interested in assisting Grays Harbor, Benton and Franklin with load balancing by buying and selling power in the real time market.  When requested, Enron will  provide competitive bids and offers on an hourly basis.  To help us provide you with the most competitive prices we can, we ask that you communicate all trades to us at least 45 minutes before actual physical delivery would occur.  We can do transactions on shorter notice, but it is more difficult to ensure a competitive price as the time for physical delivery nears.  In addition, as you may be aware, the wholesale power market can only accomodate transactions involving quantities of energy that are in whole MWs; i.e., there is no market for partial megawatts.  Therefore, each transaction must be at least 1 MW, and we would prefer, but not require, that you transact with us in volumes of at least 5 MW.

Steve here is my thoughts on the comercial language that should be in the contract

Enron is interested in assisting Grays Harbor, Benton and Franklin in load balancing by buying and selling power in the real time market.  Enron will engage its best efforts to provide the strongest bids and offers on an hourly basis.  The timing of when Enron is informed of the PUD's positions will have a large affect on the prices received.  Enron would appreciate all trades to be communicated at or before 15 minutes past the hour for the following trading hour.  In addition, Enron can only trade integer power volumes due to the wholesale power practices.  As a result, the minimum power quantity must be at least 1 MW.  Enron prefers power volumes to be at least 5 MW.

Bill, 

Attached is a memo outlining dispatch instructions for when your guys are covering our desk this weekend.  I thought with all your new guys they might need a little help.  We have it set up so there will only be a minimal amount of work.

Also, if there are any problems, you can reach me on my cell, as I will be on-call on Friday and Sunday.  The number is (403) 620-5083.

Have a good weekend,

Mike Taylor

Bill, your approval is requested.....

As I'm sure you're all aware, it took the group a day or two to hit its stride after EOL was launched on Aug. 20. We have already received approximately 30 disputes filed by various counterparties regarding deals that flowed on the 20th and 21st. Many of these will be especially difficult to settle correctly given the fact there is virtually no documentation or information to be found about the original deal. Some deals done on EOL were altered; other bilateral trades were simply zeroed out; and still others exist only in the Inc sheets. 

This situation outlines the extreme importance of documenting changes in deals as they're being made. If you have reason to zero out a trade done by an earlier shift, or to alter a trade executed online, please convey that reason. Some suggestions:

1. If you have a notebook, and use it, please enter the date on the top of the page every time you start a shift. Without that, your notes are pretty much worthless.

2. Type a short note into the Scheduling Comments section of deals you zero out or change, especially if you're changing them much later than the time they were entered.

3. Use the superfluity of spreadsheets, discussion databases, reports, Enpower applications, cut sheets, and other pieces of paper available to the Real Time group as evidence of your activity while on shift.

If this sounds unreasonable, I would welcome suggestions for an alternative. Thanks for your help.

Subject:	RE: California ISO Market Re-Design 2002 (MD02)

All:

A more detailed version  of CAISO's MD02 proposal was released on Wednesday.  Below I am copying a summary prepared by Andy Brown who covers these matters for IEP.

It appears that the CAISO proposal will allow for SC's to go short or long in the R/T market (i.e., final schedules do not need to be balanced).  That's good.  

I think the most material issue at this point is how the forward capacity requirement (ACAP, akin to ICAP) will affect our trading.

GAC

What is CAISO proposing?

First off, there are ""target price"" and ""intra-zonal congestion management""
FERC filings that are apparently almost ready for a drop at FERC.  The
""comprehensive"" package would build off that.

In essencence, CAISO is proposing a capacity market (similar to what IEP
proposed at the CPUC ""Procurement OIR"") that has an ""available capacity
obligation"" (ACAP) on the load-serving entities (LSEs, aka the utilities and
electric service providers).  This is the solution to the ""all spot, all the
time"" design that was associated with the CPUC's ""mandatory buy/sell""
requirement and failure to provide forward reasonableness guidelines for the
utilities.  The LSEs would be required to show / specify to CAISO the ACAP
resources on a month-ahead basis equal to at least 115% of the coming
month's peak demand.  ACAP resources can be the LSE's own generation,
generation under contract, etc.  Failure to procure sufficient ACAP would
lead to penalties.  Also, CAISO appears to suggest that it would be in the
middle of arrangements between a LSE and the capacity supply as it would
penalize the supplier for failure to be available, operate as dispatched,
etc.  That wrinkle seems like it calls for 3 party contracts or some element
of complexity that shouldn't necessarily be required.  Its not clear from
the paper how costs for CAISO-dispatched ACAP resource would be allocated to
other SCs, particularly where a LSE contracted for the capacity, but CAISO's
running it to cover someone else's short energy schedule?  

It is not particularly clear how DWR resources fit into the mix (there seems
to be a contradictory statement in the paper).  However, CAISO is proposing
a two-year ""transition"" mechanism where CAISO would provide the ACAP
resources (based on their stellar creditworthiness?? or DWR resources??).
There could be tension here with the proposals at the CPUC proceeding.
Also, it appears that an argument can be made that DWR is a LSE under the
terms of AB 1x.  

CAISO is also moving toward a forward nodal-based congestion mechanism,
similar to the PJM type of design.  It is based on a 3000 bus network model
with simplified modeling of adjacent control areas.  Dispatch will be on an
optimized basis that on resource constraints (that appears to be dynamic)
including transmission capacity changes (increased ATC when ETC rights are
freed up, etc.) and generation availability.  There will be some degree of
node aggregation (in the form of demand locations and trading hubs).  It
appears that RMR contracts could disappear under this approach, although
that is not completely clear.

Creation of the forward congestion approach with security based optimization
effectively removes the need for the ""balanced schedule"" requirement.  Under
the proposal, CAISO would make trades happen in realtime through the
optimization to the extent not addressed through the forward markets. CAISO
calls for the resurrection of a day ahead energy market (FERC has called for
that).  CAISO says its open to that market being run outside of CAISO, but
that the need is for a centralized day ahead energy market that could help
shape resource needs.

CAISO would have the ability to dispatch identified ACAP resources not
already scheduled by the LSE.  They speak in terms of a ""residual unit
commitment"" requirement ... something akin to the ""long lead time"" proposal
under the ""must-offer"" requirement.  Their start and min load payment
proposal would be continued, subject to loosing it for unavailability or
participation in the market.  

Note that CAISO states they will need to mitigate bids due to ""locational
market power"", particularly in relation to congestion.  I thought that
locational market power was addressed via RMR.  This raises the ""black box""
issue if CAISO is going to say on a realtime basis that they have some
dynamic problem and only a particular generation asset could address the
problem so we're mitigating your bid curve based on some form of proxy
pricing mechanism.  To some extent, in a nodal system, CAISO could argue
that more folks have ""locational market power.""  We'll need to review other
markets' treatment of this issue.

The future of the AS markets is questioned in the paper, and there's the
specific suggestion that the replacement reserve market is unnecessary if
ACAP is put into place.  This is probably the largest hole in the paper,
because there's a clear implication that something should happen and
presumably CAISO has at least come up with some set of options on the issue
(i.e., kill AS, have AS markets but alter products, have one AS product but
expect low volume, etc).

One element that seemed missing was a discussion of demand response.  In
many respects that element has been consistently missing in the market, save
the extraordinary conservation last summer.  There is a suggestion that the
ACAP requirement could be addressed by demand response, but presumably that
would need to be demand that could be dispatched by CAISO, and those
resources are particularly limited under the current CAISO demand-side
design.  While efforts on interruptible programs has occurred at the CPUC,
it is not clear that the two entities are heading in the same direction.

It was noted earlier that the ACAP proposal is similar to what IEP (and
others) suggested at the CPUC Procurement OIR.  Based on a lone comment by a
CPUCer during the CAISO media call yesterday, the CPUC is very far behind
the curve on these issues, and there is absolutely no coordination on this
issue.  Given that the same ""solution"" is popping up in both venues, there
is a real need to make sure that the two pieces can fit together, while
avoiding a bureaucratic paralysis that could happen if a formal attempt to
""coordinate"" the venues is proposed.

Bill,

We are looking for EPMI West real time to provide coverage for Enron Canada Corp. on Friday, September 21 and Sunday, September 23 from 7 AM to 7 PM (MPT). ECC will be looking for EPMI to dispatch the plant if necessary and to inform the Power Pool of Alberta of a change in availability. ECC will forward the real-time number to Portland and will also provide a cell phone number if you have any questions. 

Let me know if you have any questions,

Thanks in advance,

K:

Clearly there is some weird stuff going on here.  In addition to not
getting the instructions through ADR, it looks to me like we are getting
dispatched for some strange quantities.  My theory is we have reduced
the PMAX on some of these units through formal unit outages, but the ISO
dispatch system does not communicate with the unit outage system.  Can
we check this theory for the dispatch on September 4 for Harbgn_7_units?
Your spreadsheet is showing a dispatch of 7.92 MW.  Our records indicate
that Harbor's PMax is 80 MW as we changed the PMax some time ago.  I
believe the old PMax was approx. 87 and maybe even 87.92.  Can you check
on this?  This might help explain what's going on.

Chris

The database are scheduled to be back up after 4 PM.  If they are not back up before the end of your shift, please ask your successor to enter a few deals, etc.  If you have any problems call David Poston.

Dave,

I have attached a revised budget forecast for 2002. The 2002 headcount  (column D) is now correct at the top of the budget. I do not have a number from David Steiner yet regarding technology costs (row 107) but I am expecting it soon. Everything else is pretty much as you and I discussed earlier today. Please call me with any questions.
Thank you for the help.

Effective October 1st Real Time individuals will be responsible for anything over $55.00 on their AT&T bill.  As of now you all have 200 minutes per month plus free calling within your group all the time.  You are welcome to come look at recent and old bills to see approximately how many minutes you use within a month.    This might help you to choose a plan that might better suit you.  I urge you to do this soon so you are not stuck with a huge bill in October.  If you decide to go against the group calling plan you will have to remember your minutes talking within the Real Time group will be accounted for.  

I'll list some plans that are available.  If you are working at night and are not able to get a hold of me, please e-mail me with your decision and I will take care of it.

I was being sarcastic about the $16000. Could you send an email to each group member giving them their average usage since you started or the last 3 months (AT&T should have this info). If you could send me an email breaking out the costs that would be great as well. I am not that concerned with the new phones--but would like to know what was spent.
I appreciate the help.

The answer to that question is NO you haven't spent $16,000 in just new phones.  Your group was going over their minute limit before I even started here it seems.  Do you still want me to go through the last bill and let you know what was spent on each individual?  I'll send out the e-mail today.  I can go through all the bills and let you know what was spent on new phones, it will take a while but I could figure it out.

Please send an email to the group explaining to them that they will be billed if they go over $55 a month. Let them know they can set up a different plan if they need (I would prefer they stick with the group calling plan and add minutes...but the choice is theirs).  Let's put this in effect by October. I am seeing $20000 ytd as of June in cell phone charges (and $55 x 13 group members x 6 months should equal $4290--have we really spent $16000 on new phones?

Yeah that's a good idea.  Some of the bills lately have been bigger then others and that is because of purchases of new phones.  The rate you should be paying right now per employee is $49.99 PLUS taxes which usually adds up to be about $53 to $55 a month.  Granted most of your group goes way over that.  I set Mark Guzman up on a plan yesterday that is 1100 min. per month and he will probably be paying about $69 out of his pocket if you want to cap it at $50 bucks.  Do you want me to send an e-mail out to your group to let them know they should come see me about different plans?    I'll give you the latest report by the end of today from your latest bill.  Also to be aware that if I put everyone on a different plan they will NOT have the free group calling.

Jill,

I need information regarding our monthly cell phone costs. I would like to cap per employee costs at $50 per month on the group calling plan. Effective in October, I would like employees billed for any amount they have over $50 per month on their cell phone. If an employee needs more minutes I would like to structure a plan to allow them to purchase more minutes through us--with them paying the extra per month.

Thanks,

I need information regarding our monthly cell phone costs. I would like to cap per employee costs at $50 per month on the group calling plan. Effective in October, I would like employees billed for any amount they have over $50 per month on their cell phone. If an employee needs more minutes I would like to structure a plan to allow them to purchase more minutes through us--with them paying the extra per month.

Thanks,
Bill"

Group,

We have developed a process for tiering our bids and should do so going forward.

Please use appropriate dollar and mw values. Below is JUST an example. When tiering, the top numbers (mw values) must be monotonically increasing and the last two numbers on the bottom of your tier ($ values) must be the same.

	 
IMPORT:	0	25	50	75	100	125	150	200	200.01
		$49	$49	$74	99	149	174	199	249	249


EXPORT:	0	25	50	75	100	125	150	200	200.01
		$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1


*NOTE* If a tiered bid is entered incorrectly you will have to flow a large amount of mws for loss or no gain.*NOTE*

Please see me with any questions before implementing tiered bids.

Thanks,
Bill"

Darin,

I liked the services portion of the night discussion note that you wrote on the 13th, but you need more information on sales on behalf of EPE for both HE 6 and HE 7...you need to explain any sales to marketers or utilities. I also need you to only sell to a marketer as last resort. A marketer is usually just flipping EPE's energy and is taking your spread. 

If you have any questions, just let me know. Otherwise keep up the good work!

Thanks,
Bill"

David,
I have made some revisions to the budget after spending some time with Amy Fitzpatrick in our HR department. Obviously this is a loose plan (the headcount for the RT group changes frequently)...but it should prove a bit more accurate than nothing. If you have any questions please just let me know. You can call me here at work at 503-464-3730 or on my cell phone at 503-887-3449.
Thanks,

Bill

Subject:	2002 Budget

Here is the G&A Expense worksheet to use as a guide for next year's budget.  I've tried to put as many notes into your assumptions as I could find.  For the 2002 plan, I already input salaries adjusted for merit increases (4.25%) and special pays.  Please update the rest of the 2002 plan column and enter all assumptions used to calculate the amounts.  Some examples of assumptions are if you know you are going to attend certain conferences, have a customer outing, plan travel expense per employee, or add additional headcount.  If you could please complete this and send back to me by the end of the week, it would be greatly appreciated.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Group,
A quick reminder. The night shift will average the sales price and make one strip for the on-peak piece.(so ST-WBOM will sell to ST-Whourly at x$ for HE7-22 then ST-Whourly does whatever it needs to do).
If you have questions just let me know.

Stewart,
I will be in El Paso visting EPE on the 20th.
But I am very interested in discussing such an opportunity with NW service customers.
Do they HAVE to come on the morning of the 20th or 21st? Could they come the morning of the 19th?
Let's get together and talk regardless.

Nice job on NCPA, I appreciate the hard work.
Thanks,
Bill

Bill -

Come by and talk to me about an opportunity starting in october 1st.  Basically, Grays Harbor, Benton and Franklin would like to outsource some real time transactions to us for a short period of time until they get comfortable with SLICE.  They will probably come in for a meeting on September 20th or 21st in the morning to discuss this.  I would like you to be there for the meeting.

Group,

A quick reminder. After reviewing this weekend, we must begin adjust bidding for congestion at ALL tie points. We should be running wheels N-S and S-N across Path 15, the COI and NOB. We have lost significant revenue by failing to adjust bid our transactions. It is still fire season, and unit outages are resulting in unscheduled flow problems that are forcing congestion at different tie points and in different directions. Please check available ATC's on the CAISO site, and spend the time to manage our congestion risk. If you have questions, please ask. We need everyone up to speed on this quickly.

Thanks,
Bill

Just a quick reminder.
When we are notified by the CAISO Generation desk regarding a ""waiver"" for an Enron managed unit in California, we should notify the services desk if it is during the day, and should email the services desk (and me) if it is after normal work hours. If you have questions please just let me know.

Can we contact this Steve Johnson guy and tell him he is a pawn for the state of California... Funny...I don't remember a ""near-meltdown"", just inept purchasing and load balancing by CERS at the start of August. CERS is consistently completely out of the market. EVERY DAY! They can't even manage to bury their bad trades in 35,000 mws of load!
Humorous article though.

Increasingly, plants put grid at risk
POTENTIAL FOR OUTAGES 
: OPERATORS REFUSE
STATE'S REQUESTS TO ADJUST POWER LEVELS 
BY STEVE JOHNSON <mailto:sjohnson@sjmercury.com>
Mercury News 
More than a month after two generators refused state orders to deliver power as promised and triggered a near-meltdown of the Western power grid, California's electrical system continues to be hindered by a growing and potentially dangerous anarchy. 
Officials with the California Independent System Operator say power-plant operators increasingly are refusing the state's directions to adjust their plant power levels up or down to keep the electrical system in balance. Nearly one-fourth of the orders were ignored in July and August, state officials say. 
Refusals have increased steadily from about nine a day in May to more than 160 a day in August. The most serious incident occurred Aug. 2, when two power-plant operators declined to provide the power they promised. That resulted in what authorities called a major frequency drop across the West, with the potential to cause blackouts. 
Concern grows 
Although no outages have been caused so far, Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the Independent System Operator, said state officials are deeply concerned. 
``Our operators need a certain amount of certainty when you're running a grid,'' McCorkle said. Unfortunately, ``the level of uncertainty has reached an uncomfortable level for ISO operators.'' 
Why this is happening remains unclear, according to California and power company officials. Jan Smutny-Jones, the ISO's former chairman who heads the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents generators, said, ``It's very hard to tell'' because a number of factors appear to be at work. 
He and McCorkle agreed that the refusal to follow orders partly stems from a growing frustration by generators over not being paid for power they have supplied the state. In recent weeks, generators have gotten only about 8 cents on the dollar, McCorkle said, noting that the problem largely stems from payments coming late from the California Department of Water Resources, which has been buying power for the state's financially strapped utilities. 
Generators frustrated 
Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, also blamed the state's new portfolio of long-term power contracts. 
He believes state officials may be forcing those large blocks of contracted electricity onto the grid, to avoid admitting that they bought more than they needed. But inserting those blocks into the system can be complicated, Ackerman said, and often requires difficult-to-make adjustments by other power-plant operators to keep the grid stable. 
Moreover, Ackerman said, the state has been relying increasingly on a computerized system that sends instructions to plant operators when power levels need to be raised or lowered. However, he said, that system can't handle the number of instructions the state is sending. 
``It's like pushing your car from zero to 120 and back to zero, and doing that over and over,'' Ackerman said. ``Your car just wasn't designed to do that.'' 
ISO officials acknowledged that fitting the long-term contracts into the system has been tough. But despite some minor glitches with the computer system, they said, they did not believe it was responsible for generators not doing what they've been told. 
No fines yet 
So far, no generators have been fined for disobeying orders, said Charles Robinson, the ISO's chief counsel. He noted, however, that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is investigating the matter, could decide that fines are warranted. 
But because California is so dependent on generators for its electricity, authorities have to be careful not to alienate power plant operators by penalizing them too harshly, said Mark Ward of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. 
``How do you motivate people to do the right thing?'' Ward asked. ``It's not a real simple problem.''

Jim & Darren -

It looks as though the only ISO true-up information Risk received was regarding our July variance of $86,743. This does not take into account the August variances totalling approx. $42,000 in revenue we did not receive throughout the month. Fran has informed me that as soon as she has this information she can account for the credit to the Short Term West Hourly book; but as you can see by the attached e-mail, Risk has only accounted for July variances, not August, in this PMA. 

I did go over the Month End Variance report Jim gave me, and I have some questions about the totals listed in it - in particular having to do with charges 253, 405, 111, and 112. Let me know when one or both of you has a moment and I think we can clear this up.

Again, I think the only variances we still have out there for the WHOURLY book are the four that occurred in August, which are as follows:

8/11 - $990
8/16 - $37,787.25
8/18 - ($6,764.68)	
8/22 - $9.495.25

As long as we're all aware of the ISO charges and revenue still unaccounted for - and know they will be in the future - I think we can all sleep soundly. Let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate:

Per your request I have double checked Risk's daily record on ISO revenue/expenses for WHOURLY book in August and everything checked out.  Here is the result:

Daily ISO revenue/expenses total (8/1-8/31)	+$629,709 (you can also get this number by adding up the ISO report Risk 							distributed to you every morning along with your P&L )
July ISO true up					+$86,743 
=>					total	+$716,452
Month-end August ISO revenue/expenses 	+$716,481 (we got this total from Volume Mgmt)
Variance (i.e. true-up)				+$29

I have communicated this with Volume Management with the above results.  Jim advised that they might have added some items ""after fact"" during August but those changes were neither included in the daily ISO flash Risk got nor included in the month-end flash, and that's probably why you are expecting more than what Risk gave you.  Jim and Darren will be looking into their records in order to check out with you.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran

Group,

We are continuing to refine our deal entry techniques and spreadsheet techniques. We are having great success with EOL so far. For further clarification.
	


	1. ALL DEALS UNDER ST-WHOURLY--except a lending/parking deal or cut. For example if we are lending with ST-SW and we buy for them in NP-15. The buy in NP-15 is under ST-WHOURLY, the EPMICALPOOL Buy/Resale from NP-15 to FC345 is under ST-WHOURLY, the INTER-DESK sale is made under ST-WHOURLY (at the end of the day--see #3), and the sale to EPE is under ST-SW. The export in CAPS is also under ST-SW.

	2. ONE DEAL FOR AN ON-PEAK or OFF-PEAK PURCHASE or SALE.--For example one deal for a sale to the imbalance, one deal for a sale to EPE

	3. ONE DEAL FOR AN INTER-DESK SALE or PURCHASE--done by the NIGHT SHIFT at the weighted average price for the entire strip, transmission costs should be included. We are just averaging the purchase price or sale price for specific deals. (see ST-WBOM SP-15 section of AUG TRADING sheet on 08/29/01 for an example)

	4. INC SHEETS MUST BE MAINTAINED, DEALS ENTERED AND ROUTED EACH HOUR--only way to stay ahead

	5. WE ARE GENERATING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE REVENUE AND PROFIT TRADING WITH EOL (over $130,000 in the last 5 days alone--does not include congestion revenue!)--530+ trades, 13,100 extra mws traded with EOL in 8 days.

	6. MEETING ON TUESDAY 09/04 at 4PM


Finally, I will be out of the office for Friday and will be in Seattle through Sunday. You should be able to reach me on my cell phone (503) 887-3449. If you can not reach me, please refer questions regarding trading to Ryan Slinger, (503) 789-1306.

Thanks for the continued hard work and attention to detail,

Jon,
Good to hear from you. Glad to hear you are healing up, as for me, I am still working on the sprained knee. Enough of this one game and out stuff. Do you know when the outdoor season starts? I am hoping to make some indoor games, but want to concentrate on outdoor.

Hi Guys,

Not sure who is in charge of the indoor team but I noticed we have our first
game of the upcoming season this Thursday night at 10:15 against FC Cosmos.
For more info go to 
http://www.pdxindoorsoccer.com/

As for me my hamstring is slowly healing so I should be back out there
before too long.  Later.

Darren,
Per our discussion, please allocate all Hour-Ahead Congestion charges or revenues to the ECTRT group. Hopefully this will simplify the management of our books. My understanding is that Chris will tell RT if there are cuts or some other need to put in Hour Ahead (24) schedules for the Cali desk and will allow us to allocate approriate charges or revenue to him if necessary. All Congestion charges/revenue at tie points should still be allocated to the desk entered in CAPS. If you have any questions please see me. RealTime will still try to notify you of Congestion revenue or charges.

Thanks,

Bill"

Virginia,

All deals were originally sourced under ST-NW. Revenue was moved from ST-NW to ST-Whourly for 70/30 split between LP and ST-Whourly.

Annuity to ST-Whourly from ST-NW #531524--$23468.76

Annuity from ST-Whourly to LP #531549--$12597.73

Annuity from ST-Whourly to LT-NW #531546--$5472--this compensated for original deal sold to LP (take or pay).

ST-Whourly kept the difference between #531524 and #'s 531549, 531546.

All deals were originally sourced under ST-NW.

If you have questions, just let me know.
Thanks,

There are several annuities related to the profit sharing of this deal.
First--
All deals should have been made under the ST-NW desk to route with the PGE =
deal-buy tranny-etc. (I recognize this did not happen but this was my inten=
t and should or could have). Consequently all revenue from this deal origin=
ally went into the ST-NW book. Therefore. An annuity was made from ST-NW to=
 ST-WHOURLY. Deal #531524--$23468. Next an annuity was made from ST-Whourly=
 to LT-NW at $5472 to compensate LT-NW for the $48 purchase price (deal #53=
1546). This left a profit of $17996 to be divided between ST-Whourly and L-=
Pac-30/70. Consequently, ST-Whourly made an annuity to L-Pac for their part=
 of the profit share, Deal #531549--$12597.73. All this left RT with a prof=
it of $5399. If you place all the deals under LT-NW...it will be a large im=
pact on ST-NW, and will result in LT-NW getting paid a couple of times. The=
se profit share numbers are accurate. After expenses--LT-NW gets $5472 for =
the original deal, then ST-WH gets $5399 and L-Pac gets $12597.73. All thes=
e annuities cannot just be killed as they liquidated on the 26th--of Februa=
ry. It is probably a better idea to put everything back under the ST-NW boo=
k...ideas?

Questions?

Just come see me and let me know.

Evelyn,
Please try to send or copy any emails to me at Williams III, Bill. NOT Williams, Bill. This email went to Bill Williams with Enron who happen to be in Sweden...
 
Kate Symes will be taking care of your spreadsheet when she has an opportunity. As you may be aware we have recently brought out EnronOnLine to the hourly market. We have seen a dramatic increase in volumes, and priorities have shifted as a result. Daily deadlines must be met. We are working on our deal entry accuracy. I appreciate your patience, we will attend to this issue shortly.

Please find attached an excel spreadsheet of Bloomberg deals I can't seem to match up with our deals in Enpower.  This is for August 1 through August 22.   None of these deals have Bloomberg as the Broker in Enpower.  I was told in June to allow a two day grace period before the deals should be in Enpower and that did not occur.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help resolve these problems.

Group,
EOL is off to a great start and is already becoming an integral part of the real-time market! Each person who has put in substantial extra time entering and reconciling deals deserves congratulations. I do recognize and appreciate the hard work. As always, there is more work to be done. We have had significant difficulty integrating the increased volume of EOL trades into our current business practice. Some members of the group have experienced limited success, others have experienced little to no success. A standardization in our process will benefit the entire group and will allow us to make consistent improvements as time goes on. So going forward.

	1.	All deals will be done under ST-Whourly. If there is lending, parking or a cut that corresponds to another book, we will make that deal for the entire strip (for 	example, W-BOM sells to EPE for HE 7-22--all one deal). We will then sell or buy the appropriate amount of energy from Whourly to that book (this interdesk deal 	will not be routed). We will do the interdesk transaction as one deal and will enter deal strips with pricing for each hour or hours where appropriate and will include 	transmission charges when necessary. In Enpower, use strips wherever possible...try to avoid extending deals in scheduling.

	2. 	All imports and exports will be under the appropriate desk (for example ST-SW exporting from SP-15 to FC MUST be under ST-SW in CAPS).
	This will allow us to put everything under Whourly and have export/import fees paid for by the appropriate desk. Otherwise the Whourly book will be charged for 	wheeling and/or potentially congestion for other desks. When filling a Service customer (such as Wheelabrator or EES) we should pay for the import and export 	fees.

	3.	A ""skeleton"" of an inc sheet should be developed as soon as possible each day.  Sales/purchases to or from EES should be made for the day and 	immediately input into the service sheet. Likewise...Service deals/Lending/Parking should be put into the sheet for the day where possible.

I would like to implement all of these practices immediately. Effective HE 1 08/29/01, THIS is our new business practice. Spread the word. I am looking for more suggestions for improvements on our process. We will have a meeting on September 4 to discuss group direction and ideas for improvement. This will be an important meeting at 4 PM on Tuesday September 4th. Please plan to attend.

See me at any time with suggestions or comments.

Thanks,
Bill"

Bill-

  As we have been back and forth for 5 months now, there has to be a decision made on the Montana Imbalance piece for March 2001.
  Kate and I have done everything to find information to support ours or MPC's numbers and we have knocked out most of the issues, however, there are 6 discrepancies that we do not agree on and both we and MPC are standing on our numbers. I have filled out tape requests for these 6.  Please keep in mind, though, that we do not have access to these tapes(and have not had since April). These requests will go to Tim.

  Five disputes are for MW or to add a deal.  These will be deals that we will not be negatively affected by as we will pass them thru to another counterparty.  The only problem I can forsee is that the other counterparty will dispute the 'pass thru', especially since we have already checked out with them.
  Only one dispute (a pricing issue) could potentially leave us with a negative $1500 DPR.

  I need you to make the call today.  Kate has the tape requests in her posession as well as all of the backup information from the research that we have done.

  If I don't hear from you by tomorrow morning, I'll adjust our system according to MPC's numbers until I do.

  Thanks,

  Virginia"

Sound reasonable? Or should I be more firm?

A reminder....

In an effort to curb El Paso settlements issues, I've requested several sets of tapes over the past few days. As you know, these are the most reliable resource we have in determining the truth behind our everyday dealings. However, none of the taped conversations I've listened to recently have made mention of the time they were being traded for; many didn't name a delivery point; and some left out a price. 

Because mistakes are almost inevitable in a job as abstruse as yours, re-confirming deals just after making them is a valuable habit to form. A quick summary at the end of the conversation can potentially clear up discrepancies at the moment they're created, or serve as a tool for resolving them if they make it further than that.

(This looks good --though no one will know what you mean by abstruse--you might want to clear up the language regarding summarizing at the end of the deal. Make it a bit more firm and condescending)

As always, let me know if you have questions about this.

You have to love the availability of beautiful lasses for viewing. Things are interesting. Enron is moving right along and we will find out about who I am working for on Friday (our auction should be completed then). Not too much else is new. My place continues to get better (as I slowly furnish it), but Portland continues to be the little sister to Seattle. A couple new bars in town suggest she might be getting closer to puberty but definitely not the woman about town that Seattle is. Morgan told me you may no longer be with Steph? Is this true? (And I hope you are the only one reading this if it is not). If that is the case, well, we can see what we can do about it. As always, I have no plans the next couple weekends, so give me a shout (still have my cell phone at 503-887-3449) if you want to take a trip on down. Your always welcome to crash on my couch...(sorry its all I have, I got rid of the futon). Hope youre doing well.

Word.

Because we're under close watch by El Paso, would you mind looking over this e-mail to Kathy before I send it out? Thanks....

Kathy -

I requested tapes for 8/17 to verify the amount we purchased from SRP, and attached wave files that have Bert buying firm power (Vanessa at SRP said she'd need to run her turbines for three hours in order to sell at all) for HE 16-18. 40 mw went to you and the rest was sold elsewhere at Four-Corners. Our records also show we bought 50 mw on peak from SRP to cover the lending deal for that day. So total SRP purchase for HE 17 is 90 mw (50 mw lending deal + 40 mw purchase to maintain reliability requirements). 

I'm working with our IT department to get a tape of Todd reporting these numbers to the El Paso dispatchers - I'll let you know as soon as we find that. In the meantime, do you have anything more specific from SRP as to why they believe we only purchased 40 mw of econ energy for HE 17? I'm just not finding anything to support that.

Thanks,
Kate"

Group,
I have copied in a note from Roger at EPE. As you can see they are placing a VERY high importance on economic dispatch of the units. Please be aware that every move with regards to marketing and running their system is under EXTREME scrutiny.

Please call me before you call our customer.

Thanks,
Bill



Correction:
The burner problem is on Newman 3.  (Thank You! Mr Ward)   The unit will be held at 85 MW's until repairs can be made.  The plan is to assess the problem Monday morning and make the necessary repairs.    

If prices continue to be below cost we need to purchase power and back down
local units.  With Copper off, the dispatch shows we need to purchase power for 5 or 6 hours through super peak. 

Depending on load,  GT 1 and GT 2 should be put in the hole (around 7 to 10
MW's each) HE 1:00 through HE 9:00...

If  Market conditions are less than $14.00  BACK DOWN Four Corners...   As
load picks up be sure to pick up Four Corners first!
If there is a reason we have to dump FC power please send me a note!   If
there is any confusion over whether to back down FC CALL.

Any questions or comments please call at  5808  or  915-204-1202...
 
Roger

Subject:	As the CAISO Turns:  CAISO involved in scam with CDWR to purchase excess power from CDWR's long-term contracts

Everyone,

This is hot news showing that the CAISO/CDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought.  I am not sure how to best use this information, but this scam needs to be brought to the public's and FERC's attention.

1.  According to two sources, the CAISO is helping to bail Gov. Davis out of his high-priced CDWR long-term power contracts by purchasing CDWR's excess energy as an ""Out Of Market"" purchase---instead of purchasing real-time energy from the CAISO's Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff.  The costs of purchasing this high-cost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISO's surreptitious transactions.

2.  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff, which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy (Real-Time) auction first.  CAISO Tariff, Dispatch Protocol section 8.6.2 (d).  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids, can the CAISO buy Out Of Market (""OOM"") energy.  If the CAISO were following the Tariff, CDWR's excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energy---which is often as low as $0.00.  Therefore, under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs, but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR.  

3.  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power, the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market.  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices.  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as $0.00.  Therefore, the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free.  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment, its energy would be treated as excess energy, and it would get little or nothing for it.

4.  While there is no evidence that Gov. Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first, this behavior clearly benefits Davis.  Absent the CAISO's purchases of CDWR's excess energy, CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market (just like many other suppliers).  The media has been been making hay out of Davis's strategy of buying high and selling low.  Therefore, Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the long-term contracts.  Of course, they are only able to offset their losses through a back-door deal with the CAISO.

5.  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who, frequently seeing 10-minute Ex Post prices of $0.00, expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to $0.00.  These SCs are in for a big surprise.  According to one source at Sierra Pacific, the CAISO charged him as much as $400/MWh for imbalance energy.  (Where is the price mitigation here?)

6.  Who benefits under this scam?  Davis and CDWR.  Who loses under this scam?  In-state generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO; Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances; consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy.

7.  Sources:  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and ""the Friday Burrito,"" an industry insider publication mentioned it also.

8.  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito:

""There is another problem that is being introduced by the long-term contracts. The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market (OOM) calls, thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post (BEEP) market. As one of our faithful observers told me, ""The ISO will be billing some DRW/CERS long-term contracts to SCs as OOM energy. This has been confirmed by the ISO. This means there is no real-time price transparency. We may see an hourly ex-post price of, say, $15, but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual Real-Time settlement price. There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesn't post that information. The implication is that parties buying real-time energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price. This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERC's goals of creating open, transparent markets."" 
9.  Here is the e-mail from our CAISO representative:

Can you send me a copy of the 'Burrito' that we were discussing, or at
least outline in an e-mail the name of the person who has written about
CERS and what was published?   What is the official name of this
newsletter?  I have seen them in the past (Harvey Hall used to get it
and sent a couple to me), but I haven't seen it for a long time.

Also, to recap our telephone discussion:  the charges assessed to the
Market in Charge Type 487 are determined by CERS, and are being
collected by the ISO on behalf of CERS, to cover the cost of contracts
that CERS has signed for energy purchases? and 487 pricing/charges have
do direct relationship to the Inc and Dec prices charged or paid to
those who inadvertently over- or under-schedule?  Please clarify that I
have understood this correctly.

Thanks a lot for your assistance.

Caroline

Subject:	487 Revelation

Steve,
	Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487.  Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487, (487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market, and purchase power that exceeds $150.00/mwh, 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back), for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero.  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer. So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO.  His response was this:  that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices, to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS.  In effect, they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price, and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS.

Group,

A quick important reminder. Recently our disputes with EPE and other SW cou=
nterparties have been growing. While I recognize that we have some newer me=
mbers in the group, it is the responsibility of the senior members of the g=
roup to train and help the newer members to avoid mistakes. The EPE system =
is not overly complex. If you have questions during a shift call ME first. =
Do not wake up Roger, do not go inadvertant. Our notes on the deal sheet ne=
ed to include whether the power is firm or econ (again--you should almost n=
ever buy econ--). The EPE lending fee was recently renegotiated down to $2.=
 We have to be sharp in our marketing of their system to maintain our abili=
ty to lend and to lend at $2. Disputes with counterparties will quickly era=
se this opportunity. Marketing for EPE, making appropriate choices with reg=
ards to the units, checking out with dispatchers on time, and reconciling t=
he CARP are basic expectations for this position and MUST be met. If you ha=
ve questions, please see me. We will discuss EPE and EOL in our meeting at =
the start of September.

Thanks,
Bill"

Bill,

The DBAs for the EnPower database want to take it down from 4 PM Friday afternoon (6 PM Houston) to 4 PM Saturday afternoon (6PM Houston).  The reason for this is the NETCO/Estate database and hardware split that is occuring this weekend.  Let us know as soon as possible if this is ok or not so the DBA's can get their plan togethre for this weekend.  

thanks,

Good morning.
We are off in position manager at Mid Columbia because of Enron Canada. I notified Murray at Enron Canada at approximately 6:15 this morning. Position manager is also not working properly, it is reporting a variance at Pacificorp system border ? and at Palo Verde. However the position manager shows no variance when detail is clicked.
If you have questions, let me know.
Thanks,

Sunil,
Per our conversation on the phone. We are getting several requests from customers to allow them to ""personalize"" their quotes to only include hourly EOL products. We are currently trading physical firm power at NP-15, SP-15, PV, and Mid-C for hours ending 12-20. A same day filter or hourly product filter would work nicely.
Please let me know what you might need from me to get this accomplished as quickly as possible.
Thanks,

Bill Williams
