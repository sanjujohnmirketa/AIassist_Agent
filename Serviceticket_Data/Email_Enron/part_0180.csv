I just read the Houston Chronicle....4,000 people laid off, incredible!
What kind of work are you doing?  Is there anyone to trade with?  Have they
guaranteed to pay you and cover your health insurance?  Is Kim Olinger gone?

sorry, I have so many questions.  I just can#t believe this whole thing!

Dear Susan,

Well how's it going now?  Have they formed a salvage plan for the company?

I heard that Cuba Waddlington past away.  He had bone cancer?  I'm very
sorry to hear that, he wasn't so old either.  Was he still Frank's boss?
What's with Frank these days?  And Karen?

It's sooooo cold here!  The high maybe 32? F, MAYBE.  So, I am freezing to
death!  I've been staying in mostly, decorating and wrapping presents.  I
love this time of year!  I have been making Christmas gift baskets (filled
with wine, candies and chocolates) for our important clients and business
partners.  They look so nice sitting all around our office that I don't want
to give them away.  I bought little boxes of chocolates filled with schnapps
for the delivery people and postmen.  When you have kids, you get your
fullfillment of wrapping and giving, but when you don't, you have to focus
that energy somewhere!  We have hung icycle lights inside and out, the
germans make some that are like a meter long...we hung them inside, from the
galary and upper floor of the foyer, then hung american icycle lights (they
are much brighter) that Julie sent us outside.  It's so festive.  Are your
kids getting excited?  Kids make Christmas.  (It looks like we MIGHT have a
new baby by the end of the year, afterall.  Melissa's doctor is thinking
that his first due date, Dec 31, could be right on target!  WE HOPE SOOO!)

Hope that you and your family are all doing well.  And I hope that you are
able to get into the Christmas spirit, in spite of all that's been
happening.

HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
Connie

Susan - Here is the section of the tariff that is currently available on the TGT website that applies to our situation for October:

Customers using in-kind replacement for imbalance resolution have thirty (30) days from date of notification by Transporter to nominate and resolve their imbalances. Imbalances not resolved within this thirty (30) day period are subject to cash-out at the 5% to 10% Net Imbalance Percentage for determining the Cash-Out Index Price. The cash-out index price to be used for cash-out shall be the greater of the month in which the imbalance occurred or the month in which the imbalance is cashed out. If Customer makes a good faith effort throughout the 30 days provided for in-kind replacement of imbalance volumes, but is unable to fulfill its in-kind make-up obligations solely as a result of Texas Gas's inability to take or deliver such make-up gas, then Texas Gas will cash- out Customer's imbalance at 100% monthly average index. 

Thus for October production, since we are short gas,  the gas price would be 110% of the highest price  for October or for November.

I am going to get with Suzanne Calcagno to find out the status of the TGT tariff filings and if it is still going to be effective retro  to  October.

SNG LNG has made the necessary filing to place its FERC Gas Tariff into effect on the proposed in-service date of the Elba Island facilities, 12/1/01.   The filing (which is 311 pages) includes revised initial rates for terminaling service.  Most of the tariff was approved in the certificate proceeding.  Substantive changes are explained in Exhibit Z1, which is in Set 7 below.

These are links to the tariff pages.  The links will open in an imaging program.  Use Ctrl-Page Up and Ctrl-Page Down to move between pages.  If you want to print anything, use the printer icon on the tool bar above the page and select ""fit to page"" under the Imaging Options drop down menu.

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001

Susan, because of the way these deals are in the system, I had to shortpay Superior approx $28K for last month.  Per volume management, they cannot actualize the deals in the order listed below because meter PSNG1220 is not on deals 778088 and 939542 (days 3 & 4 specifically).  Can you make this change so that Vol Mgmt can actualize?

Thanks
Laurie

Laurie-

Superior is right.  One of the deals listed as baseload was really term.  Christina is going to adjust the tickets.  Fill deals 778088 and 933354 first, then 939542, then the gda deal 939300.  Sorry for the confusion.

Thanks,

Thanks!!!  We agree on the ENA Upstream gas but the rest of the gas needs to
be reallocated.  According to my trader, the deals should be filled in the
following order:

Trigger:	 	 5,000/day   @ $4.425   ENA Deal # 778088
EFP:    		12,903/day  @ $2.895   ENA Deal # 933354
Baseload:  	2,000/day    @ $3.10     ENA Deal # 939542
Swing:   		      @ GDA      ENA Deal # 939300

Please let me know if this is not the order that your trader agrees with.

Jenna

Jenna, this is what we show in our system for Sonat.  I know it is not
right, but I wanted you to have the detail regardless.  I am going to
get with the trader to see exactly how the volume should be allocated.
I'll let you know what I find.

Dear Susan,

That's just INCREDIBLE!  Is the SEC investigating all of the execs that
left?  Scott had said that they were all just crooks, but I didn't know if
maybe his opinion was a little tainted, guess it wasn't.  Julie hasn't said
much at all about anything either, just that it's not the same place
anymore.  I am so sorry for all of you with those worthless options!  What
is Lay saying he's going to do to fix this and moral???  I'm sure everyone
is ready to leave.  How did it get so bad so fast?!  Just incredible. I sure
hope things are going better where Renato is working!

So, did you buy you a new SUV, you wrote that you were thinking about it.
We need something like that so bad.  We have a car that's more for sporting
around in than using in everyday use.  The problem for me here though is
parking, I HATE PARKING IN EUROPE!  So I couldn't handle anything very big
either.  I actually love those little ""Smarts"" have you seen them, I doubt
that they have any in the states, they are a little 2 seater but it has more
space in the back for shopping than our BMW does in it's trunk. AND IT'S
GREAT FOR PARKING! But all that has to wait until we get this house finished
and figure out if we are making any money in this business, being it's our
first year and Armin's parents made us take the business without EVER seeing
a balance sheet.  All I can say  so far, is that we are paying our bills and
eating good!

Hope you have a good weekend, you need it I'm sure after this week.  Tell
Renato hello for me.

Take care,
Connie

Here is the provision in the tariff for Imbalance Trading:
Subject to the provisions of Section 17.3(h) above, Customers may resolve their monthly transportation imbalances by trading their imbalance with another Customer. If requested by Customer, Texas Gas will post imbalances available for trades on its EBB. Customers trading offsetting imbalances must provide Texas Gas a notice of their agreement to trade imbalances in writing and signed by both Customers. All imbalance trades must be completed within ten (10) days of the date Texas Gas renders notice to Customer as to their monthly transportation imbalance. Customers must make-up in-kind or cash out all monthly transportation imbalances not resolved through trading in accordance with Section 4 of these General Terms and Conditions. 

Since the imbalance data sent to ENA was dated November 10th,   then it appears that TODAY would be the last day to trade this imbalance.    

STEPHANIE -- Can you verify this imbalance trading deadline with your TGT rep ?     Does TGT post the imbalance data earlier in the month on their nomination system ?    If so,  then the deadline could have already passed to trade the imbalance.

Susan, I just got an invoice from Superior for the unwinding of the Sonat trigger deal.  The invoice covers production months 12/01 through 08/02 and is for $3,761,900.00.  Have you put something in the system for this?

Laurie-

No. I have not put a new ticket in the system.  I wrote up a paper ticket and Alejandra Chavez adjusted the term  of the existing sitara ticket.  I'm not sure how it is supposed to be handled.  You might check with Alejandra and Kam Keiser.  Apparently, we've had some similar deals with other counterparties.  The NYMEX desk people told me that Credit doesn't want us paying one lump sum for unwinds.  Do you have any instructions concerning this, given our current financial situation??

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Susan,

We have received our statement for September and the price has changed from
our original contract and what we have previously been paid.  The statement
shows that we are being paid three different amounts for various volumes,
rather than the average of the three prices plus $.01.  I have spoken with
Tricia Truong and she suggest I speak to you.

Also the transportation has changed on the statement.  Has this changed?

Is something in error or has the contract changed?

Thank you,

Stevens

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under ""SEC Filings.""

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =
507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Bu=
ilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=
713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=
irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=
le in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron."

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter."

Dear Colleague,

have been.

forecasters, observers, and traders.

planning load and power requirements, as well as price trends, market

feature for those doing deals tied to the Nymex futures contract.

Check out GasTrader's market recommendations from long time Commodity Trading
Advisor and analyst Bill Burson. See if those recommendations help you do
better deals and expand the razor thin margins so prevalent today in natural
gas marketing.

If you would like to receive your FIVE WEEK COMPLIMENTARY SUBSCRIPTION to
GasTrader, please vistit our website, GasTrader.net and click ""subscribe"" or
reply to this e-mail and include your name, company and address and

Susan,

It is my understanding that Enron will not be receiving gas on Destin
pipeline in the month of December.  Therefore we have made arrangements to
sale the gas to another party.  If I have misunderstood the situation,
please advise.

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com."

Victor,

I wanted to keep you in the loop of an issue on Gulf South.  I watch these 
wellheads very closely and still have managed to accumulate penalty gas on 
meter 2848 for May.  I spoke with Victor Haley to alert him as soon as I 
discovered this issue and he was looking into it.  The wellhead is flowing 
nearly twice as much as normal.  Victor H. was checking to see if another 
wellhead has been added at that point.  He still does not have any further 
information on that meter.  He is aware of it, does not seem to be too 
concerned, and has a copy of the spreadsheet attached.  You will see his 
original nom request as 2400 and I moved it up accordingly.  

Let me know if you want to discuss this any further.

Thanks!

Dear Parents of Mrs. Blair's Second Graders, 

It is hard to believe that the school year is almost over. ?I hope it has  
been a good year for your child. ?I am emailing everyone about two matters. ? 

The first is the End of Year Party. ?It is on May 25th from 10:00 until  
11:30. ?The format is a baseball game among the classes - the second graders  
will be divided into four teams. ?After the game, we will serve hot dogs and  
drinks. We have five volunteers to ""help"" but no one has volunteered to 
chair  
it. ?The volunteers are Norm Nabhan, Allison Grove, Karen George, Margaret 
or  
Mike Pierce, Lila Mazzone and Nancy Rybarezyk as sub. ?Does anyone out there  
want to chair this party?  

The second matter is our class gift to Mrs. Blair. ?We will get the three  
second grade teachers gift certificates using the money we collected from 
the  
parents at our class meetings. ?I also think that it would be nice for each  
child in Mrs. Blair's class to write her a letter thanking her for her  
efforts as teacher, telling her what they liked about the class, special  
memories, or anything they want to say. ?I propose that these letters be  
written on 8 X 11 paper and that each one have the child's school picture  
affixed to it. ?If everyone would bring these on the last day of school, we  
can put them in a notebook and present them to Mrs. Blair. ?My idea for the  
notebook is a thin three ring binder with a clear pocket on the front into  
which we can insert a cover page. 

Would anybody volunteer to purchase this book and create the cover page? 
?(If  
not, I will do it, but I am not particularly creative with this kind of  
thing.) ?Please let me know and please have your child write the letter to  
Mrs. Blair. 

Please call me or email me if you have any questions or can volunteer your  
assistance with anything.

Susan,

I don't know if you have talked to Tricia Troung since you left me a
message Friday.  I agree with what you said, the average of the three
prices, plus $.01.  However the invoice, which Tricia says is what's in the
""system""  pays us on each of the prices(three different prices), for
different volumes.  Not equal volumes,  but  a graduated scale.

Thank you,

Stevens"

Hi, Connie!  

The trading groups (the ones that used to make all the money) are still working full days.  We're trying to trade, but our number of counterparties decreases daily.  I don't know if we'll make it through the next week.  They are laying off people this week, so I hear, in other groups.  I don't know who has been notified.  We may all be walking out the door soon.

As for the kids, Yes, Kali still believes in Santa Claus.  I don't know if she knows and is not fessing up!  We'll be here in Houston for Christmas.  Give us a call when you get here; we'd love to see you.  

Thank goodness I already bought the kids' Christmas gifts.  They haven't written their lists yet, though.  

We went to a dude ranch in Bandera, TX for Thanksgiving weekend.  The kids had a blast and want to go back next year.  

I guess I'll be updating my resume this weekend.  It looks pretty bleak.

Talk to you soon.

Susan

hey Susan,

How is it going this week?  I heard that people are mostly sitting around
during the morning then going to bars in the afternoon...or is that just in
the London office?  Are people even coming into the office?  Heather Kendall
said she will be let go just before Christmas.  I can't believe how they are
laying people off just before Christmas, the whole scenerio is like a bad
movie.  She's coming to visit this week, so maybe we can cheer her up with
some Christmas shopping in Rothenburg, it's an adorable little mid-evil town
that has the greatest Christmas decoration stores ever...and they are open
year round.  We took Julie there when she was here a couple of weeks ago.

How are the kids doing?  Does Kali still believe in Santa Claus?  We are
going to spend Christmas with Melissa and family.  Christmas is just not
much fun without children to watch.  Armin needs a vacation, well we both
do.  We leave on Dec 21 and CAN'T WAIT TO GO!  Are ya'll staying home for
Christmas?

Well, just wanted to check on you!  Take care...connie"

Mr. Lay-

After reading the news of your $60,000,000 to $80,000,000 payout, I am disg=
usted and appalled all over again.  Unfortunately, that's a daily occurrenc=
e.=20

I have been employed with Enron since May of 1993, when Enron purchased LRC=
.  I was very skeptical of Enron back then and was unsure of my future with=
 the company.  As time went on, I got more comfortable with the Enron way a=
nd learned how to survive and even be a little successful here.  I became a=
 believer in the things Enron could accomplish, a champion of our hard-nose=
d, driven executives (at least some of them).  I bought Enron stock and hel=
d on to those valuable options.

Over the last 18 months, my coworkers and I have viewed the weekly, sometim=
es daily, selling of Enron stock and exercising of options by our top execu=
tives (past and present and including you).  We came up with all kinds of r=
easons that the executives would be doing this -- they're so overly compens=
ated that they have to cash out some every now and then, divorce settlement=
s, mistress settlements, buying a new home in Aspen, buying an island in th=
e Caribbean, etc., etc. etc....  We never wanted to admit that they knew so=
mething we didn't.  Things were great, weren't they?  Jeff Skilling told us=
 that Enron was going to be the ""World's Leading Company.""  He even put the=
 goofy acronyms on his car license plate.  He told us gas traders in Februa=
ry how the stock was going to $126 by the end of the year. Now, being the c=
ynic that I am, I didn't believe the $126, although I have to admit I was h=
opeful; I figured that if Jeff had the audacity to throw out a number that =
high, then it was reasonable to expect the stock to be fairly stable, i.e.,=
 +/- 20%. =20

Needless to say, I didn't sell my stock and didn't exercise any more option=
s.  In fact, I bought more stock when it first started going down.  I'm afr=
aid that there are many more just like me.  I'm fortunate in that I have ma=
ny working years ahead of me (where, I don't know) to try to build up my sa=
vings again.  Many others are not that fortunate.  So many have spent their=
 entire careers here, helping to build this company up.  They were looking =
forward to retiring soon and enjoying the fruits of their labor.  And let m=
e remind you that their retirement accounts were in many cases a lot less t=
han a month's compensation for you.  Now even that is essentially gone.  Ot=
her employees were just ready to cash in some of their options to pay for t=
heir children's college tuition.  The stories are too numerous to list, and=
 the more I think about it, the more sickened I become.

It is painfully obvious to me and my coworkers, as well as the rest of the =
industry and Houston, that Enron's executives knew that there were skeleton=
s in the closet and began cashing in ahead of this freefall.  The employees=
 and the rest of the world were fed a bunch of half-truths and mystery mumb=
o-jumbo.  There should be an accounting for this behavior.  You and your co=
horts have ruined so many lives.  Think about that while you're spending yo=
ur millions.....

Subject:	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Still here, but don't know for how long...

I still can't believe the arrogant assholes who have run this company into the ground.  Because our credit rating keeps dropping, our trading abilities are being adversely affected.  I don't know how long things will be able to go on at this rate.  We may not make it to the end of the year, Dynegy deal or not.  I'm hopeful that the remaining finance people can refinance our debt, but if they don't, it doesn't look good....

Oh, well.  We'll all just move on and look for other jobs.  

Oh, by the way, we just moved into the new building this past weekend.  We're sitting near the power trading arrogant assholes.

Hope everything is going well for you.  How is your house coming along??  Send me a note back.  I'm going to be out tomorrow but will be back in on Monday.  They start laying off people next week.  It won't be in gas and power, but in other areas of the corporation.  Merry Christmas!!

Take care,

Susan

I expect us to file bankruptcy today or tomorrow.  We will likely be defaulting on a lot of our December business.  There are some last ditch efforts going on, but I'm not very hopeful.  If we file bankruptcy, I think we'll all get at least 60 days pay.  There were supposed to be layoffs this week anyway.  I guess those will happen.  I don't know.  They may wait until we file bankruptcy and see what the bankruptcy court judge wants the company to do first.  Stay tuned....

Craig-

You might want to talk to Ormet concerning deliveries for December.  It is very likely we may have to default to them for December.  We have NYMEX length and may be able to use some hub gas to transport to Ormet.  I don't know which deals will be served first.

Susan,

It is my understanding that Enron will not be receiving gas on Destin
pipeline in the month of December.  Therefore we have made arrangements to
sale the gas to another party.  If I have misunderstood the situation,
please advise.

Subject:	Kindergarten teacher gifts for Christmas


Hello -
 
Part of our $15.00 homeroom fee that you paid at the beginning  of the school year is used to purchase gifts for the teachers at  Christmas.  Michael Davies encouraged the room moms to think of something  that the children could participate in and make for the teachers.  Families  are welcome to give individual gifts as well, if they want.
 
Our class will be making/painting a ceramic piece, one for  Mrs. Munford and one for Mrs. Thuot.  I am going to pick out a piece this  weekend at the Mad Potter - it will either be a platter or a flower pot that I  will then fill with a plant for each of them.  If you have any preferences  or thoughts on what our piece should be, please let me know right  away.
 
Once I pick out the piece, you will be able to take your child  to the Mad Potter, 1963A W. Gray (next to Fundamentally Toys and Mesa Grill,  just east of Shepherd).  They are open daily with hours that should be  convenient for working and non-working parents.  Their hours  are:
 
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday    11 a.m. - 10  p.m.
Tuesday                                      11  a.m. - 6 p.m.
Friday,  Saturday                           11  a.m. - 11 p.m.
Sunday                                          1 p.m. - 6  p.m.
 
Your child will put a thumbprint on each piece in the paint  color of his/her choice.  You will need to write his/her name in pencil  underneath the thumbprint and we will paint their names in before the piece is  fired.  I will make something (hopefully a dalmation) out of their  thumbprints.  If anyone is artistic and would like to help, I would welcome  their help.
 
The pieces need to be fired by Monday, December 10 in order  for me to pick them up before the class Christmas party on December  18.
 
Please plan on taking your child to the Mad Potter one  day between Monday, December 3 and Sunday, December 9 to do their  thumbprints.  You will not be charged anything, and anyone in the  studio will be able to help you.  They will have the piece and written  instructions from me, along with a list of the class members.
 
If you have any questions or comments, please call me at  713-626-9726 or email me.  I know we are all busy at this time of year, so  I appreciate your cooperation in getting this done next week.   Thanks!

I wanted to let you know that the filing by Texas Gas Transmission to use GAS DAILY pricing for cashout  was REJECTED by FERC.    So please disregard the cashout information that was included on the PIPELINE SUMMARY you received at our meeting last Monday.
TGT submitted another new filing which proposes using weekly averages in Natural Gas Week and also proposes changing the tiers.  TGT wants to implement this retroactive to October1st.   Numerous entities have filed oppositions to this proposed TGT tariff change.     So at this time,  the method to be used by TGT for cashouts is uncertain.   
I will let you know when a cashout methodology gets final approval by FERC.

I've forwarded your message to Christina Sanchez.  She was the one who reallocated the volumes.  She will look at it again.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do.

Susan, because of the way these deals are in the system, I had to shortpay Superior approx $28K for last month.  Per volume management, they cannot actualize the deals in the order listed below because meter PSNG1220 is not on deals 778088 and 939542 (days 3 & 4 specifically).  Can you make this change so that Vol Mgmt can actualize?

Thanks

OK .  The girls got their mission accomplished and they will be treated to ice cream during the 2nd half of practice Wed.
I will bring my Suburban and take them to the Baskin and Robbins in the Randall's Shopping Center at Weslayan and Bissonnet. at about 8pm and you can pick them up there at the regular time of 8:30.

If you will notice they are progressing as a team right in line with what we have been teaching them.. They learned a little individual and team defensive tactics for the lst couple of weeks, so they started holding the oppositions scoring down to reasonable levels.  The last couple of weeks we have  been working strengthening their kicks, on finishing and on working crossing passes.  They have improved in all those areas. They gave us as many thrills as the Yankees on Sunday, so they now will get their just desserts.

I am trying to arrange a makeup for next Sun. and will let you know at practice.

Terry Lester

David-

After thinking about it and talking with other P&Z members, I think we can suggest some more ideas to Dan Muniza on the outdoor seating area.  Since the restaurant does not need the entire area, maybe they could use the front part or the middle part.  If they used the middle part, we could reclaim the front and back and put plantings and/or suitable trees.  Also, Dora suggested they use some kind of decking instead of concrete.  Maybe when P&Z meets again we can flesh out some of these ideas.  Next time you talk with Dan, please mention using only a part of the area.

Thanks,

Susan"

Mr. Lay-

After reading the news of your $60,000,000 to $80,000,000 payout, I am disg=
usted and appalled all over again.  Unfortunately, that's a daily occurrenc=
e.=20

I have been employed with Enron since May of 1993, when Enron purchased LRC=
.  I was very skeptical of Enron back then and was unsure of my future with=
 the company.  As time went on, I got more comfortable with the Enron way a=
nd learned how to survive and even be a little successful here.  I became a=
 believer in the things Enron could accomplish, a champion of our hard-nose=
d, driven executives (at least some of them).  I bought Enron stock and hel=
d on to those valuable options.

Over the last 18 months, my coworkers and I have viewed the weekly, sometim=
es daily, selling of Enron stock and exercising of options by our top execu=
tives (past and present and including you).  We came up with all kinds of r=
easons that the executives would be doing this -- they're so overly compens=
ated that they have to cash out some every now and then, divorce settlement=
s, mistress settlements, buying a new home in Aspen, buying an island in th=
e Caribbean, etc., etc. etc....  We never wanted to admit that they knew so=
mething we didn't.  Things were great, weren't they?  Jeff Skilling told us=
 that Enron was going to be the ""World's Leading Company.""  He even put the=
 goofy acronyms on his car license plate.  He told us gas traders in Februa=
ry how the stock was going to $126 by the end of the year. Now, being the c=
ynic that I am, I didn't believe the $126, although I have to admit I was h=
opeful; I figured that if Jeff had the audacity to throw out a number that =
high, then it was reasonable to expect the stock to be fairly stable, i.e.,=
 +/- 20%. =20

Needless to say, I didn't sell my stock and didn't exercise any more option=
s.  In fact, I bought more stock when it first started going down.  I'm afr=
aid that there are many more just like me.  I'm fortunate in that I have ma=
ny working years ahead of me (where, I don't know) to try to build up my sa=
vings again.  Many others are not that fortunate.  So many have spent their=
 entire careers here, helping to build this company up.  They were looking =
forward to retiring soon and enjoying the fruits of their labor.  And let m=
e remind you that their retirement accounts were in many cases a lot less t=
han a month's compensation for you.  Now even that is essentially gone.  Ot=
her employees were just ready to cash in some of their options to pay for t=
heir children's college tuition.  The stories are too numerous to list, and=
 the more I think about it, the more sickened I become.

It is painfully obvious to me and my coworkers, as well as the rest of the =
industry and Houston, that Enron's executives knew that there were skeleton=
s in the closet and began cashing in ahead of this freefall.  The employees=
 and the rest of the world were fed a bunch of half-truths and mystery mumb=
o-jumbo.  There should be an accounting for this behavior.  You and your co=
horts have ruined so many lives.  Think about that while you're spending yo=
ur millions.....

arking behind the center is open to anyone.  They prefer that it be availab=
le for Center America employees and tenants during the day, but it's wide o=
pen after 5 pm.

David Moss will be contacting everyone soon about scheduling a meeting to d=
iscuss the City's proposed landscaping ordinance.  He wanted to do that pri=
or to Comp. Plan meeting on the 30th.

Valerie-

Go with Vintage's numbers on the spreadsheet.  I have corrected the sitara ticket.  I think the problem might have been that I forgot to adjust the fuel value from the previous month.  Sorry for the mistake.

Thanks,

Hi Susan,

I got a call form Vintage Gas and they are disputing the T-port rate on KOCH P/L for July production.

Russ,

Can you please remap KOCH/Zone 4 Area 3/000464 to IF-Tetco/ELA and GDP-Tetco/ELA?

This meter was remapped to this curve last month but there were many changes on the KOCH pipeline between zones on October 1st, could that be why the mapping was changed back to the original curve?

Susan, this fix can't be done until tonight as it takes overnight to take effect.  You should see the impact in tomorrow night's P&L.

Dear Mr. Jackson-

I am writing to request that the City of West U postpone the proposed work at Colonial Park until at least late May 2002.  Over 50 girls involved in the West U Softball Association  practice at the field from February through May every year.  At this late notice, it would be very difficult for WUSA to find a replacement field near West U.  What's the harm in delaying the work a couple of months??  West U prides itself on its focus on community and families; what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to use public park space?

Sincerely,

Susan Pereira

Could not agree more and carried that argument during the meeting in
which the proposed plans were presented at Council.  Other than Marilyn
Griffin, I received no vocal support or indications of such from the
other members including the mayor.  I hope your comments are sent to
them as well.

I would also encourage you to closely examine the proposed changes to
Colonial Park (a nuance transformation from a Community Park to a
Neighborhood Park) and cost.

With the YMCA coming into city ownership next year, there should be no
problem with INDEFINITELY postponing construction at Colonial Park until
youth activities currently ongoing at Colonial can be transferred to the
YMCA.

Mayor Lewis-

I would like to recommend strongly that the City of West University postpone its work at Colonial Park until late May 2002.  At least 50-60 girls (ages 6-8) in the West U Softball Association practice at the field in Colonial Park from February through May each year.  What harm can it do to postpone the work so that the girls can play there this upcoming season?  If the field is unavailable in 2002, it will be very difficult to find suitable practice sites on such short notice, especially near West U.  West U is all about family and community; what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to use public park space?

Laurie-

Superior is right.  One of the deals listed as baseload was really term.  Christina is going to adjust the tickets.  Fill deals 778088 and 933354 first, then 939542, then the gda deal 939300.  Sorry for the confusion.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Thanks!!!  We agree on the ENA Upstream gas but the rest of the gas needs to
be reallocated.  According to my trader, the deals should be filled in the
following order:

Trigger:	 	 5,000/day   @ $4.425   ENA Deal # 778088
EFP:    		12,903/day  @ $2.895   ENA Deal # 933354
Baseload:  	2,000/day    @ $3.10     ENA Deal # 939542
Swing:   		      @ GDA      ENA Deal # 939300

Please let me know if this is not the order that your trader agrees with.

Jenna

Jenna, this is what we show in our system for Sonat.  I know it is not
right, but I wanted you to have the detail regardless.  I am going to
get with the trader to see exactly how the volume should be allocated.
I'll let you know what I find.

Susan - Here is the section of the tariff that is currently available on the TGT website that applies to our situation for October:

Customers using in-kind replacement for imbalance resolution have thirty (30) days from date of notification by Transporter to nominate and resolve their imbalances. Imbalances not resolved within this thirty (30) day period are subject to cash-out at the 5% to 10% Net Imbalance Percentage for determining the Cash-Out Index Price. The cash-out index price to be used for cash-out shall be the greater of the month in which the imbalance occurred or the month in which the imbalance is cashed out. If Customer makes a good faith effort throughout the 30 days provided for in-kind replacement of imbalance volumes, but is unable to fulfill its in-kind make-up obligations solely as a result of Texas Gas's inability to take or deliver such make-up gas, then Texas Gas will cash- out Customer's imbalance at 100% monthly average index. 

Thus for October production, since we are short gas,  the gas price would be 110% of the highest price  for October or for November.

I am going to get with Suzanne Calcagno to find out the status of the TGT tariff filings and if it is still going to be effective retro  to  October.

I just wanted to thank all the girls and the parents for the autographed t-shirt and the restaurant gift certificate.  I really appreciate it.  I had a lot of fun working with the girls.  They were all so enthusiastic and committed to the team effort.  It was very rewarding for me to see how the team came together and improved so much.  The girls have a lot to be proud of.  I hope to see everyone in the spring soccer program or next fall.  Thanks again to all the parents for your efforts and time commitment, especially to Terry, Jon and Vicki.

Have a great holiday season.

Take care,

Susan Pereira

Hi, Connie!!  Sorry I didn't get back to you on Friday.  Things got busy. =
=20

The stock is still going down, but not as much.  It's at $13.92 right now, =
yippee!!!  I'm hoping all the skeletons are out of the closet now.  I guess=
 I'll be working another 5 years or so -- I don't think the stock will get =
back to $45 or $50 until then.  There aren't any new businesses for Enron t=
o get into to make the stock analysts excited.  All the money we're making =
in trading is apparently not doing it for them. =20

Who knows what will happen to the executives who are still here?  It might =
be hard to get a concrete case against them.  I'm sure some of them are in =
the same boat as the rest of us.  Oh, news flash....ENE $13.80.....I think =
Wall Street wants Ken Lay's head on a platter.  I'm sure the stock analysts=
 are really frustrated that Jeff Skilling isn't here anymore --- they would=
 have gutted him.  Old Skilling is just grinning in his new River Oaks mans=
ion.  I think I would gut him if I crossed paths with him.  I think I shoul=
d sign up for anger management classes. =20

As for my car purchase.... yes, I traded in my Land Cruiser for a Toyota Se=
quoia.  I got a really good deal on my trade-in and paid cash for the balan=
ce.  Two days later, Renato found out from his new boss that Renato's posit=
ion was superfluous.  This boss is the only Entergy guy to survive the Ente=
rgy-Koch trading merger.  They put him in between Renato and his former bos=
s, and this guy decided that they didn't need both of them.  Entergy-Koch i=
s so small that there aren't any other comparable positions open.  The guys=
 working for Renato are sick about it.  The upper management at Entergy-Koc=
h has done a review of this Entergy guy since he told Renato to take a hike=
 ---everyone, peers and employees, told management in the review process th=
at the guy was a two-faced loser with zero personality. Of course, now, Ren=
ato has already signed off on his settlement agreement; plus, he'd never co=
nsider going back.  They are paying him through the end of the year and ves=
ting him in all the savings plans.  They are also paying him a year's salar=
y, and he's currently doing a consulting job for the pipeline.  He's been a=
ctively looking for a new job.  Hopefully, he'll find one, or I'll be worki=
ng until I'm 70!!

Oh, well.  Maybe I'll have some good news next time.....

Dear Susan,

That's just INCREDIBLE!  Is the SEC investigating all of the execs that
left?  Scott had said that they were all just crooks, but I didn't know if
maybe his opinion was a little tainted, guess it wasn't.  Julie hasn't said
much at all about anything either, just that it's not the same place
anymore.  I am so sorry for all of you with those worthless options!  What
is Lay saying he's going to do to fix this and moral???  I'm sure everyone
is ready to leave.  How did it get so bad so fast?!  Just incredible. I sur=
e
hope things are going better where Renato is working!

So, did you buy you a new SUV, you wrote that you were thinking about it.
We need something like that so bad.  We have a car that's more for sporting
around in than using in everyday use.  The problem for me here though is
parking, I HATE PARKING IN EUROPE!  So I couldn't handle anything very big
either.  I actually love those little ""Smarts"" have you seen them, I doubt
that they have any in the states, they are a little 2 seater but it has mor=
e
space in the back for shopping than our BMW does in it's trunk. AND IT'S
GREAT FOR PARKING! But all that has to wait until we get this house finishe=

and figure out if we are making any money in this business, being it's our
first year and Armin's parents made us take the business without EVER seein=

a balance sheet.  All I can say  so far, is that we are paying our bills an=

eating good!

Hope you have a good weekend, you need it I'm sure after this week.  Tell
Renato hello for me.

Take care,
Connie

Oh, Susan, I can't believe that ENE is trading soooo low!  I am so sorry for
all of you there, hopefully a miracle will happen.  But you REALLY didn't
want to retire, did you?  You're WAY too young!  The bad thing about
marrying a man so much younger is, I probably won't retire until he does and
that may be awhile since we just started our own business this year and he's
only 31.  I don#t want anyone else being the CFO of MY company, but ME!  But
the good thing is having a full time cook/maid.

Well, I heard this morning that they are expecting more terrorist attacks
this week.  You all take care.  Are people that work at Enron flying as much
as they used too?

Well, I hate to hear that things are up in the air for Renato right now, but
sounds like he got a great package.  He will find something good in no time,
I'm sure..then you just have all that extra money!

We have some American guests visiting, my sister-in-law's, cousin's, 2 sons.
They are really nice guys, 19 and 21 and they have been soooo lucky with the
weather.  It's great!  Sunshine and warm, well warm for us...like 65?.  All
the leaves are turning right now, I hope the sunshine lasts a few more days.
They are off touring around town right now, there's so much to see right
here alone, then later in the week they are headed further south to see more
castles and stuff.

Well I have to go get some work done.  Hope things start looking up over
there SOON for you all!

Later,
connie

Subject:	Way to Go, Hawks!!

I just wanted to thank all the girls and the parents for the autographed t-shirt and the restaurant gift certificate.  I really appreciate it.  I had a lot of fun working with the girls.  They were all so enthusiastic and committed to the team effort.  It was very rewarding for me to see how the team came together and improved so much.  The girls have a lot to be proud of.  I hope to see everyone in the spring soccer program or next fall.  Thanks again to all the parents for your efforts and time commitment, especially to Terry, Jon and Vicki.

Have a great holiday season.

Take care,

Susan Pereira


P.S. - Terry, could you forward this on to the Reeses, please?  I don't have their email address.  Thanks."

Valerie-

I just found out from Robert Eubank at Vintage that he was telling me the wrong thing for the gathering charges.  SLN 9205 has always had a .0981 gathering fee.  SLN 2883 gath. charges are as follows:  Sept. .0268, Oct .0628, Nov .0628.  I'll adjust the sitara tickets, but I'll have to weight average the gathering.  You'll need to fine tune it since you're dealing with the actual volumes from each wellhead point.

Thanks,

Susan

Susan, because of the way these deals are in the system, I had to shortpay Superior approx $28K for last month.  Per volume management, they cannot actualize the deals in the order listed below because meter PSNG1220 is not on deals 778088 and 939542 (days 3 & 4 specifically).  Can you make this change so that Vol Mgmt can actualize?

Thanks

Superior is right.  One of the deals listed as baseload was really term.  Christina is going to adjust the tickets.  Fill deals 778088 and 933354 first, then 939542, then the gda deal 939300.  Sorry for the confusion.

Thanks!!!  We agree on the ENA Upstream gas but the rest of the gas needs to
be reallocated.  According to my trader, the deals should be filled in the
following order:

Trigger:	 	 5,000/day   @ $4.425   ENA Deal # 778088
EFP:    		12,903/day  @ $2.895   ENA Deal # 933354
Baseload:  	2,000/day    @ $3.10     ENA Deal # 939542
Swing:   		      @ GDA      ENA Deal # 939300

Please let me know if this is not the order that your trader agrees with.

Jenna, this is what we show in our system for Sonat.  I know it is not
right, but I wanted you to have the detail regardless.  I am going to
get with the trader to see exactly how the volume should be allocated.
I'll let you know what I find.

Susan, because of the way these deals are in the system, I had to shortpay Superior approx $28K for last month.  Per volume management, they cannot actualize the deals in the order listed below because meter PSNG1220 is not on deals 778088 and 939542 (days 3 & 4 specifically).  Can you make this change so that Vol Mgmt can actualize?

They were all so enthusiastic and committed to the team effort.  It was very rewarding for me to see how the team came together and improved so much.  The girls have a lot to be proud of.  I hope to see everyone in the spring soccer program or next fall.  Thanks again to all the parents for your efforts and time commitment, especially to Terry, Jon and Vicki.

No. I have not put a new ticket in the system.  I wrote up a paper ticket and Alejandra Chavez adjusted the term  of the existing sitara ticket.  I'm not sure how it is supposed to be handled.  You might check with Alejandra and Kam Keiser.  Apparently, we've had some similar deals with other counterparties.  The NYMEX desk people told me that Credit doesn't want us paying one lump sum for unwinds.  Do you have any instructions concerning this, given our current financial situation??

I borrowed 19903 from Egan for today's gas day and I need to pay it back by Friday.  For tomorrow, I am going to over nominate Leach.  After the cuts, if any, I want to back off of Leach and take the gas to Egan to payback back part of my balance.


Here are the deal numbers and volumes.


Deal		Current Vol	After Cuts	Comment
1149149	21,000		10,000		Moves gas from CGLF Leach to TCO Leach.
1143923	31,000		20,000		Mainline to Leach Transport
1143924	49,798		38,469		Onshore to Mainline - volume may be off a little, just need to balance mainline
1161116	7,707		????		Onshore to Egan Hub transport and desk to desk.  Move the onshore balance to Egan Hub.


I may be out this afternoon.  I think we should wait until tomorrow morning to adjust these tickets, UNLESS KELLY, you feel comfortable about CGAS not allocating Leach.  


Thanks for your support."

Susan, I just spoke to Alejandra.  They will be putting this in the system as an annuity to be settled by Financial Settlements.  I will forward the invoice to them.

Laurie-

No. I have not put a new ticket in the system.  I wrote up a paper ticket and Alejandra Chavez adjusted the term  of the existing sitara ticket.  I'm not sure how it is supposed to be handled.  You might check with Alejandra and Kam Keiser.  Apparently, we've had some similar deals with other counterparties.  The NYMEX desk people told me that Credit doesn't want us paying one lump sum for unwinds.  Do you have any instructions concerning this, given our current financial situation??

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Susan, I just got an invoice from Superior for the unwinding of the Sonat trigger deal.  The invoice covers production months 12/01 through 08/02 and is for $3,761,900.00.  Have you put something in the system for this?

Thanks

I don't think anything has changed.  The transport rate is $.2421 + 0.3% fuel.  The pricing is the average + $.01.  I've emailed Tricia to see what the problem is.

Susan,

We have received our statement for September and the price has changed from
our original contract and what we have previously been paid.  The statement
shows that we are being paid three different amounts for various volumes,
rather than the average of the three prices plus $.01.  I have spoken with
Tricia Truong and she suggest I speak to you.

Also the transportation has changed on the statement.  Has this changed?

Is something in error or has the contract changed?

Thank you,

   Susan,

   I don't know if you have talked to Tricia Troung since you left me a
   message Friday.  I agree with what you said, the average of the three
   prices, plus $.01.  However the invoice, which Tricia says is what's in
   the
   ""system""  pays us on each of the prices(three different prices), for
   different volumes.  Not equal volumes,  but  a graduated scale.

   Thank you,

   Stevens

Unfortunately, I will not be able to help you sort recognitions during the 
day on Tuesday -- I can't get off work on that day.  If you are able to sort 
our troop's recognitions (troop 12357) by Tuesday evening, I would love to 
come by and pick them up.  Our last Brownie meeting is on Wednesday 
afternoon, and I wanted to get everything to our troop leader Wednesday 
morning before work.  Let me know what time would be convenient for me to 
come by.  I have a Southside Place city council meeting to attend at 7 pm but 
could come by before.....

Thanks,

We were allocated a total of 7591 mmbtu at the receipt point for November.  I 
think our contract for November is at the average of the Inside FERC  
postings for the three pipes plus a penny.  Those prices are as follows:

Transco Zone 3  $4.51
Florida Zone 3    $4.45
Sonat                      $4.47
Avg                        $4.4767  +  0.01 = $4.4867 

The same transport fee and fuel percentage as last month should be deducted 
from this price.  I think the allocated fuel was 23 mmbtu.
 
Also, keep in mind that we scheduled 31,112 mmbtu per Rebel's directions.  
ENA will have to cash out the difference with Destin (at higher prices!).

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

We will not be settling the El Paso/Stingray imbalance.  El Paso insists on 
being paid back in kind, as opposed to cashing out at prices when the 
imbalance occurred.  We'll just carry the imbalance on our books.  Maybe 
we'll pay it back next year.

Good questions!  The volumes are at the wellhead, so the fuel volumes would 
need to be deducted.  Destin has changed their fuel to 0.003%.  As for the 
prices, the Sonat gas daily prices should be reduced by $0.24 /mmbtu 
transportation.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

I have Kali on our list for Sat the 25th. If you can, send a check for $27
and that will move you to the head of the list. Prepaid riders go to an
instructor ahead of ""stand-by"" riders. If you are unsure about whether or not
Kali wants to ride, wait to pay. There are no refunds or make-ups for prepaid
lessons.

I reconciled the imbalance between Stingray and LRP, but as to who approached 
who first, I don't remember.  It was my job to resolve all imbalance 
discrepancies on LRP, and then give my findings to commercial.  As I was 
working with Sherryl Cranford at Stingray, she made it clear that they were 
anxious to get the imbalances resolved and settled as well, and that was the 
only imbalance we discussed.  I think Sherryl and I agreed to that imbalance 
sometime in september.  Whether or not they've been asking for the gas back 
since February, I don't know because I didn't deal with LRP companies until 
several months later.

Leslie-

When did we agree with El Paso/Stingray on the 11,973 dth owed to Stingray?  
Have they been asking for this gas back since February?  Did you approach 
them first on settling this?  The reason I'm asking these questions is that 
HPL had a big imbalance due them from an El Paso operated line in Texas.  HPL 
had been asking for the gas back from the beginning and El Paso finally paid 
them back in kind this month.  I do not want to pay Stingray back in kind.  I 
want to pay them Feb. 2000 IF NGPL-LA.

Thanks,

Susan

The only info I had from you is that we owed ProEnergy 11,035 mmbtu.  I asked 
you if we had any other outstanding imbalances with Cinergy or its 
precursors.  You gave me the Onyx volume, but I had already negotiated the 
deal.  Whose imbalance is the 10,644 mmbtu??

Daniel Kieran with Cinergy/Producer's Energy called me because he wanted 
clarification on something in the contract.  He thinks were forgetting about 
the imbalance due LRP of 10,644.  I thought you said the reason the price was 
so low was because that imbalance had been taken into consideration, so in a 
sense we are netting the two.  Is this correct?  Also, was the Oryx imbalance 
of (770) taken into consideration in the agreement below?

Destin does not feel comfortable with volumes yet at your meter.  They are

That should happen some time next week.  We will send you those numbers and

Leslie-

We will cashout the imbalance with the two Koch entities in the following way:

We owe Koch 11,885 mmbtu at $3.90/mmbtu, which equals $46,351.50.
Koch owes us 13,639 mmbtu at $2.21/mmbtu and 11,720 mmbtu at $2.38/mmbtu, 
which equals $58,035.79.
The net of these imbalances is $11,684.29 due to Enron.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I negotiated this with Scott Garrison 
at Koch.

The contract was mailed to Molly yesterday(9/11/00).  Let me know if she 
doesn't get it by tomorrow.

Thanks,

Susan,

We are getting very close to the start up of the Bazor Ridge plant.. When I
talked to you Friday, you were going to request that Stacy ""generate the
paper"".  Has this been done yet?  The invoicing does not appear to be an
issue any more, our controller would like us to invoice Enron and Rebel to
invoice EOTT on all products.  Also, I am assuming that you changed the
September pricing to Gas Daily, as you implied below, on August 25.  Right
now we are looking at a start up on the last 10 days or so of September.

If there are problems with any of the above, please call me a soon as you
can today at (601)969-1568.  I will be out the rest of the week.  If
anything comes up after today please contact Dan Cole at the same number.

Thank you,

Stevens

Stevens-

I've been trying to get in touch with our attorney Stacy Dickson to see if
the confirmation is signed.  The last version of the confirmation reflected
gas daily pricing for August and index pricing for Sept, Oct and Nov.  I
think we will need to amend this if the time periods are going to be
different.

I'll let you know when I hear back from Stacy.

Susan,

As I understand it (which could be dangerous), if it comes on in 1st, 2nd
week of September we have to use Gas Daily, is this correct?  Our comtract
calls for the time period to be 3 months, after the 1st day following the
first month of production.  This would carry the contract through,
December.

Also, the operator of Destin pipeline is still telling the operator of the
well that Enron does not have a shipping agreement in place.  I have told
them that Enon is telling us they are ready to recieve.

EOTT driver training has been rescheduled for the mornings of 9/5 and 9/6.
DuFore driver training has been rescheduled to the afternoon of 9/5.  I
expect to have residue gas for sale between 9/2 and 9/6, depending on how
well plant commissioning goes.

Let me know if you require any additional information.

How have you come with the question I (actually the producer) had about the
contracts, and being able to change some of the lanuage.  They are looking
to be up and running in the next two weeks.

I'll give you a call tomorrow sometime.

Kathy-

Thanks for the email.  Kali was not able to make last Sunday's game due to a 
schedule conflict that I had.  Plus, she will not go to the last game because 
her best friend's birthday party is at the same time.  I had her skip another 
friend's party to make the one game she did participate in (all the softball 
girls schedule their parties on Sunday so as not to conflict with those 
games!!).  If it's not too late, do not order a trophy for her.  She really 
was never much of a team participant.  I'm hoping her enthusiasm this fall 
will be like last fall and not this spring.  Thanks for all your help, time 
and effort.

Susan Pereira

P.S.-
Do you know who some of the U10 girls coaches will be??  Will you be 
coaching?  I did not sign up to coach because I may asst. coach my son's U6 
team."

That sounds great!!  We're looking forward to the trip as well.  The kids are 
anxious to have Alexia and Sebastien here to play with.  I don't know if 
there are any activities in particular that Alexia and Sebastien want to do, 
but I know Kali and Michael would be happy just to play at home and swim.  
Mayba a movie or two.  By the way, we just saw Spy Kids for the second time.  
If it's playing down there, you ought to take the kids.  Alexia will 
especially enjoy it.

See you soon.

Love,

Susan

Hi Susan,
??? How's it going?? I  firmed up everything with the travel agent 
yesterday.? I still don't have a  price to give you because the hotel hasn't 
set one yet for the ground portion  (that's life in Brazil!), but it will be 
somewhere in the range that I had said  earlier.? 
??? Everything is all set and  reserved, and as soon as we have a price I'll 
purchase them.? So for the  time being don't worry about writing a check and 
I'll get back with you when  it's all finalized.? I'm really looking forward 
to having the kids return  with us and having you guys come down...it's going 
to be a lot of  fun!
??? Talk with you  soon..............Jan

Thanks for your help.  It sounds like your girl scout outings are a little 
more exotic than ours.  Our last event was an overnight campout in one of the 
girls' backyards.  The girls had a lot of fun.  I was lucky and didn't have 
to volunteer.  Michael got to be an only child for the night and got all the 
attention.  He loves it when Kali spends the night away!!

Talk to you soon.

can give a check to Papi  and he can deposit it for us there.

Hi Susan,
??? Went by the travel agent's  today to see what she found for your trip to 
Foz.? I'm still waiting on  some confirmed prices but a strong estimate would 
be between R$1,000 to R$1,300  and depending on the exchange it would be 
between US$500 and US$650 per  person.? The price includes airfare, hotel 2 
nights, complimentary  breakfast all mornings, transport from and to airport, 
english speaking guide  and driver (he also takes you to the Argentina side), 
tours on the Brazil and  Argentina sides, boat tour at the bottom of the 
falls, and a tour of the aviary  of tropical birds of Brazil.? There's also a 
helicopter tour you can take  but it's not included in the price.? This is 
with TAM airline.?  
??? We would stay in Rio Sunday,  Monday and then on Tuesday you and Renato 
would leave Rio around 11am and arrive  in Foz around 2:30 and get to the 
hotel around 3:30.? You would spend all  day Wednesday there and leave 
Thursday at 3:30 to arrive in SP at  5:00PM.
??? When she confirms the prices  I'll send you all the details.? Until then, 
let me know what you think of  this so far.

Roy Anne-

Will the last brownie meeting be on the afternoon of May 9?  We have early 
dismissal that day.  The recognitions for the cookie sale may not be 
available until the evening of the 9th.  I've emailed the coordinator to see 
if we can get them earlier.

Thanks,

Is there any chance that the recognitions will be available prior to May 9?  
Our troop is having its last meeting before the summer on the afternoon of

David-

If I want to communicate with the other commission members, am I supposed to 
funnel it through you?  If so, I want to find out if anyone is interested in 
setting up a table at the carnival (April 21) to solicit public opinion on 
P&Z issues.  We could set up next to the tree committtee or share a table.  
I'll be at the carnival until about 3 pm; however, I'll be working from 
12-2.  Also, we could solicit public opinion outside the clubhouse on 
election day, May 5.  I could do that anytime before 4 pm.  Anyone else 
interested???

I went ahead and scheduled Kali to do the GSWEC camp the first two sessions.  
I've only put the deposit down, so I can get that money back if we decide to 
do the Blue Fox Farm camp instead.  Hopefully, we'll have that info the first 
week in May.  Marla is planning on signing up Blakely for the second session 
there, pending what the Blue Fox Farm schedule looks like.  I think Anna 
Edelman is also interested.  I left a message with Sue today letting her know 
that I was reserving a spot for Kali at GSWEC just in case the Blue Fox Farm 
doesn't work.

Subject: FW: Project GEM/Windows2000 Deployment Migration


I wanted to take a few minutes to not only introduce myself, but also to 
inform you that ProjectGEM - the Windows2000 Global Enron Migration - is well 
underway and is now approaching your group to begin the initial steps of 
upgrading to this newer operating system.
 
Along with upgrading the O/S, Enron has also took the initiative to move over 
to Microsoft Outlook2000, for our messaging client.  This will provide more 
flexibility and ease-of-use for e-mail, calendars, contacts -- not to mention 
an easier medium to synchronize data to your handheld devices.
 
I would like to start the migration process first with visiting with each of 
you, going thru a 'profile process' that should last no more than 10-15min.  
Profiling can begin as early as tomorrow (4/17/01) - so here is what I ask of 
you:
 
*** Please reply to this e-mail with a date/time that I can stop by.  Being 
that most of you sit in the same, general location - I'm hoping this 
profiling process should take no more than a few days. ***
 
Feel free to e-mail/call me should you have any questions or any specific 
concerns with this process, as we strive to ensure the migration from WinNT 
to Win2K is a smooth, efficient one.



Thank you,

Susan,

I hear you are covering for Andy Ring the next couple of weeks.....

We only had two NYMEX match-ups for April, one with ABG Gas Supply (sitara 
#700336) and one with El Paso Merchant.
Andy entered them in Sitara, and I was able to find the deal with ABG Gas 
Supply, but can not find the deal with El Paso.
Could you or somebody in your group possibly find the relevant deal-number ?

I appreciate your help !

Same transport & fuel deductions.

As for the BTU issue, Joe has talked with the Destin people several times

out.  Joe will call again today.  Sorry about the delay, but we really have

Hi Susan,
    I would think that 2 nights , 3 days is plenty for Rio.  We could arrive
Sunday  see Corcovado, P?o de A?ucar, Tijuca rainforrest, and a few outlying
beaches.  Then late Tuesday afternoon the 10th you and Renato could fly out
for Foz.  Depending on the flight schedules you may have to wait until early
Wednesday morning the 11th. I think that Tuesday would be better so you're
not feeling rushed, but we'll see what flight times are offered.  Spend two
nights at Foz and fly into SP late Thursday evening the 12th.  Hang around
the house on Friday, put your suitcases together and head back for Houston
that evening.
    Too bad you're not able to spend more time here, but given what time you
have I think you'll be seeing the two most interesting places in Brazil. All
of the others, Amazon, Pantanal, Bahia all take so much travel time to get
there that it's not even really worth the attempt to see them.   If you do
decide on Foz, don't mess with packing your coats, it'll be easier to borrow
some of ours.
    The travel agent is looking at fares, etc. so I'll let you know what she
finds.
I'll be in touch.............Jan

Jan-

I was looking at the wrong week.  Sorry, stress and sleep deprivation are my 
only excuses.  How much time should we spend in Rio?  Should we leave for Foz 
on the 11th?  I just heard about the Cataratas this morning from Scott Neal.  
That was the place he suggested and that sounds great.  I'll work on Renato 
when he gets back in town.  

Thanks,

Hi susan,
??? Glad to hear that you're  interested in the Foz.? I think it would be a 
great trip for you to take,  although I'm confused about the dates of the 4th 
and 5th.? Don't forget,  the six of us will be in Ilha de Comandatuba for the 
week of June 30 til July  7th.? If we stick to the original schedule we would 
all be getting into  S?o Paulo Saturday the 7th.? The driver would pick up 
you and Renato  and you guys would arrive at the house a few hours before 
us.?  
???? What could easily work  is for all of us to go to Rio on Sunday the 8th, 
spend a few days there and  then, you and Renato could fly directly to Foz 
from Rio and the kids and I would  drive back to s?o Paulo.? You guys could 
then fly into S?o  Paulo from Foz.
??? The hotel I would suggest at  the Foz is the Cataratas.? It's located 
within walking distance of the  falls on the Brazil side and set inside the 
national reserve forrest with all  kinds of walking trails.? They might offer 
a service to get to the  Argentina side of the falls, I'll check into that.? 
If not you just take a  taxi or car service.? 
??? When we went we stayed at  Mabu which had all of these thermal swimming 
pools, large grounds, pond  etc.? It was more for the kids to enjoy.? Our 
kids liked the falls but  after walking on one side of it had no interest for 
the other.........too much  walking.? It would be a nice get-away for the two 
of you I  think.
??? I'll check into flights and  hotels today and let you know what I find 
out.? I haven't heard much about  Hotel Conial Igua?a, I'll see what I can

Jan-

I checked the website for the hotels at Foz.  The tourism website is down.  
It looks like  a great place.  I'll have to convince Renato to go (you know, 
he might miss out on working out for one day).  I think the kids might like 
it too.  Did Alexia and Sebastien like it or was it too much walking?  I 
asked my boss about it.  He went with his family when he was living in 
Argentina.  They really enjoyed it.  Can you go ahead and check on flights 
and which hotel to stay at?  The Hotel Colonial Iguacu e Spa looked like the 
nicer one on the internet.  I imagine the flights will be cheaper booking 
them there.  Is that right?  Let me know the airline and I'll check here.  I 
guess we would go on July 4 and return on July 5.  Also, would y'all want to 
go as well?

Thanks for your help.

We have a shirt and we really want her to be a part of the team- I know that
the format -- with practices with 2 teams combined with Spring Break and bad
weather have made it a little difficult to have the same feeling that we all
did with our little micro teams but I know she would like the other girls on
the team and have fun! I'll make sure Roy brings her shirt to practice on
Thursday. Thanks for letting me know about this and we''ll work together to

Susan:

Staff has received the following RFP documents.

Civic Design
Wilbur Smith Associates
Vernon G. Henry and Associates

I will be leaving you a copy of the RFP at your house this evening.

As three days is required for public posting, staff would like to schedule a
meeting of members to review and score the written proposals.

Would you be available on May 21, 22 or 24?  A budget workshop with council
is scheduled for May 23.

Interviews are scheduled for May 29.

Please advise staff as to these available dates for you.  I would be more
than happy to e-mail the other members based upon your comments.

Kathy-

I got your message.  Kali has been going to the Thursday practices, with the 
exception of the last three weeks due to rainout, spring break and a going 
away party for a friend.  She'll be there on this Thursday.  Do you have a 
uniform for her?  Maybe she would feel part of the team if she gets a shirt 
and has that for the next game.  I'll try to work on her.

Thanks,

Ok, here's the plan.....

Kali and Michael will leave for Brazil with y'all on Wed. the 27th on the 
evening flight (?).  Let me know the exact Continental flight number so we 
can make the reservations.  We'll get the seat assignments coordinated later 
I guess.

Renato and I will take a flight out of Houston on the evening of July 6, 
arriving Saturday morning.   The four of us will return to Houston on the 
next Fri. night flight (13th).  I think we've decided not to go to Foz do 
Iguacu, since we have so little time.  Instead, we'd like to go to Rio for a 
few days.  Can we all go together and drive.  Maybe you could get hotel 
reservations there?

Let me know what you think.   We're excited about the trip.  The kids can't 
wait.

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Hi, Jan.  I hope you are all doing well.  Maman has updated us on your 
mother's condition.  I know it must be stressful, especially from long 
distance.  Kali liked her birthday gifts.  Believe it or not, we didn't 
already have the World Pup movie. We had rented it back in February and the 
kids liked it.

I'm not sure if you got my last email before we left on vacation, but I was 
wondering what your travel schedule was in June.  When will you be arriving, 
when will you be returning (Kali has warmed up to the idea of travelling 
without us on the plane), etc.  The earliest we could leave for Brazil would 
be the evening of Friday, July 6.  We would probably need to return to 
Houston by July 14.  Let me know how that sounds.  Also, if we need to 
reschedule for another time until you get things straight for your mother, 
let me know.  That's certainly more important.

Talk to you soon.....

Susan"

In the past, Jesse would let me know about our imbalance and cashout price.  
He would do the paperwork and trade out of the imbalance with another party.

Brenda,
Victor and I totally agree with you.  With the increase of wellhead 
production and swings that we are seeing, we are totally revisiting the way 
we handle wellhead.  Beginning with March we will be taking a closer look at 
what our production is doing and will enter appropriate cash out tickets on 
Venice.  

Just to let you know, we are going through the process of looking at wellhead 
production on all our pipes and at what is the best method to handle.

Venice invoices for cashout on a one month lag.  The February invoice cashed 
out the January  volume of <19,385> at $6.8121 for a total credit of 
$132,052.55.  The imbalance for February production is  <4455> and to trade 
the imbalances, VGS must be notified in writing on or before the 25th of 
March.

There are no cashout tickets for VGS on the CPR cashout reports that I ran 
for January and February production.  From looking back at several months of 
invoices, we appear to get cashed out every month.  Would it be possible to 
have cashout tickets entered for VGS?

If you have see any problems with the imbalance volumes reflected on the 
invoice, please let me know. 

Thanks,
Brenda

Just want you to know I received and checked your  paperwork.? It's nice to 
get a head start on things, thanks!? I did  not find a T5 - which is OK as 
long as you hadn't turned one in with cash and I  missed it.
?
I did make a minor adjustment which you'll need to  know about when 
distributing the recognitions.? The donated box of cookies  had to be to be 
assigned to a girl, so I gave it to Kendra Muecke.? She  originally sold 49, 
and with the extra box, she is at the level to receive the  patch and face 
stickers. You'll get the extra patch and stickers kit with your  stuff in May.

David-

I got the email you forwarded to me.  Have you responded to Suzanne 
Sugarbaker yet?  I would be happy(?) to talk with her, so please feel free to 
forward my email address to her.  If I don't hear back from you today, I will 
probably email Suzanne directly this weekend.  Maybe I can clarify a few 
issues with her.  As for Cindy Colvin's ""presentation,"" I've spoken with 
Richard Rothfelder on how we might handle future situations like this.  In 
the meantime, I'm taking extra vitamins to thicken my skin.  

Let me know what responses you receive today on the RFP.  I know we will need 
to schedule a committee meeting in the next week or so.

Thanks,

Susan

P.S.-
Please email me back today at our home email address :  
pereira@houston.rr.com.  I'm leaving early for a doctor appt.

Susan,

I know you are quite busy with other items, but have you had time to
discuss the BTU protest with the Enron attorneys?  As I told you before,
Rebel would be more than happy to write ""the letter"", but I believe it will
have to be submitted by Enron as the shipper.

Thanks,

Stevens

Hi, Jan!  I don't know if you'll get this, but Maman said your email was back 
in business (my words, not hers!).  I asked the kids about going ahead to 
Brazil with y'all.  Michael will do whatever; Kali was a little hesitant.  
When do you think you'll be coming here and when do you think you'll leave.  
We'll need to coordinate the travel schedules.  We're going to use OnePass 
miles for at least two tickets, so we'll need to finalize things in early 
April to get seats.

Talk to you soon.

Susan

P.S.-  Happy Birthday early!!"

Renato and I are already signed up to work Kali's class booth and our son's 
class booth--all at different times.  I don't think we'll  be able to help 
all afternoon at one booth, but if something changes I would be more than 
happy to help Mary out.

Subject: Field and Fair booth on Friday, May 4th


Dear Second Grade parents, 

Our class booth is the pinata booth and the booth chair is Mary Rothwell. 
?As  
you may know, she is expecting a baby in early April. ?She is still willing  
to run the booth and prepare the pinatas before the fair but will need  
someone to help her that day since she will have her newborn with her. ? 
Duties would begin mid morning with setup and continue until 2:30 or 3:00  
with cleanup. ?During F& F hours from 11:00 - 3:00 her helper would need to  
help run the booth, hanging the pinatas from the tree, collecting tickets,  
etc. ?There are also several parent volunteer hourly slots that have not 
been  
filled - one slot from 1:00 - 2:00 and two slots from 2:00- 3:00. 

Could any of you help with any of this? ?If so, please email me and I will  
let her know. 

Thanks! 
Margaret Pierce 
Room Parent

Stevens,

Joe put a call into Destin today, but our contact was out.  Once we talk to 
the right person and find out exactly what needs to be done, I think we would 
be very interested in having Rebel draft the letter.  I'll let you know as 
soon as I know...

Susan,

I have told Rebel that you and I have discussed the BTU issue and the
complaint.  Harvey Petter with Rebel has offered to draft a letter.  Would
this be acceptable for you?  If it meets with Enron's approval it could be
sent by your office.  It might save you and your attorneys a lot of time,
but that is not how you might want to handle it.

Let me know.

Stevens

Hi, Elise.  Sorry to bother you, but when Kali was unwrapping her presents
last night, there were two without cards or tags (probably lost in
transit!!).  We narrowed it down to Laura and Sofi.  So that we can get the
thank you notes correct, did Laura give Kali  a Skipper doll or a bath set
in a blue bag?  Thanks for your help.

P.S.- We ended up selling 131 boxes at the booth on Saturday.

Helen-

I don't think we will be able to do group lessons during the week, but, just 
for grins, what is the time of the Tuesday afternoon class?  How many kids 
are in the class and who is the instructor?  Also, are there any group 
lessons on the weekends that my daughter Kali might participate in?  Are the 
classes large?

Thanks,

Susan Pereira"

Since we last emailed, something has come up on Sunday afternoon.  Would it 
be possible to do the lesson earlier, like 11 am or noon?  Or, Kali has 
Monday the 19th off and could do a lesson anytime that day.

Thanks,

Looks fine, Jan.  Thanks for taking care of this for us.  Let me know the 
exact amount if the exchange rate changes.  I'll give a check to Papi to 
deposit in your account.  

I hope you are all doing well.  Maman told us of your struggles to get the 
medication you need.  I hope things work out.  How are the kids doing?  Kali 
and Michael are very excited that school is almost out--just two more weeks.  
They can't wait for Alexia and Sebastien to get here.

See you soon..

Hi, Jan!  I hope you are all doing well.  I'm sorry to hear that your mother 
is ill.  I'm sure it's frustrating to be so far away.  

I know you have other things on your mind right now, but I wanted to check 
with you about our visiting this summer.  We were thinking about the second 
week in July.  We have not made any definitive plans.  Let me know if that 
will work.  If this summer doesn't work, we can always try next summer...

Take care.

Hello U of Chicago Recruiting Team,

I am about to bombard you with all of the resumes that have been submitted 
for summer internship with Enron..  We are needing to choose 12 candidates to 
invite, with about six alternates.  We are having two schedules which means 
that will be interviewing 24 people total.  The Career Placement office 
requires that 50% of you list be open for bid, therefore 12 candidates will 
be open.

I am going to forward the e-mails that have the resumes attached. Please 
review and choose 12 invites and 6 alternates.

I am also going to forward the teams commitment to participation as it stands 
so far.

We will be needing 4 interviewers day one and 2 on day two.

Let us try and meet on Tuesday to discuss the resumes.  We need to have our 
choices to the Career Placement Office.  Please let me know what time is good 
for Tuesday.

Thanks -=- Paul L.

Sorry for delay, it's been real busy.? On the practice schedules, the only 
switch I have made is to put the 2? 7:40 sessions back to 5:30 to 6:30.? 
Assuming they will have smaller attendance, I am asking Nebo to only schedule 
1 trainer for each session.? We will plan on using half of the Pershing 
middle field unless the Pershing Large field is empty. 

See how this works, I am putting this into effect with Nebo's trainers unless 
I hear any objections by tomorrow evening.? Let's plan on charging $40 per

Dave-

There are several little features that EOL traders such as myself would like 
to see on the website and stack manager.  I realize that there may be bigger 
issues being worked on currently, but would it be possible for EOL to survey 
Enron traders as well as outside traders on suggestions for enhancements??  
For example, I'd like to be able to sort completed trades by date on stack 
manager.  Also, it would be nice if we could have a shading feature on the 
website, so people could shade products different colors.  This might cut 
down on trades made in error.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira"

Subject: Any Petal Gas Storage Issues?

As reported previously in the trade press, Petal Gas Storage has decided to 
build its own pipeline to connect its storage facility in Forrest Co., MS to 
interconnections with Southern Natural, Destin, and Transco in Clarke and 
Jasper Cos., MS.  We have received FERC's notice of the application (Docket 
No. CP01-69), and will be filing an intervention before the February 20 
deadline.  Southern Company Services has contracted for the full 700,000 
Mcf/day of capacity for a term of 20 years.  The project calls for about 59 
miles of 36-inch pipeline and a 9,000 HP compressor station at a cost of 
about $94,343,700.

As part of its application, Petal also submitted pro forma tariff provisions 
and rates for firm and interruptible transportation services and asked for 
authority to charge negotiated rates.  Petal also requested approval of 
certain deviations from the pro forma transportation agreement for the 
contract with Southern, apparently to allow Southern to act as agent for its 
affiliated operating electric utilities to apportion capacity among them.

Please advise if you have any issues with Petal that should be made a part of 
our intervention.  The certificate application is 635 pages, not including 
another 778 pages for the environmental reports, so I'm not going to request 
a copy unless someone indicates a desire to review it.

The three indices are 9.81,9.89 and 9.97;  the average is $9.89.  So, the 
contract price is $9.89 + .01 less .2422 transport on the net of fuel 
volumes.  If you invoice on gross volumes you will need to deduct the value 
of the fuel (0.3%).

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Susan and John:

Staff would like to reschedule the tentative Tuesday P & Z meeting.

City council members are also set to meet on this date for a elevated
tower/cell tower workshop.

I had envisioned a 30 minute meeting with P & Z members to finalize the last
remaining item (driveway distance from right-of-way) at the Tuesday meeting
before council's workshop.

However, I have since received a letter and sketch from CenterAmerica
concerning the demolition of Weiner's.  CenterAmerica is proposing a 3 to 4
story development consisting of retail on the first floor and a self-storage
facility on the remaining floors.

Staff would like to begin discussion with P & Z on this CenterAmerica
proposed project.

Would you be available on either Wednesday (February 7) or Thursday
(February 8) at
7:00 P.M. for a longer meeting?

Sorry about that! I've been sick and I guess I forgot. We had the show last

This weekend, Sat or Sun at 3PM should be fine. Let me know which works for

I don't want to promise too far in advance because of the erratic party

Kali Pereira was not able to make the lesson on Sunday the 21st due to car 
trouble.  By my calculations, she has taken 3 private lessons since and 
including Dec 31, leaving an $89 balance of the $170.  That would allow for 3 
additional private lessons.  What days and times will work over the next few 
weeks?  Saturdays and Sundays will work depending on the time.  After school 
during the week might work, with the exception of Mondays.

Thanks,

Ruth-

I've been trying to call you back since last night, but your line is always 
busy.  I'd be happy to drive on Saturday.  Shall I call everyone?  Other than 
Jazz and Kali, I'll need to pick up Francie, Angela and Amy, right?  Any more?

Thanks,

Kali Pereira was not able to make the lesson on Sunday the 21st due to car 
trouble.  By my calculations, she has taken 3 private lessons since and 
including Dec 31, leaving an $89 balance of the $170.  That would allow for 3 
additional private lessons.  What days and times will work over the next few 
weeks?  Saturdays and Sundays will work depending on the time.  After school 
during the week might work, with the exception of Mondays.

Thanks,

Unfortunately, I will not be able to help you  sort recognitions during the

sort our troop's recognitions (troop 12357)  by Tuesday evening, I would
love to come by and pick them up.? Our  last Brownie meeting is on Wednesday
afternoon, and I wanted to get  everything to our troop leader Wednesday
morning before work.? Let me  know what time would be convenient for me to
come by.? I have a  Southside Place city council meeting to attend at 7 pm
but could come by  before.....

Whoops!  I goofed.  The transport deduct on gross volumes (including fuel

My understanding is that our deal converted to the average of three IF 
indices + .01 (less transport and fuel) effective November thru February.  

The November price would then be $4.4767 + .01 = $4.4867 less $.2422 less 
0.3% fuel.
The December price would be $5.9967 + .01 = $6.0067 less $.2422 less 0.3% 
fuel.

Please let me know if this is not your understanding.  Also, please keep in 
mind ENA has taken losses on cashing out negative imbalances on this 
production.

Stevens-

I wanted to clarify with you the transportation costs on Destin.  The 
transportation rate is $.24/MMBtu and the ACA charge is $.0022/MMBtu.  This 
should be deducted from the net volumes received on our transportation 
contract.   The net volumes are the volumes allocated to our contract for 
redelivery after 0.3% fuel in kind has been deducted from the gross volumes 
at the receipt point into Destin.  If you bill us on gross volumes, then you 
must deduct the value of the fuel as well as the $.2422/mmbtu in 
transportation costs from the pipeline.  From my calculations, deducts from 
gross volumes would be $.258 in Oct., $.2556 in Nov. and $.2602 in Dec.   
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Susan Pereira

Dear Debra,

The measurements for 005 are 16"" for the necklace and 7 1/2"" for the jacla,  
006
is 15 1/2"" for the necklace and 5"" for the jacla, and the internet necklace
measures 13"" and 7"" for the jacla.  Also included is a necklace that you might
be interested in.  It matches up very well and the jacla has spiny oster on 
the
tip.  It has a price of $425 and measures 15 1/2"" and 7"" for jacla.

Thank you,

Debra,

I noticed on one of the Deal #'s listed below, Deal # 231047,  is under the 
counterparty Duke Energy Field Services, Inc. I was wondering if that Deal # 
is a type-o or if it should stand as is, since the subject is dealing with 
Tristar Gas Marketing Company I would think it should be different than what 
is listed? Please let me know.

Thanks,
Corey

Yes, Clinton is a sub of Enron.  As far as percentage of ownership, I am not

their transactions.

Hello,

Debra, can you please forward by e-mail a copy of our GISB template to Robin 
for delivery to her customer for review.

Robin, our GISB is a standardized contract that very rarely contains any 
specific credit covenants.  I do not provide credit terms to Legal for GISB 
contracts and they do not keep me informed of any's execution.  Should you 
like to have your customer review an Enfolio Master Firm Purchase Sale 
Agreement, I would more than happy to oblige with credit terms.  (note:  
Debra and the rest of the commodity legal group is attending a legal 
conference in Austin and will not be returning until Monday)

Sorry to hear about your car, been there.  Are we doing anything tonight?  I 
have not heard from anyone?   I would like to check things out at the church 
in Bz, but confess I would want someone to drive, and knowing that area it 
might not be the target rich environment we are looking for.  But, you never 
know!  

 I have plans to help you move next weekend if  you are still going on Sat.   
I am anxious to see the changes in your new home.  If  I do not see you this 
weekend, let me what time and where for Sat.

With regards to our discussion concerning ENA verses ECC,  the delivery point 
will determine which company to use.  If the delivery point is a border 
point, I will write and agreement for you with ENA.  Also, if the deal is 
made in Houston I can write the agreement.

I hope this is helpful.  Please let me know if I can be of further

I pulled Dan in to listen to the voice mail.  Dan says, to go ahead and write 
a new Master under the new name w/ whom ever the guarantor is as long as you 
are comfortable with this.  After the new agreement is executed, we can move 
the old transactions over to the new Master as necessary.

With regards to Heartland's legal stauts, I will do the due diligence. 

Have a good time!!!!

PG&E Texas Industrial would like to setup a GISB under HPLC.  We currently 
have one with ENA, and they are telling me that they can not do business with 
HPLC until they get an agreement in place.  Would you please send to Steve 
Kennedy with PG&E Texas Industrial (Fax 713-371-6906) the information he 
needs for him to send us a GISB.

If possible, could we send that today.  If not, tomorrow at the lastest.  If 
that can not happen please call me and give a status so I can call Mr. 
Kennedy and give him an ETA.

Thank you!

Debra,

We've mistakenly written up an Annex B for the referenced Counterparty as if 
the deal were Financial.  Can you please create the correct Annex B with the 
same Credit Terms as the attached below and forward to Jennifer Blay in the 
Physical Confirmations area?  If you have any questions, please call John 
Suttle.  Correct Deal # is ni3797.

thanks,
Joe Hunter

Global shows there is a Master Spot ,Master Firm Purchase / Sale, and Master 
Sale Spot  in place w/ Gulf.  There is no need to send this ""Annex B"" with 
the confirm as this language is generally in each of these  Masters 
currently.   

Please let me know which agreement you confirm under.

Debra,

Attached is the requested electronic version of the WPSC contract and
Corporate Guaranty sent to Enron 12/14.  Given the cold weather conditions,
WPSC is very anxious to get this agreement executed.  Hopefully, given the
time we all spent resolving contract issues, this contract can be executed
and sent to WPSC this week.

Please call me if you foresee any problem with this timetable.

Thanks,
Kim

I have sent a Gas Purchase Agreement as requested to Jim Shanner for 
signature.  Are there any transactions which need to be confirmed under the 
new agreement??  

Mr. Shanner is curious as to price etc.  Could you contact him regarding this 
issue and let me know.

Thanks!

I don't think so.  I bought the gas based on Index, no fixed price.

Good Morning Bob and Happy Holidays to you -
Hope things are going well with you and Enron North America (""ENA"").
Earlier this week, I assumed a new role at Constellation Power Source, Inc.,
which will give the opportunity to ""reconnect"" with many of the contract
administration and legal professionals I worked with during my years at
MEGA. I look forward to working with you once again.

In light of the upcoming addition to our wholesale energy business, this
email confirms our request to establish a gas purchase and sale agreement
between your organization and Constellation Power Source, Inc.(""CPS"").
According to our business structure, our affiliate company in Houston, TX,
Constellation Energy Source, Inc.(""CES""), was previously handling all of the
wholesale natural gas business on behalf of our organization.  It is
expected that CES will cease operations by April '01 and the wholesale gas
trading activity will be conducted through our newly formed Gas Desk located
within the CPS' offices in Baltimore, MD. I have already contacted CES in an
attempt to gather contracts and determine whether an assignment or the
termination and reissuing of a new agreement between us would be the most
feasible mean to proceed with our gas trading activity in a timely fashion.

ENA  has been identified by our Gas Desk as one of the potential
counterparties for gas trading in the year 2001.  CPS will initiate gas
trading as early as January 29th, 2001. Considering this, I am looking
forward to receiving a copy of your master agreement for our review and
consideration.  Such can be forwarded to me via email at the earliest
convenience.

I thank you in advance for your assistance and prompt response to our
request and look forward to working with you in the near future.  Do not
hesitate to contact me if there are any further inquiries to this request.
I will make a note to follow up with you during the first week of January
'01.

Vangie McGilloway

James,

Section 13.5 With regards to choice of law,  this is a Texas contract.  We 
will agree to New York or Texas law.   The gas is to be delivered in the 
United States?  

Before we go further, let us resolve this point then proceed.

Thanks for your call this morining.   As stated,  I am unaware of any changes 
in our agreements or terms with regards to Canadian  companies or

that name in our credit departments.  Do you have a phone number for this guy?

Dear Debra,

Here are four dead pawn necklaces with the jacla.  Three are Navajo and
one is Santa Domingo.  The Santa Domingo is the necklace that keeps the
same shape throughout the whole piece.  The most expensive necklace is
going to be an older piece, and it is a nice piece which uses turquoise
between beads instead of heishe.
price 005s.jpg $425 (ahy 443)
price 006s.jpg $325 (ajj 323)
price 007s.jpg $750 (ahp 119)
price 008s.jpg $175 (ahg 595)

Please let me know if this is not what you had in mind.  We have a large
selection of necklaces with the jacla.  The price range is going to go
from $100 - $8000.

Thank you,
Jason Arsenault

Tracy,

Enron North America Corp. does not cover trades with Enron Canada.  For gas 
delivery in Canada, you should consider an agreement with Enron Canada.  

Also,  for long term firm transactions with ENA, you should have a Master 
Agreement.  I hope this clears up any confusion.  If not, please give me a 
call.

Wanda,

I will prepare a GISB draft and send your way next week.  With regards to a 
Master with HPL, a draft  was sent  for HPL  in October of 19 of which I am 
sending for your review.    Online trades at this time are for firm 
transactions only.

So is this all you have to do?  What's going on with work and the bar?  And 
how about that love life?   Miss you here.  We need a good law clerk.  Want 
to come back?  Have  you been in the dark?

Steve,

The necessary information for ENA has been placed in the attached draft as 
well as a few modifications to the front page.  In addition,  I have 
included  at the end of the GISB a list of Special Provisions for your 
review.  

Finally,  with regards to ""agent"",  would you fax me a copy of the Agency 
Agreement,  or is it possible for the agreement to be in the name of Murphy 
Exploration & Production Company.

ENFOLIO MASTER FIRM PURCHASE/SALE AGREEMENT

GUARANTY AGREEMENT

 This Guaranty Agreement (this ""Guaranty""), dated as of ________, is made and 
entered into between ________________, a ___________ corporation (""Guarantor
""), and ______________________, a _____________ ___________ (""Contract 
Party"").

 WHEREAS, (i) Contract Party and ____________________, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Guarantor (""Obligor""), are contemplating entering into an 
ENFOLIO Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement of even date here-with and herein 
incorporated for all purposes (said Agreement, as the same may be from time 
to time extended, amended and supplemented, particularly including, without 
limitation, all Transactions thereunder, the ""Gas Contract""), (ii) Guarantor 
will directly or indirectly benefit from the Gas Contract and (iii) as a 
condition precedent to the consummation of the Gas Contract, Contract Party 
has required that Guarantor unconditionally guarantee to Contract Party all 
payment obligations of Obligor under the Gas Contract.

 NOW THEREFORE, to induce Contract Party to enter into the Gas Contract, 
Guarantor agrees as follows: 
 
1.  PAYMENT GUARANTY.  Guarantor absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally 
guarantees to Contract Party all payment obligations of Obligor set forth in 
the Gas Contract and interest thereon accrued as provided in the Gas Contract 
(the ""Obligations""); provided, the applicable rate of interest shall never 
exceed the maximum lawful rate permitted by law.  This guaranty of payment is 
a continuing guaranty effective during the term of the Gas Contract and until 
complete performance by Obligor of its obligations under the Gas Contract and 
payment in full of all Obligations; provided, in all instances this Guaranty 
shall continue for a period of six months after the termination of the Gas 
Contract for the purpose of guaranteeing indemnity Obligations which survive 
the termination of the Gas Contract as set forth in Section 8.4 of the Gas 
Contract (the ""Indemnity Period"").  With respect to any Claims threatened or 
filed as of the close of the Indemnity Period, the Obligations resulting from 
any such Claims shall be guaranteed hereunder.  No notice of the Obligations 
or any Transaction need be given in any form to Guarantor at any time and 
Guarantor WAIVES any such notice and the right to consent to the Obligations 
or any Transaction.  Guarantor WAIVES any right to require as a condition to 
its obligations hereunder that (i) collateral be applied to the Obligations, 
(ii) presentment or demand be made upon Obligor or (iii) action be brought 
against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, should 
Contract Party seek to enforce the obligations of Guarantor.  Specifically, 
without limitation, Guarantor WAIVES any right to require, substantively or 
procedurally, that (i) a judgment previously be rendered against Obligor or 
any other person or entity except Guarantor, (ii) Obligor or any other person 
or entity be joined in any action against Guarantor or (iii) an action 
separate from one against Guarantor be brought against Obligor or any other 
person or entity.  The obligations of Guarantor are several from those of 
Obligor or any other person or entity, including, without limitation, any 
other surety for Obligor, and are primary payment obligations concerning 
which Guarantor is the principal obligor.  To the extent Obligor shall fail 
to timely make payment of any Obligations, Guarantor shall satisfy its 
obligations hereunder regardless of whether Contract Party or any other 
person or entity shall have taken any steps to enforce its rights against 
Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor.  The obligations of 
Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be affected or impaired by reason, and 
Guarantor WAIVES its right to prior notice, of the happening from time to 
time of any of the following:  (i) extensions (whether or not material) of 
the time for payment of all or any portion of the Obligations, (ii) the 
modification or amendment in any manner (whether or not material) of the Gas 
Contract or the Obligations, (iii) except for applicable statutes of 
limitations, any failure, delay or lack of diligence on the part of Contract 
Party, or any other person or entity to enforce, assert or exercise any 
right, privilege, power or remedy conferred on Contract Party or any other 
person or entity in the Gas Contract or at law, or any action on the part of 
Contract Party or such other person or entity granting indulgence or 
extension of any kind, (iv) the settlement or compromise of any Obligations, 
(v) the status, composition, structure or name of Obligor change, including, 
without limitation, by reason of merger, dissolution, consolidation or 
reorganization, (vi) except for releases or waivers resulting from the rights 
or defenses of Obligor that Guarantor has reserved in Section 3, the release 
or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance 
by Obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition in the Gas 
Contract, (vii) the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of 
the performance or observance by any co-guarantor, surety, endorser or other 
obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition to be performed 
or observed by it under the Gas Contract or related document and (viii) the 
failure to acquire, perfect or maintain perfection of any lien on, or 
security interest in, any collateral provided by Obligor to Contract Party or 
the release of any such collateral or the release, modification or waiver of, 
or failure to enforce, any pledge, security device, guaranty, surety or other 
indemnity agreement in respect of such collateral.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to direct, 
actual damages and, unless expressly provided in the Gas Contract, Guarantor 
shall not be liable for consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or 
indirect damages, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, in 
tort, contract or otherwise, or any penalties or charges assessed by any 
person or entity for the unauthorized receipt of gas.  Upon 30 Days written 
notice and with the prior written consent of Contract Party, which consent 
shall not be unreasonably withheld, this Guaranty may be replaced by (i) a 
guaranty in identical form made by a guarantor of equal or better 
creditworthiness, including credit ratings by nationally recognized credit 
rating agencies, taking into consideration all relevant information 
concerning corporate structure, all relevant financial information, both 
current and projected, and all effects on the enforceability of the 
replacement guaranty, or (ii) a letter of credit in favor of Contract Party 
in the amount of the Maximum Limit (below defined), issued by a bank and in a 
form, each of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Contract Party, 
taking into consideration all effects on the enforceability of the 
replacement letter of credit; provided, this Guaranty shall continue to apply 
to all Transactions in effect at the time this Guaranty is replaced until all 
such Transactions are completed and the replacement guaranty or letter of 
credit shall apply to only those Transactions formed after its execution and 
delivery.
2.  MAXIMUM LIMIT.  The amount covered by this Guaranty for all Obligations 
in respect of the aggregate of all Transactions under the Gas Contract that 
ever shall be required to be paid by Guarantor shall not exceed 
$_____________ (the ""Maximum Limit""); provided, this Guaranty shall cover and 
Guarantor shall pay, in addition to the Maximum Limit, all reasonable 
expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, court costs and 
similar costs, of Contract Party in the event of judgment, settlement or 
other enforcement against Guarantor.  The Maximum Limit shall not be affected 
by the number or type of outstanding Transactions or the holding or 
application of any collateral by Contract Party.
3.  DEFENSES.  Other than as expressly waived in this Guaranty, Guarantor 
retains its own defenses and rights hereunder.  Guarantor WAIVES all rights, 
setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses of Obligor relating to the 
Obligations, including, without limitation, all rights, setoffs, 
counterclaims and other defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency, 
dissolution or liquidation of Obligor.      
4.  DEFAULT.  If Obligor fails or refuses to pay timely any Obligations, 
Contract Party may at its option exercise any or all of its rights, powers 
and remedies afforded hereunder and under all documents, if any, securing 
this Guaranty and may declare the unpaid amounts of all Obligations then 
owing under the Gas Contract to be immediately due and payable, and thereupon 
such amounts shall be immediately due and payable without presentation and 
demand for payment, protest, notice of protest or dishonor, notice of 
default, notice of intent to accelerate or notice of acceleration to 
Guarantor or any other person or entity, all of which Guarantor hereby 
WAIVES.  
5.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  Guarantor represents and warrants that:  
(i) it is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of 
the State of its incorporation and has the power and authority to execute, 
deliver and carry out the terms and provisions of this Guaranty, (ii) no 
authorization, approval, consent or order of, or registration or filing with, 
any court or other governmental body having jurisdiction over Guarantor is 
required on the part of Guarantor for the execution and delivery of this 
Guaranty and (iii) assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof 
by Contract Party, this Guaranty constitutes a legal, valid and binding 
agree-ment of Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as 
the enforceability thereof may be limited by the effect of any applicable 
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting 
creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.
6.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  At the written request of Contract Party, 
Guarantor shall provide Contract Party with the financial information 
described in Appendix ""1"" of the Gas Contract under Financial Information in 
accordance therewith.
7.  NOTICE.  All notices and communications made pursuant to this Guaranty

payment in full of all Obligations; provided, in all instances this Guaranty 
shall continue for a period of six months after the termination of the Gas 
Contract for the purpose of guaranteeing indemnity Obligations which survive 
the termination of the Gas Contract as set forth in Section 8.4 of the Gas 
Contract (the ""Indemnity Period"").  With respect to any Claims threatened or 
filed as of the close of the Indemnity Period, the Obligations resulting from 
any such Claims shall be guaranteed hereunder.  No notice of the Obligations 
or any Transaction need be given in any form to Guarantor at any time and 
Guarantor WAIVES any such notice and the right to consent to the Obligations 
or any Transaction.  Guarantor WAIVES any right to require as a condition to 
its obligations hereunder that (i) collateral be applied to the Obligations, 
(ii) presentment or demand be made upon Obligor or (iii) action be brought 
against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, should 
Contract Party seek to enforce the obligations of Guarantor.  Specifically, 
without limitation, Guarantor WAIVES any right to require, substantively or 
procedurally, that (i) a judgment previously be rendered against Obligor or 
any other person or entity except Guarantor, (ii) Obligor or any other person 
or entity be joined in any action against Guarantor or (iii) an action 
separate from one against Guarantor be brought against Obligor or any other 
person or entity.  The obligations of Guarantor are several from those of 
Obligor or any other person or entity, including, without limitation, any 
other surety for Obligor, and are primary payment obligations concerning 
which Guarantor is the principal obligor.  To the extent Obligor shall fail 
to timely make payment of any Obligations, Guarantor shall satisfy its 
obligations hereunder regardless of whether Contract Party or any other 
person or entity shall have taken any steps to enforce its rights against 
Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor.  The obligations of 
Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be affected or impaired by reason, and 
Guarantor WAIVES its right to prior notice, of the happening from time to 
time of any of the following:  (i) extensions (whether or not material) of 
the time for payment of all or any portion of the Obligations, (ii) the 
modification or amendment in any manner (whether or not material) of the Gas 
Contract or the Obligations, (iii) except for applicable statutes of 
limitations, any failure, delay or lack of diligence on the part of Contract 
Party, or any other person or entity to enforce, assert or exercise any 
right, privilege, power or remedy conferred on Contract Party or any other 
person or entity in the Gas Contract or at law, or any action on the part of 
Contract Party or such other person or entity granting indulgence or 
extension of any kind, (iv) the settlement or compromise of any Obligations, 
(v) the status, composition, structure or name of Obligor change, including, 
without limitation, by reason of merger, dissolution, consolidation or 
reorganization, (vi) except for releases or waivers resulting from the rights 
or defenses of Obligor that Guarantor has reserved in Section 3, the release 
or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance 
by Obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition in the Gas 
Contract, (vii) the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of 
the performance or observance by any co-guarantor, surety, endorser or other 
obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition to be performed 
or observed by it under the Gas Contract or related document and (viii) the 
failure to acquire, perfect or maintain perfection of any lien on, or 
security interest in, any collateral provided by Obligor to Contract Party or 
the release of any such collateral or the release, modification or waiver of, 
or failure to enforce, any pledge, security device, guaranty, surety or other 
indemnity agreement in respect of such collateral.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to direct, 
actual damages and, unless expressly provided in the Gas Contract, Guarantor 
shall not be liable for consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or 
indirect damages, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, in 
tort, contract or otherwise, or any penalties or charges assessed by any 
person or entity for the unauthorized receipt of gas.  Upon 30 Days written 
notice and with the prior written consent of Contract Party, which consent 
shall not be unreasonably withheld, this Guaranty may be replaced by (i) a 
guaranty in identical form made by a guarantor of equal or better 
creditworthiness, including credit ratings by nationally recognized credit 
rating agencies, taking into consideration all relevant information 
concerning corporate structure, all relevant financial information, both 
current and projected, and all effects on the enforceability of the 
replacement guaranty, or (ii) a letter of credit in favor of Contract Party 
in the amount of the Maximum Limit (below defined), issued by a bank and in a 
form, each of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Contract Party, 
taking into consideration all effects on the enforceability of the 
replacement letter of credit; provided, this Guaranty shall continue to apply 
to all Transactions in effect at the time this Guaranty is replaced until all 
such Transactions are completed and the replacement guaranty or letter of 
credit shall apply to only those Transactions formed after its execution and 
delivery.
2.  MAXIMUM LIMIT.  The amount covered by this Guaranty for all Obligations 
in respect of the aggregate of all Transactions under the Gas Contract that 
ever shall be required to be paid by Guarantor shall not exceed 
$_____________ (the ""Maximum Limit""); provided, this Guaranty shall cover and 
Guarantor shall pay, in addition to the Maximum Limit, all reasonable 
expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, court costs and 
similar costs, of Contract Party in the event of judgment, settlement or 
other enforcement against Guarantor.  The Maximum Limit shall not be affected 
by the number or type of outstanding Transactions or the holding or 
application of any collateral by Contract Party.
3.  DEFENSES.  Other than as expressly waived in this Guaranty, Guarantor 
retains its own defenses and rights hereunder.  Guarantor WAIVES all rights, 
setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses of Obligor relating to the 
Obligations, including, without limitation, all rights, setoffs, 
counterclaims and other defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency, 
dissolution or liquidation of Obligor.      
4.  DEFAULT.  If Obligor fails or refuses to pay timely any Obligations, 
Contract Party may at its option exercise any or all of its rights, powers 
and remedies afforded hereunder and under all documents, if any, securing 
this Guaranty and may declare the unpaid amounts of all Obligations then 
owing under the Gas Contract to be immediately due and payable, and thereupon 
such amounts shall be immediately due and payable without presentation and 
demand for payment, protest, notice of protest or dishonor, notice of 
default, notice of intent to accelerate or notice of acceleration to 
Guarantor or any other person or entity, all of which Guarantor hereby 
WAIVES.  
5.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  Guarantor represents and warrants that:  
(i) it is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of 
the State of its incorporation and has the power and authority to execute, 
deliver and carry out the terms and provisions of this Guaranty, (ii) no 
authorization, approval, consent or order of, or registration or filing with, 
any court or other governmental body having jurisdiction over Guarantor is 
required on the part of Guarantor for the execution and delivery of this 
Guaranty and (iii) assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof 
by Contract Party, this Guaranty constitutes a legal, valid and binding 
agree-ment of Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as 
the enforceability thereof may be limited by the effect of any applicable 
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting 
creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.
6.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  At the written request of Contract Party, 
Guarantor shall provide Contract Party with the financial information 
described in Appendix ""1"" of the Gas Contract under Financial Information in 
accordance therewith.
7.  NOTICE.  All notices and communications made pursuant to this Guaranty 
shall be in writing and delivered personally or mailed by certified mail, 
postage prepaid and return receipt requested, or sent by facsimile, as

with this Section 7.
8.  LAW, WAIVERS, MISCELLANEOUS.  THIS GUARANTY SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS BE 
GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF 
TEXAS, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS.  Guarantor WAIVES 
all right to require marshaling of assets and liabilities, sale in inverse 
order of alienation, notice of disposition of collateral and notice of 
acceptance of this Guaranty.  The Transaction Procedures set forth in the Gas 
Contract are acknowledged and agreed to by Guarantor and Guarantor agrees not 
to contest the validity or enforceability of any Transaction entered into in 
accordance with the Transaction Procedures under applicable law relating to 
whether certain agreements are to be in writing or signed by the Party to be 
thereby bound.  No term or provision of this Guaranty shall be amended, 
modified, altered, waived, supple-mented or terminated except in a writing

Contract.  This Guaranty shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of

under-standing between Guarantor and Contract Party and supersedes all prior 
agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.  The 
headings in this Guaranty are for purposes of reference only, and shall not 
affect the meaning hereof.  This Guaranty may be executed in any number of 
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together

Regarding BC Utility,  I have discussed a GISB with Mr. Wong  and  we have 
been unable to come to agreement  due to their choice of law restriction.  
Because they are a utility they are by statute required to bind agreements 
subject to  British Columbia.   Conversely as this would be an agreement 
subject to state laws of Texas as well as the United States,  it will not 
work to agree to British Columbia as jurisdiction for this contract.  

Please let me know if you have any questions, or I can be of further 
assistance.

With regards to our discussion on priority of contracts for 30 day firm 
transactions.  The system gives priority to Master Agreements over GISBs.   
All things equal,  a 30 day firm transaction will attach to the master before 
the GISB.

Hope this helps.

Marcia,

Thank you for your e-mail regarding SP's to the purposed GISB.  My responses 
are as follows:

Section 1.   We will agree to your suggest  language.

Netting:  We suggest the following:  

In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the 
same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be 
aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through 
netting,  in which case the party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount 
shall pay to the other party the difference between the amounts owed.

Adequate Assurance:   We will agree to 5 business days.

Term:  For firm delivery limit the use of the GISB to 30 days.  For 
interruptible delivery there is no limit.

We  will agree to the above along with our other SP's as written.  Thanks for 
your attention to the foregoing.  Please let me have your thoughts.

		 Subject: MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT/Monthly Meeting Notice


Dear WEN Members-2000:

We have not received your 2001 membership applications.  You are in danger of 
being dropped from the membership directory for 2001 and from receiving 
monthly luncheon notices.  Please send in your application for 2001 (see 
attached form) and your $30 membership dues AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!

In the past, the WEN Board has sent you a copy of the monthly luncheon
meeting notice and the bi-monthly newsletter by both e-mail and regular
mail.  The WEN Board recently voted to discontinue sending notices by
regular mail.  Beginning with this e-mail message, you will receive future
meeting notices and the WEN newsletter by e-mail only.  Those members for
whom we do not have an e-mail address will continue to receive their
notices by regular mail.

Keeping the above in mind, please make sure that you print the attached
meeting notice as an extra reminder to yourself to sign up for the luncheon
since you won't be receiving the hard copy in the mail.  We hope that you
approve of this method.  If you have friends in mind that you think would
be interested in attending our next luncheon on February 14, please forward
the attached luncheon notice to them.

Additionally, the Board also voted to begin publishing the WEN newsletter
on a quarterly basis rather than bi-monthly.  We look forward to sending
you your next newsletter in April.

For your information, we will be sending a survey to you in the near future
to gather your input about suggestions for making WEN even better.  We
value your opinion, so your responses to the survey will be greatly
appreciated.

Don't forget that we will be having a Networking Happy Hour for all WEN
members on Thursday, February 1, at Mesa Grill, 1971 W. Gray (713-520-8900)
beginning at 5 p.m.  Hope to see you there!

Leesa Foster
President of Women's Energy Network - 2001

Have you talked to Kurt re Sat?  I will talk to him tonight.  Can we start at 
5:00?   Are you sure we want to use that   ""Jen Air""   I have certain 
memories  that thing.  Have you used it?  

I thought we might grill some vegetables on it.  I will bring stuff for 
cheese dip and what ever else.   How many of us will be there?

John,

The only remaining points at issue concerning the GISB are as follows:

Section 1.2   change to ""Oral"".  As you may recall in our previous 
discussion,  Enron will always send a written confirm.   

Section 10.1 supplement:  Agree to purposed language save ""two day"",  please 
revise to ""5 business days"".

If in agreement with changes above, please prepare final document and send 
for our execution.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

I have a few questions re PSNC.

 Are you comfortable w/ Scana as guarantor?
 Which agreement do they want this to cover?  I see they currently have GISB 
and a Master Purchase Sale Spot.

Finally,  if you want to use this form,  I want to included additional 
language to strengthen our position.  As is this is very weak and loose.

Please advise,

Claire,

In response to my phone message of  1 February, 2001,  attached are two 
agreements for your review.  First is a GISB revised in acceptable form to 
ENA.  I have incorporated UGI's Special Revisions into ENA's save number 
(3).  Also, with regards to number (2),   ""three business days"" has been 
changed to ""five"" and revisions to  the last two sentences.

Finally, also attached is a draft of ENA's Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement.

Upon your review, please give me a call to discuss the attached.

In response to your Revised Cutter Oil contract:

1.   Ok
2.    What is the arrangement if not 100%?
3.   I suggest ,  30 days notice /  two business day notice for seller, as 
they must give some notice.
4.   Can you negotiate $.05 for damages?

We are ok with your Addendum to the agreement.  However,  there remains 
Section 3.2,  we discussed earlier.  Because this is interruptible gas we 
prefer Spot Standard. 

Also,  with regards to the signatory.  Is Mr. Roy VP for Atmos Energy 
Corporation?

I will prepare an additional GISB for United Cities.

Regarding Article 3.3  

Do I understand you correctly to change to read as follows:

""Provided, if Buyer elects not to purchase Gas from Seller for 30 consecutive 
Days, Seller may terminate this Agreement upon 30 Days prior written notice.""

I am ok with the rest.

Susan,

Re: Reliant: 

I am sure the letter Cynde  uses is fine however,  I would like to see it 
before you send it to Reliant.

Re:  Oneok:

Did they give 30 day notice?
I would like to know what  Oneok's  relationship is to  Elwood and KN ?

No,  I was waiting for you to tell me if Cutter  agreed  to the revisions, 
and  I needed to  discuss revisions w/ Jeff Hodge for approval.   I will send 
the agreement today pending your reply. Also,  there needs to be included 
into Article 1. the following: 

(after ""Term"") provided this Agreement shall continue to apply to all 
Transactions then in effect until all Transactions are completed.  

Article3.  delete ""Exclusive Commitment and Representations and Warranties"".

Please advise.

My only concern is that they have the legal right to cancel the contract.  
""Certain Assets""  must also include the agreement  at issue.

Debra,
 I am not showing that we have a file on New Gaskom. We are showing a PMTM 
loss of approx ($150,000) for physical forwards/swaps that were done on 
12/22/99. As of now, the answer from Credit, is that we would like to see 
financial statments to set an appropriate line. Please call if you have any 
questions.

Debra,

I am sorry for the long delay in responding.  In regard to the HPL
agreement, we'd like to submit a few requested changes for your
consideration, as follows:

1. Article 1.  Term.  We'd like to amend the initial term from one year to
one month.

2. Section 3.2 Subsections(i)& (ii).  Seller's Failure to Schedule.  In the
seventh line immediately after the word ""the"", delete the words ""Replacement
Price Differential, plus (ii) liquidated damages equal to $0.15"" and replace
with the words ""Gas Daily Price"".  In line nine immediately after the word
""Quantity"", delete the words ""to cover Buyer's administrative and
operational costs"" so these 2 subsections now read as follows: (i)an amount
equal to the product of the Seller's Deficiency Quantity multiplied by the
Gas Daily Price multiplied by Seller's Deficiency Quantity"".

3. Section 3.4 Subsections (i) & (ii).  Buyer's Failure To Deliver.  In the
twelfth line delete the words ""Replacement Price Differential, plus (ii)
liquidated damages equal to $0.15"" and replace with the words ""Gas Daily
Price"".  In line thirteen immediately after the word ""Quantity"" delete the
words ""to cover Seller's administrative and operational costs"" so these 2
subsections now read as follows: (i) an amount equal to the product of
Buyer's Deficiency Quantity multiplied by the Gas Daily Price multiplied by
Buyer's Deficiency Quantity.""

4. Section 4.1 Early Termination. Subsection (i).   We'd like to reduce the
number of days in which notice can be given of the termination of the
transaction(s) upon a Triggering Event from 60 Days to 10 Business Days.  In
line six immediately after the word ""which"" delete the words ""any or"".  In
line seven immediately after the word ""Transactions"" delete the words
""selected by It and"" and replace with the word ""under"", so this subsection
now reads as follows: ""(i) upon two Business Days written notice to the
first Party, which notice shall be given no later than 10 Business Days
after the discovery of the occurrence of the Triggering Event, establish a
date on which all Transactions under this Agreement in respect thereof will
terminate...""

5. Section 4.2 Triggering Event. Subsection (i) We'd like to limit the cure
period during which an Affected Party is able to remedy a payment failure
from five (5) Business Days to two (2) Business Days.

6. Section 8.2 Transfer.  In line five immediately after the word ""may""
delete the words ""without the"" and replace with the words ""with written"".

7. Appendix 1.  Definitions  ""Material Adverse Change"" definition.  Delete
subsection (ii) in its entirety and replace with the following definition,
""(ii) with respect to Customer, its Guarantor's Credit Rating is below
""BBB-"" by S&P or its Guarantor fails to have a Credit Rating from S&P.  If
there is no Credit Rating for Customer's Guarantor, then Material Adverse
Change with respect to Customer means: its Guarantor shall have any of the
following occur at any time: (a) its Net Worth falls below U.S.
$200,000,000, or (b) its Funded Debt to Net Worth at any time exceeds forty
percent (40%).  (This language was recently approved by both parties and is
included in the Bandwidth Master Agreement between Enron Broadband Services,
L.P. and Aquila Broadband Services, Inc.)

Please call me (816-527-1560, or e-mail me upon your review of the above
requested changes.  If possible, we'd like to get this agreement executed
within the next couple of weeks.

Thanks so much!

Kathleen,

Further to our conversation, attached are drafts for Master Firm
Purchase/Sale Agreements for HPL and ENA.  As previously noted, our credit
department has been in discussions with Jennifer West and Aquila's credit
department regarding these agreements.  It is my understanding Aquila
requested the attached drafts.

Having said that, I will review your responses to my comments for the HPL
agreement.  I  have suggested  we amend the current Master Agreement (1993)
between ENA and Aquila.

Finally, while there are existing guaranties currently in place between
Enron and Aquila, they are only referenced in the attached  and not
included.

I  look forward to working with you in finalizing  these agreements.
Please let me have your thoughts regarding these issues.

                    (See attached file: Aquila Energy(ENA).doc)(See

Debra,

I thought I would touch base with you on the status of the Material Adverse
Change language for the above agreement.  I did speak with Marie Heard
yesterday and she indicated she would contact you concerning this language.
Marie advised that even though this language was approved for the Bandwidth
agreement, it would not necessarily be approved for this gas agreement.

This particular language needed special approval from our CFO as it differs
from our ""approved"" language.  In light of that, I am sending you our
standard language in case the ""bandwidth"" version is not acceptable to
Enron's gas Credit people.

We are very anxious to finalize this agreement, so please let me know if
there is anything I can do from our side to expedite this.  I really
appreciate all of your assistance!

Thanks for your e-mail.  Yes because we are different  companies with 
different credit departments,  we would not necessarily agree to the same 
terms.  Having said that,  I have sent your attachment to credit for 
review.   This is all we can do for now.

Further to our conversation, please see attachment regarding warranty and 
netting.
Disregard the section on ""Non-Warranted Gas"" as this does not apply to our 
negotiations.



Netting.  In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an 
amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each 
Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to 
pay through netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater 
aggregate amount may pay to the other Party the difference between the 
amounts owed.

John,

One final change with your OK.  Regarding section 7.5  last sentence, delete 
after ""be""  and add ""paid.""  The sentence will read,  ""Upon resolution of 
such dispute, any amounts owing will be paid.""
Please advise.

Although the Clark County gas deal is moving slower than I'd like it to, it 
is very much a live deal.  Thanks to all of you for your patients and 
assistance thus far.  Its being held up by the Master Agreement which their 
credit representative (Reid Grossmann) will be working on it AGAIN tomorrow.  
He will be in Houston and asked if he might meet with Debra and Jay in 
person.  He has assured me that our issues are being taken care of today.  
Since they still have some of their own issues, he is of the opinion that 
nothing can happen before Friday.  I intend to keep the heat on them and 
fully anticipate they will - at some point - transact.

Thanks Again,

Dave Fuller

Debra - 

We've been tasked with creating a customer database and cultivating some new 
clients.  I will be covering the state of Wisconsin.  I need to know if the 
attached companies have Master Physicals or GISBs with ENA.

Sorry to be a pain and I don't need it this afternoon - but if you could fill 
it in as whenever you get a chance, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks -

Marcia,

Thank you for your e-mail.  Concerning confirms,  Enron North America Corp. 
will be the confirming party for all transactions.   

# 6.  Please we would use the following:
In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the 
same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be 
aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through 
netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount 
may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.

Is it correct to say that no confirmation was sent by ENA or Southwest for 
our Stara #538767?   If so,  how was the Southwest deal for Jan delivery

As you may know this entity has purchased the gas trading section of Merrill 
Lynch.  In turn they have approached ENA requesting  a GISB and Master for 
physical gas trades.   Do you have any problem with a GISB and Master?

In response to your e-mail please see the attached draft sent to Trans 
Canada.  Be advised Trans Canada was less than eager to negotiate this 
agreement and as of today there has been no action.   It would be great to 
get both  executed!!

Christy, I am going to speak with Debra Perlingiere in ENA Legal to obtain 
the most recent version of the Master between ENA and Transcanada Energy 
Marketing USA, Inc. and will forward it when I receive it.  I also will check 
into the status of that unexecuted Master as it may be that we can assist in 
getting both executed at the same time.  Thanks.

James, thanks for the info.  Yes, I agree they should be the same.  Is there 
a chance I could get a copy of the one ENA sent out to them, not only would 
it show me how ENA worded certain things but would show me where ENA and EES 
agreements are different, so I can make sure we have same info.  If you could 
send me a copy of ENA's proposal to TransCanada that would be helpful.

Thanks. Christy

Subject: Master Purchase and Sale Information Worksheet for TransCanada 
Energy Marketing USA, Inc.

Christy, attached please find the Master Purchase and Sale Information 
Worksheet for TransCanada Energy Marketing USA, Inc.

Please note that Russell Diamond and Veronica Espinoza have been working on 
executing a Master Purchase and Sale Agreement with the same counterparty on 
behalf of ENA.  I have based the EES Master Worksheet off of the ENA Master 
Worksheet to remain consistent.  My understanding from talking with Veronica 
and Russell is that this Master is not yet executed.

In negotiating the ENA Master, a $60MM Enron Corp. guarantee has been issued 
benefiting TransCanada Energy USA, Inc.  In addition, TransCanada Pipelines 
Ltd. has issued Enron and any of its subsidiaries a $60MM guarantee on behalf 
of its sub, TransCanada Energy USA, Inc.  

Putting in place an executed Master is definitely the only way to go as it 
will allow us to net exposures between EES and the counterparty.  Please let 
me know how the status of the Master progresses or if you need my assistance 
to facilitate.  Thanks for your help.

Dear Debra:

Our proposed restatement of Section 13.10 is as follows:

""Enron recognizes that, when NEGM is acting as Buyer hereunder, NEGM is
purchasing gas on behalf of certain gas companies (the ""Repurchasers"") to
whom it immediately resells such gas at the Delivery Point(s).  In addition
to any other circumstances for which NEGM is entitled to claim force majeure
pursuant to this Contarct, Enron agrees that NEGM as Buyer shall be entitled
to claim force majeure if a Repurchaser purchasing gas from NEGM is unable
to receive gas from NEGM because such Repurchaser has been affected by an
event of force majeure.  The parties further agree that the term
""Transporter"" when used in this Contract, including, but not limited to, in
Sections 4.1. and 11.1, shall include any company acting in the capacity of
a transporter for any Repurchaser and agree that Section 4.3 of the Contract
will apply to invoices from such Transporters for Imbalance Charges received
from such Transporters to the same extent as if such invoices were received
by NEGM, provided that any such Repurchaser scheduled and nominated the same
volumes as Enron and NEGM scheduled and nominated on behalf of such
Repurchaser at the Delivery Point(s).""

I look forward to hearing from you.  Best regards, Beth Webb

Dear Debra:

As promised, here is a redraft of the language on the force majeure point:

""Enron recognizes that, when NEGM is acting as Buyer hereunder, NEGM is
purchasing gas on behalf of certain gas companies (the ""Repurchasers"") to
whom it immediately resells such gas at the Delivery Point(s).  In addition
to any other circumstances for which NEGM is entitled to claim force majeure
pursuant to this Contarct, Enron agrees that NEGM as Buyer shall be entitled
to claim force majeure if a Repurchaser purchasing gas from NEGM is unable
to take delivery or transport gas from the Delivery Point(s) as a result of
an event of force majeure.  The parties further agree that the term
""Transporter"" when used in this Contract, including, but not limited to, in
Sections 4.1. and 11.1, shall include any company acting in the capacity of
a transporter for any Repurchaser and agree that Section 4.3 of the Contract
will apply to invoices from such Transporters for Imbalance Charges received
from such Transporters to the same extent as if such invoices were received
by NEGM, provided that any such Repurchaser scheduled and nominated the same
volumes as Enron and NEGM scheduled and nominated on behalf of such
Repurchaser at the Delivery Point(s).""

Hopefully this reflects our discussions of yesterday and today.  Best
regards, Beth

All I have to say is, I hope you purchased a box or bushel of the SISSI  
chocolates.  That was one of the finest pieces of chocolate I have ever had!  
It  was milk chocolate w/raspberry liquor filling.  I am now about to embark 
on Mozart !!

Thanks a bunch!!!!

Gary,

I have reviewed your GISB and Special Provisions my remarks are as follows:

Concerning the first page,  Section 2.5 Enron prefers to be the confirming 
party; Section 3.2 we will agree to Spot Standard, and Section 13.5 Choice of 
Law we will agree to  New York or Texas.

Special Provisions:

1. We would agree to this provision with minor changes in wording.
2. Agree to netting again with changes to language as follows:
   In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in 
the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be 
aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through 
netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount 
may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.

We do not agree with purposed revisions to the remaining sections.   

As previously stated,  ENA will  consider use of  the GISB for firm delivery 
for 30 days or less.   This of course does not apply to interruptible 
service.   If you intent is for greater that 30 days of firm delivery,  I 
suggest we explore use of our Master Agreement in combination with a GISB or 
alone.  The  Master  cannot be used for interruptible service  thus the need 
for the GISB.

Please let me have your thoughts regarding these issues and how you would 
like to proceed.

We will not agree to the use of the GISB for firm delivery past 30 days.   I 
will get in touch with  Lucci to discuss a master agreement.   To  speed 
things along I will attach a sample of our master for your review.   Pending 
credits review,  we could send you a draft as early as Monday .

or greater)   I have related to them ENA will not go past 30 days on firm 
delivery with a GISB and suggest consideration of a Master.

Concerning the status of Cinnabar, Mr. Shumway and I are currently discussing 
requested changes in the Guaranty involving letters of credit and damages.    
We cannot agree to their suggested change in language to the Guaranty.  
Therefore as some of their transactions are for 30-60 days and they are 
looking at on line trading,  I purposed for the short term a GISB.  He 
agreed, and I will be sending our draft of same to him for review (I will 
include you in my e-mail).   The issue of the Master is still open and I 
await his final response.

I will keep you informed of Cinnabar's status.

Dear Debra:

As promised, here is a redraft of the language on the force majeure point:

""Enron recognizes that, when NEGM is acting as Buyer hereunder, NEGM is
purchasing gas on behalf of certain gas companies (the ""Repurchasers"") to
whom it immediately resells such gas at the Delivery Point(s).  In addition
to any other circumstances for which NEGM is entitled to claim force majeure
pursuant to this Contarct, Enron agrees that NEGM as Buyer shall be entitled
to claim force majeure if a Repurchaser purchasing gas from NEGM is unable
to take delivery or transport gas from the Delivery Point(s) as a result of
an event of force majeure.  The parties further agree that the term
""Transporter"" when used in this Contract, including, but not limited to, in
Sections 4.1. and 11.1, shall include any company acting in the capacity of
a transporter for any Repurchaser and agree that Section 4.3 of the Contract
will apply to invoices from such Transporters for Imbalance Charges received
from such Transporters to the same extent as if such invoices were received
by NEGM, provided that any such Repurchaser scheduled and nominated the same
volumes as Enron and NEGM scheduled and nominated on behalf of such
Repurchaser at the Delivery Point(s).""

Hopefully this reflects our discussions of yesterday and today.  Best
regards, Beth

Dan says,  Cutter in acting as ""Representative"" for Harley,  would receive 
payments from Enron.   With regards to deals,  deals with Harley at different 
prices is ok.  

Concerning FM,  Harley could claim FM for delivery to the meter. 

Hope this helps.  If  not, please discuss further with 
Dan.

Sorry,  I am unable to help you with your gas bill.   I suggest you try the 
following:

Depending on where our live (ie city or supplier),  contact the supplier 
regarding your rates, and have your meter checked.  Also you might request 
the supplier check their line to your home.

Debra,

I think this just takes us back to your Feb. 22 proposal.  Since the second
sentence seems to be somewhat problematic for Enron, we will withdraw our
request for that sentence.  My only other change would be that the "".1""
appearing after the ""4"" and the ""11"" in the last sentence should also be
deleted.

Hopefully this will resolve the issue.

Best regards,  Beth

Debra,

Attached below is a slightly revised Mac language for the Aquila Master.  
After speaking to Aquila today, we should execute both HPL and ENA Masters 
simultaneously (as both documents were sent over for their review at the same 
time--especially since we do so much business w/ENA & Aquila and the Master 
is so old).

Please confirm the above for me and let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks and I apologize for the delay in getting back to you,

Veronica

Debra,

I thought I would touch base with you on the status of the Material Adverse
Change language for the above agreement.  I did speak with Marie Heard
yesterday and she indicated she would contact you concerning this language.
Marie advised that even though this language was approved for the Bandwidth
agreement, it would not necessarily be approved for this gas agreement.

This particular language needed special approval from our CFO as it differs
from our ""approved"" language.  In light of that, I am sending you our
standard language in case the ""bandwidth"" version is not acceptable to
Enron's gas Credit people.

We are very anxious to finalize this agreement, so please let me know if
there is anything I can do from our side to expedite this.  I really
appreciate all of your assistance!

Gary,

Thanks for your e-mail,  attached is a sample of our Master.  I notice we 
currently have a Master in place with PPL Gas Utilities?

In response to your previous e-mail my comments  are as follows:

We cannot agree to both parties confirming.  ENA prefers to be the confirming 
party.

Section 13.5  NY law is fine.

Our netting language is a stated below:

In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the 
same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be 
aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through 
netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount 
may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.

Your suggest to stipulate a 30 day limitation on usage for the contract is 
not necessary as this condition is stated at the bottom of the first page in 
the disclaimer.  With regards to limitation, we do not limit transactions to 
one year.



Finally, with regards to the Master, our credit department will need to speak 
to someone in your office for credit information.

Sandra,

In response to your comments:

Section 11.1    We  cannot agree to the use of GISB's force majeure language.
Section 13.9  We will agree to suggested changes.

Finally,  warranty language would also need to be included in the GISB.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

We have reviewed your special provisions and request the following:

Section 11.1 We feel the GISB language is adequate; please delete HPL's
Section 11.1 special provision.

Section 13.9 In the fourth line change ""designate an arbitrator, who need
not be neutral"" to ""designate a neutral arbitrator"".

If you are agreeable to Dow's requested changes, please send either by
e-mail or mail originals for signature.  If you have any questions, please
give me a call.

Further to our conversation, please see the attached Special Provisions and
Warranty for the HPL GISB.

(See attached file: ENA  Special Provisions revised GISB.doc)

Section 8.5 is added as a new section under Section 8 -Title, Warranty and
Indemnity, as follows:

   ""8.5   (i)   Intrastate Warranted Gas.  If the Delivery Point(s) for the
   Transaction  are  intrastate interconnections, (a) Seller represents and
   warrants  to Buyer that all Gas will have been produced within the State
   of  Texas  and  will  not  have been commingled by Seller with other Gas
   prior  to  the  Delivery  Point(s)  which  is  or may be sold, consumed,
   transported  or otherwise utilized in interstate commerce in such manner
   which  would  subject Buyer's Transporter's pipeline to the jurisdiction
   of  the  Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission or an successor authority
   under  the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and (b) Buyer represents and warrants
   to  Seller  that  none of the Gas will be sold, consumed, transported or
   otherwise  utilized  outside  the State of Texas or delivered to another
   party  which will subsequently sell, consume, transport or otherwise use
   the  Gas  outside  the  State  of  Texas  where such event would subject
   Buyer's  Transporter's  pipeline,  Seller's  pipeline, or any portion of
   such  pipelines  to  the  jurisdiction  of the Federal Energy Regulatory
   Commission or any successor authority under the Natural Gas Act of 1938.

Beth,

My last e-mail should have read as follows ending with ""volumes"". =20

Enron recognizes that, when NEGM is acting as Buyer hereunder, NEGM is=20
purchasing gas on behalf of certain gas companies (the =01&Repurchasers=018=
) to=20
whom it immediately resells such gas at the Delivery Point(s).    The parti=

=20

ee=20

Transporters for Imbalance Charges received from such Transporters to the=
=20
same extent as if such invoices were received by NEGM provided, that any su=
ch=20
Repurchaser, Enron and NEGM  scheduled and nominated the same volumes.  =20

In the event this is not acceptable, please let me know how you would like=
=20
this Section to read.  With regards to imbalances,  I would direct you to=
=20
section 4.3.  As an example, if  Enron nominates 10MMbtus and only 8 are=20
placed in the line,  2 will be made up by the transporter  the cost is=20
Enrons, and 10 would be delivered to NEGM.   And so the  opposite holds for=
=20
NEGM.  If 10 could not be accepted by NEGM, its transporter would respond=
=20
accordingly, and NEGM would be responsible for the cost.

Enron's  concern is with NEGM's desire to claim force majeure as a result o=
f=20
an event by its customer downstream.  Force majeure must  take place at the=
=20
delivery point..=20

Hope this helps!  Have a great weekend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thanks for your e-mail re Aquila.   I will incorporate the MAC both A/B  
along with the definitions.  And you also want me to apply the same language 
to the contract with ENA.  If this is not correct,  please let me know.

Sorry,  one I additional question,  the previous worksheet had ratios for 
EBITDA, net worth, and FD/NW.  Do you want any of these to remain or only use

Debra,

Since we currently have a Master in place with PPL Gas Utilities, we can do an
""identical"" one with PPL EnergyPlus, LLC.  Draw it up in duplicate and mail it
out to me (I'm attaching a ""Notices"" sheet for you to use in preparing it).
Your Credit Department can contact our Alan A. Babp, Credit Risk Analyst, at
Phone: 610-774-6129 or email: aababp@pplweb.com.  OR they can go directly to
our web site (www.pplweb.com) and click on ""Building Shareowner Value"", which
will take them to our financial information page.

Debra, we also prefer to be the confirming party, but have become enamored of
""Both"" since it forces our Trading Controls to compare our Confirmation
document with your Confirmation document. As a matter of interest, the 
existing
GISB we have with you, dated June 1, 1999, does in fact have ""Both"" parties
listed as confirming parties and your office prepared that document.

Your netting language is acceptable.

You and I know that the disclaimer states that the GISB is intended for
Interruptible transactions or Firm transactions of one month or less and that
it does apply to the Enron contract.  However, we have 141 other contracts 
that
are used for Firm transactions of up to one year (which is the maximum
allowable period the Fuel Trading group can commit to without higher, Vice
Presidential, approval and signature.  So, if we have the time period
specified, as I suggested, in the Special Provisions we have a much better
chance that our Traders will remember which contract to use, our data entry
personnel will cite the proper contract and, if not, our Trading Controls
personnel will spot and correct any that sneak by. So if it is just a
matter of resistance to duplication, I ask that you ""bite the bullet"" for I
would appreciate it if we could have the language included.

Thanks for your response.

Gary,

Thanks for your e-mail,  attached is a sample of our Master.  I notice we
currently have a Master in place with PPL Gas Utilities?

In response to your previous e-mail my comments  are as follows:

We cannot agree to both parties confirming.  ENA prefers to be the
confirming party.

Section 13.5  NY law is fine.

Our netting language is a stated below:

In  the  event  that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in
the  same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may
be  aggregated  and  the  Parties  may  discharge  their obligations to pay
through  netting,  in  which  case  the  Party,  if  any, owing the greater
aggregate  amount  may  pay  to  the other Party the difference between the
amounts owed.

Your  suggest to stipulate a 30 day limitation on usage for the contract is
not  necessary  as this condition is stated at the bottom of the first page
in   the   disclaimer.   With  regards  to  limitation,  we  do  not  limit
transactions to one year.

(See attached file: Sam3102.doc)

Finally, with regards to the Master, our credit department will need to
speak to someone in your office for credit information.

Debra,

As requested  here is a bit of history regarding the initial request for the
above referenced Agreement.

On July 1, 1999 through October 31, 1999 Cabot began purchasing supply from
Enron at Sumas.  When we received the Transaction Agreement dated June 10,
1999, I began calling regarding the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement
dated November 1, 1993, stated therein.   I could find no such agreement in
our files.

On July 28, 1999, Karen Lambert faxed this Agreement. I then realized that
Enron was utilizing an Agreement which had not been assigned to Cabot in its
merger with Washington Energy Resources Company in May 1994.  I tried on
several occasions to explain the situation.  Finally on October 24, 2000 we
received the above referenced Agreement originally effective October 1,
2000.  We then requested the effective date to be July 1, 1999 to encompass
the original transaction along with the three (3) additional transactions.

See the attached sheet for specific deal information.
 <<GC115.xls>>
Hope this helps.  I have submitted the master agreement for execution and
will let you know when it is on its way.  Thanks.

Laurie

Debra,  I have reviewed Markwest's proposed changes to the Master, and given 
the fact that we have since amended the ISDA with Markwest I would like to 
maintain consistency between the two agreements with respect to the credit 
terms.  This being said, I have attached an amended credit worksheet that 
highlights in Red the changes I would like inserted in the Master.  Please 
make these changes.  You will notice that I have increased Markwest's 
collateral threshold to $1MM and have agreed to both of their proposals to 
amend the Third Party Debt and the Collateral Multiple amount.  Also, with 
respect to their request to amend Section 4.2, section (ix), I would like to 
know how they define 'borrowed money' and if this change is going to be 
representative of Markwest, then why is it not bi-lateral.

Thanks
Russell

Debra,  I have reviewed Markwest's proposed changes to the Master, and given 
the fact that we have since amended the ISDA with Markwest I would like to 
maintain consistency between the two agreements with respect to the credit 
terms.  This being said, I have attached an amended credit worksheet that 
highlights in Red the changes I would like inserted in the Master.  Please 
make these changes.  You will notice that I have increased Markwest's 
collateral threshold to $1MM and have agreed to both of their proposals to 
amend the Third Party Debt and the Collateral Multiple amount.  Also, with 
respect to their request to amend Section 4.2, section (ix), I would like to 
know how they define 'borrowed money' and if this change is going to be 
representative of Markwest, then why is it not bi-lateral.

Thanks
Russell

Debra,

Ok, we're getting there.  Please see comments below.

1. Good, please prepare the draft Master Agreement and send it to my 
attention.
 We've been doing business with Enron since 1996, so the credit review
shouldn't be a problem.  You can probably find everything you need on our home
page (www.pplweb.com) or call Alan Babp at (610) 774-6129 { 
aababp@pplweb.com}.

2. We're at a stalemate on the confirmations.  I have checked with out
electrical side and their negotiated contract with Enron uses ""Seller
Confirms"".  For Gas GISB contracts while we prefer ""PPL Confirms"", we 
recognize
that almost everyone wants to be the confirming party so we have been 
accepting
""Both"".  But if you can't accept either of them, I suppose we can live with
""Seller Confirms"", since our electrical side has accepted it.  Those are our
choices, in order of preference.

3. Good, I'm pleased you agree to the ""redundant"" language.  I know it will
help my Trading Controls people.

Please advise...again, I think we're close.
Gary  Shay

Agreement for your consideration pending ENA credit review;

ENA's confirm is controlling.  If agreed  PPL may also send a confirm with
this understanding;

Netting.  In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an 
amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each 
Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to 
pay through netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater 
aggregate amount may pay to the other Party the difference between the 
amounts owed.

Good Morning Debra - I have attached a revised copy of the GISB Agreement
and Special Provisions for your review and consideration.   I anticipate
completing the review of the Master Agreement form and submitting comments
to you by Monday.

In addition, I received feedback from our Gas Desk that the access to the
Gas segment of Enron On-Line was cut off to CPS --- do you know who would
handle this at Enron that we can speak to?  Greatly appreciate your prompt
feedback to this inquiry.

I look forward to your feedback on the GISB.

Priscilla,

I do not find the term ""Alternate Transporter Imbalance""  in our agreement..  
The term ""Aggregate Transporter Imbalance"" is located in several sections.  
Could this be what your referencing?

As discussed,  attached is a GISB draft for Pioneer.  As you can see there 
are several blanks concerning administrative information for ENA Upstream.  I 
was able to secure a Duns# and Fed Tax ID however,  I am lacking Fax and bank 
account numbers. Do you have this information?

		 Subject: Request for Master Natural Gas Agreement


As I mentioned on the phone, our Traders (Tom Carlson and Theresa Cline) and
our management have requested a Master Agreement for the purchase & sale of
Natural Gas (presumably for firm sales) between Enron and Pinnacle West
Capital Corporation, Arizona Public Service's parent company.  As I further
mentioned, our hope is to have this Agreement in place by next week because
our respective traders are poised to start trading under it.

I have attached PinWest's Company Information Sheet which provides certain
background and contact information.

Please email the draft Agreement as soon as possible to our Contract Manager
(Miki.Kolobara@pinnaclewest.com).  Please contact either Miki (602/250-3427)
or me if you have any questions.  Thank you.

I received a voicemail from Will this morning.  Kimberly had 4 baby girls.  
Will did not leave any information on the babies, just that they are very 
small.  He will be out of the office for a few days but will be checking 
voicemail.  I will send flowers from the department.

I have had two conversations with Mr. Dawson and others re a GISB for this 
muni.  However, no one there is interested in putting a contract in place.  
Please let me know how you would like to proceed with this matter.

Debra,
 Hey, I'm hoping maybe you can help me out. I know this is a stretch, but
I'm desperate.I'm working on a story for Image Magazine. It's about people
from around the world who have moved to Brazoria County and their
experiences here. I've done four stories from England to Australia, but
cannot locate anyone from Latin America. Do you know if Enron would have
someone from Central or South American and they now live in B.C.?

Gary,

Thanks for your e-mail of 4/9/01.  We cannot agree to the suggested language 
regarding arbitration in Section 13.  We will of course agree to New York as 
jurisdiction.  

Please let me have your thoughts on how you would like to proceed.

Jill,

Bob Walker has informed me that Pioneer has requested the existing GISB with 
ENA be assigned to ENA Upstream.  The GISB at issue was acquired from 
Columbia Energy Services.   In light of this there would be no need for a new 
GISB with Pioneer.  

To date,  Pioneer is holding final version of  our GISB.

I am in final negotiations with FPC, hopefully this can be concluded today.   
Ms. Murphy of FPC stated   Dustan is scheduled to be down for repairs and 
delivery may not take place until the 5th?  In any case, should we not reach 
agreement today, I will have the confirm desk send a confirm with GTC and 
move the transaction to the finalized Master upon completion.
 
I will let you know by 5:00 today our status.

Alan,

In response to your phone call,  I too had to refresh my mind its 
MONDAY!!.    I will e-mail   later today a final version of the redline for 
execution.  You can print two originals, sign both and send same to my 
attention at the address below.   I will return a fully executed original for 
your records.  Should need to trade prior to full execution of the GISB,  
send me a fax with  signature.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions or comments.

Hi Debra,

Have you had any word back from credit regarding the Exposure Thresholds?
When last we spoke, Enron wanted Duke to be reduced to $1M regarding Early
Termination Damages due to current exposure rates.  Our credit department
came back and said the Enron's exposure to Duke was such that they would
then want to see an equal reduction in Enron's Early Termination Damges
amount.

Basically, our credit department has asked that these amounts be reciprocal
in nature as we have a situation where our exposure to one another is
almost equal.

Please let me know what they say.

Robin

I have reviewed suggested revisions to Greene's agreement.   We will not 
agree to suggested changes to section 3.3 regarding purchase obligations 
because of capacity constraints.  The remainder of Greene's requests are ok.  
I have not discussed  these issues with Greene.   Do you want me to talk to 
them?

Hi Debra;
Attached are documents for your review regarding Aquila's request of Enron
to amend our current Gas contract to replace/assign the UtiliCorp
responsibilities to Aquila, Inc.
I have sent along for your review, the supporting documentation from both
Moody's and S&P regarding the Aquila credit rating, the Secretary of State
filing/order showing Aquila's name change, our underlying contract and a
proposed amendment for your review/execution.

It appears that this amendment is necessary because there has been a delay
in the execution of a new contract which would have removed UtiliCorp as a
party.

Because of the Aquila spin off, we are under a significant time constraint
to remove UCU from all Aquila contracts.

If you have any questions regarding this, please do not hesitate to contact
me.

Sounds like yours really had it bad.  Mine may not have had a virus though.
It may just have been coincidental.  I hope that Tizzer and Geronimo are
better now.  Hope that things are going well.  Our business, hence our
department also, announced that we will be cutting a few positions/people
very soon.  We are all laying low.  Oh well, we shall see.

Take care of you!

Ms. Perlingiere:

Gloria Salazar and Greg Hall asked that I let you know that we received the
Gas Purchase Agreement for our PA facility today.  Before it is executed,
Gloria has asked our legal group to review it.  They are doing that now;
however, it will be Monday before she will have their comments.  The plant
in PA will not be ready to sell gas until Tuesday, possibly Wednesday, and
we anticipate that the agreement will be in place by then.  Although Greg
will be out of town next week, Gloria will be able to talk with you.  If you
have questions, please contact her on Monday.

You were thanking me too soon for the info on the confirm.
I gave you the wrong information. (Alan Koelemay just called me.  I told him 
that it was my fault and we'll be sending him a new one.)

The price should be:
Inside FERC CIG Index minus $.67 not Gas Daily minus $.55 (that was the 
purchase prices from April.  Which is the month I'm working on for 
allocations right now.  (Not that this falls as a valid excuse)).  All other 
information is fine.

Alan is throwing away the confirm you sent and is waiting for a new one.

My fax # is (303) 534-0552.

I'm sorry for the mix up.  (I'll never take a 2 week vacation again.  I can't 
get myself back into the swing)

Sarai,

Further to our conversation below is suggested language for Section 8.2.

8.2. Transfer.  This Agreement, including, without limitation, each 
indemnification, shall inure to and bind the permitted successors and assigns 
of the Parties; provided, neither Party shall transfer this Agreement without 
the prior written approval of the other Party which may be withheld entirely 
at the option of such Party; provided further, either Party may, without the 
consent of the other Party (and without relieving itself from liability 
hereunder), (i) transfer, sell, pledge, encumber or assign this Agreement or 
the accounts, revenues or proceeds hereof in connection with any financing or 
other financial arrangements, (ii) transfer or assign this Agreement to any 
Affiliate by assignment, merger or otherwise, or (iii) transfer or assign 
this Agreement to any person or entity succeeding to all or substantially all 
of the assets of such Party.  Any Party's transfer in violation of this 
Section 8.2 shall be void.
Finally, with regards to Section 4.2, we will agree to the use of 
""occurrence"" in  (vii) however,  we will not agree to the ""borrowed money"" in 
section (ix).

Please let me have your thoughts regarding these issues.

Bad news.  Even though I was able to get the Tagg numbers (NE2988 and NE3039, 
respectively), the only things in Livelink were the deal tickets.  Please 
call Ellen Wallumrod at x54099 - she may be able to pull something for you.  
I'm going to try and play around in Tagg and see if I can somewhere print the 
confirms, but Ellen's your best bet there.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,

Thanks again,  I explained to Dan the situation he sort of laughed after I 
told him you would take lunch.   I always say in these cases quoting a famous

Pat,

Attached is a draft of the GISB between ENA and Sequent Energy.   As 
requested,  I have included in the Special Provisions found on the last page, 
an addition to Section 7 a provision for netting.   

Regarding the date,  how were the previous transactions papered you wish to 
be a part of this GISB?  Are there in current active transactions?

Finally, if in agreement with this draft please complete Sequent's 
administrative portion and remove ""Draft"" from the heading and we can discuss 
your reasons for the date change.

		 Subject: Re: Exxon/HPL GISB

Debra,

The only confirm I've been able to print is for Sitara deal 131153 (Tagg 
N47394.1) and this one is weird:  the deal was a two-month firm deal covering 
12/01/99 - 01/31/00.  Since firm deals over a month should not be confirmed 
under a GISB, this deal was split and 01/00 was moved to Sitara deal 133958 
(cannot find Tagg number).  Deal 131153 was originally confirmed under a 
Master Purchase Sale Firm but moved to the GISB following the correction of 
the CP name on the deal ticket.  The deal was not reconfirmed under the GISB 
to the best of my knowledge; I couldn't locate the deal in Livelink (the only 
confirms under that deal number were for EPMI deals) and could only print the 
confirm out of Tagg. 

I could not locate the other deal numbers at all in Tagg and there are no 
records in Livelink of the confirms either (only EPMI deals).  I'm guessing 
the deals were confirmed out of DCAF, but I don't have access to that.  
Someone in the Confirms group will have to print those for you.  One note:  
The last deal, Sitara 107197, is a five-month firm deal that should NOT have 
been attached to the GISB.

Since these are HPL deals, I'm not sure who confirms them, but you could 
probably get some help from either Ellen Wallumrod, Ann Osire, or Richard 
Deming.  On the contract side, Cheryl Dudley or Amelia Alland should be able 
to help.  I'm afraid I've done all I can on this end.

I'm getting ready to fax the confirm for deal 131153 (before it was split) 
since it's the only record I could pull up.

Sorry I couldn't find you everything!
SBR

Hi Debra;
Attached are documents for your review regarding Aquila's request of Enron
to amend our current Gas contract to replace/assign the UtiliCorp
responsibilities to Aquila, Inc.
I have sent along for your review, the supporting documentation from both
Moody's and S&P regarding the Aquila credit rating, the Secretary of State
filing/order showing Aquila's name change, our underlying contract and a
proposed amendment for your review/execution.

It appears that this amendment is necessary because there has been a delay
in the execution of a new contract which would have removed UtiliCorp as a
party.

Because of the Aquila spin off, we are under a significant time constraint
to remove UCU from all Aquila contracts.

If you have any questions regarding this, please do not hesitate to contact
me.

Surprise surprise our law clerk from UH.  I think he will only be here for a 
few summer months.  Gerald Nemec introduced me to him.  He, Majed, will also 
be working with the swap group.  That's all I know.  Except that he is a vast 
improvement from the prior.

Deb,

Thank you for your e-mail regarding the guaranty.  This form of guaranty 
appears to be fine however,  Enron North America Corp. needs to be 
incorporated as well as  references to physical gas transactions.

Victoria,

Now it is my turn to apologize for a late response.  Having said that, I have 
reviewed your remarks regarding the GISB my comments are as  follows:

Section 1.2   Transactions may be negotiated orally or online.  In either 
case Enron will  send a written confirmation via fax or electronic for  the 
trade.  I hope this helps in clearing any confusion regarding the oral 
designation in Section1.2.

Section 7.2 With regards ACH, I am waiting on a response from my accounting 
dept.

Section 13.5 Concerning jurisdiction we will agree to  New York.


Please let me have your thoughts regards these issues.

Judy,

Further to our conversation,  attached is a draft of a Master Agreement for 
TransCanada Energy Marketing.  I anticipate sending a draft of the Master 
Agreement for TransCanada Gas Services Inc. late today or early tomorrow. 

 Also as you may recall, with regards to the guaranties, I have left Section 
4.5 in the draft however, the exhibits noted are not attached to this 
document.  

I look forward to working with you in completing these agreements.

I wanted to let  you know I am currently negotiating two Master Gas 
Agreements with TransCanada for the two entities listed above.  As previously 
discussed, credit suggests increasing  TransCanada Pipelines Ltd.'s  guaranty 
to $50MM and decreasing Enron's to the same amount.    Have you discussed 
TransCanada's guaranty?    Is $50MM large enough to cover your agreement? 

Veronica Espinoza(66002) in credit is working with me on guaranty issues.   
Finally, did you receive copies of Enron's and TransCanads's guaranty?  If  
not, let me know I will fax same.  Their guaranty expires the end of this 
month.

Debra - Attached is a bank copy of the format letter submitted back in April
regarding the changes.
I know that you forwarded to me a copy of an agreement initially between ENA
and BNG (the CES predecessor) but unfortunately, all of our files are in
boxes (just moved office areas)so I can not locate immediately.  If you want
to, we can re-generate a copy for ENA with the applicable terms of the
referenced agreement (title of the agreement and effective date is all I
need), and forward to you.

Let me know if you can help me with this new request ----then we can take
care of it right away.

Thanks- Vangie

Hi, interesting...Please bring me up to speed.? I'm juggling a number of 
agreements with a number of trading partners.? Would you mind giving me a 
little background?? Normally, when we want to trade natural gas, I'll work 
out a GISB.? Is this a GISB, and if so, what version.

Thanks.

I need a confidentiality for Ball Corporation.
I believe the same one we used for Battle Mountain Gold would suffice. I 
would be looking at their physical supply contracts in order to:
a) supply them centrally physically
and b) offer risk managment services.
Can I have this today?
Thanks

FYI,
In reference to your memo of May 5th,  I prepared and sent a new Master to 
Pan on May 1st.  Since then, I have trouble getting in touch with anyone at 
Pan to discuss the agreement.   The treasurer  referred me to  Rick Tucker 
(713) 331-5049.  He stated Pan is not ready to consider new paper, as the one 
in place is working fine and not priority.   But would review the new 
agreement when he had time.

Please give me an update or status for the following:

Dynegy Canada Inc. When we last spoke, you were in the review process and 
wanted to make changes to credit terms. Please advise on how I should proceed.

Engage Energy Canada LP The draft went to Engage in Oct. of last year.  You 
had said you wanted to change credit terms?   Do you want me to keep trying 
with this draft or send a new one?


TransAlta Energy marketing Corp. Do you want to change the credit terms ?

Reliant energy Services Canada Ltd. They have requested a Master with HPL?


Please let me have your thoughts on each of these  by early tomorrow as I 
have to give Jeff / Stacy a memo regarding  progress.  If was my 
understanding from my last conversation with Veronica that there is 
significant exposure with some of these.  

Many thanks!

I have determined the GISBs referred to earlier were acquired by ENA through 
Columbia Energy Services.  I will be faxing those to you soon.  They are 
executed but in the name of 
CES.   Regarding those agreements, we have Consent Agreements for assignment 
from MarkWest.

Concerning the Master Sale Spot Agreement dated 5-1-90,  I have located same 
and will send you a fax of it as well.

I agree, with your suggestion to terminate the previous agreements and we can 
begin with a new GISB.   I have not yet determined , do you know if there are 
any trades booked under any of these contracts?   If so, we can move them to 
the new agreement,

Sorry for the confusion.  Yes, you did send special provisions and the GISB.  
My comments to each of these are as follows.

GISB

Section 2.5 We would like for ENA or ""Seller"" to confirm.

Section 2.24 Gas Daily --Midpoint

Section 13.5 We will agree to Texas or New York  jurisdictions.


Special Provisions

Section 1.2, Oral Transaction Procedure:

In third line of  the suggested paragraph, delete  ""for purposes of Section 
2.201(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code"".

Section 7.5

We suggest the following language:

In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the 
same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be 
aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through 
netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount 
may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.


Please do not hesitate to contact me with you questions or comments.  
Attached is our information sheet for the GISB.

FYI, John Grass and  I spoke to Curt Hribernik  this morning regarding 
various issues in the Master.  There has been a change in their corporate 
structure such that it appears they may  have stronger financial backing or 
at the very least a change.    I requested they send documents reflecting 
ownership and name change.   Curt  indicated they would be able to provide a 
LC.   I told him he and or his credit dept. would need to discuss these 
issues with you before we could continue.

I will send you information when I receive same.

I spoke to Jeff regarding the next meeting,  he said we would talk about it 
next week.  He has been in England on  business for the past week or so.  

I will forward  a notice to you upon his decision.

You will do fine on the exam.  Do not worry!!!!   
No, the new garage is still under construction.
Yes, you were spoiled !  Glad to know California is still full of fruits and 
nuts and the women are inferior to TEXAS women.

Thanks for your e-mail.  I feel like our accounting dept. or contract 
administration has somehow billed incorrectly.   I have spoke to the attorney 
and trader and have been told you should be billed by Enron North America 
(ECT) and not HPL.  This agreement has not been assigned to HPL. 


I will be in touch, and hope to have this resolved on Monday.   Thanks for 
your assistance.

Paramy,

I did receive your e-mails and apologize for my late response.  Yes, I will 
be the negotiating person for the agreement with the exception of credit 
terms and issues, but will also be involved in the background with credit.  

I hope to  e-mail you my comments by the end of next week.

I have completed my review of  International Paper's Natural Gas Sales and 
Purchase Agreement as requested.  As constructed, there are numerous 
revisions that would need to be made for this agreement to be acceptable.  

Having said that, are you aware we currently have in place a Master Sale Firm 
Agreement  with IP dated May 5, 1995?   

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Debra,

Per the info below, can you please review the information and see if you can 
find any information as to why we can't use the Committed Reserves contract 
mentioned.  I'd also like to terminate the two GTC contracts listed as 
well.   Client Services needs to clear up this issue very soon and I'd like 
Legal to sign off on the terminations.

Please don't hesistate to call me at x30569 or Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan at 
x31443 if you have any questions or need further information.   Thanks!

Subject: Hall Energy Company/Willis Enterprises Corp.

Tricia,

I've uncovered some troubling information regarding the issue with Hall 
Energy Company and Willis Enterprises Corp. based on the info you sent me.  
Apparently, at one time, Enron was assigned a Committed Reserves contract 
with Hall Energy Company (Global #96003960) originally signed 05/07/84, 
effective with first production 10/04/84, that is still effective.  Two deals 
were entered in Sitara under this contract, covering 02/98 and 04/98 
production.  From 05/98 production on, deals were tied to a GTC Purchase Spot 
contract (Global #96014936).  

I'm not sure why the GTC was set up when we had a purchase contract already 
in place; it appears that this GTC covers the same well (Stewart #1) that the 
Committed Reserves contract covers.  Not only that, but a point was set up 
under the GTC (we don't set up points under GTCs, only under Committed 
Reserves).  It was the same point under the Committed Reserves contract.  
Also, later deals entered in Sitara even include this exact meter used for 
the GTC.

You also included documentation from Hall authorizing payments to Willis.  
I've reviewed all contract and correspondence files for this contract and can 
find absolutely NO documentation showing that Willis in an interest owner in 
this well.  Do you have any division orders or other assignments showing that 
Willis has an interest in the Stewart #1?  If that's the case, I can add 
Willis as a seller under the Committed Reserves and we can have all deals 
moved to the original contract.  However, Willis still will not receive a 
separate payment.  Enron will only issue payment to the counterparty on the 
contract (the operator) so Willis will have to receive payment from Hall.

A GTC Purchase Spot contract (Global #96007659) was also set up for Willis 
Enterprises Corp.  That could technically have been for separate purchases, 
but more recent deals in Sitara show that these purchases were from the same 
meter point for the Stewart #1 that the GTC for Hall used.  I can find no 
documentation on either of the Hall or Willis GTCs to reflect that these were 
set up to handle different wells than the one in question.  Without any other 
paper, it is my guess that both the Hall GTC (96014936) and the Willis GTC 
(96007659) were set up in error.  The people responsible for setting up the 
contracts are no longer around and would probably not remember anything if 
they were.  I would like to run this by Legal, but my inclination is to 
cancel both GTCs and settle under the Committed Reserves contract set up 
originally for Hall.  I will forward this information to Legal to see how to 
proceed.

I know all this is confusing, but please let me know if you have any 
additional documentation from Willis or if you have any questions.  I will 
turn this matter over to Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan (who handles the ""H"" 
counterparties) and she will let you know the outcome.  Of course, you can 
always call me with questions, but this is really her domain since the 
contract in question is with Hall.

Thanks,
Stacey  x30569

Debra,

I'm not sure we wouldn't prefer to have it kept as Houston Pipe Line
Company.  We have been filing with the regulatory bodies all expenses under
HPL, since November of '99.  So, what I would like to have happen, even if
it was a mistake, is have the contract assigned to HPL.  This will keep our
records with the PUCT and FERC the same.  In either case, I will still need
documentation in our contract files to show the assignment.  I appreciate
your help, and please let me know what your thoughts are on this matter.

We cannot assign this agreement to HPL.  Although the billing was in error, 
the transaction was confirmed under, and rightfully so Enron North America.  
We of course will correct our records and future billing statements.

We are sorry for any inconvenience.  Please let me know if I can be of

Dear Debra,

It is great to hear from you.  I just took a practice
exam.  I consisted of 3 essays from 9-12, then a one
hour lunch break, then a 3 hour performance test.  I
think I did well on the essays, but not the
performance exam.    I pretty much spend most of my
time sudying.  this whole bar thing is quite an
undertaking.  I do not know how people pass it, but
they do.  It is a lot of work and sometimes you just
hit these walls, but I have rebounded prety quick.

BErkely is quite an interresting place.  I have seen
more Freaks here than in Austin during college easily.
 It is like they bread them here.  At first, it was
funny and I liked it, but now it has become so normal
for me to see a guy with a nose ring, and a tattoo
over his adam apple(Ouch!), that they are just another
person.  I have met some people, but I do not hand out
with people here very much.  I knew that coming here,
but at times it does get lonely.

The women here are quite average.  I think I was very
spoiled in Texas.  Texas women are beautiful.

I am house sitting for my uncle in San Francisco for
the 4th of July weekend.  So it is a nice break from
bar reviewing, bt I did bring all my books.

I still think of you guys a lot.  Please tell everyone
that I say hello.

So has the new parking garage been built yet ot what.

Take care....Yaron Shaham

Finally, because I know you would want to know, I do
not have a BOYfriend, yet there was this one guy I
met, oops, uh nevermind.

Yes, I have heard about the changes in your life.  I  will make some inquires 
and get back with you.      Did you look at Enron.com in the job bank?   My 
CD player has cost the price of a VERY good bottle of something to have 2 
extracted!  NOT my fault.  It is working only as a single player, the changer 
cannot be trusted.

  
Have a great weekend,  I  will be in touch!

A couple of things I wanted to tell you.

 1.  There is a company in Houston named ""Compsys"".  I have been told they 
are the contract agency who places computer staff here.  Which is a good way 
to get in. Sorry, I do not have their number.

2.   In addition to searching enron.com, also search enron.net, this is our 
broadband network.

The Guaranty is specific to the master.  In paragraph  #1 it says 
""...guaranty effective during the term of the Gas Contract...."".   Also at 
the top of the agreement it says ""...entering into and Enfolio Master Firm 
Purchase/Sale Agreement of even date....""

Rob,

I have researched your question regarding a confirm from ENA for the April 
2000 delivery of 5000 MMbu at 2.77.  This transaction was papered under ENA's 
General Terms and Conditions.   A conformation was sent to Arizona Public 
Service on 3/29.

I hope this clears up any confusion.  If I can be of further assistance, 
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Regards,
Debra Perlingiere

It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the=

first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen.  We recogniz=
e=20
that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron=01,s business goals, and w=
e are=20
pleased that many of you have shared in the company=01,s financial success=
=20
through Enron stock options.=20

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=
he=20
All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided valu=
e=20
to participants through 2000.  Employees who have participated in this=20
program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of=
=20
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the=20
program.  =20

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package=
=20
and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron=01,s continued=
=20
success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and=
=20
Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid=
ed=20
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for=
=20
calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  =
It is=20
expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted,=
=20
effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib=
le=20
on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to=
=20
final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to=20
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and=20
international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base=20
salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on=20
December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some=20
international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.
? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated gran=
t=20
of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O=
ption=20
Program, among other good reasons=01( that=01,s why.

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =
=01)=20
Your Stock Option Program.  To provide information and answer your question=
s,=20
we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host=20
several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular=
=20
basis.  In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact yo=
ur=20
Human Resources representative.=20

Note: In addition to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, grant=

regulatory requirements.  It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock=

on=20
companies=01, employees may not be eligible due to legal, accounting, tax, =

Debra -- The delay from my side was due to a change in the approach where the 
LNG people now do not want to use an offshore company.  Therefore we should 
use the following as the counterparty:

Enron LNG Marketing, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company

The address would be the Three Allen Center address on Clay St., 18th floor.

Thanks -- David

I have place the amendment with your revisions and ours with my attorney for 
review.  Hopefully  I will receive it back today.   In Section 4.2 we 
increased the event for Enron Corp. to 100m and Idacorp, Inc. to 50 m.  In 
addition to this I changed the date of the Amendment to July 1, 2000, changed 
the name to reflect Enron North America Corp. and finally to Section 4.6 the 
following: Collateral Requirement/Termination Threshold is hereby amended by 
the addition thereto after the last sentence: ""For purposes of this Section 
4.6, the calculation of ""Early Termination Payment"" shall include all amounts 
owed but not yet paid by one Party whether or not such amounts are then due, 
for performance already provided pursuant to any and all Transactions.""

These are the only changes we have made.  Pending my attorney's review we 
should be ready.  I will e-mail the new version as soon as I receive it.

Thanks for your assistance, and have a great weekend.

	Office: Save As... responds very slowly when naming the file
Mike Hernandez on 06/12 at 10:04 AM
Category: Applications 


Problem: When a document is created or renamed using the Save As option under 
the File menu, the system responds very slowly when typing in a file name.

Cause: Office keeps a directory full of shortcuts to recently opened files.  
As this directory gets larger, the problem starts to occur.

Resolution: Delete the h:\application data\microsoft\office\recent 
directory.  It will be re-created when the next file is saved.  Note: This is 
a workaround, as this directory will re-populate itself over time and the 
problem will resurface.  A long-term solution is being researched.

I am putting a Master Agreement together for a customer that will agree only 
to New York law.  Do you have a problem with changing the jurisdiction in 
Enron Corp.'s guaranty (item #8, second page of the Enfolio Master)  to New 
York law?

We can date the GISB as of December however, this would in itself not place 
the transactions under this paper.  These transactions were previously 
papered under GTCs were they not?  Were they rejected for some reason?

To: Debra Perlingiere

Welcome back from your vacation.

We've got our GISB agreement in place, and gas is flowing.   However,
Metromedia Energy is still waiting on a Master Agreement so we can do some
term deals.  We've got the form of parent guaranty, and that's been
approved, so once we can fill in the dollar figure we'll have that taken
care of.

I have not yet seen a sample master agreement, so if you can email that to
me, it would speed things up a bit.

Thanks

Scott

In preparing for our meeting with Exxon, I have hit a dead end with regards 
to the ""Agreement""  he cites in his fax to us.  I have searched and others as 
well to no avail.    Therefore,  would you ask Jacobson to fax  you/me  the 
entire agreement he is referring too because it does not exist in our world.

In a conversation with Randy Miller of Texla, the following credit issues 
were raised:

1.  Texla would like to raise their threshold to $200,000;
2.   In place of a LC  Texla would offer furture trades  within 24 hours.

As previously discussed, I can write the language, the decision is a credit  
call.

H.L. Jacobson
ExxonMobil Gas Marketing Company

Further to our discussion Friday, concerning certain confirmations for 
ExxonMobil Gas Marketing Company, I have determined the following: first, 
ExxonMobil  or HPL may confirm transactions as agreed at the time of the 
trade; second, in the event HPL confirms,  we have made changes to our system 
which should prevent the  issuance of  GTCs for Exxon Mobil Gas Marketing 
Company trades, with the exception of ""online"" trades, therefore causing  
future trades relating to these agreements to attach to one of two contracts 
under discussion  Friday.   Please bear in mind these changes may not be in 
effect until the end of next week.  With regards to confidentiality language 
contained in the confirm, we are unable to amend this at this time.

Finally, concerning the August 8th letter (confirmation) provided by you in 
the meeting, we are in agreement with same.

We trust the foregoing meets with your approval.  Please do not hesitate to 
contact me with any questions you may have regarding this matter.

I did it!  I finally took a minute to e-mail you.  How are you?  Mom and Dad
just moved to Arkanshire (Retirement Village) this week.  Went over to help
and pick up a load of stuff.  It has been tuff to deal with but know it is a
good idea for them.  Jason is here for a visit, broken hip and all so
between two jobs and all this I am a little ""fritzed"" at the momment.  Heard
you and I both have a ""Jeff"" in our lives.  We will have to talk.  Maybe we
can begin communicating a little better. Love you! mb   "

It is great to hear from you!  Yes,  I was sad to see them move, but know it 
will be better for both.  We have a lot catch up on.  I think you could give 
me some much need coaching  in a few areas.  As for the  ""J"" men,  well I 
think you have the better deal as I think mine as taken off.  Sorry to hear 
about Jason.  Would like to come for a visit, or meet you somewhere, say 
Santa Fe,  when time permits.

I have made the following changes:

On page 1-2  under ""Financial Information"" , 7th line beginning w/ 
""Customer"".  Deleted ""[or its Guarantor] J.M. does not have a guarantor.

On the signature page for the Guaranty I changed ""JM Huber"" to  ""J.W. Huber"".

In addition, in the ""Appendix ""1"" I have deleted ""EBITDA Coverage Ratio""
this ratio does not apply here.   And moved ""Net Income"" to its correct place 
in alpha order before ""Net Worth""

We have reservations for 7 p.m. tomorrow at Boudro's on the Riverwalk.  It 
comes highly recommended, and of course, the company will be wonderful!  We 
will need to leave La Cantera about 6:15 or 6:20, so let's plan to meet at 
6:15 at the front desk.  If this is somewhat ambiguous when we get there, 
then I'll leave word for you there or look for you.  See you!

Just a reminder, in order to keep this project on track,  I need the 
remaining credit sheets for those counterparties as discussed in our 
meeting.  

To date, all previous drafts have been completed and sent to those customers 
with negotiations in process.

Debra,

Craig Taylor  would like to have a GISB executed with Houston Energy Services 
Company LLC.  The contact there is Carol Wood 713-463-5040.  They are not set 
up in the system yet; I'm working on that at the moment.  All I have on them 
thus far is a D&B report.

Their address is 10497 Town & Country Way, #150  Houston, TX  77024.

If you need any other info, give me a call and I'll try to get it for you.

Thanks,

Veronica"

Please see the attached Transaction Agreement and Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement.

We are in receipt of signed faxes of the Transaction Agreement and Master 
Agreement however,  we also need signed originals.  To that end,  ""DRAFT"" has 
been removed from the attached documents for execution.  Please note, on the 
first page of the Master Agreement  and Exhibit ""C""  the blank  after ""a"".  
Determine  the state of  incorporation for Huber, and file in the name of the 
state.

Finally,  print two of each document,  have signed and send both to my 
attention. 


Please let me know if you have any questions.

We can amend, and assign everything including the guaranties, as long as I 
have some paper work showing the company structure.   We do not need to put a 
new master in place.

Due to computer troubles etc.  I did not get the confirms or agreement out 
last night.  I assure you it is going today via Fed Ex First Delivery.  Is 
the previous address still the location you want these docs sent too?

I am a legal assistant for Jeff Hodge.  At his suggestion,  I am contacting 
you concerning the possibility of spending time with you or a trader in your 
area observing ""the business""  during bid week if possible, in order that I 
may gain experience and information concerning gas trading.  A few hours in 
the morning or whenever is best for you.  

Thanks for your help!

Venona, 

I have discussed the warranty issue with my attorney and he suggested the 
following be used as Section 8.5.  The language in this section allows for 
gas from outside the state.  Please advise.

The following representations and warranties shall apply to Transactions 
under the stated conditions:  (i) if Company is Buyer, Seller represents and 
warrants to Buyer that all Gas will have been produced (a) within the state 
of Texas and will not have been commingled with other Gas which is or may be 
sold, consumed, transported or otherwise utilized in interstate commerce in 
such manner which would subject an intrastate Transporter to the jurisdiction 
of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or any successor authority under 
the Natural Gas Act of 1938 or (b) outside of the state of Texas with any 
transportation on an interstate pipeline having been conducted under Section 
311 (a)(1) of the Natural Gas Policy Act and (ii) if Company is Seller and 
the Delivery Point(s) for the Transaction are not interstate

Does this mean we are gainfully employed? More important, are you a single

Bernadette,

Given the amount of time that has expired sense we started working on this, I 
thought it would be a good idea for you to review the agreement again with 
regards to our agreed changes and respective guaranties.   Please let me know 
if I failed to incorporate any revisions.  I will forward originals for 
execution upon approval from  your.

Sorry for the delay in responding.  Regrettably, I have a legal conference 
that weekend and with dog logistics and all I cannot  see how it would be 
easy to do.   Also sounds like you will be busy and it being balloon festival 
it will be hard to get a room.  

Let me know when you have some free time otherwise.   I can fly into Tulsa, 
or NM on other date.  How is Jason's injury?

Mr. Burrow w/ B&G  has called regarding sales to ENA from his wells.  I have 
provided him with a sample  of our Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.  
However he has indicated he would only be selling to us.   Do you want me to 
proceed with this?  Please advise.

Leandra,

As previously discussed, attached is a red-line version of suggested changes 
from Tractebel and ENA.   

Please note ENA changes from the earlier draft are as follows:

Section 4.2 Triggering Event.     Increase defaults for both parties to 
$100,000,000.

Section 4.6  Collateral Requirement/ Termination Payment  Threshold. Decrease 
in Tractebel's Threshold from $10,000,000 to $7,500,000.

Appendix""1""
""Material Adverse Change"".   Change Tractebel S.A. ""Minimum net worth ratio"" 
to $3,375,000,000 USD from $150,000,000 Belgian Francs.  


Laura Kinner in your credit dept.  is working with ENA's Russell Diamond 
concerning these changes to credit sections.


Finally, although this draft has been reviewed by my attorney, there are a 
few sections as you will note we need to discuss further.

Thank you for your assistance.  Please let me have your thoughts regarding 
the draft.

Although we are in possession of  executed fax copies of the Master Agreement 
and Confirm, we need to replace these with originals without  ""draft"" on the 
document.  

I can e-mail these documents to you or send directly to Huber.  Please advise.

Attached are the Transaction Agreement and Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement for JM Huber.
    
Revisions are as follows:
No changes were made to the Transaction Agreement.  However,  on page two the 
sixth line in the section ""Condition Precedent"" please fill in the correct 
date and have Huber initial.

Concerning the Master: Page1-3; Line 7 beginning with ""Customer"" [or its 
Guarantor] has been deleted.  On the signature page ""JW"" has been changed to 
J.M.  In Appendix 1: ""EBITDA Coverage Ratio"" has been deleted and  ""Net 
Income"" has been moved and placed in alpha order.  Finally, please fill in 
the name of the state in the blank on the first page in the first paragraph.

For execution:  print two of each  document and have Huber sign and return 
same to my attention.  I will forward a set of originals for their records 
upon final execution.  

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Thank you again for all your help on Friday.  However, I was never able to 
get all the way in.  When do you have time to look at my computer?  I will be 
on the trading floor in the morning for several hours and  I could drop it 
off then?   Please advise.

Please forgive my slow response.  We don't have a problem with the
confirmation itself.  It was the general terms and conditions that we didn't
want to agree to without review.  It would be best to execute a master gas
agreement that would accommodate longer term deals.  Attached is our Master
Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement.

Hey Debra, how are you?  The guy next to me was searching the enron web page
and so I thought I would check in a see what is going on.  I am on page
30-35 of my seminar paper.  I have about 15 more pages to go.  I found a
place in Berkeley for the summer too.  I hope Richard is doing well and you
are taking care of yourself.  Please tell everyone hello.

In response to your memo, concerning Article 11,   I have increased El Paso's 
threshold to $10,000,000; Article 17.13 ""further acts"" and ""deeds""  means any 
further action that would need to be taken by either or both parties shall be 
done, i.e. new taxes or tariffs etc.  This article gives assurances to both 
parties that each will honor the necessary changes as required in the course 
of normal business.  In addition, I  have changed the date to October 1, 2000.

If this is satisfactory, I will send execution documents for signing. 

Please review the attached, and let me know.

Further to our collective conversations yesterday,   I have contacted counsel 
for CES and have sent   via fax the Consents of Assignment for both parties 
for execution stressing the need for a quick turn around.    Upon execution, 
I will amend the agreements for new pricing.

Please let me know if you have an questions or comments.

Hi everyone!

Thought you might like to know my new email address:
marcella1022000@yahoo.com Yes, I know it is strange,
but there is not much I can do about it. :)

So, far I am doing well adjusting to ""big city"" life.
The weather is cool and the trees are changing color!
I worked three days this week. It will be quite a
change from my last job, but I think it will be a good
experience and teach me a lot.

Anyway, I can write in more detail when I hear from
each one of you!

Take care,
Marcie"

Let me know if I can help.  Also, you should know most of these dealers will 
negotiate on price.

Thank you, right you do not have one as Southern did not sign or agree I have 
learned.  I have their consent  and will have them sign and return a copy for 
your records.

Stacy,

Currently I have pending on my desk a GISB from you however, ENA's special 
provisions are not included.  Also, a draft of a Master agreement was sent to 
Markwest this summer.  Can you give me an update on the status of the 
purposed draft?   With regards to the GISB, we can discuss ENA's special 
provisions at your convenience.   

Please let me have your thoughts.

Here is the information regarding the John Singer deal we talked about.

Buyer - ENA
Seller - Questa Petroleum Company 

1,588 MMBtu per day at Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. for October 01, 2000 
through October 31, 2000.
Price is equal to US Dollars $3.15710 per MMBtu.
Interruptible Gas
Contract - Master Purch Wellhead

This deal was originally confirmed as an Oct-Dec delivery of firm gas....on a 
GTC-Firm...so revised language might want to be included in your confirm(??)

Also, there are only two active trades with Oasis Pipeline Company which are 
October Transportation deals...and I don't confirm.

Please let me know if you need anything else.
Thanks

I have reviewed the special provisions for the GISB,  we agree to your 
provisions however, I have a question with regards to no. 6.  The last 
sentence states, "" ..each party agrees that either party may use these 
recordings in its business affairs as it deems appropriate.""  My concerns are 
founded in the use of ""these recordings"".  As the GISB does not have a 
provision for confidentiality we are concerned with the use of these 
recordings.  Also,  we want to be the confirming party.

Cary,

Thanks for your e-mail.   Your suggestion to rephrase the second sentence of 
number 6 is acceptable with one change.  Could we change ""may be used"" to 
""shall be used"" in the sentence beginning with ""Each"".

Finally, my attorney insists  Enron be the confirming party in Section 2.5. 

Pending these changes, we are ready to finalize.

Thanks!

 Here is the list of the top 40 with the information pertaining to deals and 
activities. I have made a recommendation of what type of contract or to 
terminate contracts.  I will be out until April 14th. Hopefully by then you 
will be able to get some of the Enfolio's and GISB's out and credit will be 
able to supply to you the final sheets you are missing.

Hello, Everyone

The GST language in the GasEDI Standard Contract is being confirmed by a tax
expert. We expect this will be complete within the next day or two, at which
time the GasEDI Standard Contract will be reissued for general use, complete
with a statement of all changes vs the September 7, 2000 version.

In the meantime, I thought you might be interested in the attached article
which appeared in the October 19, 2000, issue of the Daily Oil Bulletin.

Have a great day ... Ian

In response to your e-mail of 4/12 regarding Hall Energy,   do NOT cancel the 
GTC's without discussing same with the trader or business person for the 
midwest. The original agreement (Hall  #96003960) contains very specific 
pricing from that well for long term use.    I suspect the GTS were put into 
place for alternative pricing or business reasons.  

Nevertheless this is a business decision, therefore please talk to the trader 
and business person regarding this issue prior to termination of the GTCs.

If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

Dp

How is the transfer of these assets taking place?  Is the father deceased?  
If you know, please advise, as we need to do some paper work if there is a 
true transfer of ownership.

I am unable to find in our records an agreement in the name of  ""WG Shaner"" 
or ""Shaner""  could it be in another name?  Was this a CES agreement?

Hello Debra:

Regarding your comments to Jeff Mayer of MxEnergy:

I spoke directly with Veronica and she never asked that the GISB be
co-signed.  Aquila will not co-sign GISB's.  Further, Veronica told me that
she would accept a guarantee from Aquila.  She had the format of the
guarantee in hand at the time we had the discussion.  Please contact me if
you have any further questions on this matter.  My number is 203-356-1318.

Thank you for your help in this matter.  We appreciate it and look forward to
expanding our relationship with Enron.

If you will give me the details, i.e. name of customer etc., I will put 
together a quick draft for you this morning.  We do not as a matter of policy 
hand out blank ca agreements.

Kathleen,

Further to our conversation, attached are drafts for Master Firm 
Purchase/Sale Agreements for HPL and ENA.  As previously noted, our credit 
department has been in discussions with Jennifer West and Aquila's credit 
department regarding these agreements.  It is my understanding Aquila  
requested the attached drafts.

Having said that, I will review your responses to my comments for the HPL 
agreement.  I  have suggested  we amend the current Master Agreement (1993) 
between ENA and Aquila. 

Finally, while there are existing guaranties currently in place between Enron 
and Aquila, they are only referenced in the attached  and not included.   

I  look forward to working with you in finalizing  these agreements.  Please 
let me have your thoughts regarding these issues.

Hi Sylvia,

Re the GISB for Wisconsin,  no we would not agree to the terms of their GISB 
on the front page or their special provisions.   Are you aware we currently 
have a GISB in place with Wisconsin Public Service Company and ENA as well as 
with Wisconsin Gas Company??????

Re Master Status:  I have devoted  my afternoon to this contract  in order to 
complete the redline.  Will keep you apprised.

Do you still want a copy of our GISB.  If so, I will send you a draft 
however,  I need to fill in the name  of the counterparty etc. before it goes 
out.

Rob,

I have researched your question regarding a confirm from ENA for the April 
2000 delivery of 5000 MMbu at 2.77.  This transaction was papered under ENA's 
General Terms and Conditions.   A conformation was sent to Arizona Public 
Service on 3/29.

I hope this clears up any confusion.  If I can be of further assistance, 
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Concerning ProLiance,  we have tried in the recent past to negotiate with 
much difficulty a Master Gas Purchase Sale Agreement  with this customer.  
There are significant credit and legal issues surrounding  ProLiance.   Enron 
Credit has refused to grant a line of credit as a result of these issues and 
will not ok a GISB.     In addition,  ProLiance has proven to be most 
unreasonable with regards to terms in the Master.   

Please give Russell Diamond or I a call if you have any questions and or 
comments about ProLiance.

Debra-
 I have filled in all of the necessary information under the contract
but would like to request that under Section 1.2, the Transaction Procedure
Type be ""Written"" rather than ""Oral"". Please let me know if this is not
possible. Also, you have indicated that Seller will be responsible for
initiating the Transaction Confirmation. When will Prairielands be receiving
the Confirmation for the term deal done by Paul Lucci for the time period of
12/01/2000 through 03/31/2001?
 Let me know if you need any further information from me. Please send
out two originals to my attention at the address noted on the contract and I
will return on fully-executed copy to your attention. Thank you and talk to
you soon.

Concerning Proliance,  have discussed Proliance's purposed language which 
would give them the right to terminate the contract upon ENA's single failure 
to schedule. Dan Hyvl, will not agree to this verbiage.    Please give him a 
call if you wish to discuss this further.

Nancy,

Thanks for your e-mail.  Regarding  Section 1.2, ENA  perfers  the ""Oral 
Procedure"" which as noted  in  Section 1.2 on page two is considered a 
""writing"" and to have been ""signed"".  For all transactions under the GISB, a 
written confirmation will be sent by ENA  notwithstanding the choice  ""Oral"" 
on the first page.   

I am checking on the status of the term deal.

Carl, 

Thank you for your e-mail.  Concerning Section 13.5, we will agree to New 
York on choice of law.  For Section 2.5, ENA as confirming party.  Finally, 
Section 3.2  we prefer Spot Price as this is a short term deal.

Please let me have your thoughts regarding these issues.

Hey Debra, we did an audit of all 'EOL approved"" contracts in EOL Back-office 
& while reviewing the data I told Stacey that I'd give her a list of all 
Master contracts that were not in Enfolio II format. The spreadsheet attached 
lists the contracts (33 total) along with their current Investment Grade 
Status. We thought it might be worth while to look at the counterparties & 
determine where we might want to replace the old version contracts with new 
Enfolios (especially with the potential trade volume out on EOL). This was 
not stated to be a 'hot item', but with the potential exposure on EOL it was 
deemed worth a look over.

Bet this made your day huh?

Thanks!!
Cyndie

I have been in touch with Mr.  Woodford today.   This is my first day back 
from Turkey Day vacation.  The dogs are good.  I packed them up and drove 9 
hours to Ark to visit the folks.  Geronimo was very good.  I was surprised, 
although he was a little much for my Dad.   

How is the baby?  Have you adjusted?  Have the dogs adjusted?  

The luncheon was just OK.  I thought last year was better with regards to 
food and clothes.  River Oaks CC did not live up to the Junior League in my 
opinion.

Jeff Hodge requested that I forward the following collateral language for 
your review. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

[4.6.] Collateral Requirement/Termination Payment Threshold.  If at any time 
and from time to time during the term of this Agreement (and notwithstanding 
whether a Triggering Event has occurred) the Termination Payment that would 
be owed to a Party in respect of all Transactions then outstanding should 
exceed $______, such Party as the Beneficiary Party may request the other 
Party to establish a Letter of Credit as the Account Party in an amount equal 
to the Termination Payment in excess of $______ (rounding upwards for any 
fractional amount to the next $______), or such other collateral as may be 
reasonably acceptable to the Beneficiary Party.  The Letter of Credit or 
other collateral shall be delivered within two Business Days of the date of 
such notice.  On a Monthly basis, such Letter of Credit may be increased or 
reduced correspondingly to the amount of such excess Termination Payment 
(rounding upwards for any fractional amount to the next $______).  For 
purposes of this Section [4.6], the calculation of ""Termination Payment"" 
shall include all amounts owed but not yet paid by one Party to the other 
Party whether or not such amounts are then due, for performance already 
provided pursuant to any and all Transactions.

Howdy all! SUE NELSON at AURORA GAS COMPANY (based in Michigan) is asking for 
information pertaining to what actions are necessary to establish a MASTER 
PURCHASE CONTRACT with ENA. 

What she is looking for: They are a small Utility that is looking for a FIRM 
PURCHASE contract taking gas to ""Mich Gas Station"" (?). They are looking at 
approximately 300,000 MMBTu a year and are looking for a 2 - 3 year contract.

Sue Nelson can be reached at 517-733-6625. 

We have not yet done business with this counterparty, so they are not in any 
of our Global systems. 
(Their address is (per smartpages.com) 7038 S Black River Rd, Onaway, MI 
49765. (She left her fax number instead of a phone, by the way - - - - - 
their fax is 571.733.6626)

Please let me know if I can do anything else to help.

Thanks!!
Cyndie
