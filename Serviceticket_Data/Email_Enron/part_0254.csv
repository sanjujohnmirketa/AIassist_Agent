Stacey:

I received your name from David Oliver in London, who mentioned that you may be able to answer questions for me regarding how we handle tolling for power in relation to order handling.    I am a business analyst working with EIM on the Logistics project.

I would like to ask some questions on this to understand how my team might relate it to the steel industry for EIM.

Let me know if this time will work for you.  If not, I can reschedule.

Thanks,
Angela"

I am pleased to announce the following changes in the Global Risk Management Operations organization: 

Bob Hall will lead operations for Enron Americas. Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas, with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management.  The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary Operations), Jeff Gossett ( U.S. Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (U.S. Power Risk), Leslie Reeves (U.S. Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements), and Bob Superty (U.S. Gas Logistics). 

Brent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets. 

I am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets.  Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston, London and Singapore offices.  Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod, who will now report directly to Beth Apollo. 

Beth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis,  Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations.  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams.  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. 

Beth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner.

Mike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron.   

Thanks for your continued support especially in exploring and seizing commercial opportunities to strengthen our contributions to Enron."

Someone sent this to Micah the other day and he read the whole thing to me.
It made me want to throw-up!!!!  Is this real or a sad joke???  Frightening
thought is that this was only 50 years ago.

RICARDO - This sounds like your type of woman : - )

Someone sent this to Micah the other day and he read the whole thing to me.
It made me want to throw-up!!!!  Is this real or a sad joke???  Frightening
thought is that this was only 50 years ago.

RICARDO - This sounds like your type of woman : - )

Rodney,

Our Web site is atrocious. Here is the story, as it appeared in Sunday's
paper. I am sending your mom some extra copies today.

David King

""Wa"" is a Japanese term meaning unity and team spirit. Every person playing
baseball in Japan must have it.
*
- Author Robert Whiting, from his book on Japanese baseball, ""You Gotta Have
Wa""
,
David King
Rodney Pedraza has gotten wa.*
Oh sure, he's still a gaijin, *an imported player, in the insulated world of
Japanese baseball.
But as he starts his third season with the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks* of the
Pacific League, the Cuero High School graduate and former University of
Texas pitcher has earned the respect of his peers - and developed a mutual
respect.
""(The players) know how the system works, how we could be here one year and
gone the next,"" said Pedraza, noting that most non-Japanese players don't
stay with teams more than a season or two. ""It's hard for them to open up to
us, knowing that, but since this is my third year, most have opened up to
me.""
It doesn't hurt that Pedraza, who never climbed above the Triple-A level in
North America, has become the top closer in Japan.
In 1999, he had 27 saves. Last year, he had 35, tying a Pacific League
record, and earned the Fireman Award as the league's top reliever.
Pedraza had been a starter throughout his pro career, but the Hawks needed a
middle reliever when he joined them early in the '99 season. One night, a
pitcher was hit by a line drive, and he wound up throwing the final three
innings for a save.
""They asked me if I could close, and I said I would give it a shot,"" he
said. ""I told them I didn't have closer stuff, but I would go after guys and
throw strikes.""
It's worked so far. The combination of a sinking fastball, a slider and
amazing control - he walked four and struck out 40 last season - has made
him almost automatic for the Hawks, who have gone from the league's doormats
to contenders the past two seasons.
The Hawks, managed by Sadaharu Oh,* Japan's home-run champion, won their
first Japan Series in 26 years in 1999.
""It was kind of overwhelming for me because it was my first year, I made the
All-Star team, I was being successful at something I hadn't done since
college ..... and as a team we were in the middle of a pennant race,""
Pedraza said. ""It was over before I could really get a grasp on what was
going on.""
He got the final strikeout of the Japan Series-clinching game against the
Nippon Ham Fighters.
But he admits he was a little puzzled by the postgame celebration, which
included the players tossing Oh in the air multiple times, a march around
the field with the championship pennant and a solemn ceremony in the
clubhouse.
The adjustment to Japanese culture - on and off the field - can be
overwhelming for a lot of players, as Whiting wrote in his 1988 book. But
Pedraza went to Japan prepared to be flexible.
He got his opportunity through Lee Tunnell, who pitched three seasons in
Japan. Tunnell was his pitching coach at the Rangers' Class A team in Port
Charlotte, Fla., in 1998, and he recommended Pedraza to scout Shin Mizumori*
the next spring.
Knowing he wasn't going to get beyond the Triple-A level with the Rangers,
Pedraza, 29 at the time, signed with Mizumori.
He sat down with Tunnell and Mizumori before leaving and got a full
briefing.
""They told me to have an open mind and go have fun,"" Pedraza said. ""The
culture is very different, but it doesn't affect me that much. I've gotten
used to most of it, or at least the things that mean anything to me.""
One problem has been the language. Although he has a translator, Pedraza
said he misses the camaraderie with his teammates, some of whom speak no
English.
""There are some neat guys that I'm missing out on only because I can't speak
to them,"" he said. ""I'd like to know about them and what they are thinking,
and I can't ask,"" he said. ""We try to talk and just end up smiling at each
other and walking away.""
His main contact with the English-speaking world is his laptop computer and
the Internet. Pedraza, who is single, talks to his mother virtually every
day on the telephone as well. She also visits occasionally.
""We've been to Japan his first two years. It's a completely different world
over there,"" said his mother, Imogene Stakes.
Pedraza also takes advantage of his brief offseason - teams that make the
playoffs don't finish their seasons until the end of October, and spring
training starts Feb. 1.
""That's not much of an offseason, because that's the time I have to spend
getting ready for the following year,"" said Pedraza, who recently bought a
home and property near Cuero. ""I have to squeeze that in along with my
hunting and fishing.""
It's not easy, but right now, he wouldn't trade his life.
""I don't miss much about playing in the States,"" he said. ""I am playing a
game I love, and it doesn't matter where it is.""
Sounds a lot like he's gotten wa.

As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.  "

As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov. "

Subject: Editorial: The Afghan people had nothing to do with this  atrocity.
The following commentary (forwarded by Yates Hafner) is by Tamim Ansary, a  
writer and columnist in San Francisco, who comes from  Afghanistan:
I've been hearing a lot of talk about ""bombing  Afghanistan back to the Stone 
Age.""  Ronn Owens, on KGO Talk Radio  today, allowed that this would mean 
killing innocent people, people who had  nothing to do with this atrocity, but 
""we're at war, we have to accept  collateral damage.  What else can we do?""  
Minutes later I heard  some TV pundit discussing whether we ""have the belly to 
do what must be  done.""
And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard  because I am from 
Afghanistan, and even though I've lived here for 35  years.  I've never lost 
track of what's going on there.  So I want  to tell anyone who will listen how 
it all looks from where I'm  standing.
I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden.   There is no doubt 
in my mind that these people were responsible for the  atrocity in New York.  
I agree that something must be done about those  monsters.
But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan.   They're not even the 
government of Afghanistan.  The Taliban are a cult  of ignorant psychotics who 
took over Afghanistan in 1997.  Bin Laden is  a political criminal with a 
plan.  When you think Taliban, think  Nazis.  When you think Bin Laden,think 
Hitler.  And when you think  ""the people of Afghanistan"" think ""the Jews in 
the concentration  camps.""
It's not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this  atrocity.  
They were the first victims of the perpetrators.  They  would exult if someone 
would come in there, take out the Taliban and clear  out the rats' nest of 
international thugs holed up in their  country.
Some say, why don't the Afghans rise up and overthrow the  Taliban?The answer 
is, they're starved, exhausted, hurt, incapacitated,  suffering.A few years 
ago, the United Nations estimated that there are  500,000 disabled orphans in 
Afghanistan--a country with no economy, no  food.  There are millions of 
widows.  And the Taliban has been  burying these widows alive in mass graves.  
The soil is littered with  land mines, the farms were all destroyed by the 
Soviets.  These are a  few of the reasons why the Afghan people have not 
overthrown the  Taliban.
We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the  Stone Age.  
Trouble is, that's been done.  The Soviets took care  of it already.  Make the 
Afghans suffer?  They're already  suffering.  Level their houses?  Done. Turn 
their schools into  piles of rubble?  Done.  Eradicate their hospitals?  Done.  
Destroy their infrastructure?  Cut them off from medicine and health  care?  
Too late.  Someone already did all that.
New bombs  would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs.  Would they at least 
get  the Taliban?  Not likely.  In today's Afghanistan, only the Taliban  eat;  
only they have the means to move around.  They'd slip away  and hide.  Maybe 
the bombs would get some of those disabled  orphans;  they don't move too 
fast, they don't even have  wheelchairs.  But flying over Kabul and dropping 
bombs wouldn't really  be a strike against the criminals who did this horrific 
thing.   Actually it would only be making common cause with the Taliban--by 
raping  once again the people they've been raping all this time
So what else is  there?  What can be done, then?  Let me now speak with true 
fear  and trembling.  The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in there with  
ground troops.  When people speak of ""having the belly to do what needs  to be 
done"" they're thinking in terms of having the belly to kill as many as  
needed.  Having the belly to overcome any moral qualms about killing  innocent 
people.  Let's pull our heads out of the sand.  What's  actually on the table 
is Americans dying.  And not just because some  Americans would die fighting 
their way through Afghanistan to Bin Laden's  hideout.  It's much bigger than 
that, folks.  Because to get any  troops to Afghanistan, we'd have to go 
through Pakistan.  Would they  let us?  Not likely.  The conquest of Pakistan 
would have to be  first.  Will other Muslim nations just stand by?  You see 
where  I'm going.  We're flirting with a world war between Islam and the  West.
And guess what:  That's Bin Laden's program.  That's  exactly what he wants.  
That's why he did this.  Read his speeches  and statements.  It's all right 
there.  He really believes Islam  would beat the west.  It might seem 
ridiculous, but he figures if he  can polarize the world into Islam and the 
West, he's got a billion  soldiers.  If the West wreaks a holocaust in those 
lands, that's a  billion people with nothing left to lose--that's even better 
from Bin  Laden's point of view. He's probably wrong;  in the end the West 
would  win, whatever that would mean, but the war would last for years and 
millions  would die, not just theirs but ours.  Who has the belly for that?   
Bin Laden does.  Anyone else?

Pretty good editorial by Leonard Pitts, Jr. in the Miami Herald...



Published Wednesday, September 12, 2001


We'll go forward from this moment


It's my job to have something to say.

They pay me to provide words that help make sense of that which troubles the
American soul. But in this moment of airless shock when hot tears sting
disbelieving eyes, the only thing I can find to say, the only words that
seem to fit, must be addressed to the unknown author of this suffering.

You monster. You beast. You unspeakable bastard.

What lesson did you hope to teach us by your coward's attack on our World
Trade Center, our Pentagon, us? What was it you hoped we would learn?
Whatever it was, please know that you failed.

Did you want us to respect your cause? You just damned your cause.

Did you want to make us fear? You just steeled our resolve.

Did you want to tear us apart? You just brought us together.

Let me tell you about my people. We are a vast and quarrelsome family, a
family rent by racial, social, political and class division, but a family
nonetheless. We're frivolous, yes, capable of expending tremendous emotional
energy on pop cultural minutiae -- a singer's revealing dress, a ball team's
misfortune, a cartoon mouse. We're wealthy, too, spoiled by the ready
availability of trinkets and material goods, and maybe because of that, we
walk through life with a certain sense of blithe entitlement. We are
fundamentally decent, though -- peace-loving and compassionate. We struggle
to know the right thing and to do it. And we are, the overwhelming majority
of us, people of faith, believers in a just and loving God.

Some people -- you, perhaps -- think that any or all of this makes us weak.
You're mistaken. We are not weak. Indeed, we are strong in ways that cannot
be measured by arsenals.

IN PAIN

Yes, we're in pain now. We are in mourning and we are in shock. We're still
grappling with the unreality of the awful thing you did, still working to
make ourselves understand that this isn't a special effect from some
Hollywood blockbuster, isn't the plot development from a Tom Clancy novel.
Both in terms of the awful scope of their ambition and the probable final
death toll, your attacks are likely to go down as the worst acts of
terrorism in the history of the United States and, probably, the history of
the world. You've bloodied us as we have never been bloodied before.

But there's a gulf of difference between making us bloody and making us
fall. This is the lesson Japan was taught to its bitter sorrow the last time
anyone hit us this hard, the last time anyone brought us such abrupt and
monumental pain. When roused, we are righteous in our outrage, terrible in
our force. When provoked by this level of barbarism, we will bear any
suffering, pay any cost, go to any length, in the pursuit of justice.

I tell you this without fear of contradiction. I know my people, as you, I
think, do not. What I know reassures me. It also causes me to tremble with
dread of the future.

In the days to come, there will be recrimination and accusation, fingers
pointing to determine whose failure allowed this to happen and what can be
done to prevent it from happening again. There will be heightened security,
misguided talk of revoking basic freedoms. We'll go forward from this moment
sobered, chastened, sad. But determined, too. Unimaginably determined.

THE STEEL IN US

You see, the steel in us is not always readily apparent. That aspect of our
character is seldom understood by people who don't know us well. On this
day, the family's bickering is put on hold.

As Americans we will weep, as Americans we will mourn, and as Americans, we
will rise in defense of all that we cherish.

So I ask again: What was it you hoped to teach us? It occurs to me that
maybe you just wanted us to know the depths of your hatred. If that's the
case, consider the message received. And take this message in exchange: You
don't know my people. You don't know what we're capable of. You don't know
what you just started.

But you're about to learn.

US military's alert status downgraded: Rumsfeld

09/13/2001
Agence France-Presse
(Copyright 2001)

ATTENTION - ADDS quotes, details
WASHINGTON, Sept 12 (AFP) - The US military downgraded its alert status Wednesday as tensions heightened by terrorist attacks on major US buildings a day earlier began to subside, US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said. 
""We've already moved from a force protection condition called Delta, the highest level, down to Charlie, which is the next highest,"" Rumsfeld told NBC News.
""But we are still at a reasonably high state of alert,"" Rumsfeld pointed out. 
US President George W. Bush ordered troops to be placed on Threat Condition Delta following the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon building just outside Washington. 
Under the alert, immediate restrictions were put on the movements of US troops overseas, military officials said. 
All leave was canceled, and soldiers overseas were barred from attending classes, bars and clubs outside their bases. 
Rumsfeld confirmed that despite the lowering of the alert status, the US military was carrying out missions which go beyond its normal peacetime operations. 
They include, for instance, sending jet fighters to provide protective air cover over an energy complex in Houston, Texas. 
""We have a number of so-called cap flights up, as well as some AWACS and some tankers to refuel the interceptors, as well as the other aircraft that are involved,"" he said. ""They're over a number of areas in the country."" 
The defense secretary said that military aircraft at a number of bases across the country were ""on strip alert,"" ready to respond in the event it would be appropriate. "

The BIG day is almost here, less than a month away!!  I hope everyone is as
excited as I am!!  I wanted to give you a heads up on times and what is
going on for that weekend so you can begin making plans if you haven't
already.

Friday August 10
I think some of the guys are getting together to play golf.  My dad,
grandad, brother, Kevin Galloway, and whoever else will be playing at a
location to be decided.  If you are interested and will be in Dallas Friday
morning, let Kevin or myself know.

The girls will be relaxing and taking care of last minute details (nails,
facials, tea, etc...)

Friday night
Please be at the church between 5:45 and 6:00.  Traffic can be bad at this
time of the evening, so please allow plenty of time.  In order to be at
dinner by 7:30, rehearsal must start at 6:15.  Maggiano's is five minutes
from the church so as soon as the rehearsal is over you can start drinking
beer again.

Most of our family and Jason and I are staying at AmeriSuites on Friday so
if you are staying at a hotel, try to book it there.  You need to book by
July 27 to get the discounted rate.  All the hotel information is on the
back of the directions sent with the wedding invitations.

Saturday August 12
Guys:  You are on your own, but Jason is not to hang out at the bar all
day.  (Sorry Kevin, no paybacks!)

Girls:  Luncheon is at the Zodiac room at downtown Nieman's.  If anyone
needs help with transportation, please let me know.

Wedding Time

Guys:  Please be at the church by 6:15.  You need to come dressed, but
bring your tux coat on a hanger as it will be very hot!!  Pictures will be
taken with guys and Jason's family before the ceremony.

Girls:  Please be at the church by 5:30.  You can bring your dresses, but
have hair and make up already done. Pictures will be taken with girls and
my immediate family before the ceremony.

Vocalists should be there by 6:30 to practice with organist.

House party should be there by 6:45 guest will begin arriving around 7:00.

There will not be a mass (you non-Catholics are off the hook(except
Jason!), Catholics will have to go to mass on Sunday!!)

Reception
As soon as the ceremony is over, stay around for pictures.  We are only
allowed 20 minutes so we will need to be attentive to the photographer so
he can make sure he gets all the pictures in the allotted 20 minutes.
Everyone will then go to the Tower Club downtown for the reception.  We
should be there by 8:45, unless we take a detour in the limo!!

Last call will be at 12:30 and there are plenty of places to go out
afterwards if you would like.  West end and Deep Ellum are a short cab ride
away.

I think that is everything.  Please feel free to call or E-mail me if you
have any questions!  Thank you for everyone for being a part of this
special time with Jason and I.  We look forward to seeing everyone soon!!!

Chris and Jason

	It appears after looking at the calendar that we need to clarify our vacation policy. When the calendar says no one off early, that also implies that no one should take vacation.  There are numerous tasks associated with closing out the prior month and setting up the new month which make those 2 days much busier than the rest of the month.  It does appear that the last day of the month is not quite as busy as the first day so we will be monitoring it to ascertain the need for everyone on that day, however, until we make that decision we would like everyone to be here. That being said we all understand unanticipated events and pre planned trips can sometimes interfere with your work schedule we just ask that you take the groups workload into account when scheduling your much deserved vacations.
	Another issue that needs to be addressed is the last day of the year and the first business day of the year.  Absolutely no one can miss these two days due to the extreme work load.  In addition we would like to give everyone the opportunity to have time off around Christmas or Thanksgiving in order to do this we need to see who needs what days off.  Please let Casey or I know what your plans are around those holidays.  Until we know from everyone it will be hard to allow someone to be off for both holidays.  Please let someone know in the future when you are scheduling days off before you enter them in the vacation folder so we can minimize the issues related to too many people being gone at the same time.
	Also be wary of your vacation balance and remember that according to Enron corporate policy you can only carry over 40 hours of vacation time, all remaining vacation time will be lost.  With that in mind try to schedule your remaining vacation time in the next few weeks so the end of the year doesn't sneak-up on you.

Thank you
Donnie Vinson

Sanjay,
In order to calc our book every day our C$ calc must be able to calc any USD 
deals that are in the book.  Currently the book errors out.  See postID 7746 
deal 473233.  The C$ book should take the USD MTM and multiply it by that 
day's fx curve in order to derive the C$ amount.

Also, In order to manage our currency exposures there are certain reports 
that we are going to need:

Daily Change Report:  This report needs to be amended so that p&l due to 
currency curveshift is separately stated.  This p&l would be calculated as:  
Yesterday's USD position x (today's fx rate - yesterday's fx rate)

Currency position report:  This is a report needs to show by month (by day 
for the current and prompt month) what our USD and CAD$ position is.  Our USD 
position would be the estimated cashflows for all of our deals denominated is 
USD.  Our C$ position would be the estimated cashflows for all of our deals 
denominated in C$.  We will use the USD position report in order to enter 
into offsetting currency hedges.

We are going to need this as soon as possible.

*DJ Cal-ISO: 2 Lines Down Tripped 400 MW Generator Off Grid
(MORE) Dow Jones Newswires 12-04-00
1226EST Forecast Demand May Surpass Record
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)-- A 230-kilovolt and a 115-kilovolt line went down
near Bakersfield, Calif., Monday morning and tripped a 400-megawatt
generator off line, causing a stage one power emergency, a spokeswoman for
the California Independent System Operator said.
The identity of the generator, which went off line about 7 AM PST (1500
GMT), wasn't immediately available. One of the two power lines that went
down is now back up, but a spokeswoman couldn't identify which line it was.
A total of 10,000 MW is off line Monday, with 7,000 MW off the grid for
planned maintenance and 3,000 MW off for unplanned maintenance, spokeswoman
Stephanie McCorkle said.
McCorkle said Monday's forecast peak was 34,257 MW, near the record winter
peak of 34,432 MW reached Dec. 13, 1999. McCorkle also said there is a good
chance Monday's forecast peak could change and surpass the record winter
peak.
Electricity forward prices in the Mid-Columbia River hub were higher Monday
than they were last summer, when demand outstripped supply. January was
trading Monday at $475/MWh, and balance-of-December was trading at $525/MWh.
Third-quarter trades were at $250/MWh.
A market participant said the ISO had a call out to buy 3,000 MW of power
from outside of California, which is usually done only in emergency
situations. But the ISO didn't comment on that.
The stage one emergency, which means operating reserves in the state are
below 7%, was expected to remain in effect until 10 PM PST (0600 GMT).
McCorkle said she didn't anticipate the state would go to a stage two
emergency, when voluntary power curtailments may be instituted for customers
who agree to cut power for reduced rates.

Hope this helps a little bit re: RisktRAC.  After talking to Jeff, I believe the key to book codes is ensuring from IT that we can use whatever we want as the database will be entry.  Andrea, I agree that you should keep a power list and Kam should keep the gas list.  Also, just wondering if when we set up the gas books should we have also put in requests for gas daily, basis, index, etc.  I couldn't remember how that worked.

Subject:	DprAutomation with Financial Swap Liqudation is ready

Dear Casey, J.P.

The first version of new DprAutomation with Financial Swap Liquidation and other changes is ready for testing. The set of files is saved at 
M:\Power_devl\Test\Swap Liq\

Since the driver and folder are moving around at this moment, all files in that folder must be keeping under same folder.

The formula for Swap Liq is the same as previous agreement.

Also Swap Liq have been rewritten. It is automation row.  It can pull all files from Unix and without manually pulling them via PortCal. The Calculate time for each pair desk/region also has been cut from about 2 minutes down to about 5 seconds. Total time for adding J9 issue is less 5 minutes at this time.

For roll files, I change some tabs names to match their names in Oracle region name. Otherwise, DprAutomation can't work.
 
If you really need the regions names as your new rolls file, I am going to find a way to hard code mapping  them in DprAutomation. However, we think the best way is setup those change in Oracle database. 

All files in that folder are copy files. Any change only affects those copy files.

The tabs names I change in copy rolls are:
R1:  NY Zone G -> NY EAST 
R1A: PJM West -> PJM 
R1C: NY Zone A -> NY WEST
R1D: PJM EASTTERN Hub -> EASTTERN Hub 
R1Z: PJM WESTTERN Hub -> WESTTERN Hub
R3B: TVA -> Into TVA
R4C: Comed -> Into Comed 

I will continue to test, optimize and  polish the Swap Liq and DprAutomation.

Please let us know if there is any correction or any problem.

Thanks!

Min Zheng

Since all of us need to log off of our PCs tonight. I can't work tonight. I will try to make the first version before end of tomorrow.

Also, could you let me know where is your latest roll files location. I need to COPY those files to my PC and have a full test on those COPY files.

BTW, all of our accounts will be switched to UBS.  That change may impact PC and Excel setting. I will be my desk < 8 Am. Let me know if there is anything I can do.

John - Not even the Dec #'s are done yet?  I believe they are planning on mass drafting Monday, so whatever is in the system at this time will go to Unify.  We might as well match Unify even if it is wrong, I guess.

I have moved deals where Houston has the master to an Alberta ENA terminations book (the postid is 15872 for Jan 10th.  Counterparties in the book are BP, Coral, ElPaso, Maclaren, Mirant, and ECC.  (I still need to move the ECC deals).  I think you would need to consider this book anytime you are doing termination calculations for any of these counterparies.

Please start the following task in the morning:

Using the Official 11-30 calcs that you exported deal summaries from, add the following counterparty's MTM by desk:
Constellation 
Energy Authority
Sempra Energy Trading
Public Service of Colorado

I believe the calc that identified our top-levels had extra transactions or values that did not fall out of our books.  Once you have figured out the total for the above counterparties compare them to your top-levels.

Thanks,

I have not recompared the Master Log to the 'Physical Terminated' spreadsheet.  This is just an update of my initial review.  Any comments would be appreciated.  I have also not included the Auto Terminations that we found out about today.  After tomorrow's updates, I will do these.  We are planning on moving the auto-terminations identified by David and confirmed by Kimberly to the bankruptcy book tomorrow.  If anyone has a problem with the counterparties identified, please let me know as soon as possible

Thanks,

Each of you needs to send a book request for the East & West portfolios for the counterparties listed in the following spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet identifies those counterparties which we are still performing under the contracts.  Please create a East-Performance and a West-Performance book.  We then need to get all deals with the following counterparties moved to those books.  I would suggest you pull the values out of AdHoc as of 12/31 for the counterparties by desk before transferring them to the new desk.  Obviously these transactions will create prior days and the amount will run through the P&L in the old and new books and flatten out.  The remaining prior day value will need to be in Schedule E.

Subject:	Enpower Outage Notice ***THIS WEEKEND***

Good Morning,

To support the Enron Estate / NETCO split, Enpower will be going down this weekend.  Starting at 6:00pm Friday, January 11th, we begin the process of moving databases & renaming them for the two companies.  The application is scheduled to be back online at 6:00pm on Saturday, January 12th.  The application team & any users volunteering for weekend testing will then begin performing some basic test scripts to ensure the applications still work.

Please note that after the change, you will need to change any Excel Spreadsheets or Access Databases that connect to the ""PWRPRODN"" or ""PWRPRODN_DED"" database aliases to ""ESTPWRPN"".

Thanks,  David Poston

Tim,

John's communication regarding not updating December was in order to complete December liquidations for accounting and settlements last week.  However, we were then informed that settlements would not draft their billing until the 14th of January so we then retracted our 'hold' on updating December schedule.  Any updates that can be made in order for settlements to get the most accurate data would be most appreciated.

In addition, the cash flow forecast (as indicated by Don) will be coordinated through Kristin.  I do not believe you will have to do any work for this as all the data will come from our risk calculations and true settlement information.  

Thanks,
Stacey

Subject:	RE: Dec and Jan liquidations

Yesterday I was approached by Steve Thome who had been asked by Brandon Wax (who was asked by Don Miller?) looking for a cash forecast for deals that flowed in December.  While I'd like to be helpful, I have never done a cash forecast before.  We don't have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort of thing.  The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower.  A week ago the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update Enpower in ""Schedule"" for all of the deals that flowed in December.  Diana Scholtes sent an e-mail (below) to Leslie Reeves on January 3rd indicating that we were prepared to update Enpower.  We heard from John Postlethwaite that Leslie didn't want us to update Schedule -- instead they could work off of our trade sheets.

I don't care which way we move forward.  It just seems that we aren't all on the same page.  We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the right information to the right people.  Exerience tells me that we are better off doing it ""right"" the first time.  I am hoping that between Don, Leslie, and Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do.  As of now, there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a cash flow projection.

Regards,
Tim

It has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.

What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Thanks,

John

Leslie,

I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  

I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  

If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.

Diana Scholtes

Subject:	Enpower Outage Notice ***THIS WEEKEND***

Good Morning,

To support the Enron Estate / NETCO split, Enpower will be going down this weekend.  Starting at 6:00pm Friday, January 11th, we begin the process of moving databases & renaming them for the two companies.  The application is scheduled to be back online at 6:00pm on Saturday, January 12th.  The application team & any users volunteering for weekend testing will then begin performing some basic test scripts to ensure the applications still work.

Please note that after the change, you will need to change any Excel Spreadsheets or Access Databases that connect to the ""PWRPRODN"" or ""PWRPRODN_DED"" database aliases to ""ESTPWRPN"".

Thanks,  David Poston

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

TXU would like to close out all of their positions, and have finally provided us with their view of MTM and other charges for physical and financial power and gas for EPMI, ENA, EES and Enron Canada.  Would each of you please provide me with corresponding Enron numbers for your respective areas.  Michelle, as you will see, there is an item under ENA titled ""other"" - is this something from your area?  Elizabeth - given the net amount they owe us ($114,751,812.) if we can agree on numbers, can we take this as a one off item to the bankruptcy judge?  Please advise.  Thank you.

Carl,

Please review the attached.  I have attempted to summarize our mutual
exposures by legal entity.  If the numbers in the spreadsheet are negative,
then that is monies owed by TXU to Enron.

I am still waiting for exposure summaries from TXU Energy Services as it
applies to Garden State Paper.

As discussed today, my intent is to quickly reach agreement as to a fair
and reasonable resolution of eliminating Enron positions from our book
structure.  I feel confident that our combined legal staffs can bind our
intent as required.

THE ATTACHED SCHEDULES CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND IS SUBJECT TO
FEDERAL RULE OF EVIDENCE 408 - FOR SETTLEMENT DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY -
NOT TO BE OTHERWISE ADMISSIBLE

Please give me a call when you've had a chance to review.

thanks

Subject:	RE: Interest Rates

Following the discussions I have had with Louise and Jay, this is the proposed solution to the interest rate risk management in NEWCO. 

1. For the first few weeks ( to a few months) we continue to use Infinity to update the curves at 2 PM. I will need to have one trader to execute, mark curves and do any deals for foreign exchange (Cd$ etc.). Louise, I hope you have this in your budget and headcount. I will need one junior trader(and maybe two as things grow) to help do this job.  I have lined up one of the guys in the old trading desk, if this goes forward.

2. In the first few weeks, Jay Webb and myself are hoping to acquire a lighter, and much simpler interest rate package which will allow us to do what we do, with significantly lower costs. We also will re-design the way we aggregate interest rate risk in the commodity books, to make it simpler and easier. To ensure there is no more discussion ever of drift-reallocation, I propose a method where, every desk head gets back his complete interest rate portfolio drift every month or quarter (less any transaction expenses ).  I would expect that, the interest rate curve shift will be small till we build a somewhat longer dated portfolio, while the drift could start becoming substantial pretty quickly (as we start making money).

Hope this answers the questions. We will have the curves at the right time, done by the trading group. We will still measure and manage our own exposure to both interest rates and currencies.  We intend to allocate small VAR to that risk management. We would deal primarily with one or two counterparties - the parent bank and a couple of futures brokers to manage the risk.  

Just to be very clear, while I am happy to manage this risk (with extra help), I am primarily  interested in the running of power options and structured products.



Harry

John/Louise -

Given that under the current plan, the bank will be trading our interest rate risk,  I doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to Newco.  In order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve.  

Should I plan on just getting access to Reuters and setting a curve off of LIBOR on my own?

After talking to Tom I have a new plan of attack for Schedule E's.  He informed me that the top-levels were typically put in at one region level per roll.  I had Zhiyun re-run the killed deals calc (post id 15667).  Everyone should go back into the rolls and put the top-levels into their correct regions also adjusting the Schedule E's.  This is why the differences are so large in certain areas and the only way we can start to pinpoint the problem is to find the problem spots.

I have also identified where the $4.6 MM difference for OPPD arose from.  Deal # 11678.04 has not been transferred into the East Bank book.  In addition, there are no volumes in this deals; however, if you look back to the official 11/30/2001 calc there are volumes for this deal.  It gets more bizarre than that because there were two deals that should have been transferred for OPPD (11678.4, and 564826.1).  Deal 564826.1 was transferred but the valuations are approximately $4MM different.  I have printed detail for deals 11678.4 and 564826.1 (they are in Casey's chair) as of the 11/30/2001 official calc.  I have also printed deal 564826.1 in the 11/30/2001 bankruptcy calc.  I noticed that I cannot see any swap detail reports for the bankruptcy calc.  Please re-calc and generate these reports as they will probably be important as we dig into details.

Other than Andrea who has to perform some IT testing, no one should be working (or playing) on anything other than trying to get these Schedule E's and top-levels figured out.  The task is actually very important as there will be many decisions made off of these numbers.

Thanks,
Stacey"

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

The first question is, as of the relevant dates (November 29, December 2,
December 11, and for completeness, all intervening dates) did Sequoia,
Cherokee or EFP have assets other than Enron receivables? If so what were
they, down to particular receivables, and what was done with any proceeds
thereof?  For the purpose of this question and the proposed stipulation,
ignore EFP assets that have nothing to do with Sequoia.  If the answer is,
""on November 29 there were receivables in ______ (identify entity) that
resulted in subsequent collections of $_____ (amount) on _____ (date),
where were the proceeds deposited?  If in an Enron account commingled with
other funds, segregation may not apply.  If segregation applies, then the
DIP lenders may or may not need to consent.

Also, please look at the description in the stipulation of information to
be provided and advise if it accurately describes what we have already
delivered.  If not, please advise regarding any discrepancies.

Thanks.

NOTE: amount at issue here is about $14,000,000.

True to form, Kelley Drye sent the form of stipulation and order last night
and want to submit it today.  Don't worry about the timing request, but I
would like your comments, particularly as to the paragraphs regarding what
we have or will deliver.  As for the segregation paragraph, all we agreed
to segregate were Sequoia assets.  I need to understand what is in the
other entities, if anything, before I tell them to stick it or agree
because we don't care.

Looks good - you mention month-end deadlines.  You also might want to mention the work that goes on during month-end close and how that could potentially affect trading P&L.

If you wouldn't mind, have a quick glance over the spreadsheet and see if there is anything I missed that you think should be mentioned. This is for the training class and I was just trying to hit on all the main areas which is not in any particular order right now. It is a general overview, so not too detailed.

Casey and John can get back to you on your specific question re: Canada.  However, I wanted to let you know that our DPR will more than likely not be final until Friday.  Hopefully we can get you all reports then.  We have had to leave the DPR open due to many terminations that are still funneling our way and we are getting the 12-31 data as clean as possible for the estate.

Stacey,Casey and John
 
Can you guys let me know which books still have deals with Canada?  If so,  are they still in the original files or have they been moved to another book.   As you can see below, the request for the Estate information is begun.   Please let me know if you have any problem getting the liquidations to me sometime today or early tomorrow morning. 
 
John - Do you have a Dpr for 12-31?  If so could you copy it to the report directory.  
 
Let me know if you have any questions, or problems gather this information.
 
Thanks
Tracy

Importance: High


There are a few things that we need to compile for the Estate.
 
1) Please load your December liquidations into your ""flash"" database so that I can get a good number for Gas December liquidations.
 
2) TG - need your liquidation file from power risk.
 
3) We need to find out which books have deals with Canada, gas and power.  For the gas books, these deals had to remain in the original book because  risk could not move these to the Gas Price book because of the pricing structure.  TG - for the power books, can you check with Stacey?
 
4) Also, we need to get a list of books, gas & power, that have a gross book balance as of 12/31/2001.
 
Put your lists together in the attached template and send back to me.  Let's try to have this data ""rounded"" up by tomorrow morning at 10:00 am.  I'm sure that this will not be all the data that is needed, but I'll let you know as soon as I get the requests.
 
thanks for your help

Please let me know your thoughts on the following correspondence.  We are in the process of putting together our integration plan and the interest rate curve is one of our biggest stumbling blocks since the interest rate group will not be going to NEWCO.  As you can see, your name has been volunteered and I need to know what all you will need access to in order to get this curve to the Risk Management groups on a timely (preferably 2:00 p.m.) basis.

Thanks,
Stacey

John/Louise -

Given that under the current plan, the bank will be trading our interest rate risk,  I doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to Newco.  In order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve.  

Should I plan on just getting access to Reuters and setting a curve off of LIBOR on my own?

Vlad,

Here is the latest book list based on book requests.  The one item I know has not been requested is Andy Zipper as the LT-Option trader.  When we request this and it is complete, we will send you an update.

Go ahead and include counterparties on our power list even if they do not have any outstanding trades.  That way, if anyone is comparing our lists later on their will be no discrepancy and they won't have to ask us again.

Thanks for all the other information.

Stacey,

I have reviewed the section on the attachment of counterparties on the master log with a ""Y"" but not on the physical power terminated list.  BP Energy Company is on the physical power terminated list.  With the exception of the four new companies that appeared on the master list today and Ameren, we do not have any trades flowing after December 1, 2001 with the other counterparties.  I have not been including counterparties on the list if we don't have any deals flowing December 2001 on out.  If I need to include companies that we don't have outstanding trades with let me know.

Niagara Mohawk has been purchased by Select Energy New York, Inc.  Tonight Global Counterparty is going to replace the Niagara Mohawk name with Select Energy New York, Inc.  I have been waiting on global before adding Select to the termination list.  I have not heard back on Ameren yet.

Once I have an answer from David on the other terminations (by alternate source) I will let you know.

Thanks for organizing the information from all of the e-mails.

Let me know if you need anything else.  I will be sending an updated physical power termination list today.

Thanks,
Melissa

Please review and let me know if I have misrepresented any counterparties.  If you want me to add comments, send them to me and I will incorporate.

Thanks,
Stacey

David,
Just to make sure you know, the Power Physical Terminated Transactions spreadsheet, is put together by Melissa from information she has received from Master Log and other.  This is our primary source for moving transactions into the bankruptcy book as she review to ensure that the contracts terminated cover all our trades.

Thanks,
Stacey

 I hope that all of you will attend this meeting, either in person on via video conference.  To make our time productive, please come prepared with the following:

1)  List of what we have done well in Operations and will want to repeat as UBS Warburg Energy.   This can be in your specific area of responsiblity or broader across all aspects of Operations (running risk books, broker check-out, confirmation prep, execution and tracking, scheduling, volume management, settlements, collections, operational analysis, etc.) . 

2)  With the luxury of no history and a fresh start, what would you do differently?  Please be specific, and again your suggestions can relate to your area of responsibility or may be broader.  

3)  If you could change or enhance one thing about the operating systems that you use to do your job, what would that be?  Please be specific and constructive on this.  An answer of ""Unify"" for instance, will be too broad.  

Call me if you have any questions.  --Sally

Please review and let me know if I have misrepresented any counterparties.  If you want me to add comments, send them to me and I will incorporate.

Thanks,
Stacey

David,
Just to make sure you know, the Power Physical Terminated Transactions spreadsheet, is put together by Melissa from information she has received from Master Log and other.  This is our primary source for moving transactions into the bankruptcy book as she review to ensure that the contracts terminated cover all our trades.

Thanks,
Stacey

Though LG&E Energy Marketing Inc. (""LEM"") has not delivered EPMI notice thereof, the wholesale power trading relationship with LEM should be considered terminated effective December 2, 2001 by reason of an automatic termination provision in Section 4.2 of the 1-22-97 Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement between LEM and EPMI.  No further scheduling of trades under that master agreement should occur. 

Though Cargill Alliant LLC is not being served currently, please note that the December 1, 1998 Master Energy Purchase & Sale Agreement with Cargill Alliant LLC terminated effective 12-2-01 by operation of its automatic termination provision.  

The ""restore services list"" immediately below has now been revised to reflect these automatic terminations.  Please let me know if you have any additional information, questions or comments.  --David

Importance:	High

1.  The cc'd individuals shown above are to be cc'd on each e-mail communication relating to terminations by the counterparties shown below which have not yet terminated. Communication on termination notices coming in should be made as soon as possible after receipt from the counterparty. Please try to assure that any termination notices reaching the 6th floor credit war room are brought to you ASAP for review.  Starting today, those counterparties shown in red may be receiving performance from EPMI on any given day going forward.  To serve our commercial purposes, we are hoping to get the time beween receipt of wholesale power side terminations and their review and internal acknowledgment on your spreadsheet and among the referenced persons reduced to a maximum of 24 hours.   

2.  I am confirming back to you that MidAmerican Energy Company has delivered to EPMI a 1-2-02 notice of termination, terminating effective 1-4-02 all wholesale power transactions under its Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement with EPMI dated 11-13-01. Please reflect this on your next issued spreadsheet.

We have many deals in the system with UI, but they are all part of one contract.  To my knowledge, this is the only big contract we have with them.  Just wanted to let you know because going through all the deals would be time consuming and they basically are one huge deal.

Stacey,

I have attached updated termination lists.  FirstEnergy and GPU have been added to the attached spreadsheets (along with a few other counterparties not referenced in your e-mail below).  United Illuminating has terminated as well but we are researching which trades are terminated.  I will let you know once the research is finished.  I spoke to David Portz about the other counterparties listed below.  He said they are all terminated and we should be notified on the next list we receive from legal.

Steve, I wanted to send this email in reference to Min Zhen with regards to the fact that he has not been included as one of the employees that will be a part of the new company. I wanted to make you aware of the fact the West and Canada power risk management groups consider Min to be a vital and very important part of the IT support that we receive. His knowledge and understanding of several very important excel macros that we use daily is critical to the success of our groups. It must be noted that on several occasions when other people were asked for help in areas that Min supports, the response was slow as people tried to understand what the problem was and how to fix it. I feel that is very important and necessary that Min be a part of the staff for the new company to ensure that all the risk groups continue to receive the exceptional support that we have come to expect from him.

Subject:	New West Power Deal Info

Confidential:  For Internal Distribution Only

The purpose of this e-mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible.  I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing.  My apologies for this.  Hopefully this e-mail will accomplish that goal.

A number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals.  As a result, we haven't been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money.  Our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check.  Instead, these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices.

We have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have.  We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre-petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money.  We have received approval from the Cash committee for purchases through December 27th (I think) and we will secure additional cash to continue on.

Here are the procedures as I understand them.  If you have any questions or modifications please me an e-mail or give me a call.

Cash Desk
Each cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated.
On a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term (next day to next week) deliveries with that counterparty are in the money.
If the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money, we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point.  We are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location.
The cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate (based on spot market prices) of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to Steve Thome.
The cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to John Postlethwaite via e-mail.
The cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring John current.

Marketing Desk
Steve Thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk.
The marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis.
The marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder.
Make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder at (503) 464-8058.
The marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis.  We don't necessarily care who buys it, but rather, we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated.
Whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to Steve Thome.

Deal Entry
The new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle.  After discussing the matter with Stacey White, she recommended entering the new deals in Enpower as zero price, non MTM, with an annuity equal to the prepay amount.
We should enter notes into Enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions.
This will allow settlements to match an annuity in Enpower with prepay out the door.  It will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice.

I'm sure that I've missed something.  Let me know.

Regards,
Tim"

Please forward to the following:

The request is for the East and West portfolios (non-terminated).  Don't forget to include Capacity and show separately in queries. By Portfolio, by Counterparty, by Category Code - P&L and delta by month.

Also send a P&L update to Elizabeth Sager and Don Miller.  The original files are 'East by Counterparty' and 'West by Counterparty'.

Stacey,

In talking with the Estate team, it sounds like they will be needing a few different types of info to help in the unwinding process.  In addition to the MTM reports you guys have been putting together, could we also do a delta position report by month?

Also, it would be helpful to get a list of deal specs and terms for each counterparty, basically like we were working on for David Forster before the bankruptcy.  I'll check with Kim Theriot on this as she was putting the list together before, but we will also want to get a MTM breakdown by deal for each counterparty.

These requests are not super urgent.  Basically I'd like to get the breakdowns sometime in the next week or two.  Hope that is OK, as I know you guys are inundated with requests at this time.

Let me know if you have any questions or if this overlaps with any other requests.

Thanks.

In order to point to the UBS environment in EnPower you need to change your PortCalc Host to the following.  This screen is reached through Tools - Option Environment.  Also, copy the PortCalc Host into your FTP Host:

 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks again for your continued help.  Hope all is well.

Subject:	Interest Rate Curves

Hi,

Is anyone talking to you guys about sourcing end of day Interest Rate
Curves for your various risk management systems, or would you like me
to arrange for them to be sent to you at the end of each day?

I could arrange for a file containing the OBS (UBSW Interest Rate
Derivatives system) yield curves to be e-mailed to you once they are
saved every afternoon.  The official closes for the USD and CAD LIBOR
curves are saved down at around 3:30pm / 3:40pm New York time each
afternoon.

The files would contain prices for the swaps, futures and money market
instruments that are used to build the curve, and also the
corresponding zero coupon rates on a continuous A/365 basis.  I guess
we would have to talk about the exact form that your systems need the
rates to be in to see if any conversion would be necessary.

Cheers,

James

I ran deal data for the counterparties we received termination notification on today.  I did not want to start moving deals while you were running calcs, so we can just do this tomorrow.  The deals are on the 'East New as of 12-19' and the 'West New as of 12-19' tabs.

Good News!!!  The termination spreadsheets have been updated.  There are three new counterparties for physical and one new counterparty for financial.  Will Smith has moved a new version of Deal Liquidation into stage for us to use going forward.  It incorporates both his script for moving deals to Bankruptcy books and splitting deals on their termination dates.  Please look at this so we can use it on our updates.

Dana,

Here are the values of the annuities in the book as of 12/18/2001.  These annuities represent amounts UI paid to Enron for the specified PPA's taken on during the transaction.

Stacey

Deal #		Description			Amount
277987		Bridgeport/RESCO from UI	$132,435,059
277854		Derby Hydro pmt from UI		$      432,504
277816		Shelton	Landfill pmt from UI	$    1,271,462


The following list represents other values associated with Resco, Derby and Shelton.


Deal #		Description			Amount
277987		Resco Deal			$(139,333,170)
257449.2	Receipt of capacity Resco	$    3,889,708
255034		Longs - Derby Hydro		$        (29,107)
257449.4	Receipt of capacity Shelton	$         49,488

I have also attached a file with UI current deal numbers and comments attached to those deals, thought it might help.

Dear All,

	After the Windows Accounts migration tonight, our UBS traders will not be able to access the Estate EnPower Curve Manager. We are going to copy all the existing Curve data and files from the Estate to the UBS servers tonight. This would be the Final copy, so the UBS Curve data is considered Production data.

	Starting tomorrow, please let the Estate Traders mark the Estate Curves, and UBS traders mark the UBS Production curves.

	Estate Curve Manager will NOT be available between 8:00PM 2/4/2002 and 10:00AM 2/5/2002.

	UBS Curve Manager will be available starting 10:00AM  2/5/2002.

	Please let us know if there is any questions or concerns.

	Regards,


Norman.

PS. Kathy, please contact Min if you need help on Alberta's Excel Position Managers ( Curve) files.

We will be running a December MTD DPR tomorrow.  Before we start this process please recalc the East, West, Eastbank, & Westbank portfolios to AdHoc.  Check one more time that only terminated counterparties are in the Bank portfolios and all terminated counterparties are out of the East and West portfolios.

Before kicking off the calcs, double check the specific deals that are listed on the Physical Power Terminated spreadsheet.  I believe there were whole deals moved to the Bank portfolios by Will that should never have been moved, because they were already liquidated in November.  Also, I have attached a new copy of the physical terminations.  There is one counterparty (TXU) added to the list that we need to take care of before kicking off the calcs.  In addition to adjusting deal entry for TXU we also need to adjust scheduling.

Before recalcing the Bank portfolios, please contact Debbie Brackett or Stephanie McGinnis (4-2022) to make sure that they have extracted the data they need from the portfolios.

We should still be calcing on 'No True-up'.  Casey, I know you said this probably will still cause us trouble.  At this point, we are going for reasonableness with numbers.  All the previous top-levels in our rolls (as of the 3rd or 4th) will stay as top-levels until we know the exact amount of cash that is being attributed to power.  The remaining prior day values will be held in Schedule E for Georgeanne to move to a balance sheet account.  These top levels should match the total value of your Bankruptcy portfolios.  Where I think it will get tricky is that we are calculating as of the 18th and have transactions in the Bankruptcy portfolio that are before the 18th and therefore will fall into your liquidations.  These numbers will also have to moved to Schedule E.

When running through liquidations in the East and West portfolios, we will not be flat.  Currently, we are liquidating all non-terminated counterparties other than those specifically negotiated out of by scheduling.  (Thresa and I are working on this with Corry and Cara).  The settlements group will figure out what the counterparty agrees with through the check-out and ultimately the clean-up process.

Tomorrow should be a blast - I can't wait!!!

Stacey

In addition to running the East and West portfolio calculations we will also be running the bankruptcy books on a daily basis.  These should be run as 'Official AdHoc Full Book' but NOT OFFICIALIZED.  

The post id numbers should be e-mailed to Debbie Brackett, Stephanie McGinnis and John Powell before you leave for the evening.

Debbie,

The bankruptcy post ids for 12-18 are 15296 and 15297.  The data should be available first thing in the morning.  Norman is running the calcs for me because I was receiving error messages.

Norman,

If the post ids change or the data is not available by morning please reply to all to let us know the status.

I am not sure why these did not show up yesterday, maybe my query was incorrect.  However, the following spreadsheet contains terminated counterparties that still show up in the West portfolio.  Let me know that you have or have not corrected it.

Subject:	west bankruptcy deals

John:

So far I know we have three lists going around associated with moving west deals to the bankruptcy portfolios:
   
The first list is what I got from you => we added the deal comments together.
The second list is from Casey => Sam and I changed the deal termination dates in each deal 
The third list is from Will Smith => Will Smith changed the deals listed from the original desk to the bankruptcy desk

However, I am not sure if these three lists together provide the whole picture of what we have done so far.  Per Stacey's instructions, after we changed the termination dates, I exported ad hoc for the bankruptcy and west portfolios and found below issues:
 
a. some counterparties showing up in the bankruptcy portfolio are listed in any one of the above three files.  Please see this attachment and look at those not highlighted in yellow.
 
b. for some counterparties we still have deals in the days after the termination date.  Please see this attachment and look at those highlighted in orange and red.
 
* AQUILA: please check out deal # 656568 and # 569156.  According to Will Smith's list, the termination date for AQUILA should be 11/30/01.  However these two deals are not changed accordingly.
* ELPASOMERLP: according to the termiation dates list (from Casey), are we terminating all deals with this cp on 12/3/01?  If yes there are a bunch of deals left unchanged in the west portfolio for the rest of the month.  For example, #883630 has volumes for 12/4/01-12/31/01 under STNW desk.  There are many more deals like this.  Please search in deal entry to see all.
* Same case for MORGAN.  Example # 884431.1 in which we have volumes for all December 01' but according to the termination dates list, the termination date for this counterparty should be 12/7/01
* SMUD: please check deal# 647957.  This financial swap is still as it has been, i.e. under LTCA book for Q2 02'.  But according to Will Smith's list, the termination date for the counterparty should be 11/30/01?

If you could please help me look at this I will appreciate it very much.

Thanks,
Fran

Yes, you will do normal calculation tonight.  In addition, either today or tomorrow, please also calculate the Bankruptcy Portfolio.  Export data from both West and Bankruptcy Portfolio by Counterparty and Physical/Financial.  Compare the data to the Termination Lists.  All counterparties on the termination list should be included in Bankruptcy Portfolio and all other counterparties should be in the West portfolio.  If you notice discrepencies, please investigate and correct.  Also, Will is still changing some deals that Casey sent him an e-mail on.  Do you know if this affected the West?  If so, you will need to wait until he is complete.

Mid C is R9, but WSCC-N is R8.  A 'B' indicates a basis curve which WSCC-N is not.

Subject:	the list for the 13th

Current open items are:

Weather - looks like there are still probs bringing this stuff in.  Ramesh, would you have time to work with Todd and see if you can track down the problem?
Freight exotic - this hasn't been officialized for days - what's the status here?
Gas - they are still working to officialize the 12ths (should be done by 10 am this am) and then will do the 13th - there were problems deleting the interdesk transactions.  Jeff will let me know when they are done and we can rerun VAR/credit.
Power - a few EPMI books showed up.
Lumber - I probably need to reload the 12ths, but waiting on confirmation.
Liquids - a few exotics books showed up as well as 1 UK book that has been officialized in the recent past, I'm not sure of the status of these going forward.

 

Thanks

Andrea:

Thanks for doing that for us.  I also did a check by looking at ad hoc exported after the bankruptcy calc is done.  I believe there might be some deals that were missing in the process of changing the deals and moving them from west portfolio to bankruptcy portfolio.  I will be out starting from 12/17 on vacation.  I will ask John to confirm if there are more changes needed for the cleanup.

Thanks again,
Fran

John and Fran-

The Creditors committee is coming in this afternoon and requested reports showing the value of the deals we have in our bankruptcy portfolios.  Given the time crunch, I ran the WestBank calc also and included in the information I sent to Debbie Brackett.  There were a few counterparties that I deleted from your query because they were not listed in the Terminated Counterparties file.  They were BPENERGYCO (Financial Deals, but net value = $0) and PUDSNOHOMISHCTY (Financial).  I also did not have time so see if all of your Dec-01 information was correctly split based on each counterparty's effective termination date.  Did you guys have a chance to go through that information?

Thanks!

I have attached two Excel files representing the P&L by counterparty for all deals in the East and West Bankruptcy portfolios.  Please do not hesitate to call if you have any questions or if you need any additional information.

Stacey, part of my relocation package was the $700/month mortgage subsidy. In May, I received the first installment for one year and due to the current situation with the company and with Enron at this point unsure about helping with a potential move back to Houston, I wanted to receive the second installment as soon as possible. Frank is ok with this, but I wanted to check with you before anything else is done.

Subject:	UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week


Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken"

Hey guys, 

We need to try and get this populated today and distributed.  Can each of you please take a look at the assigned section and let me know your comments.  The only thing we are trying to do here is identify the activities of the Estate and what needs to be performed by the resources in each group.

Cara & Mike will you please update the scheduling and trading areas? 

Stacey, will you please update the risk area?

I will work on the settlements / volume Management and I will work with Dave Steiner on the IT section.

Thanks so much for everyone's help.  I'm sorry I'm out of the office today.  We really need to get this done ASAP to help management understand who is available to assist in this time of transition.

Thanks - MO

Tom,

After our call today Mike Purcell and I spent a little time talking.  We also have some time schedule to Cara and Jeff Richter tomorrow  I have put together the attached  template which I will hopefully have filled out for you by tomorrow afternoon.

Our biggest concern today was how we would address the Real-Time scheduling requirements.  Mark Guzman is part of the estate and should be able to cover the day shift during the week and we can outsource to UBS to cover all the other shifts (Just a proposal).  In addition, Lester Rawson is part of the estate and has Real-Time experience and is also the individual who currently manages the El Paso obligations.

If you have any questions please give me a call @ 503-702-9846.

As of right now this is the plan for the killed transactions:
  Please use the attached spreadsheet that indicates the prior day changes in your rolls.  Then compare these actual changes to the projected changes in the spreadsheet below.  As of tonight, please top-level all prior day changes and we will tackle tomorrow.  Also, remember that traditionally you would have no financial prior days on the first business day, so the financial prior days showing up in your rolls are due to killed financial transactions.  These amounts should also be top-leveled.

Thanks,
Stacey

All deals were killed with Constellation, The Energy Authority and Public Service of Colorado.  This will cause us to have huge prior day values today.  This spread sheet has the P&L for all deals with those counterparties and Stacey will let us know what adjustments we need to make.

I was in a meeting last night to discuss who was critical.  I do not know if that list has been blessed.  The list we put together would definitely get us a through especially since we will not have all the old deals.  Your normal contacts should be there - Norman, Zhiyun, Min, Duong Luu, Will Smith.

Stacey,

Wondering if you could provide a little help.  The career services
assistance packet we picked up on our way out listed an email address to
send our resumes.  The email was listed as follows:

career services@enron.com

It doesn't work.  For one thing email addresses do not have spaces between
words, it is usually a . or _ but not a blank space, the email program will
not accept a blank space.

I tried emailing to
       careerservices@enron.com
       career.services@enron.com
       career_services@enron.com

Every one of them got returned.  Is the email address not functional yet or
am I am missing something?  Could you forward this email to the appropriate
person?  In the mean time I will try the fax numbers provided.

Thanks

Also thank you for forwarding those voicemails.  Having been in Houston for
less than 6 months and reentering the working world after being a full-time
student for 2 years, my contact base in Houston is very limited.  At least I
will be able to call a few people in the morning.

Thank you

No prob.  Can you request DPOS through ERequest - I believe we still do it that way.

My group is now:

Shona

I'm putting together a list of everything we used to do and working on determining which things we should prioritize.  Until I complete that, can you ensure that all requests for info go through me?

Thanks a million!

This will open up a folder where the data is archived to.  It should be read only, so let me know if there are any problems or you need read/write access.

You could tell during the conference call yesterday with you that he was somewhat disappointed that he was not laid off. He has other avenues that I think he wants to pursue. Wanted to know if we have any recourse on this since he under contract right now. I have not approached him about it but have been tempted to just so he will get his act together.

Here is my request:

Can you make the system calculate a killed deal?  There were deals killed with Sempra Energy Trading on Saturday and the credit group needs to know what the value would have been had these deals been calculated against yesterday's curves.  Basically, we need to calc all Sempra deals that were killed Saturday or later as of last night.  Is this possible?

I have Norman running a calc on the Sempra transactions.  He was able to set up a special calc to calc the killed deals.  When he is able to give you the values, will you call Dave Forster @ 3-1861 and let him know the values.

I will be in meetings from 1:30 - 4:30.

possible.  I am currently working on termination statuses and when deals wi=

The 11/30 DPR is still listed on the ERV as preliminary, as there are still=

 tomorrow.  We are currently experiencing some IT issues related to positio=

Dear Stacey and Fran:

  Both of you have asked me to restore some portcalc reports, some of the request was due back to even early this year.  I submitted all those request to the Unix team, but due to what happened to the company recently, apparently things are not kept in track very well and some people who used to work on the restoration has left without leaving a clear status notification.  

  I was asked by the Unix group to put together all the reports that still need to be restored and submit it to them again.  I'm wondering if you can provide me with a current list.   

  I'm very sorry that I have to ask you to do this, but I think by putting together a complete list and getting rid of those we no longer need, we can get things done in the shortest time.

  Thanks a lot.

I was comparing the 'Position by Trader PRINT' tab in WestPos to the VaR report (Nov. 26 for example).

I would hope the rules for carrying over a week will still apply, but I have not heard anything concrete.  I'll see what I can find out.

this covers just about everyone I know.


Unfortunately, the last one did apply to me.  Happy Holidays.  :-)

  . 1. Your potted plants are alive. And you can't smoke a one of them.
    2. Having sex in a twin-sized bed is absurd.
    3. You keep more food than beer in the fridge.
    4. 6:00 AM is when you get up, not when you go to sleep.
    5. You hear your favorite song on an elevator.
    6. You carry an umbrella. You watch the Weather Channel.
    7. Your friends marry and divorce instead of hookup and breakup.
    8. You go from 130 days of vacation time to 7.
    9. Jeans and a sweater no longer qualify as 'dressed up.'
    10. You're the one calling the police because those darn kids next
        door don't know how to turn down the stereo.
    11. Older relatives feel comfortable telling sex jokes around you.
    12. You don't know what time Taco Bell closes anymore.
    13. Your car insurance goes down and your car payments go up.
    14. You feed your dog Science Diet instead of McDonald's.
    15. Sleeping on the couch makes your back hurt.
    16. You no longer take naps from noon to 6 p.m.
    17. Dinner and a movie - The whole date instead of the beginning of one.
    18. Eating a basket of chicken wings at 3 a.m. would severely upset,
        rather than settle, your stomach.
    19. You go to the drugstore for Ibuprofen and antacids, not condoms
        and pregnancy test kits.
    20. A $4.00 bottle of wine is no longer 'pretty good stuff.'
    21. You actually eat breakfast foods at breakfast time.
    22. ""I just can't drink the way I used to,"" replaces ""I'm never going to
drink that much again.""
    23. Over 90% of the time you spend in front of a computer is for real
work.
    24. You don't drink at home to save money before going to a bar.
    25. You read this entire list looking for one sign that doesn't apply to
you.

I think what was happening with the VaR is that we would like the POS with VaR in the evening but not relink in the morning when they run the VaR p/l so the numbers in the pos are a day behind.

One more change....the two desks should be broken down into separate portfolios, so we actually need two new portfolios set up in Enpower:

East Bankruptcy
West Bankruptcy

They should each have their respective bankruptcy book only in each portfolio.

Norman & Zhiyun,

Please see the bottom of this e-mail for the original values given to Andrea for this exercise.  At the time, we had not broken out East & West and only had a total value.  My issue is that the original values do not tie to the values were are seeing today.  Just to be sure, the calcs we are running should include all Sempra deals killed on or after Saturday, Dec. 1.  Can you please advise as to which numbers are correct.

Thanks,

Stacey,

Wondering if you could provide a little help.  The career services
assistance packet we picked up on our way out listed an email address to
send our resumes.  The email was listed as follows:

career services@enron.com

It doesn't work.  For one thing email addresses do not have spaces between
words, it is usually a . or _ but not a blank space, the email program will
not accept a blank space.

I tried emailing to
       careerservices@enron.com
       career.services@enron.com
       career_services@enron.com

Every one of them got returned.  Is the email address not functional yet or
am I am missing something?  Could you forward this email to the appropriate
person?  In the mean time I will try the fax numbers provided.

Thanks

Also thank you for forwarding those voicemails.  Having been in Houston for
less than 6 months and reentering the working world after being a full-time
student for 2 years, my contact base in Houston is very limited.  At least I
will be able to call a few people in the morning.

I have consolidated the changes in the following file:

 

Please change the trade date on all the newly created Bankruptcy Deals to the trade date of the original deal.  Also, please cross-reference in both transactions the associated deals numbers and document that the deal numbers are due to termination.

Also, check with Will Smith to make sure he has completed the Allegheny transfers (they were missed in the initial batch run) and then re-calc the 'Termination Test' portcalcs to ensure that the designated counterparties are not included in the old portfolios.  Also, check with Norman or Zhiyun to ensure that they have attached the port-calc code to the Bankruptcy portfolios and then we need to make test runs on them as well.

Can you please work on attaching the portcalc code to the Bankruptcy Portfolios first thing Monday morning.  Please reply to this e-mail when it is complete so we can begin testing the transactions we moved.

Thanks,

Last week was the hardest week that our office has ever experienced.  When I look down the list of people who were laid off I see the names of some very talented people.  Things have unfolded so quickly -- the reality of the situation is settling in for me, and probably many of us, today.  

Again, I wanted to express my thanks and gratitude to everyone on our floor -- both current and former employees.  In the interest of keeping people informed about who is here and who is gone, below is a complete list of layoffs done last week within the west power team.

Attached is a template we will be using to identify all pre-petition creditors that are critical to our operations.  This will allow these creditors to be paid.  Payment to such creditors must meet the following criteria in order to be considered ""critical"":  (1) payments must make sound business and operational sense; (2) payments must be mission critical; and (3) there must not be a substitute vendor.

The ""critical"" status of these vendors will need to be approved by Kerry and George Wasaff (head of the cash committee).

Jenny, we already have your list. 

Thanks, 
Mike

Corry,

I would love to start the process of cleaning up the scheduling system.  We will need help from the schedulers as well so can you send Duong Luu their logins and request the 'Zero Volumes' application in EnPower.  There are many people asking about what is flowing and the month is creeping by so if you could get with me tomorrow to make a game plan that would be great.  I think we should have the schedulers send us their spreadsheets with an explanatory and then we, along with Unify users, will come up with a plan.  I hope to use the schedulers in this process as well, let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
Stacey"

Hey girls.  I just talked to Kathy and she can't do
lunch on Friday, but wanted to do Sunday brunch
(without the guys).  I can't remember who was free on
Sunday and who wasn't, so let me know.

One question:  I had Melissa Murphy put together the termination dates for each of the counterparties and was wondering if you could clarify something for me.  If a termination date is 12/4/2001, do I move 12/4 forward to the bankrupt book or do I move 12/5 forward to the bankrupt book?

The following spreadsheet is a consolidation of counterparties that have not turned in termination letters.  I have also attached the list of terminations so that you can see the list we used.  If there are other counterparties that you know of that have not appeared on these lists, let me know and we will move them to the 'Bankruptcy Portfolio' we have set up.

<<Non-Terminated Counterparties as of 12-7-2001.xls>> <<Financial Power Terminated.xls>> <<Physical Power Terminated.xls>> 

Please let me know what other details you need and we will be happy to provide.

Georgeanne,

I spoke with this recruiter on the phone and told her I would forward the information to our accounting group.  I was not sure who all in your group was part of the layoffs and thought you might be able to forward them this information.

Elsie, 

I put the 11/30 strip back in the deal.  The ""884449 in bankruptcy"" does refer to another deal that we created due to Aquila terminating transactions with us.  The reason you cannot see it is because you probably do not have access to the new portfolio.

Stacey,
	On deal 321581.1, there were adjustments made 12/10-12/11.   Appears to have deleted 11/30/01 strip.  In deal comments, what does ""884449 in bankruptcy"" mean?  I tried looking up this deal, but it did not exist.

Frank,

Here is the file.  I am planning on continuing to look for the $30.5 MM that is created when you add dailies and compare to YTD.  (Cell M245).  You can delete these information if you want.  Remove December from the reconciliation because I only gave them data through 11/30 and Curve Shift data for December is completely useless.

Yes, you will do normal calculation tonight.  In addition, either today or tomorrow, please also calculate the Bankruptcy Portfolio.  Export data from both West and Bankruptcy Portfolio by Counterparty and Physical/Financial.  Compare the data to the Termination Lists.  All counterparties on the termination list should be included in Bankruptcy Portfolio and all other counterparties should be in the West portfolio.  If you notice discrepencies, please investigate and correct.  Also, Will is still changing some deals that Casey sent him an e-mail on.  Do you know if this affected the West?  If so, you will need to wait until he is complete.

It seems like Casey is out of office.  We have done changing the termination dates.  Is there anything we need to do next?  Do we calc our books as we normally do this afternoon?

We have changed the termination date for west deals (old and new) as specified in the ""termination dates"" file in Stacey's special project folder.  Please let me know how we should proceed from here.

Do your gas books have any gas deals left?  There were 23,000 deals missed in the 'kill exercise' performed by IT.  If you have deals left, please re-calc tomorrow to see if they go away.  If you have no deals, then you are done!

Here is today's list.

 << File: dec 11 unofficialized.xls >> 

I have open questions for:

Stacey - 2 west pwr books (by the way, good job on the gas books you guys have - I spoke with Casey and she'll officialize these tonight for the last time and we'll inactivate them tomorrow)
Todd - GRM & weather - do you know when you might be able to start officializing these again?
Michelle/Mark/John S - there are still a few books (exotics etc) that we should figure out what should be done
David Oliver - UK-CRD-BRN-PRC - Mark said this one would be officialized.  It showed up as not officialized this am.
Sheri - the exotic price still isn't being officialized.  Where do we stand on that one?
Matt - steel & lumber - they showed up - we rolled the files from yesterday and uploaded them this morning - is this okay or were there terminations run through?

Thanks

This file gives you similar information to the file that Jeff sent you for gas.  Frank is using it to continue investigating what went wrong with the extraction from the VaR model.  If you want me to change anything, let me know.

We technically should have no third party transactions.  If we do, we need to move them to the NG-Price book.  Please let me know if this is the case.  Also, Casey & I will be both be out of the office tomorrow.  If you need someone in Houston to help get questions answered please call Andrea.

There are still gas deals in five gas books. So you mean they should all go away tomorrow (whether interdesk or 3rd party deals)?
Anyway, I will re-calc tomorrow to make sure.

To be totally consistent from the beginning, can you rename either your long term Long Names to not include spaces between 'North' and 'West' and 'South' and 'West'.  The short term books do not have spaces.

If there is anyone I have missed on the email that needs this info, please forward it on. To expedite the process for all, Tim Belden will be looking after 2 trading books for the time being. There is no time frame for when a change on this will take place.

Here is a list of the remaining Hourly traders for the West trading region.

I just wanted to give you an up date on the review with Heather. My primary=
 focus with her was taking on to much responsibility and not focusing enoug=
h on the end results of her project such as Renewables. She just needs to s=
pend more time ensuring that the numbers being reported are correct and acc=
urate the first time, not after it goes into production. There had also bee=
n a complaint from Fran that Heather is not involved enough with the daily =
routines and may be taking the group for granted when it comes to the day t=
o day work. Heather agreed with that but the problem that she faces is that=
 Nick, Fran and Sam use that inter messaging system to communicate instead =
of verbally and as a result Heather is left out. I was thinking of telling =
everyone that there should be no use of the messaging system for business r=
elated issues within our group and also implementing the assigning of respo=
nsibilities to people for a couple of weeks then rotating it around. That w=
ay nobody can say somebody else is not helping enough. All in all it went w=
ell otherwise. She is was very receptive to my concerns and readily admitte=
d to areas of improvement.

Couple of other things that I got from the meetings that might help the gro=
up. The first is an informational meeting with settlements and maybe accoun=
ting to understand what they do with the reports that we send each month an=
d secondly, another meeting (hopefully better) regarding VaR and how the re=

It is meant to have price increments that indicate what curve shift would have been had the curve been adjusted by that increment.  In order for this report to be generated, you have to choose the Hypothetical Curve Shift option in PortCalc (see below)

Now I am reading your To Tame a Texan's Heart.  So  maybe I will have it finished by the next time we see each other.
 
Have y'all seen any good movies  lately?  We went for my birthday and saw Don't Say a Word.  Couldn't  decide between that or Training Day.  Should have seen Training Day.   I was disappointed in the other one.  Of course Lamar said ""I told you  so"".
 
Well, I will let you go.  Take  care.
 
Love,
Karyn"

Keith, 

Here are the procedures for the East.  The West is not currently running option sensitivities. 

Approximately every one to two weeks or as requested by the options traders an option sensitivity report is run using PortCalc.  Three parameters are tested:  Price (increments from -5 to +5), monthly Volatility (increments from -25% to +25%), and Time (increments up to 90 days.  (Reminder:  the increments are changeable)  The data is imported from PortCalc into an Excel pivot table.  The pivot table is then used to show how the various Greeks (delta, gamma, theta and Vega) change for each trader's book, generally with a 3 month look ahead.  The data can also be sorted by and grouped by other criteria, if requested, such as by region and delivery date These reports are given to the East option traders only.

Thanks,
Stacey

Tom,

For East Power, when you do your extract, you should select ""commodity"" only as the deal category so you will not pick up any capacity positions, as they are included in neither Var nor our position reports.  Also, you should query by delivery point and exclude all of the following delivery points (region codes in parentheses) as they are ancillary and credit positions and not energy positions, per se:

10 Min Spinning (R1J)
10 Min Non-Spinning (R1K)
30 Min Op Reserve (R1L)
Op Cap (R1N)
Renewable Energy Credits (R6R)
Regulation Up (R6W)
Regulation Down (R6X)
Responsive Reserve (R6Y)
Non-Spinning Reserve (R6Z)

Let me know if you have any questions!
Casey

2)Yes, except South America is not in EnPower yet.  The portfolio is set up, but no transactions are captured there.
3) The West looks close but the East is completely off.  Also, AlbertaENA should not be zero.
4) RetailEast & RetailWest are test Portfolios and should not be included!

Hi Stacey.

We've generated the numbers below directly from EnPower/Adhoc (effective date 10/24). Just a couple of points I need to confirm before we can try to generate our DPR numbers from this query --

1) where can we get the spreadsheet positions from?
2) are these all the Enpower portfolios we should be picking up for Power?
3) do the numbers for NA look correct? 
4) I will be sending the numbers daily to the ""contacts"" listed -- any other names I should add?

Thanks.

Stacey,

- ALBERTADIR is in the table: Peak = (20,162), Off-peak = (20,588)

- Per your last email, I'll remove RETAILEAST and RETAILWEST.

- For spreadsheets, we currently see the following:
POWER-SS-R3B-PRC
POWER-SS-R3C-PRC
POWER-SS-R1B-PRC
We'll take these from RiskTrac.

- For SouthAmerica positions, we can also take from RiskTrac

- The numbers for EAST and WEST are off because I ran the query at around 11AM. I didn't realize that Adhoc only holds the last calculated numbers, not as of a certain effective date. If we run the query everyday at 7AM, can we be sure we're capturing all of previous day's trading? And none of current day's?

Thanks.

Tim,

I typically do not like to give access to m:\common\power\ directory as this is where all the DPR information is.  A member of your fundamentals team, Maria Van Houton, would like access to the drive in order to access curve data that the risk group puts together.  If this is o.k. with you I will approve, otherwise I will tell her to get the information from the curve directory m:\power2\region.

Thanks,
Stacey

Hi Stacey,
I work in the fundamentals group in Portland and receive the forward power curves daily via e-mail to import them into our database for our traders here.  I have requested access to the m:\common\power directory because this is where the files are stored and it would be much more efficient and increase reliability tremendously by automating the collection of this data versus the current system of manually detaching the files through e-mail.  Our traders have come to rely heavily on accessing this information in our database.  However, when I'm out, the files don't get imported because I'm not here to detach them.  Please let me know if you have any further questions.
Thanks,
Maria

I'll try to keep you up to date with any changes.

Subject:	UBS Data Migrations


I have received several questions from the floor regarding the subject topic.  Here is what I know as of 2:00 today.  This is an evolving process.  Please distribute this note as appropriate:

All movement of 'data' from Enron to UBS is subject to legal approval.  Legal is developing policy guidelines that will govern what and how much data individual users and the IT department can move.

Data can be defined as application data (source code, executables, scripts, etc...), business data (curves, prices, deals, weather forecasts, etc...), and office documents (spreadsheets, word files, etc...)

Data is housed in many different places, including desktop C drives, individual network H drives, common file servers (O/M/R/W drives), database servers, application servers, and web servers. 

Several steps have already been completed:

The physical file server environments for UBS have been established.
The physical DB server environments for UBS have been established.
The physical application and web server environments for UBS have been established.
Some file server directories have already been copied.  This was limited to data (executables, risk excel sheets, etc...) necessary for IT to test our critical applications in the new UBS production environment.
Our large EnPower and TDS Oracle databases were also copied for application testing.

Where do we stand?

I am maintaining, and have distributed to this group, an inventory of all software and hardware components associated with our Power application portfolio.  The inventory includes specific common file server directories that are necessary for our Power apps to run.  We have received input from several business owners in this area.
Legal and IT are collaborating on a process for moving file server data. (H/O/M/R/W)  We are expecting a process definition within days, given our Day 0 target of February 6th.  (legal integration date)
At this time, it sounds like individual UBS employees will participate in identifying files on the various file server drives listed above and signing a document specifying that that data movement adheres to legal policy guidelines.  Individuals may even be asked to physically move (drag and drop) files from the old Enron drives to UBS holding drives.  This is still under discussion.
We have made some basic assumptions about the amount of business data to be moved to UBS.  I have provided Tim, Kevin, and Lloyd an overview of these assumptions.  This is also still under discussion.

I will schedule a meeting in the next couple of days to discuss this, and other transition issues, in more detail.

Thanks, Steve

Hi Stacey,
I work in the fundamentals group in Portland and receive the forward power curves daily via e-mail to import them into our database for our traders here.  I have requested access to the m:\common\power directory because this is where the files are stored and it would be much more efficient and increase reliability tremendously by automating the collection of this data versus the current system of manually detaching the files through e-mail.  Our traders have come to rely heavily on accessing this information in our database.  However, when I'm out, the files don't get imported because I'm not here to detach them.  Please let me know if you have any further questions.
Thanks,
Maria

How did you get the column Deal Cat-Code to show up when you ran the PL Desk Report?  This was the column that separated the lines into Commodity and Capacity.  I don't see that column when I run this report.

We will not be there next week so that should be fine.  Are the complex derivatives group and 'structured book' run by Paul Darcy the same thing?  If yes, then we are planning on reviewing that area.  Should I contact Paul Darcy directly?  If no, what is the complex derivatives group?

No formal agenda has been planned for our staff meeting today.  Instead, I would like for each of you to think of a question(s) or problem(s) that you have encountered while in the group.  These questions/problems can be something that you already know the answer to or have yet to receive the answer.  For those areas that you already know the answer, this would be a good time to share what you have been working on with the rest of the group and maybe stop everyone else from running into the same question/problem.  For those areas that you do not the answer, we will do our best to get that answered.  

In addition, if there is any additional detail that you would like to know regarding topics covered in the Risk Overview class, this would be a good time to ask since the class is fresh on your minds.

Thanks,

Jason,

I am aware of the risk being taken regarding the old Sun machines moving to the new building.  Specifically, they may not work once taken out of commission.  I am also willing to take this risk and request that the current machines the power risk group operates on should accompany them to the new building.

I really am in the dark re: Hanson.  If you could make the rounds then we might have a better idea if Donnie should be there.  If Scotty does not know all the particulars (and Jeff does) I am not sure that the 9:30 PST meeting will be effective.  I basically just want some answers!

I believe Jeff cannot make the meeting tomorrow at 9:30 local. I know we meet at 8:30 local should we have jeff and Scott sit in at 8:30 and just meet separately after? Did you want Donnie at the meeting? Of course I am speculating not knowing anything about whether Scott can make it or not.

Deal Entry needs your user testing today.  The Production freeze starts tomorrow so we have to move this today if it is ok or it cannot be moved for another 2 weeks.
Kroum made some changes so that the long deals done in Canada will not crash the system.  You should not see a change at all.  They had over 2000 transactions that replication could not keep up with, but that has been fixed.
I will be calling you to make sure you are able to test.  I appreciate all your help.

As the rules for ERCOT have changed and we are looking at a pool, with sandhill (the Austin Project) right there, this risk is mitigated. Does this suffice as a reason to  unwind this.

All,  This past weekend, additional performance related changes to the EnPower production environment were implemented.

Our database environment was upgraded from a 32-bit version of Oracle 8.1.7.2 to the 64-bit version.  This upgrade increases the maximum size of memory cache available to our applications from 4Gb to 25Gb.  Apps that cache large amounts of data will experience reductions in physical I/O thereby increasing application speed.

Once again, this change represents one of many short-term steps to improve the performance of our core wholesale trading system.  I'll continue to send out notifications as these changes are implemented.

We will review the complete set of short and long-term performance related improvements in an upcoming architecture review meeting TBA. 

Glad to discuss.

We think the best option is to balance the month with a sale/purchase at $R0 price and push the income and cash payment/receipt into the future.  Remi is giving us a Dec 2002 expected settlement date which is discounted at about 25%.

Other than Lavo's approval does there have to been sound rationale for a Schedule C for AA?

Please plan to attend a meeting in my office (ECno 2328) at 1:45 today.

Britaldo, Peccio & possibly Remi will be calling me @ 2:00 to discuss establishing an official policy for recording trades, receivables and related ""reserves"" for deals.

Martha, I think this will link back to our discussion last week and the decision to ""schedule C"" some amount for the liquidity issue.

Thanks,
Jody"

Can one of you make sure LT-SERC is still an active book (if not, have it reactivated) and coordinate with TJae regarding the EOL ID.  John may still be set up in EnPower, I am not sure that his access was ever taken away, but we need to have his trader ID attached to LT-SERC.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Everyone,

As we prepare to re-launch the website, we're planning a simulation session for our traders and originators for next week (tentatively Monday).  This session will be similar to the ones we had before the initial launch of EnronOnline.  In brief, the goals are:

Test the integrity/functionality of the system and related processes,
Get everyone re-acclimated with the system and processes (traders, originators, credit, operations, help desk, et al), and
Show how the trading system and our processes work to the UBS staff visiting next week.

In order for the simulation to be successful, we will need to ensure that the simulation environment is exactly like the ""live"" trading environment.  We will need to coordinate with each one of you about what needs to get done to make this possible.  I will be sending out an invite for a meeting tomorrow morning.  Please make sure you attend to discuss what needs to get done on your end (setting up trader/counterparty profiles, credit headroom, etc.), as this simulation has been requested for early next week.  If you have prior commitments, please appoint someone from your group to fill in for you.

Feel free to call me with any questions.

Regards,
Rahil

Yes - I travel to Portland on a regular basis and access the network from the hotel.  I also I am a member of the 'Emergency Weather Plan' team meaning that I have to simulate my computer at work from home in case my group (Power Risk Management) cannot get to the building.

I am sorry to be difficult and you can definitely have a meeting without me and fill me in later, but the all-employee meeting is today and I have been asked to be there by Bob.  In addition, I have a work lunch headed by Sally to discuss the all-employee meeting.

Subject:	New Pub Codes for Enpower

Good Morning Stacey,

Jeff Richter wants to start trading ancillary service deals through EOL.  To help facilitate this new business, we need to setup several new pub codes that represent the indexes the California ISO publishes for ancillary services.  A few of the ancillary pub codes are already setup we just need to add the ones for spin & non-spin.  Do you know who we need to get with to have these new pub codes setup?  I will work with the IT guys to ensure the programs that scrape the ISO site and store the prices are updated to capture these new indexes.

Thanks,  David Poston

ps - Please give me a call if you have any questions, 57834


These pub codes already exist:

ISOGRRNP15	(CAL ISO GENERATION REPLACEMENT RESERVE @ NP-15)
ISOLRRNP15	(CAL ISO LOAD REPLACEMENT RESERVE @ NP-15)

Repeat for SP-15

Repeat for ZP-26


These pub codes need to be created:

ISOGSRNP15	(CAL ISO GENERATION SPINNING RESERVE @ NP-15)
ISOLSRNP15	(CAL ISO LOAD REPLACEMENT RESERVE @ NP-15)

Repeat for SP-15

Repeat for ZP-26

ISOGNRNP15	(CAL ISO GENERATION NON-SPINNING RESERVE @ NP-15)
ISOLNRNP15	(CAL ISO LOAD NON-SPINNING RESERVE @ NP-15

Repeat for SP-15

Repeat for ZP-26

Make sure that all curves are downloaded by the end of simulation, 11:00 CST, tomorrow.  Ideally, the 2/7/02 curves should be marked in the morning prior to simulation.  We have been instructed to kick the calculation off as close to 11:00 CST as possible.  This is to ensure that ALL downstream systems are able to run through the simulation.

Please forward to all applicable traders.

Tom,

Hope this helps.

1)  Only the power positions need to be queried.  Gas positions for spread options and heat rates are included in the gas bench.

2)  Any power Exchange transactions should be included, but the gas transactions calculated in ERMT should not be included as they are on the gas bench.


Thanks,
Stacey

Dear Tom,

	 1) Are you only interested in the Power positions? Do you need the Gas position for a Spread Option deal? 

	 2)  Do you want only the Post IDs officialized by Power PortCalc, so the Exchange deals' position calculated in ERMT need not be included?

	 3)  Can the results be in vertical format? e.g.

	East	Nov-01		100
	East	Dec-01		200
	...
	West	Nov-01		101
	West	Dec-01		201
	...

	Thanks,


Norman.

Hi Norman. I've tried running some queries using Adhoc and I always get too detailed information. We only need total MONTHLY peak and off-peak positions for a couple of portfolios.

I've attached a file to illustrate the information we need. Can you please take a quick look and let me know if it would be possible to write a query to generate the info on a daily basis. Since the query may take a while to run, and we need the info by 7:00AM everyday, I would prefer to automatically run the query at say 5AM?

Let me know your thoughts. Thanks.

Edie,

Per our conversation last night, attached is the lowest level of detail we can provide for EOPS allocations to EA.  EOPS doesn't track these costs at the cost center level.  If you would like for us to provide the plan at a lower level than this, please review the categories and provide us with a further allocation and I will use your allocations on the template for Thursday.  If we can't make it by Thursday, we can provide this level and maybe later we can go back and do a further breakdown.  If you have any questions, please call.

One more thing, this file has not been finalized or blessed so it is preliminary and subject to change.  It should give you a good basis to start breaking it out.

Thanks,

Kevin

In order to have consistency among all power calculations, please follow the procedures outlined below.  Please feel free to forward this e-mail to anyone I may have missed.


Power Month End Calculation Procedures


?	At each month end the officialized power calculations are dated effective the last day of the month, even when that day is a weekend.
?	Power curves are populated as of the business day the calculation is performed and the effective date of the calculation.  For example, curves were produced for both Friday, September 28, 2001 (the day the calculation was performed) and Sunday, September 30, 2001 (the effective date of the calculation).
?	RisktRAC IT rolls the results of our calculation back to the last business day in order for the information to map to the business day's date.

This procedure is followed because power trading is on a daily liquidation timetable.  The calculation engine is instructed to liquidate based on the effective dates of the calculation.  

Below is an example of the PortCalc screen as set up for a calculation at month end where the month end is on a weekend.
	Choose Non-exact Libor Based Curve so that the calculation engine will pick up the last business day's interest rate curve.

	Choose the Valuation Date as the last day of the month.

Choose the Prior Val Date as the last time you ran a calculation (normal procedures).

In addition, if you are the owner of the power curves, you must contact PortCalc IT to copy the curves as of the last business day over to a file dated the last day of the month.

Thanks Tracy. Based on conversations I just had with Chris Foster it looks like they want to take the money and put it in a sch C. To cut a long story short, they are worried that they will lose part or all of this money because the FERC and California may be revising the PX index. I have indicated that this can not be done until John Lavorato signs off on this. Stacey, do you see any fall out from doing this. It looks like they want to take care of this in the next couple of days.

John,
 
I'm afraid I don't have a whole lot of detail.   These deals originally came through on the March Flash to Actual report as a West DPR adjustment.   I was then told by Stacey that these deals needed to be moved off DPR adjusment, but I'm not sure where they were to be moved to.   You will see these listed as a ""?"" on the LTD report at the top of the page.  I know during the meeting, Stacey was talking to Portland about these, but the only notes that I see on my hard copy is ""wait 60 days on PX""...""annuity 4 sale back to them"".
 
Sorry I'm not much more help than that.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thanks
Tracy

Can both of you give me some background on the 4 annuity deals listed below. Mark, these deals have never shown up on a desk analysis report and were entered on Mar 30 for jan business. Are they supposed to? Murray, are we supposed to be taking these annuities as PMA adjustments or are we still waiting for something more information?
 
 
Thanks for your help on this.

Do you remember what was going to happen to these deals with the cap of 150.00? Will they be clearing anytime soon?

Thanks Tracy. Based on conversations I just had with Chris Foster it looks like they want to take the money and put it in a sch C. To cut a long story short, they are worried that they will lose part or all of this money because the FERC and California may be revising the PX index. I have indicated that this can not be done until John Lavorato signs off on this. Stacey, do you see any fall out from doing this. It looks like they want to take care of this in the next couple of days.

John,
 
I'm afraid I don't have a whole lot of detail.   These deals originally came through on the March Flash to Actual report as a West DPR adjustment.   I was then told by Stacey that these deals needed to be moved off DPR adjusment, but I'm not sure where they were to be moved to.   You will see these listed as a ""?"" on the LTD report at the top of the page.  I know during the meeting, Stacey was talking to Portland about these, but the only notes that I see on my hard copy is ""wait 60 days on PX""...""annuity 4 sale back to them"".
 
Sorry I'm not much more help than that.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thanks
Tracy

It's not as detailed as you may be thinking. 

We run an unofficial adhoc book for the LT-SW and LT-Options book with option sensitivity checked as on
Run the West_Sens_new macro created by Min and Zhiyun after calc has finished
Spreadsheet is sent to Matt for his use
audience is Matt Motley and Mike Driscoll
Matt only looks at the spreadsheet based on current market conditions and does not do any type of stress testing. As a result we always make sure there are no scenarios in the predictive option sensitivity area..

Are you currently preparing option sensitivity reports for Matt Motley?  If so, please put together a bullet point list of what we do on a daily basis, who the audience is, and anything else you think might be relevant to an audience of users interested in what procedures we perform for stress/ scenario testing.

Partnership
Spurs Enron
Equity Cut
---
Vehicle Is Connected
To Financial Officer
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller

10/18/2001 
The Wall Street Journal 
Page C1 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Enron Corp. shrank its shareholder equity by $1.2 billion as the company decided to repurchase 55 million of its shares that it had issued as part of a series of complex transactions with an investment vehicle connected to its Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. 
Enron didn't disclose the big equity reduction in its earnings release issued on Tuesday, when the Houston-based energy giant announced a $1.01 billion charge to third-quarter earnings that produced a $618 million loss. But the company briefly mentioned it in a subsequent call with security analysts and confirmed it in response to questions yesterday. As a result of the reduction, Enron's shareholder equity has dropped to $9.5 billion, the company said. 
In an interview Tuesday, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said that about $35 million of the $1.01 billion charge to earnings was related to transactions with LJM2 Co-Investment LP, a limited partnership created and run by Mr. Fastow. In a conference call yesterday with investors, Mr. Lay said that the 55 million shares had been repurchased by Enron, as the company ""unwound"" its participation in the transactions. In the third quarter, the company's average number of shares outstanding was 913 million. 
According to Rick Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, these shares were contributed to a ""structured finance vehicle"" set up about two years ago in which Enron and LJM2 were the only investors. In exchange for the stock, the entity provided Enron with a note. The aim of the transaction was to provide hedges against fluctuating values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other technology investments. Mr. Causey didn't elaborate on what form those hedges took. 
Subsequently, both the value of Enron's stock and the value of the broadband investments hedged by the entity dropped sharply. As a result, Enron decided essentially to dissolve the financing vehicle and reacquire the shares. When Enron reacquired the shares, it also canceled the note it had received from the entity. 
In addition, Enron was receiving increasing criticism from analysts and major shareholders concerning the apparent conflict of interest involving the role of its chief financial officer in the partnership, from which he stood to make millions of dollars. In July, Mr. Fastow formally severed his connections to LJM. Mr. Fastow has declined to be interviewed. 
Given all the complexities of the LJM-related financing vehicle and the questions it raised outside the company, ""the confusion factor wasn't worth the trouble of trying to continue this,"" Mr. Causey said. 
Enron downplayed the significance of the share-reduction exercise. Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, described it ""as just a balance-sheet issue"" and therefore wasn't deemed ""material"" for disclosure purposes. 
Jeff Dietret, an analyst for Simmons & Co. in Houston, said that a large reduction of equity could be ""a flag for the rating agencies"" because it could adversely affect a company's debt-to-equity ratio. Enron said yesterday that as a result of the equity reduction, its debt-to-equity ratio rose to 50% from 46% previously. 
On Tuesday, after Enron reported its big quarterly loss, Moody's Investors Service Inc. put Enron's long-term debt on review for a possible downgrade. Moody's said the move was related to ""significant write-downs and charges reflecting substantially reduced valuations"" in several of Enron's businesses. In recent years, Enron had moved aggressively into broadband telecommunications and the water business, both of which failed to produce expected returns. 
Enron, which as of June 30 had $33.6 billion in current liabilities and long-term debt, has lately been attempting to shed assets to pay down debt."

Subject:	RIBFEST -5- (Nov. 3rd)


The World Wide RibFest ""celebration of the Rib"" is coming up.  This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).  I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.

For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).  A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a ""peoples choice"" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).  

Every year, my wife asks the following: 	""So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?""
			          I reply:	""Nothing comes to mind.""	
		               She replies:	""No."" 

As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.  So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.  The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.  The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.

There are a couple of changes to this year's competition:
The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire
Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing ""personal reasons""

Date & Time
Saturday November 3rd.  We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.

4807 Elm Street in Bellaire

Directions (from John Mee himself)
From downtown, take 59s to 610s. The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit. Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April. Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building. Right before that building is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street. Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue...
KIDS
Bring 'em!  We'll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we'll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them.  The more kids the better.

What you need to bring
Nothing, except maybe some attitude to heckle the cooks while they try to concentrate.

Zhiyun,

Let's go ahead and make this change.  We can think of no reason why this would cause a problem.  If everyone could keep a close eye on this deal after the change, that will be most beneficial.

Thanks,

Hi Stacey:

  Just want to follow up to see if there is any after thought about what we discussed yesterday on Index Option.  From our discussion, index option will be reported in two records:  reported as physical in the delivery region, and financial in the index region with the corresponding position and risks.    This seems to be a better alternative than reporting the collapsed position in the delivery region in one record or reporting both position as physical  in two records in the delivery and index region.  

   Could you please let me know if we should go ahead  implementing the changes?  We plan to move the current stage to production tonight and do a new stage release this week, I'd like this change, if going to occur, to go into this release.

   Thanks a lot.

Subject:	RE: New Curves - REVISED AGAIN

Hi Frank.

Rakesh and I talked with Narshima Mistra, ancillary trader at EES.  The ancillary curve exists almost every power curve and it's more related to the capacity availability rather than market prices. Obviously it's indirectly related to prices since cost of generation, which is one important factor of constraints in the capacity of generation.  So EES has a table of ancillary service price % to generation cost.(Below)  I think this table can be used to simulate the ancillary prices by mapping to regional curves after the modification based on the market prices.  The problem is the illiquidity of this market. The price is reported once in a month as average point, so the RAC should identify the risk in this market, e.g. is it reasonable to get the daily value at risk.  Once again, as long as the daily prices of the ancillary is given, the implementation will be available by doing analysis on the data and making table like below to use in mapping curves.

Jaesoo

Frank,
the ancillary curves data are not liquid so we can not assign them as primary curves presently.
Using jumps would be appropriate for them. 

Jaesoo plans to talk to the trader and come up with more concrete suggestions.

How urgent is it to start calculating VAR on them?

Hi Stacey!
I wanted to thank you for spending time with me yesterday.
I am very interested in learning more about/ pursuing opportunities within your group.
Since i would have to pretty much start from scratch, wherever you have a need i would be glad to jump in.
Both the curve validation & risk positions sound very interesting to me.
Below is my availablilty over the next 2 weeks...
Please let me know who you'd like for me to sit with/ learn from/ etc. and i will be there.
 
Friday, 10/19- OFF
Monday, 10/22- available all day
Tuesday, 10/23- not available
Wednesday, 10/24- available after 9:30
Thursday & Friday, 10/24-5- available all day
Monday & Tuesday, 10/29-30- available all day
 
I will be off the 31st through the 2nd, as we are now moving (as of 4:30 yesterday!) to the green glass building behind my current unit.
We got a great deal, and saved a bunch of $$$$, so i took it.
 
Let me know what works for you...
 
Thanks!
 
Sunjay

The Bayou City Dance Company is once again selling poinsettias as a fundraiser.  This is the dance company for 10-18 year olds for which my wife, April, is the Director.  They are selling the poinsettias for $8.50 each and they are pretty good size (about 12-18 inches tall from what I remember).  Just like last year, I will deliver the flowers to the Enron building (or at least to the Enron garage).

They come in red, white, or pink, but I think the red were by far the healthiest and longest lasting.

The order are due by next Friday, so please let me know if you would like to order (and how many).

Thanks.

I am still tracking down the Green Mountain documentation, but here is the documentation for LCRA.  I'll forward the rest when I get it.

Thanks,

I need to get with you regarding the existing schedule C I have for LCRA and for green mountain. I believe market conditions may have changed sufficiently that we can release some of it but I want to reaffirm this by researching the reasons again.

Trust you are well.

Thanks,

Subject:	RE: R20 - Ontario

I can easily put in prices for the earlier months.  My only worry is that it may affect EES since they have current Ontario positions that should not be valued against my curve (they should use regulated rates until market opening).

I can put the prices in today.

Subject:	R20 - Ontario

Garrett,
Recognizing that Ontario does not open until Mar 02, and recognizing that we have positions starting then, and recognizing that the curve doesn't have prices posted for reference dates prior to Mar 02, the value-at-risk engine is getting errors in it's simulations due to lack of prices thereof.  

Can you do either of the below?
?	Post prices for dates up to Mar 02?  (realize their isn't market?.tough issue)
o	If you post a price, I'm not sure it will mean much other than letting VAR run, primarily because there isn't position prior to Mar 02. Perhaps you can fill in hole with a realistic price so prompt month correlations don't go wacko?I guess.. Stacey help. 
?	Recommend a ""like"" curve to map R20 to so that we can get around zero price issues?  Realize that mapping will include entire term structure and not just for the reference dates with zero price.
?	Other ideas?

I appreciate your help in working toward a solution.

Thanks,
Frank

Stacey, the index option is showing just as a physical deal with a position. I am wondering if this is creating positions in Risk Trac because our peak position does not tie with the bench mark. The difference is close to the index option but not quite.

Subject:	RE: New Curves - REVISED AGAIN

Hi Frank.

Rakesh and I talked with Narshima Mistra, ancillary trader at EES.  The ancillary curve exists almost every power curve and it's more related to the capacity availability rather than market prices. Obviously it's indirectly related to prices since cost of generation, which is one important factor of constraints in the capacity of generation.  So EES has a table of ancillary service price % to generation cost.(Below)  I think this table can be used to simulate the ancillary prices by mapping to regional curves after the modification based on the market prices.  The problem is the illiquidity of this market. The price is reported once in a month as average point, so the RAC should identify the risk in this market, e.g. is it reasonable to get the daily value at risk.  Once again, as long as the daily prices of the ancillary is given, the implementation will be available by doing analysis on the data and making table like below to use in mapping curves.

Frank,
the ancillary curves data are not liquid so we can not assign them as primary curves presently.
Using jumps would be appropriate for them. 

Jaesoo plans to talk to the trader and come up with more concrete suggestions.

How urgent is it to start calculating VAR on them?

Hi Stacey:

  Thanks for the background and insight information.  

  For weekly options, if there is any, we are still using the monthly-daily blending formula, there's no different blending rules applied right now.  

  From your email, I get it that for all deal types in East portfolio, no blending should be applied, this includes deals whose expiry frequency is embedded in the deal type but not explicitly specified (such as transmission deals) in deal entry.  If this understanding is correct, we'll need to make code changes, please let us know if we should start implementing that or wait till after the meeting.

  Thanks,
  
- Zhiyun

Subject:	RE: volatility

The blending vs. non-blending can be confusing and could potentially cause problems down the road so I would first like to make some general statements regarding the history or this change and what the rules should be as I understand them.  

	Only the curves applicable to the East NERC regions are being marked as a daily and monthly volatility; therefore, no blending is needed for daily options (they point directly to the daily vols) or monthly options (they point directly to the monthly vol).  All curves applicable to the West NERC regions are still being marked as intramonth and monthly; therefore, blending is needed to provide a volatility for daily options.

	The best rules to be in place for the blending vs. non-blending would be based on curve.  East curves do not blend.  West curves do blend.  Therefore, ANY daily or monthly option in the East would not have to blend.  The potential problem that could be caused by making the rule apply to portfolios is that, for example, the East portfolio could potentially enter into an option at a West region (curve) and that transaction would need to use blended curves even though it is in the East portfolio.

	Options at a different expiry than daily or monthly is another problem.  Are there different blending rules embedded in the code for weekly expiration?  We still need to discuss this.

	I would be happy to all sit down and have a meeting concerning this issue whenever everyone is comfortable enough that we know all the current rules.  Let me know.

Clarification 1,  I haven't come to East Power last March.  Therefore, the change must not be my request.
Clarification 2,  I like the change.
Clarification 3,  I do NOT have concerns about the difference itself, but it is scary that people (i.e., myself) don't know the difference exits.  I think your summary below is very valuable and I would like to make sure Risk team and other relevant people be aware of it.

Hi Hai:

  Here's the logic about volatility.  Originally all volality is calculated as a blend of monthly and daily volatility.  From last March, based on your request, I made the changes for East and its mirrored portfolios (ENAWEATHER, ENACCO,PLANT,SVCE) only, and for option, spread and basis option only, that we use daily vol for daily option and monthly vol for monthly option.    The implication of that is that for 

1. other portfolios,
2. other deal types such as Asian, Transmission Deal, index option ( which East does not have right now),
3. other expiry frequency, say, WEEKLY (which East does not have right now), or deals that doesn't have expiry frequency explicitly defined,

the blend approach will still be applied.  Please let us know if you have any concerns.

Sounds like a great idea to do follow-up reviews.  

I have budgeted $2000 a month for travel and lodging on the West RC.  I would prefer you keep it to every six weeks in order to cover me coming up there and others coming down for training.  I think it would be beneficial for you to be able to meet with groups in Houston.  I also only budgeted for $100/month for Overtime/Working Meals so we may have to subsidize that with the traveling budget.

I have not heard anything lately on the video conferencing.  If you don't mind, ask Tim if he has made any decisions on the video conferencing.

Subject:	update on a couple of things

Just wanted to give you an FYI on a couple of things. I am planning to meet with everybody on a one on one basis in the next week to do a quarterly review. I was planning to revisit their mid year reviews and talk about how they have progressed or not, projects they have worked on and how they went,  long term plans, etc. I think it is even more pressing for Heather because of the way the Renewables was handled. I figured since I went through the process with Emissions, I had a pretty good insight on what I wanted her to do, so I laid out the groundwork for her. Didn't go as I had planned so I wanted to use the opportunity to get her back on track.


Regarding coming to Houston a little more often, I would like to try and come maybe every 4 - 6 weeks if that doesn't blow your budget up. Obviously it depends on ticket prices, but I am learning that while it is ok to communicate over the phone with various groups, it doesn't beat being face to face and looking at the same reports and interacting a little more efficiently. As I said, I was only in the office for 2 days but I could have spent a week there getting work done and meeting with people. It would also give me a chance to meet with Jill Vogelfang a little more. I met with her, last Thursday and it was a good meeting.

By the way, have you heard any more about the PC video conferencing?

John

Richter reserved that last year.  He made the money.  It's his.  It goes against refund risk in California.  If we take a hit in CA due to refunds, Richter should eat a good chunk of that hit -- if there is extra money then he should keep it.

John has asked me to do a thorough review of our Schedule C reserves in light of the northwest refund decision, BPA's new contracts that started in October, and the overall lower price environment.  Richter's reserves will be a part of this bigger effort that I will get done this week.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hey guys!

Sorry I wasn't able to get to some of you and tell you what we got him.  
We gave him an XL Jansport Backpack.  Believe it or not this is something 
that he has wanted.  He seemed to really like it.

Thanks to all you for the back-pack.  I needed a new one.

My daughter had taken my old one.

Mostly thanks for making this place a great place to work.

You make my job easy.

We will be having a staff meeting today.  If we can start at 12:15 rather than 12:00 that would be great because I have an 11:00 meeting.

John,
What is the phone number where we can reach you?

Sorry I do not have an itinerary.  I would like to go over Doorstep findings and anything else you would like to fill me in on since we have not met in a while.

The blending vs. non-blending can be confusing and could potentially cause problems down the road so I would first like to make some general statements regarding the history or this change and what the rules should be as I understand them.  

	Only the curves applicable to the East NERC regions are being marked as a daily and monthly volatility; therefore, no blending is needed for daily options (they point directly to the daily vols) or monthly options (they point directly to the monthly vol).  All curves applicable to the West NERC regions are still being marked as intramonth and monthly; therefore, blending is needed to provide a volatility for daily options.

	The best rules to be in place for the blending vs. non-blending would be based on curve.  East curves do not blend.  West curves do blend.  Therefore, ANY daily or monthly option in the East would not have to blend.  The potential problem that could be caused by making the rule apply to portfolios is that, for example, the East portfolio could potentially enter into an option at a West region (curve) and that transaction would need to use blended curves even though it is in the East portfolio.

	Options at a different expiry than daily or monthly is another problem.  Are there different blending rules embedded in the code for weekly expiration?  We still need to discuss this.

	I would be happy to all sit down and have a meeting concerning this issue whenever everyone is comfortable enough that we know all the current rules.  Let me know.

Clarification 1,  I haven't come to East Power last March.  Therefore, the change must not be my request.
Clarification 2,  I like the change.
Clarification 3,  I do NOT have concerns about the difference itself, but it is scary that people (i.e., myself) don't know the difference exits.  I think your summary below is very valuable and I would like to make sure Risk team and other relevant people be aware of it.

Hi Hai:

  Here's the logic about volatility.  Originally all volality is calculated as a blend of monthly and daily volatility.  From last March, based on your request, I made the changes for East and its mirrored portfolios (ENAWEATHER, ENACCO,PLANT,SVCE) only, and for option, spread and basis option only, that we use daily vol for daily option and monthly vol for monthly option.    The implication of that is that for 

1. other portfolios,
2. other deal types such as Asian, Transmission Deal, index option ( which East does not have right now),
3. other expiry frequency, say, WEEKLY (which East does not have right now), or deals that doesn't have expiry frequency explicitly defined,

the blend approach will still be applied.  Please let us know if you have any concerns.

When you get around to setting up these fields for the West, please use the portfolio code 'W' for West and then use the same methodology for Book Code that Andrea did.  I'll let you know the answer she gets from Andrew re: 'US Power East' because you should be using 'US Power West'.

Andrew-

I have created a draft of our RisktRAC book setup spreadsheet for East Power.  Can you take a look at it and see if everything is accurate.  One issue I have relates to the 'Trading Location' field.  We had previously used 'US Power East', but this is not part of the dropdown menu in the field.  Has this location been changed to something else?

Thanks!

Subject:	New instrument type code from ENPower

Frank,

We were just informed by Norman Lee's group that ENPower is going to put out a new instrument type code called 'TRANSMISSION' and it basically is a kind of SPREADOPTION, so we will modify the code and capture them as SPREADOPTION.

Also we were told that we should handle one existing instrument type code INDEX-OPTION as SPREADOPTION too.  INDEX-OPTION has been captured as OPTION so far.  We will also make the code change for this.

Anytime when ENPower introduces new instrument type code in the future, we need to be informed because there are 15 - 20 instruemnt type codes existing in ENPower system and we need to convert them into one of the six instrument type codes in RisktRAC.

I am going to make the changes tomorrow.

Regards,

Wei"

Have you heard any more regarding the PGE sale? It's funny, here nobody is talking about it. I guess that means that it's no big deal here, but you think they would have send something.

By the way, when I saw Casey, that girl is getting skinnier by the day. I have never personally seen her that thin before.

It was wonderful.  Not so excited to be back - I'm sure it will get better as the week goes on.  How was your flight?  Did you feel safer?  They want me to go on the London Doorstep in November, so I was just wondering.

Dear Stacey,

	Wei's email is about how to capture Power PortCalc positions and P&L into the RiskTrac ( VATR) system. Both Spread Option and Index-Option's positions are stored in two columns in the VATR result table, whereas an Option deal would be in one column only, so Wei has to treat Index-Option the same as Spread Option in capturing the numbers.
	
	Regards,


Norman.

Frank,

We were just informed by Norman Lee's group that ENPower is going to put out a new instrument type code called 'TRANSMISSION' and it basically is a kind of SPREADOPTION, so we will modify the code and capture them as SPREADOPTION.

Also we were told that we should handle one existing instrument type code INDEX-OPTION as SPREADOPTION too.  INDEX-OPTION has been captured as OPTION so far.  We will also make the code change for this.

Anytime when ENPower introduces new instrument type code in the future, we need to be informed because there are 15 - 20 instruemnt type codes existing in ENPower system and we need to convert them into one of the six instrument type codes in RisktRAC.

I am going to make the changes tomorrow.

Regards,

Wei"

Subject:	Filling vacancies and adding head count

After my recent budgeting experience, I think we need to tighten up our procedures around filling vacancies and adding head count.

When filling vacancies, I would like to have each of you review the positions.  I think we need to challenge ourselves and the managers
to be as conservative as possible.  I would like to sign off on all replacements.  I promise not to be difficult.

When adding personnel over your current budgeted number, besides having the commercial team sign-off on the addition, I am think
that it may have to be approved by the COO of Americas (Louise).  I am planning on meeting with her next week to discuss in detail
how to keep her in the loop in new hires resulting from business changes (asset management deals or service arrangements)

Let me know what you think.

thanks

Stacey,

Georganne mentioned that you thought we may have booked a reserve for this back when you were unwinding the deals.  We did not. 

Do we need to get together to discuss this?

Have them go through accounting.  This is non-trading expenses.  Not our area unless it runs through the DPR.

Stacey:

Jennifer from AA is inquiring about the $7.5 MM she saw on ENA 3rd Quarter 2001 Detail of Expenses.  She noticed that these expenses are related to trading (Belden)- legal & bank fees.  

Tim is in Houston for the rest of the week and will be back next Monday.  Should I suggest AA to check with Accounting (Tracy Greene) on this item or should I try to contact Tim directly?

Please advise.  

Thank you,

1. The Mid Market Originations are calculated based on the total QTD P&L
of our certain books mutplied by certain percentages (different by book)
agreed upon by Tim Belden and Chris Foster early this year.  Therefore
essentially the $14.9 MM P&L is calculated based on every deal in our
LTSW, LTNW, LTCA, LTWMGMT, STSW, STNW, and STCA books.  Please let me
know if you need the agreed percentages for each book.

2. Please advise where you saw the $7.5 MM bank and legal expenses.

Fran,

In reviewing the Management Summary, we had the following questions:

1.  We noted that $14.8 million P&L related to Middle Market
Originations
(Foster).  Does this relate to a specific deal or several small deals?
2.  We noted that $7.5 million direct expenses related to trading
(Belden)-
legal and bank fees.  What do these expenses relate to?

If you have any questions, please call me at X6-6269.  As earnings

is quickly approaching, we would appreciate your prompt assistance.

Stacey, 

I think the idea of having two books stinks.  We would have to touch every deal every month to move the ""prompt"" long term month into the short term book.  (Ok - we only have five long term deals right now but ...)  Maybe I'm over reacting.  Do you know of any other instances where this is done to account for risks?

I think a better idea would be to continue with one book using one curve - Pushkar's front end and our curve 3+ years.  We keep the Rho & Drift from this book.

The SA traders could then execute trades with Pushkar to hedge our short term exposure.  They could tell us the P/L to report and in theory this would be the offset to

the short term Rho in the power book.

Kim,

I'm attaching a spreadsheet that details the regions and delivery points we would like to have migrated over to the Global Facilities database for UBS.  There are two separate tabs - one for regions and one for delivery points.  I have left a message with John in Portland to call me in the morning and I will have him compile the same information for you for the west.

Please let me know if you have any questions!
Thanks!
Casey

Make sure that all curves are downloaded by the end of simulation, 11:00 CST, tomorrow.  Ideally, the 2/7/02 curves should be marked in the morning prior to simulation.  We have been instructed to kick the calculation off as close to 11:00 CST as possible.  This is to ensure that ALL downstream systems are able to run through the simulation.

Please forward to all applicable traders.

As you can see from various e-mails, Samantha will need to take responsibility for these twice weekly calcs.  I talked to Bob yesterday and he is aware that she is there and needing something to do.  Unofficially, he said that there should be no employee changes before the end of February, so Sam should start coming to work and taking over any specific West Estate requests.

As a follow up to this email, we will start reporting the DPR's on Wednesday's and Monday's, for Tuesday and Friday valuations.  The first Wednesday will be the 30th of January.  Each day we should expect to report the positions, P&L and PRMA of only those transactions we expect to fulfill.  With the exception of Gas, Susan Trevino will be sending the benchmarks to each of the groups for their review.  
 
If anyone anticipates any problems with this time frame, please call me or Shona to discuss.

Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
 
- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
 
Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.
 
Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.
 
Thanks in advance

Dear Everyone:

  As some of you might have heard, I gave my one-week notification last Friday, my last day with Enron will be Thursday, 1/31.  The reason of my leaving is purely visa status, I have nothing but joy working with you all in the last one and half years,  the wonderful experience made the departure a painful decision.

  I shall be around in the next few days should you need anything from me.  I'd like to thank you all for making my work at Enron such a thrill experience, for your support and friendship, I hope I will have a chance and honor to work with you again in the future.

  Good luck to all of us!

This should answer your regional trading question.  Once again, there is nothing to physically stop them from trading in any region, but the management decision on regional trading for the East is as follows.  I do not have this same information from the West.

As you finalize the personnel issues, any information regarding which trader will be managing each location is extremely helpful.  The reason for this is because we must apply the trader to the appropriate product(s) in order to test the system completely.  Using the information you provide, we will be able to make sure the traders are set up correctly prior to our go-live date.

As a follow up to this email, we will start reporting the DPR's on Wednesday's and Monday's, for Tuesday and Friday valuations.  The first Wednesday will be the 30th of January.  Each day we should expect to report the positions, P&L and PRMA of only those transactions we expect to fulfill.  With the exception of Gas, Susan Trevino will be sending the benchmarks to each of the groups for their review.  
 
If anyone anticipates any problems with this time frame, please call me or Shona to discuss.

Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
 
- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
 
Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.
 
Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.
 
Thanks in advance

Sounds good to me.  FYI - the option true-up was a different issue, related to the way options were being input into the system.  They had days which would fall out of the calc, not a last day of the month problem.

What do you guys think about this.....assuming we can put a fix in port calc that will allow us to true-up the current day (correctly), we could simply recalc the books the following morning (after last day of month) after indeces have been posted, then adjust the financial numbers in the vlookup according to the new top pages?!

Since 99% of the deals that we did in Calgary were financial, one of the biggest problems we encountered was the last day of true ups at month end. Because we cannot capture the last day of the month right now, as the volume of financial deals grow (assuming it will), it is possible we could be dealing with fairly large PMA adjustments. 

We may need to start thinking about a way that we could capture these numbers.

Dear All,

In Enron system, M:\common\power is one of our major folder. In UBS system, it is changed to M:\power. I wonder whether we need to create a new folder:
M:\common, then move M:\power under M:\common\ and become M:\common\power just as Enron system. Otherwise, we at least need to spent a lot of time to find out and change all path pointers and fixed links of Excel application under power folder. Also, if too many files dynamic links are  messed up, we may be able to ask system team to rebuild power folder for us.

Thanks!

Can you find out who in your HR would be a good contact for a job opening
previously held by Lou Casari?  I have a friend at Enron, my first boss,
who will probably be leaving the company, but does not want to leave
Houston if she does not have to.  She is very well qualified for a
management position, her resume should speak for itself.

Let me know.

Power December books are final.  This does not mean that every termination has been accounted for in the final Dec. 31 calculation.  We eventually hit a stopping point for terminations and will catch up the remainder of terminations in 'after December' books.

Also, power books are set up as you have defined below.

I am following up to see where we stand on the risk books for December.  My understanding is that we will have at least 3 categories:  legally terminated, not performing but not terminated, and still performing.

The deals that are still performing should have liquidations, etc. ""as normal"" - the remainder will be ""frozen"" until an amount is settled with the counterparty.

I am inheriting the MTM group and am trying to get as much done before we split with the people going to NETCO, so if you can give me the status and ETA if the books are not done I would greatly appreciate it.

All, 
I received a call from Sally Beck today alerting me to concerns about spreading the risk group across the floor (gas team - power team).  From a control perspective she prefers that the team be all together.  

Can you factor this in and give Sally and me your thoughts as well?  Perhaps we could find an area that is more central to both groups that will help with this (as we've done with fundies).  

Scott and I are meeting Tuesday afternoon at 4:00 - Lloyd and Sally are you free to join us to keep us all on the same page?  Please let me know so I can reserve a room.

I am not sure if I said or not that I would be out Tues. Jess has a series of doctor appointments (due to family history) tomorrow so I will be babysitting. Don't think I will be missing anything with it being so slow.

Can you find out who in your HR would be a good contact for a job opening
previously held by Lou Casari?  I have a friend at Enron, my first boss,
who will probably be leaving the company, but does not want to leave
Houston if she does not have to.  She is very well qualified for a
management position, her resume should speak for itself.

Let me know.

Subject:	risk books for December

I am following up to see where we stand on the risk books for December.  My understanding is that we will have at least 3 categories:  legally terminated, not performing but not terminated, and still performing.

The deals that are still performing should have liquidations, etc. ""as normal"" - the remainder will be ""frozen"" until an amount is settled with the counterparty.

I am inheriting the MTM group and am trying to get as much done before we split with the people going to NETCO, so if you can give me the status and ETA if the books are not done I would greatly appreciate it.

thanks
Lisa

Dear All,

In Enron system, M:\common\power is one of our major folder. In UBS system, it is changed to M:\power. I wonder whether we need to create a new folder:
M:\common, then move M:\power under M:\common\ and become M:\common\power just as Enron system. Otherwise, we at least need to spent a lot of time to find out and change all path pointers and fixed links of Excel application under power folder. Also, if too many files dynamic links are  messed up, we may be able to ask system team to rebuild power folder for us.

Thanks!

Subject: DPR reporting for 22nd trading due today - request by Fallon


Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
 
- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
 
Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.
 
Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.
 
Thanks in advance

Talked to Tim last night - basically, they were either letting people know by phone yesterday or in person today.  They were going to let them know they had a position with the estate and leave it up to them as to whether or not they wanted to come in over the next few days.  Tim wasn't exactly sure the reporting relationship and/or what they would be doing, but felt that everyone would have a role at least in the short-term.  I believe that Wednesday is the day that UBS will be in Portland to do benefits review and UBS overview......

The people on the list for VM should be: 

Scotty Gilbert 
Eugene Lee 
Donna Sheidun 
Heather Dunton 



Heather is currently in Risk but they may have to reduce from 3 to 2 in that group.  Scotty agreed to take Heather in VM.  In the event that Heather can remain in the Risk Group, then Kit Blair should be added to the VM team.  Call me if you have any questions.  Stacey will let me know by Sunday where Heather sits relative to Risk.

All right, we have tried to almost complete a whole month without seeing
eachother.  Now that I have turned thirty, Bridget has run the marathon, and
Kelly had Luke, we no longer havea excuse not to see eachother.  O.K. Kelly,
we might make a small exception for you.  I think we should start off with a
small novella, written by Steve Martin.  Yes, Steve Martin, the comedian.
He has a short book in the stores; he has written.  It is called Shopgirl.
The reviews in Amazon are fairly good.  Does anyone else have a good
suggestion?  I think meeting in the beginning of February would be a good
idea. -Christina
P.S. We miised you, Kelly and Anna at my fine party(oh yeah it was for Kelly
Kampe too!).  Ya'll will just have to hear all about it.

According to Tim, if we could find no other spots for her to stay in Risk, she would be designated as VM and Kit Blair would be taken off the list.  Do you know what communication is being given to 'estate' employees in Portland?

Dear All,

In Enron system, M:\common\power is one of our major folder. In UBS system, it is changed to M:\power. I wonder whether we need to create a new folder:
M:\common, then move M:\power under M:\common\ and become M:\common\power just as Enron system. Otherwise, we at least need to spent a lot of time to find out and change all path pointers and fixed links of Excel application under power folder. Also, if too many files dynamic links are  messed up, we may be able to ask system team to rebuild power folder for us.

Thanks!

Thank you so much for this query.  At this time, I am not sure what happened to the numbers in our spreadsheet.  The data was pulled from AdHoc by calculating East, West, Eastbank, & Westbank.  However, the total we retrieved from AdHoc did not match the total Portcalc value.  I do not want you to spend time trying to figure out what happened to our spreadsheet because it could have been anything from using the wrong code to calc the books to simple user error.  There are too many variables that are unknown.

The good thing is, it works now.

Thanks,
Stacey

Hi Stacey:

  We were able to pull out the P&L vs Counter Party for the four Post IDs, and the total matched the $986,414,195 you gave, it seems that there are more counterparties than what you included in the spreadsheet.  Please see the attached spreadsheet for details.

 << File: PL_11_30_2001recalc.xls >> 

  Could you let us know how the number in your spreadsheet was generated?  Was it from DPR or some other spreadsheet?  Maybe we can take a look at the query to see if something is missed.

  Thanks,

- Zhiyun

Have you told Kathy about this transfer?  Should it be a bankruptcy book?

Thanks,
Just to let you know.  We have moved everything terminated out of the alberta ena book into the albert ena bankruptcy book.  The only deal left in the alberta ena book is a deal with Nexen so when they terminate please let me know.

Stacey,
Would I also be able to get this calculation as of the 28th.  This would have been backed with deals between ECC and ENA and these deals were terminated Dec 28th.

As we discussed yesterday, here is the list of information that we need to gather to put into the booklets.  Please give us information (Chris, Keith, Susie, Susan and me) information as you get it.  The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.  Please let Chris, Keith & myself know of your time frame to get us this info.  Currently, expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week.

This is not a circular and you will not get another chance.  This deals with migration to new systems and you need to migrate your own information or applications in the next day.  Remember do not delete anything and data to be transferred must comply (see attachments below).

The policy must be complied by Thursday.  Please ensure that everyone in your group has moved everything which is in compliance with the policy.  We will not be delaying close or restart for people not having completed their own migrations.

Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply (eg Dana - please cover Kevin's migration requirements)

Thanks

Dear Stacey, Casey,

	It seems that nobody even knows what those applications are, and so they will not be migrated to NetCo.

Hope all is well.  My new e-mail is stacey.w.white@enron.com  The one you have will be decommissioned shortly.  I still have a job and will more than likely go to the 'new co.' - the piece that UBS has bid for.  Currently, we are extremely busy trying to close out old business at the same time as setting up details of the new business.

Russell and I are both well, probably working too hard.  What is new with you?

Brian,

Could you provide me the userids that have access to these apps.  We do not recognize them and need to find out if anybody is still running them.

Here are the documents for the proposed services deal with Intergen.  The contract will be with Redbudd LLC which is the facility that it pertains to.  Attached is the Energy Management Agreement (EMA) and the Energy Management Criteria (EMC) which outlines how they plan to commit the plant.  The EMC is built into their lending agreements with the bank and forms part of their risk managment stucture.

Folks,

We are getting very close on an agreement with Intergen.  In the interest of having as many eyes on this as possible, can all of you please review this and we will meet next week to review any remaining concerns.

Here is my turn from Kay's draft transmitted this morning (clean and blackline).  In my estimation, this puts us very close.  Please fill in the blanks in 6.1 and 10.1.
This is still subject to InterGen and lender review and possible modification, but it looks like we are there.

Eduardo and Mary,

Attached is the Alcoa model.  Remi changed the curve to 281.1 which is reflected in the attached model.  I included an accrual for CPMF but not for IOF based on our discussion regarding how to calculate it.

This is a deal where we purchase restricted power certificates.  I think the ""market"" is similar to the SO2 (if that is the pollution credits) market here.

Brazil is having a power crisis worse than California.  The large end users are required to reduce their power consumption by 20% from last year's usage.  My understanding 
is that for example July 01 must be less than 80% of July 00.  If the consumer lowers their consumption by more than 20%, they can sell the excess reduction to another user or marketer - and it is called a certificate.    

I will copy you on the valuation model that they just requested that I complete.

See attached the DASH. Do you think we need to model the accrual also or just the MTM ?
I'll send you the IOF rate as soon as I have it.

Eduardo,

Could you please confirm that the following taxes are in the model used for the financial projections.

PIS/COFINS----3.65% of the gross

CPMF of .38% on all cash transfers

total 34% Brazilian income tax    

IOF----what is the rate for this transaction?      (Ricardo, I believe Sami indicated you could provide in an earlier note?)     

I have also been asked to add a section regarding the effective tax rate in Brazil.    Since I have not seen a copy of the model, can someone please fill in the blanks below regarding the rates?    I'd also appreciate a copy of the model for my records here.    

The section will need to indicate that the effective tax rate on this transaction in Brazil is ________________, which includes 3.65% PIS/COFINS (gross receipts tax), 34% Brazilian income tax and .38% CPMF on all cash disbursements, and _______________IOF.    Repatriation of the cash back to the U.S. will also trigger U.S. income tax at the rate of 37% of the cash dividend repatriated.    

Also, please add Stephen Douglas name to the tax sign-off list.   He is the lead member of the tax planning group for Enron Wholesale Group.

Martha

Just one correction. The energy they get credit (assured energy) come from the Energy Reallocation Mechanism or MRE. All hydro generators are member of this mechanism, which is regulated by ANEEL. MRE's objective is to optimize the cost of hydro generation. So, regardless the energy generated by the plant, it always gets the assured energy plus secondary energy (if there's surplus of energy).

In the case of Santa Clara, due the rationing, they want to deliver the volume they get from the MRE, which can be lower than 28MW (assured energy) or even the minimum of 20MW that we proposed.

Let me know if you have any doubt.
Tks. Eduardo

Subject:	Santa Clara Deal

Remi,

Spoke with Eduardo today about the Santa Clara deal.  We were discussing whether the deal would receive MTM or accrual treatment.  

As I understand it, at this point in the negotiations, we would purchase the amount of energy they get credit from the LDC for generating.  The volume may or may not be equal to the energy that they actually generate. It will be determined by the availability of power in the region due to the rationing situation.  Under this scenerio, I do not think we can MTM the deal as there is no firm quantity specified.

If I'm missing, some aspect of the deal that you think gives us the ability to mark the deal, please let me know.

Martha

I talked with Sami Arap, our attoney responsible for this transaction, and he told me that rationing is going to be treated as a Force Majeure event under this contract. Besides, there's going to be a specific language for what we are calling ""pre-rationing event"", which is not FM, but may reduce (up to 10%) the contract volume.

This pre-rationing event will occur under two circumstances: (i) when Spot Price is higher than R$200,00 (as of Feb/01) and (ii) when the net energy alocated to Furnas by MRE is lower than its assured energy.

We would like to know what is the impact of these two sections (rationing as FM and ""pre-rationing"") on the accounting treatment of the transaction.
Thanks
Eduardo

Eduardo,

I think if we the contract reads that if the purchase volume can be reduced by 10% in case of rationing then we would probably only consider 90% of the volume firm. Have you gotten a legal opinion of whether rationing is a Force Majeure event?

By copy to Stacey, do you have any additional comments to assist Eduardo?

Furnas has requested us to include in the contract a language saying that in case of rationing in Brazil the contracted energy is reduced proportionally. We plan to cap that reduction in 10%. I would like to know what would be the impact in the MTM treatment. I guess it doesn't affect MTM because a rationing could be seen as a Force Majeure event.

Please let me know what you think.

From Kevin Hannon, Jim Hughes and John Lavorato

Our efforts to move our South American merchant business model to look like our North American and European models has been evolving quickly.  In the volatile Brazilian power market, Enron is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future.  We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market.

To continue our positive momentum in South America, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business.  We have asked Orlando Gonzalez to become President and CEO.  In addition we have asked Brett Wiggs to join Orlando in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer.

Joe Kishkill has been involved in the South American business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Enron.  We would like to thank Joe for his contributions.  

Please join us in congratulating Orlando and Brett on their new duties."

AA has concurred with MTM accounting for the South America commodity transactions, so long as they have MTM attributes (which is no different of a standard than any other bus unit). They would, however, like to update their general knowledge of the South American regulatory and commercial environment, etc.  Do we have some presentation materials already done that would be helpful in this regard? Again, as expected, we are a ""go"" for MTM.

Jody and Cris,

I became aware of the Duke deal late Monday.  Spent yesterday validating their assumptions and value which is no where near US$15.6. The MTM value looks like it will be around US$4MM.  We plan to finalized the MTM today. Remi was initially planning to prudence some of the value (with Lavo's approval).  However, that was before we added the Pis/Cofins tax assumptions.  Duke did pay us a R$15MM option premium on the deal.   Robin Veariel confirmed that ECE received that money yesterday.  Spoke with Paul Radous in credit and he is not taking a credit reserve because we are supposed to receive a parental guarantee.

I'll keep you posted.

Also, thanks for the message regarding the MTM.  I passed it on to Stacey.

Subject:	This Weeks Earnings

Gents,

Lots of ""noise"" on what should be booked fot the Duke deal on this weeks Hot List (actually a done deal now).  A ""little bird"" told me that it could be as high as $15.6 MM.  Well, I do not buy it.

Before sending out the forecast this week I want to talk to you guys about what is inside the number we book for Duke.  I will be getting prepared on this end.

Thanks,

Kish"

I've tested the ""schedule"" version of forward obs.  It seems to be working 
well.  

The wish list might include a summary page to show the desks net 0. And it 
could use a default that pulls all the west desks when the West portfolio is 
clicked, while retaining the flexibility of overriding the west default to 
choose individual desks - HOWEVER - it does work fine the way it is.

Please release this to production and let Fran Chang, Heather Dunton, 
Samantha Law and Diana Scholtes know when it is released.  Thanks!"

I think we all decided that COB S/N and NOB S/N should become a basis point 
unto themselves.  Remapping the S/N  has not been thoroughly explored 
regarding implications to existing deals and has not been re-mapped in table 
edit nor has a basis point been created.  Currently COB S/N and COB N/S = R8; 
and NOB S/N = Basis Pt #22 which is also what NOB N/S is mapped as.  We'll 
probably only appreciate the revaluation on a shoulder month basis, but I 
believe it is material.

We have deals 470788, STSW
146517, LTNW
205218, LTWTRANS
426855 LTSW

which are transmission deals.  The correlation for these are contained in the 
West Correlation file in M/power2/region.  The correlation for these delivery 
points and basis points don't match what Houston's RAROC  office has. 

Please review the attached spread sheet and email me the correlation you want 
to use for valuing the tranny deals.  As soon as we agree on the correlation 
and change them in West Correlation and/or RAROC, I'll re-run the mini-books, 
and we can release the deals into mark to market as we want.

(Matt's correlation have already been reviewed but not yet changed, you're 
done Matt.)

Please let me know if you have any questions or points of discussion.  If you 
could respond by Monday, Feb 12, that'd be good.  Thanks!

Deal # 539968 legs one and two is presently in the ""killed"" status.  John 
will let one or all of you know, preferably by email, when you should 
reactivate the deal.  You may have to modify the start date and the deal 
date.  The deal date should match the date the EEI was signed.  And March 8th 
(the start date) will have come and gone by the time (if ) the contract is 
finalized.  

John (mid market) will take origination on this deal.  I believe his orig. 
that will come out of the LTNW book is going to be .75 per mwh.  Please 
confirm the amount with John.  

Also, please connect with Chris Foster, as I believe the orig. will be held 
until the end of March, and then Chris will provide Risk with a comprehensive 
list of all the mid-market origination that needs to be granted from the 
power books, as he did in Feb.

Subject: Re: adding new books/desks/counterparties in West Portfolio

Hi Min Zheng and Norman:

In the past couple of weeks you have been working on adding three new books 
(Short-term west rockies, Short-term west services, and Long-term west 
options) for the west.  Yesterday we entered/moved our exotic deal (deal # 
13982.3, which was originally in Short-term Southwest book) into the new 
Short-term west rockies book and we are seeing a couple of problems:

(1) It seems that in DprAutomation the Short-term west rockies book was named 
as ""ST-WROCK"", rather than ""ST-WR"" (i.e. the book's/roll's name in 
M:\common\power\Postion\Dpr\2001\0102).  Therefore, last night and this 
morning we had to temparily changed the roll's name to ST-WROCK in order to 
allow DprAutomation to run through the roll to bring in P&L/PCS/PID data.  
(After DprAutomation was done running, we then changed it back to ST-WR so we 
can link the roll to the ""pwrdpr"" file).  

=> We need DprAutomation to use ""ST-WR"" for Short-term west rockies book so 
we won't have to change the file name everytime we run DprAutomation.

(2) As mentioned earlier, yeterday deal #13982.3 's desk was changed from 
ST-SW to Short-term west rockies in the Exotic book.  Although we officialize 
the Exotic book (post id 14061), Nancy Hernandez in Risk Management (Houston) 
found that they could not see the Short-term west rockies book officialized 
in Exotic.  

=> I am not sure if this is due to the same problem as in (1) or something 
else.  We need the new Short-term west rockies book set up right so it can be 
officialized in the Exotic book in order for the Risk Control Group in 
Houston to see/monitor it.

Please help us look at the above issues.  Let me know if I can provide more 
useful information.

(For Nancy:  I spoke with Valarie and there is nothing we know of other than 
deal #13982.3 that was in the ST-SW book in Exotic book.  Since we moved the 
deal to Short-term west rockies book last night, it should be normal to see 
nothing remaining in the ST-SW book.)

Thanks,
Fran

Hi guys:  

I just wanted to touch base with you on how we are doing on the IT side 
regarding the 3 new books that West Power is establishing (* please refer to 
the email attached from Val sent on 2/5/2001).  

Today, we will be creating the three new desks/books (ST West Services, ST 
West Rockies, and LT West Options).  Would you please help us set up these 
three new desks/books in ""West tot belden2"".  The path to the file is 
M:\power2\Curve\New_sys\Data.  Specifically, when you open the file and go to 
""Peak"", ""Off-Peak"", ""Peak-By Region"", and ""Off-Peak-By Region"" tabs, you will 
see pivot tables/columns which can be manupulated to get positions in our 
existing desks/books (eg. LT-NW, LT-SW, etc).  We need ST West Services, ST 
West Rockies, and LT West Options to be included in these tabs under seperate 
columns, too.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran

Hello all.   I'm not sure if I've included too few people or too many, but 
you can let me know if I've left someone off the list or have included 
someone unnecessarily.  

We're busy up here in Portland adding new desks...these new desks  will need 
to mapped through all of the Enpower reports/calcs, DPR, adhoc, MTM97, etc.

There are several of you that I will need to work with after the books are 
set up, but I think this gets us through the initial push.  Attached is the 
primary information on the new books.  Please email me or call if there are 
any questions.

I'd like to have the setup completed by Wednesday, Feb. 07, if possible.

Thanks!

Dear Valarie and Fran:

  I followed up with Nancy regarding  EPMI-ST-WROCK.  Based on her response, 
the name won't be changed to EPMI-ST-WR but a new book called EPMI-ST-SW-EXT 
will be added.  Do you plan to use that one in the future?  Please let us 
know so that we can adjust other things accordingly.  Thanks.

Zhiyun:

We actually can't change the name of books, so we had to create a new book on 
the RisktRAC side called EPMI-ST-WR-EXT.  However to my knowledge I think 
they are still officializing the EPMI-ST-SW-EXT book.

Regarding the list below, I will let you now later today if this will work 
for us.

Thanks for your help.

As of 12/28 Power VaR increased by $8.7 MM to $43.7 MM (limit of $50 MM) and 
West Power increased by $9.2 MM to $35.8 MM. This increase is mainly 
attributable to an addition of a long MidC position of ~1.8 MM Mwhs - a deal 
with BPA: Buy 250-360 MWs for the period 2/01-9/01. See the increase in 
component VaR in 2001 below (Longs are driving the risk in the portfolio).

Can you change the Huber transaction agreement to reflect the pricing provisions we have laid out in the LOI.  The only other thing I saw in the Capacity release agreement was in 2.6.  If they owe us for any refunds prior to the release date, then we should owe them for any charges in the future for any past periods.

Thanks

We are trying to send out a draft version of these on Monday afternoon.


Thanks

As could be expected PSCO has finally implemented PRM this year and did a great job of ""buying the high'.  Now the rate payers will have lower prices than last year but probably twice as high as they should be.  I would definitely like to discuss it with you.  How about 1:30 central on the 8th?

Subject:	Colorado PRM


Mark/Barry--- I finally had a chance to look this week at the Colorado PUC proposed rulemaking amendments regarding price risk management (PRM) for gas utilities.  As we had generally talked about, the appetite for meaningful change to the PUCs rules has been pretty weak by staff and to a great extent by the Commissioners themselves.  These proposed rules reflect some movement toward encouraging utilties to implement PRM, but does NOT require them to implement, nor is there a clear statement that the PUC will allow recovery of costs.  Here's a short list of what's in the rules:

	> costs related to prm may be allowed, and new language is added to better define the standard of review as ""whether the utility action was reasonable in light of the information known, or should have been known, at the time of action or inaction"".    

	> in the utility's annual Gas PUrchase Plan they must include an exhibit that describes and analyzes the steps the utility has taken to reduce gas price volatility.  It appears to be an informational filing only, but clearly signals that the PUC expects them to take some action or explain why they didn't. 

	> the utility's actual portfolio purchases, included in the costs of purchasing risk managment products,  need to be included in a Gas Purchase Report to be filed annually. This report presumably is the document that the PUC will then use to determine reasonableness of gas cost pass thru.


There are numerous areas that we could comment on in this proposed rulemaking---anywhere from pushing them to be more explicit in advocating that the utility must do prm and that they will recover the costs, to something along the line of turning over their gas supply portfolio to a company that can more effectively manage it.  There is a hearing scheduled for November 1 in Denver, with comments due on or before October 21.  

We would be happy to intervene and file comments in the proceeding and work the issue if you guys would like us to. Might be kind of fun to tweak our friends at Xcel just a bit! Is there a time on Monday Oct 8 or Tuesday Oct 9 that we could talk via phone to determine your level of interest?  I am available mid day on Monday (between 10 and 2:30 central) or Tuesday anytime up until about 3:30.  Please let me know via return e mail or give me a call   #612-339-4599"

I have a meeting in the morning on this deal to get a price for the 10,000/d.  I am hoping that as part of this overall deal I can get a pretty good price on that package.  As far as your analysis goes, I have not gotten through it completely, but make sure that you do not add fuel and commodity charges to the transport that does not flow.  Our current analysis shows that the reallocation on El Paso should take place in the 1st or 2nd quarter.  At that time this capacity will have more value out of the Permian than it does today when it does not flow.  The .38 rate you are using is the current full toll rate. The demand charge is actually only $.3595 and it drops to $.2991 in January 2004.  The commodity charge for San Juan is currently $.026 and drops to $.019 in 2004.  Let's go through this and the other components in the morning.

Mark,
Help me out here!
I took our current marketing arrangements, selling into the spot
market, assuming the worst at EPNG-SJ Index - $0.10, and compared it to
the pricing under the three tranches.  I realize we are mixing IF and
GDA, but IF can be swapped for GDA and vice-versa in the swing swap
market.  My dilemma is that the firm transportation does not appear to
be accretive, in fact it results in $0.05 / mmbtu  less than current
arrangement (accross the total volume).  What is really killing it is
the NW basis and discount...am I using the right one?  (FYI, I used
ENA's mid-market basis for the 12-month strip going forward).  What am I
missing here?"

Subject:=09RE: WBI Rate Base Study

Mark,

Rate case settlements reached between a pipeline, its customers and Commiss=
ion Staff sometime prescribes the treatment of gains on the sale of assets =
and specifically the sale of base gas volumes (eg Columbia, CNG settlements=
).  In review of the past two rate case settlements of Williston Basin (WBI=
) I found no such provisions.  In its current rate case proceeding before F=
ERC a limited settlement was reached which dealt primarily with net plant a=
nd labor costs.  A hearing was held on all remaining issues and is currentl=
y in the briefing stage.  Neither in the limited settlement, nor in the hea=
ring was disposition of base gas revenues addressed.

However, the reorganizational settlement that conveyed facilities from MDU =
to WBI may be a factor.  As a result of restructuring under 636 WBI was obl=
igated to sell certain excess volumes of company owned working gas (priced =
at $.47 /mcf) to its customers.  WBI proposed to sell the gas at market and=
 retain any profits.  As mentioned in the LeBeoeuf, Lamb memo the Commissio=
n addressed this issues several times, reversing itself in the process, and=
 finally ordered that WBI must sell the working gas at cost.  Though not re=
lying entirely on the reorganizational settlement, throughout the various o=
rders, the Commission referenced the 1985 reorganizational settlement as re=
quiring any gains on the sale of working gas to be flowed through to WBI cu=
stomers.  WBI sought rehearing, arguing that the Commission was taking a ve=
ry broad interpretation of the settlement.  The Commission raised the issue=
 again in its order on rehearing, among other things, and WBI didn't seek r=
ehearing or pursue that particular argument further, which the Commission p=
oints out in its final order.

As LeBeoeuf Lamb asserts, the environment (Order 636 restructuring) in whic=
h the Commission ordered flow-through of profits on the sale of storage vol=
umes has changed and those arguments may not be applicable anymore.  But, t=
he reorganizational settlement might be something to take into account and =
should be discussed with WBI.  Just something to be aware of.

If you have any questions please call.

Robert

 The first blonde replies, ""Oh, that's easy! It's the holiday in November
  when we all get together, eat turkey and are thankful.""

 ""Wrong!, you are not welcome here, I'm afraid. You must go to the other
  place!"" replies St. Peter. Then he turns to the second blonde, and asks
her
  the same question - ""What is Easter?""

 The second blonde replies, ""Easter is the holiday in December when we put
  up a nice tree, exchange presents, and celebrate the birth of Jesus.""

 St. Peter looks at the second blonde, bangs his head on the pearly Gates
  in disgust and tells her she's wrong and will have to join her friend in
  the other place; she is not welcome in Heaven.

 He then peers over his glasses at the third blonde and asks, ""Do YOU know
  what Easter is?""

 The third blonde smiles confidently and looks St. Peter in the eyes, ""I
  know what Easter is.""

 ""Oh?"" says St. Peter, incredulously.

 ""Easter is the Christian holiday that coincides with the Jewish
celebration
  of Passover. Jesus and his disciples were eating at the last supper and
  Jesus was later deceived and turned over to the Romans by one  of his
  disciples. The Romans took him to be crucified and he was stabbed in the
  side, made to wear a crown of thorns, and was hung on a cross with  nails
  through his hands and feet. He was buried in a nearby cave which was
sealed
  off by a large boulder.""

 St. Peter smiles broadly with delight.

 Then the third blonde continues ... ""Every year the boulder is moved aside
  so that Jesus can come out and, if he sees his shadow, there will be six
  more weeks of winter!

Mark,

I spoke with our ATT Wireless (Cell Phone) rep. yesterday.  I told him about the Sprint packages that offer many more minutes for same $$ as ATT.  He wants to work with us.  He's on family-leave  for the next 2 weeks, but he and I are scheduled to meet the 2nd week of Oct.  He knows we're doing some comparison shopping, and he doesn't want us to leave.  I think it would be in our best interest to see what he can offer us.

I'll keep you posted.

$1MM.  Could be another $45,000 because of interest rate decreases.

I have received the signed CMS Agreement.  I have signed it and returned it and we will be booking the earnings over the next couple of days.  Huber is trying to figure out how they will structure the purchases at the wellhead for royalty purposes.  They are doing this as part of their counterproposal to us.  I do not have very high expectations for this deal happening in the 3rd quarter.  However, Brian Stone will be stuck in a boat with just me and a guide for a total of 8 hours on Wed and Thurs. and I hope to make significant progress in that time.

 From the 11/26/01 New Dem Daily.  Please let the Colorado DLC know what 
you think.

With the U.S. economy in recession and the unemployment rate up above 5 
percent, there is naturally some speculation that the millions of former 
welfare recipients who began working since the 1996 national welfare reform 
legislation was enacted may now be at special risk of falling back onto 
public assistance. Indeed, within the last week, columnists E.J. Dionne of 
The Washington Post and Bob Herbert of The New York Times have suggested 
that the successful welfare reform experiment of the 1990s might soon fall 
apart in the wake of recession.

But the facts suggest otherwise.  In an article for the forthcoming 
January/February 2002 edition of Blueprint magazine, which will focus on 
the next steps in welfare reform, Blueprint Executive Editor Tom Mirga 
takes a look at the record and finds abundant evidence that welfare 
reform's success story remains stubbornly intact so far despite the new 
pressures of a slowing economy 
(http://www.ndol.org/ndol_ci.cfm?contentid=3961&kaid=114&subid=143).

Exhibit A of Mirga's case is a mid-October survey by the Welfare to Work 
Partnership, a voluntary association of more than 20,000 companies who have 
agreed to hire welfare recipients.  According to Rodney Carroll, the 
president and CEO of the Partnership, 57 percent of the firms he surveyed 
said they were still hiring entry-level workers, and another 18 percent 
predicted they would be hiring such workers by the end of the 
year.  Eighty-seven percent of the firms reported that they had not laid 
off any former welfare recipients during the previous two months - which 
included the period immediately after the September 11 terrorist attacks 
when the travel and entertainment industries took a huge hit.

Mirga also looked at the official numbers in the five states with the 
largest welfare caseloads: California, New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, and 
Michigan.  In all but Michigan, caseload levels remained stable at 
historically low levels since last fall, when the 1990s boom first stalled 
nationally.  Michigan experienced a 3 percent increase in caseloads between 
September 2000 and March of 2001, but the level of public assistance is 
still only about a third of what it was at its peak in the 1980s.

In Texas and Pennsylvania, Mirga discovered that some of the upward 
pressure on caseload levels is attributable to deliberate policy changes 
that allowed welfare recipients to retain some public assistance while 
working in private sector jobs.  While expressing considerable concern 
about the effects of a sustained period of rising unemployment, state 
officials remain very optimistic about the long-term job prospects of their 
former and current clients.

What they understand - and many persistent critics of work-based welfare 
reform don't - is that the welfare system has undergone a profound cultural 
change since 1996.  Michigan welfare director Doug Howard, who is also 
president of the American Public Human Services Association, says work 
requirements have permanently and dramatically changed the attitudes of 
both recipients and welfare administrators.  ""New entrants now come in with 
the expectation that welfare is temporary and transitional and that they 
need to move into employment and help their family,"" Howard says.  ""There's 
been a cultural change for our staff as well, a new attitude about moving 
families quicker.""

New York welfare agency spokesman Jack Madden echoes this belief that a 
more work-oriented system will help recipients weather hard economic 
times:  ""[They] now have a work history, they understand the importance of 
work in their personal lives and they will be able to jump back into 
employment when the economy picks up steam again.  You have to compare that 
with the old welfare system, which kept people in poverty regardless of the 
economy.""

The debate over the economy and welfare reform is of particular importance 
because the 1996 law is up for reauthorization in Congress next year.  Many 
of the original critics of work-based welfare reform, having grudgingly 
admitted its success, are now calling for a significant scaling back of 
work requirements and time limits on grounds that they can only work in a 
red-hot economy with plentiful jobs.

No one is arguing we shouldn't be worried about the impact of the economic 
slowdown on welfare recipients, many of whom do not yet qualify for 
unemployment insurance if they do lose their jobs.  Today's relatively 
positive picture could clearly get worse.  But the answer is to intensify, 
not retreat from, the new system of job placement, support services, and 
assistance to ""make work pay"" through health insurance and supplemental 
income support, that was at the heart of the 1996 reforms.

The stubborn good news about welfare reform, even in relatively tough 
economic times, provides ample evidence that it's no time to turn back from 
the most successful social policy innovation of the 1990s. "

One of the guys here recieved a call from a guy at EES looking for contacts at gas utilities in the Northwest.  They are hoping to sell them some sort of deal where they provide the utility structured products and the utility pushes them through to the endusers... isn't that my Cascade deal?  Let's discuss Monday, it sounds like something we need to nip in the bud."

That is great!  Let me know when you have time to talk this morning.  I can walk you through any questions regarding the LOI and the economic evaluation.

In addition, Dan and I still need to arrange a conference call with you regarding the Fort Union/Powder deal.  You and I should talk about it prior to that discussion just to make sure we are on the same page regarding the Ft Union capacity deal you are looking at.

Mark,

Good Afternoon!  you have 258 shares being vested in Jan 2002. It is too
early to tell what the taxes will be, I'm sure we'll be notified before the
release date.
Thank You!

 From the 12/11/01 New Dem Daily.  Please let the Colorado DLC know what 
you think.

This week the long, windy debate in Washington over a so-called economic 
stimulus package will likely be resolved one way or another.  Putting aside 
all the partisan finger-pointing as to who is responsible for this or that 
twist or turn in the process, the bottom line is very clear: Republicans 
are unwilling to support any stimulus package that does not include 
significant new cuts in tax rates for wealthy individuals and 
corporations.  We think that's too high a price to pay for the modest 
relief efforts for the unemployed that should be the focus of this legislation.

The overall economy is not in as bad a shape as many feared at the 
beginning of this debate.  Fiscal stimulus is already being supplied by new 
federal spending related to the war on terrorism and homeland defense.  The 
tax rate cuts Republicans demand will in any event have no positive 
short-term impact on the economy, and could damage its long-range prospects 
by boosting future federal budget deficits.  In effect, the GOP is holding 
unemployment relief hostage to yet another installment in its relentless 
drive for tax cuts targeted to high earners.

It's time for Democrats to call the whole thing off, and call the 
Republicans' bluff on unemployment relief by decoupling it from tax rate 
cuts.  Congress should be debating whether to cancel some of the high-end 
tax cuts enacted earlier this year, in order to pay for the war on 
terrorism.  Instead, Congressional Republicans have spent months talking 
about new demands on public funds for the Americans who are least 
vulnerable in the economic slowdown, and least likely to make personal 
sacrifices in the war effort at home or abroad.

If fiscal discipline means anything at all, it means a willingness to 
resist these sorts of demands.  New Democrats favor bipartisan compromises 
in the pursuit of the national interest, but not in the pursuit of special 
interests.  A deal with Republicans to secure new tax rate cuts would not 
be a compromise between ""Left"" and ""Right,"" but between right and wrong. "

What is the word dudes?
 
Subject: Four Good Management Lessons!!


Lesson Number One 
***************** 
A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. 
A small rabbit saw the crow, and asked him, 
""Can I also sit like you and do nothing all daylong?"" 
The crow answered: ""Sure, why not."" 

So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested. 
All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it. 

Management Lesson: 
To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Two 
***************** 
A turkey was chatting with a bull. 
""I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,""sighed the turkey, 
""but I haven't got the energy. 
""Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?"" replied the bull. 
""They're packed with nutrients."" 

The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him 
enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree. 
The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. 
Finally after a fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the top of the
tree. 
Soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the
tree. 

Management Lesson: 
Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Three 
******************** 
When the body was first made, all the parts wanted to be Boss. 
The brain said, 
""I should be Boss 
    because I control the whole body's responses and functions."" 
 
The feet said, 
""We should be Boss 
    as we carry the brain about and get him to where he wants to go.
 
"" The hands said, 
""We should be the Boss 
    because we do all the work and earn all the money."" 

And so it went on and on with the heart, the lungs and the eyes.... 
 
until finally the asshole spoke up. 
 
All the parts laughed at the idea of the asshole being the Boss. 
So the asshole went on strike, 
    blocked itself up and refused to work. 

Within a short time the eyes became crossed, the hands clenched, 
the feet twitched, the heart and lungs began to panic and the brain fevered.


Eventually they all decided that the asshole should be the Boss, 
so the motion was passed. 
 
All the other parts did all the work while the Boss just sat and passed out
the shit! 

Management Lesson: 
You don't need brains to be a Boss - any asshole will do. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Four 
******************* 

A little bird was flying south for the winter. 
It was so cold, the bird froze and fell to the ground in a large field. 
While it was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on it. 
As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung,
it began to realize how warm it was. 
The dung was actually thawing him out! 
He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. 

A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. 
Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung,

and promptly dug him out and ate him! 

Management Lessons: 
1) Not everyone who drops shit on you is your enemy. 
2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend. 
3) And when you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut!

Mark,
I don't think you have any capital expenditures but you're welcome to join in on the call.  I sent the invoices over to Susan Helton (3-1503) in accounting.  She is going to help get the requests done.  Things are still quite fluid and the i-payit system is up (so I hear).

Folks,
 
Please plan on attending a conference call Thursday morning (12/13) at 10 am CST to discuss how the cash approval process will be carried out going forward.  Attached is an example of the 5 day rolling forecast that the Cash Management Committee uses as an agenda.  Also attached is the Cash Use Approval Request form that will be used for justifying the payment of expenses.  We will discuss the process and lay out some guidelines for getting things through the Committee and executed as smoothly as possible.  Houston people will meet in ECS 05116 (conference room on the left-hand wall as you come into the room).  I will send out the dial-in number tomorrow morning.  Thanks for your help in this.
 
Doug "

Little Johnny went up to his father and asked him, ""Dad, what is the
difference between potentially and realistically?""

The father thought for a moment, then answered, ""Go ask your mother if
she would sleep with Robert Redford for a million dollars. Then ask
your sister if she would sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars,
and ask your brother if he'd sleep with Tom Cruise for a million
dollars. Come back and tell me what you learn from that.""

So little Johnny went to his mother and asked, ""Would you sleep with
Robert Redford for a million dollars?"" The mother replied, ""Of course
I would! I wouldn't pass up an opportunity like that."" Johnny then
went to his sister and asked, ""Would  you sleep with Brad Pitt for a
million dollars?"" The girl replied, ""Oh absolutely, I'd just love to
do that! I'd do it for free!"" Then he went to his brother and asked,
""Would you sleep with Tom Cruise for a million dollars?"" ""Of course,""
the brother replied. ""Do you know how much a million could buy?""

Johnny pondered that for a few days, then went back to his dad. His
father asked him, ""Did you find out the difference between potentially
and realistically? Little Johnny replied, ""Yes, sir. Potentially, 
we're sitting on three million dollars, but realistically, we're
living with two sluts and a fag

Subject:FW: It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown!

Police arrested Malcolm Davidson, a 27 year old white male, resident of
Wimbledon, in a pumpkin patch at 11:38 pm Friday. Davidson will be
charged with lewd and lascivious behavior, public indecency, and public
intoxication at the County courthouse on Monday.

The suspect allegedly stated that as he was passing a pumpkin patch, he
decided to stop. ""You know, a pumpkin is soft and squishy inside, and
there was no one around here for miles. At least I thought there
wasn't,"" he stated in a phone interview from the County courthouse jail.
Davidson went on to state that he pulled over to the side of the road,
picked out a pumpkin that he felt was appropriate to his purposes, cut a
hole in it and proceeded to satisfy his alleged ""need"". ""I guess I was
just really into it, you know?"" he commented with evident embarrassment.


In the process, Davidson apparently failed to notice the Wimbledon
Municipal police car approaching and was unaware of his audience until
officer Brenda Taylor approached him. ""It was an unusual situation,
that's for sure,"" said officer Taylor. ""I walked up to (Davidson) and
he's...just working away at this pumpkin."" Taylor went on to describe
what happened when she approached Davidson.

""I just went up and said, ""Excuse me sir, but do you realize that you
are screwing a pumpkin?"" He got real surprised as you'd expect and then
looked me straight in the face and said, 'A pumpkin? Damn... is it
midnight already?"""

Dear Mark Whitt,

Thank you for your recent order via our website. Fortunately, we were able
to change your shipping method before the package shipped. It will now be
shipped via expedited ground, and should arrive in 5-7 business days. This
will change the total cost of your order to $79.40.

Unless you choose another method, all web orders are shipped SURFACE (via
Parcel Post). This is your most cost effective shipping option (unless time
is a factor), because it's based on the very low ""bulk"" rates Sierra Trading
Post is able to negotiate due to its huge shipping volume.

If you would like to specify another method of shipment, please remember to
do so in the ""Shipping"" choices section during check-out, or place a note in
the ""Comments"" section. 

Thanks for shopping with us. We appreciate your business.

Sincerely,

Vici
Customer Service

I received an invoice from Corestaff for the day that Christina worked.  Do I need to do something with the invoice, or will she be paid automatically?

I spoke with Jill at the agency, and I will either meet with her later this 
afternoon or tomorrow morning.  She basically just needs some paperwork on 
me and I am then able to start working for you as soon as you'll have me.  
When would you like me to begin?  This week...Thurs?  Just let me know what 
you'd prefer and I'll be there...with bells on!

Mark,

Thanks very much for the information.  I left a message Friday for Clifford.  


I arrive into Denver around 8:30 a.m.  I have lunch planned with Bierbach at 
11:30 and a meeting with a headhunter at 1:30 p.m.  If I can't hook up with 
Clifford I will come by in the afternoon.  I look forward to seeing you and 
your family.  Talk to you soon.

Kind regards,

-Larry-"

This message was passed on to me and I did have the virus on my
computer, which means you probably have it as well, because you are in my
address
book. The antivirus did not detect this. Please read and do the following
to get this off of your machine.

Dear Friends and e-mail correspondents,

This is a serious e-mail. I anti-virus an e-mail from a work associated
warning of a virus that was passed on to him. His PC was infected and
since I was in his address book it had probably spread to my computer. I
followed the instructions and located the virus. By following the
instructions, I was able to delete the virus. The bad news is that you
probably have it, as you are in my address book. More bad news is that
my anti-virus program did not detect this virus.
This virus lies dormant for 14 days and then kills your hard drive. Here
is what to do. If you follow the instructions and then see that you have
the virus, you will need to send a similar e-mail to everyone in your
address book.

TO CHECK AND REMOVE VIRUS
Click on START pull up to FIND or SEARCH (depending on your computer)
and click on FOLDERS OR FILES
*Type in sulfnbk.exe this is the name of the virus.
*Make sure you are searching on the C DRIVE.
*Click on FIND NOW
*If the search finds the virus it will be listed in the box below the
search. It will have a black icon that will have the name sulfnbk.exe.
DO NOT OPEN THIS FILE!
*RIGHT CLICK on the file and pull down to DELETE.
*It will ask you if you want to delete this file LEFT CLICK YES
*Go to your desktop (where all of your icons are) and RIGHT CLICK on the
RECYCLE BIN (TRASH CAN) click on EMPTY THE ENTIRE BIN
*If you found the virus on your computer you will need to send this
message to everybody in your address book, because this is how it is
transferred.

Subject: fire truck
Date: Mon, 17 Dec 2001 09:46:04 EST


A fire fighter is working on the engine outside the
station when he notices a little girl next door in a
little red
wagon with little ladders hung off of the side and a
garden hose
tightly coiled in the middle.

The girl is wearing a fire-fighter's helmet and has
the wagon tied to a dog and a cat.

The fire fighter walks over to take a closer look.
""That sure is a nice fire truck,"" the fire fighter
says, with
admiration.

""Thanks,"" the little girl says.

The fire fighter looks a little closer and notices
the girl has tied the wagon to the dog's collar and
to the cat's
testicles.

""Little partner"" the fire fighter says, ""I don't
want to tell you how to run your fire truck, but if
you were to tie
that
rope around the cat's collar, I think you could go
faster.""

The little girl says, ""You're probably right, but
then I wouldn't
have a siren.

Sorry everyone! 
I've received a virus from someone else and now  your computer may be affected since you're in my address book. I'm told it  lies dormant for 14 days, 
THEN IT KILLS YOUR HARD DRIVE! 

NOTE: When I receive this notice, I updated my McAfee and ran a full scan, and it did not catch it. 

Here's how to stop it, if you've got it.  Also, send this message to everyone in your 
address book. I received this message, followed the instructions and got rid of it, so please do the same. 

The directions for removing it are easy: 

1. Go to 'Start' - then to 'find or search' (depending on your computer). 

2. In the 'search for files or folders' type in sulfnbk.exe - this is the virus. 

3. In the 'look in' make sure you're searching Drive C. 

4. Hit 'search' button (or 'find') 

5. If this file shows up (it's an ugly blackish icon that will have  the  name  'sulfnbk.exe' -     DO NOT OPEN IT. 

6. Right click on the file - go down to delete and left click. 

7. It will ask you if you want to send it to the recycle bin, say yes. 

8. Go to your desktop (where all your icons are) and double click on the recycle bin. 

9. Right click on sulfnbk.exe and delete again - or empty the bin. 

If you find it send this e-mail to all in your address book, because that's how it is transferred. 

I Apologize!

Just wanted to follow-up with the status on the gas proposal that you
submitted.   I have been a little bit side-tracked with a financing project,
but still plan to meet with the management group in the next couple of weeks
to review the proposals.   Please let me know if you have any updates or
changes to your proposal that you submitted.  Thanks again for your
patience.

Re:    IPAMS 4th Quarter Board of Directors Meeting
         December 7, 2001 at the Pinnacle Club, starting at 9:30 am

Dear Board Member:

I wanted to give you a quick reminder that the 4th Quarter Board of Directors Meeting is next week.  Hopefully you've already made arrangements and are planning to attend.

We have a short amount of time to cover all our topics, so each board member is asked to keep their oral report short (3-5 minutes).  Oral reports are intended to touch on highlights such as:  significant issues and upcoming events or activities.  For Committee Chairs and State Vice Presidents a more detailed description of your activities/reports should be contained in your written report.  A form for submitting your report is also included with this letter.

As a reminder, please submit written reports to the IPAMS staff no later than Monday, December 3rd.  
Please RSVP to Natalie in the IPAMS office by responding to this message or e-mailing her at ngarner@ipams.org.  
Thanks for your continued involvement, and I look forward to seeing you on the 7th.  If you should have any questions, please feel free to call the IPAMS staff for more information, 303-623-0987.

Very truly yours,

Robert L. Bayless, Jr."

This all sounds terrific!!!  I will have to check Sea World (I think she'd
really like that better than Six Flags because of the animals...the
dolphins, whales, etc. are so beautiful) for their winter schedule.  They
are only open on weekends in the fall and then do a Christmas special thing
before Christmas and I really don't know if they are open weekends after
Christmas or not.  I will try to find out.

I just talked to Dorcille...Debbie and Jo Beth are coming to their house
Friday...Jo Beth will leave late on Christmas Eve and Debbie will leave
Christmas Day...I would really love to see them...I have not seen Jo Beth's
kids in ages.  Dee asked us for Sun. when she will have all her side of the
family or Mon.  I think Mon. would be better because it would give you guys
a chance to rest up and also the crowd would not be overwhelming.  Dee has
two brothers who have five grown kids between them with spouses and kids so
that is a lot!!!

Lauren could see the beach, too...we'll hope for good weather...so far we've
had a great fall...lots of rain so hopefully that is over and ya'll leave
the cold in CO.

I was going to check on the portacrib to see if you thought Brock would
still fit but if you're bringing one, great.  The woman I borrow it from has
a new baby but she probably isn't using it.

let me know what else I need to get or do...has Kim had Daisy yet???  MJ

Mark,

Thanks so much for your kind hospitality.  Please thank Alicia again for me.  
How did Lauren's play go last night?  I am getting more excited about a move 
away from Houston, especially to Denver.  I hope you and your family have a 
great trip and please do give us a call if you swing into Houston.  Talk to 
you soon.

Kind regards,

-Larry-"

Been thinking about you, but figured you were busy.  Asked the Jernigan's
how you were doing and if your group was included in the filing.  They said
it was, you were trying to sell your group and that you didn't seem worried
at all, which is good.  Good Luck with that as I know it will be tough.  On
the bright side, if you sell it, you are a friggin hero for pulling off a
deal in a tough environment.  If you don't and go get another job, well
that's what everyone expects anyway.  Again, good luck, tell Lucci hey and
have a Merry Christmas.

Mark,
I found a good looking job at Anadarko.  (attached).  I believe the hiring supervisor is Bruce Stover who is the chairman of the University of Oklahoma Board of Visitors-College of Engineering where I went to school.  I think I should be able to match up with him but, I don't know him and need some help in getting into his office.  Do you know him and ( here is the big favor) know him well enough to get me into his office???
At any rate let me know what is going on with you in Denver.  This job hunting is like no fun at all.. . . .
Thanks,
Andy "

What's up with the IEEE 1451 standard? 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some years ago we saw the introduction of the IEEE 1451 architecture for smart transducers, which was supposed to make it possible to connect any kind of sensor or actuator to any kind of bus. While the first part of the standard was completed in 1997, the remainder is still under development and getting a lot of attention.

The Austin Group Energy, L.P.
Monthly Newsletter

Let's describe a typical and recurring nightmare for generating unit
operators. It's noon on August 15, temperatures have reached the upper 90s
all week; you're well into your reserve margin to serve native load, when a
unit trips off line. Do you scramble to find replacement power at record
high prices and worry about the consequences later? Or, have you prepared
for this event?

When the degree of risk has not been quantified, fear of the unknown can
lead to restless nights, and understandably so. The financial implications
can be astounding when a unit outage occurs during a period of high spikes
in market prices.

How does this relate to the recruitment and hiring of talent within your
shop? Allow me to bring the story together. What would you do if your top
employee came to you and said, ""You've been great to me and I've learned
alot, but I just accepted a job at your level right down the road and they
like me so much they want me to start tomorrow."" Do you spring into 911 mode
or are you ready for this day.

Start a relationship today with The Austin Group Energy. We will keep you
aware of all available talent in your market area. These candidates are
currently employed and do not answer ads. They stay in touch with
opportunities through us to ensure confidentiality. Why would Top 5

Yes - since Corestaff is who she would have gotten the pay check from she should definately contact them.  Let me know what they tell her.

Invoices should be processed as normal.  I have given the invoice to CSS. (our outsource service provider for contract labor) This invoice should be processed through CSS.

Note: Enron is not allowed to issue checks for pre-petition invoices. 

Thanks,

I talked to Susan Helton yesterday and she is still trying to track down the rent.  She said she isn't seeing it on a ""paid invoices"" list so she's still trying to get it resolved.  She said it would probably be after Jan. 2nd since so many people are out of the office until then.
 
I haven't seen Todd or Wayne and I didn't see an invoice on my desk from them.

Have you heard anything about the rent check?  Let me know if you do not get an invoice from Todd for the remaining construction work.

Mark,
I'm sure you've already noticed this, but our cell phones have been disconnected.  

I thought maybe we could pay for the bill on a credit card and turn it in on an expense report. Susan Helton is trying to find someone to get guidance from as far as getting this bill paid.  She said in Houston they are no longer paying for parking or cell phones but she wasn't sure about satellite offices.  She would hate to see us not get our expense reports paid.

I'll keep you posted.

Susan said to go ahead and expense the cell phones.  I called AT&T and it was 176.92  so I put it on my credit card and I'll turn it in.  The phones should be on now."

WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN

Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.

The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application (CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction by the following April.

Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as ""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""

Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""

To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.

""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months."" With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.

The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub."

Mark, Brian, and Steve,
	Further to my conversation two weeks ago with Mark, I would like to schedule a visit to Denver 11/19-20.  As a reminder, Business Controls is looking at the security posture of Enron facilities worldwide.  Currently, we are focusing our resources on domestic sites.  At the moment, I am planning for one of our IT specialists to travel from Portland to assist me with reviewing IT back-up procedures, recovery, and continuity issues.  If I could impose on you to provide some information about the office, it would greatly help in our planning.
	In particular, could you briefly describe the office(s); physical location, which floor, how large, how many employees, and any other Enron subsidiaries or offices in Denver.  Additionally, would you be our point of contact, or can you designate someone?  Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.

Mark - attached are the PUC's proposed rules on hedging - all they did is modify the existing rules pertaining to CGA proceedings.  I'd like to get xcel's comments and did not locate a phone number for their regulatory person in any of their filings that I could locate online.  How about trying to get a copy of their most recent comments from your contact at the company?

WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN

Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.

The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application (CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction by the following April.

Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as ""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""

Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""

To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.

""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months."" With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.

The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub."

Mark, pls encourage everyone to talk to their customers today and let's let the street know we are as busy as always and that the overall issues are behind us. I have no new info regarding this matter but believe that the proper vehicles are in place to maintain liquidity.  

I am very interested in what the wholesale customers have to say about our issues.  Do they have a mandate to not trade, are they wanting to turn down their exposures etc. If any customers say this, then let me know.

Pls keep me posted.

I don't know if you've worked with Walton before, but if not, you'll find that he is really well versed in transmission issues throughout the west.  I think he worked for Pacificorp for quite a few years.

Robert--isn't it kind of odd that the parties who had commented before would not at least file comments in support of the rules?  

Hey Mark--have you talked with your buddies over at Xcel?

I spoke with the ""WebMeister"" of the Colorado PUC today.  He did not think that the PUC would post on its website the filings by other parties in this docket.  He could only find one other party's filing (People's) and didn't see any other comments on file, either in the data base or on other analyst's desks.  I will continue to check with him.  The hearing is scheduled November 1.

Significant issues raised in People's comments are as follows:

Rules should be revised to include a Fixed Gas Cost option (without true-up) in addition to a traditional PGA-type offering - However the comments did not address administrative problems or cross-subsidization issues.
Rules did not go far enough in assuring utilties that hedging costs will be recoverable through the GCA
The calculation of interest on underrecoveries should be allowed.  Currently the interest calculation is asymmetrical.

Mark--one of my colleagues, Bob Frank, is going to be attending the hearing on Thursday morning at the Colorado PUC on my behalf.  Bob has as strong background in regulatory proceedings and will be able to expand on our comments before the Commission if given the ability to present.  (As we had talked about previously, it is very possible the the Commissioners will ask interested parties if they would like to speak---this is a tad less formal than evidentiary proceedings).  

I suggested to Bob that you might want to go to the hearing with him since you are officed in Denver and have an interest in the issue.  I'll give you a call on Monday and we'll see what's up in terms of coordinating.  In the meantime, Bob's phone number is  713-853-3180. 


Bob--there is a Westin at Tabor Center that is just across the street from Mark's office.  The Commission is about 10-12 blocks away, but I don't think there are any hotels that are effectively any more convenient than this one.

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

We received notification that the 5th segment to gate valve 6 providing a
total firm capacity of 495 Mdth/day was approved by FERC today.  Based on
the feedback some of you have provided today, and since this is late notice
on a Friday afternoon, the contracts will be effective on Monday, October
29, but the capacity will be available tomorrow and Sunday.  We filed the
6th segment to gate valve 5 this past Tuesday (October 23) and are prepared
to file the final segment as soon as one currently being reviewed is
approved.

Please call me if you have any questions.

basis has been tightening appropriately.   Per our conversation last week,
attached is my resume for your consideration.  Please pass on to the
appropriate people.   I am motivated in finding a position with a
progressive marketing company who could use my experience and knowledge of
the NW gas and electric market and where I can be part of a team that has
much larger view on the markets..   I definitely know that Enron fits that
model...

Thanks, Kevin

Mark,
 
According to the listing agent, the annual gross income for this unit is $22,800.  This is actual income from the past year. Expect this year to be somewhat less.  Also, a contract has been offered on this property, but not yet accepted.  I'm going over there to take a look today.

Alan,

My sincerest apologies, please keep me posted on what happens.  I'd like to buy you lunch sometime soon and talk about how we can avoid these situations in the future.  I think if we get master documents in place and convey to you a better understanding of our corporate structure, you'll find Enron easy to deal with, flexible, responsive, and competitive.  I'll call you soon in hopes we can get together.

		Roger,

		I hope you're reading your E-mail, because I can't get to
you by phone.

		Our attorney is checking the contract T&Cs, but I noticed
that none of
		the
		corrected company information I provided the last time
around is
		included.
		The name of our company is incorrect.  You have Ralph Mill's
name with
		my
		address, phone number, and my (incorrect) fax number. The
facility name
		is
		incorrect and the street name is misspelled.  All of this
was correct on
		the
		last copy I sent you.  Plus, there is no customer contact
information on
		the
		second page.

		Since the file is protected, I can't even correct this.

		How are we going to get this fixed in the next 2 hours?

Roger,

I hope you're reading your E-mail, because I can't get to you by phone.

Our attorney is checking the contract T&Cs, but I noticed that none of the
corrected company information I provided the last time around is included.
The name of our company is incorrect.  You have Ralph Mill's name with my
address, phone number, and my (incorrect) fax number. The facility name is
incorrect and the street name is misspelled.  All of this was correct on the
last copy I sent you.  Plus, there is no customer contact information on the
second page.

Since the file is protected, I can't even correct this.

How are we going to get this fixed in the next 2 hours?

I spoke with Dale Sanders at Williams today.  They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work.  I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003.  I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity.  However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity.  Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality. 

Williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d.  I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d.  Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely.

If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest.  Especially on the heels of the Kern River expansion. In addition, the Cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years.

Call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments.

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PA  have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

Mark,

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins."

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Are they going to build it if it is not fully subscribed?  Or is Williams going to take the risk?  I wonder why Entergy is taking space?

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PAs have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

NOAA ANNOUNCES NEW ""ENVIRONOMICS"" PROGRAM THAT 
LINKS WEATHER, CLIMATE TO ECONOMY
Data Show Effect of Climate Conditions on Corn and Soybean Yield
and Residential Energy Needs
October 24, 2001 - NOAA <http://www.noaa.gov/> today unveiled two new indices that evaluate the effect of climate conditions on corn and soybean yield and on residential energy needs. The development of the indices is part of NOAA's ""Environomics"" program <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/environomics/environomics.html>, an effort to better understand the impact of weather and climate on socioeconomic sectors of the nation. The indices were developed by NOAA's National Climatic Data Center <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ncdc.html> in Asheville, N.C., which maintains the world's largest weather database. (Click NOAA image for larger view of standardized temperature index for Sept. 2001.)
Anecdotal statements about the weather are often used to explain variations in economic activity, and these statements are often based on perceptions about the weather that may or may not be valid. Through NOAA's Environomics program, relationships between the nation's climate and vital economic sectors of the nation are clearly defined using climate indices, which enhance the understanding of how year-to-year variations and trends in weather and climate affect associated sectors.
Thomas Karl <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/about/welcomefromdirector.html>, director of NOAA's National Climatic Data Center, said, ""Climate indices developed through the Environomics program provide quantitative information regarding climate's influence while providing historical perspective on how weather and climate conditions affecting our economy and society today compare with conditions of the past.""
The period of high energy demand and prices of the late 1970s coincided with extremely cold winters that contributed to higher residential energy usage. The Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index (REDTI), which provides information related to climate sensitive residential energy demand, reflects this increased demand through historically high index values and can be used in part to explain the cause of the historically high energy demand of that time. By providing continuing updates to the index, a clearer understanding of future fluctuations in energy demand will be possible.
The REDTI tracks both unusually hot and unusually cold conditions. It varies from year to year due to variability and trends in temperature, and it responds most strongly to temperature conditions in heavily populated regions. REDTI values range from 0 to 100. Values greater than 90 indicate a much above average temperature-related energy demand and values less than 10 reflect much below average conditions.
The REDTI for the 2001 April-September season was 34, indicative of slightly below average residential energy demand for cooling and heating. Based on the 107 year record, the population-weighted REDTI value of 34 ranks as the 19th lowest value.
The nation's warm season (April-September) 2001 ranked as the fourth warmest such period since 1895, the first year of complete climate records. The preliminary national average temperature was 67.4 F (19.7 C), which was 1.6 F (0.9 C) above the long-term mean. Although the area-weighted national temperature gave the season a rank of fourth warmest on record, the persistence of average to cooler than average temperatures in some of the most heavily populated regions of the U.S. contributed to a REDTI that was below average. Energy usage statistics for 2001 will be available from the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration in 2002.
While the REDTI provides information on the impacts of temperature on energy demand, the Moisture Stress Index (MSI), was developed to quantify the effect of soil moisture conditions on crop yield. It provides historical perspective on conditions such as moisture stress, that are closely associated with corn and soybean yields and is a source of information for explaining the cause of lower national yields.
The MSI ranges from zero to 100 and specifically measures the proportion of the nation's corn or soybeans affected by severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness. Values near zero indicate that few productive corn or soybean growing areas were affected by severe drought or catastrophic wetness. This index reflects conditions during July and August and is weighted by the mean (1991-2000) annual crop productivity within 344 climate divisions in the contiguous U.S. Although a number of factors affect the success of a single crop growing season, drought or excessive wetness during critical phases of crop growth have a significant impact on the nation's corn and soybean yield.
Although warmer than average temperatures coincided with drought in some parts of the country during the warm season months of 2001, conditions in the heart of the major corn and soybean crop growing regions were generally normal to wetter than normal. The corn MSI for the 2001 crop growing season was eight, and the soybeans MSI was seven. This means that severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness affected only 8 percent and 7 percent of the nation's corn and soybeans, respectively. Both index values were below average and reflect favorable soil moisture throughout a large part of the crop growing regions during July and August (the reproductive season).
The MSI for corn exceeded 40 during the drought-plagued growing seasons of 1983 and 1988 and 30 during the catastrophically wet summer of 1993, years in which corn yields were less than 75 percent of the 2000 yield. The 2001 growing season (May-September) followed several years in which national corn and soybean yields were generally high, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The low values of this year's corn and soybean MSI indicate that conditions associated with this index were again favorable for good corn and soybean yields. National crop yields for 2001 will be available from the United States Department of Agriculture following the harvest season.

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PAs have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

Chris,

My email probably was a bit out of line, sent out of frustration - my apologies.  It was not wise of me to give a trader a heads up on my intent to buy in the first place, going forward I will not do that.  I have no expectation of having Stephan manage anyone's price risk.  I am hoping to develop Cascade into a long-term Enron customer, I make no origination on the deals I have done with them, I have encouraged them to enter into longer term DI deals and I have hooked them up with EOL - all intended to benefit of the cash desk in Calgary.  Next time the market falls $0.12 immediately following a trade I make on behalf of a customer I'll keep my mouth (email) shut.

There is no offence intended by either of these emails and I intend to continue to try and develop more spot and term business for your desk.

Dave

Dave,

I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning. I don't really feel that it is Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer. If you would like we could look at doing an  MSA with Cascade where by we could sell them gas at Sumas DI.

Dave,

I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning. I don't really feel that it is Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer. If you would like we could look at doing an  MSA with Cascade where by we could sell them gas at Sumas DI.

Thanks for the jokes, Bubba.  When are we all going to go out again?  I had 
such a great time.  By the way, I'm not wearing a bra!

I've met with the new Enron CFO when he was COO at Net Works and think he is
a complete asshole.  That said, the stock is too low and I am now the proud
owner of 250 shares.  Go BIG E!  Just hope that debt rating doesn't get
dropped.

Sue,

Well you would sure think they would file something, and I'm assuming they did, but the filings are probably sitting on somebody's desk.  I am going to be calling one of the information resource people this morning to follow-up.  I'll let you know.

Robert--isn't it kind of odd that the parties who had commented before would not at least file comments in support of the rules?  

Hey Mark--have you talked with your buddies over at Xcel?

I spoke with the ""WebMeister"" of the Colorado PUC today.  He did not think that the PUC would post on its website the filings by other parties in this docket.  He could only find one other party's filing (People's) and didn't see any other comments on file, either in the data base or on other analyst's desks.  I will continue to check with him.  The hearing is scheduled November 1.

Significant issues raised in People's comments are as follows:

Rules should be revised to include a Fixed Gas Cost option (without true-up) in addition to a traditional PGA-type offering - However the comments did not address administrative problems or cross-subsidization issues.
Rules did not go far enough in assuring utilties that hedging costs will be recoverable through the GCA
The calculation of interest on underrecoveries should be allowed.  Currently the interest calculation is asymmetrical.

Fred, Mark and Brian,

First of all, congratualations to Fred.

Second, I wonder if each of you could give ETS a litttle help.
We monitor all Enron companies to determine which companies sell gas.
We have to do this to comply with the ""Marketing Affiliate Rule.""
We think we have most of the producers, gathers and processers identified.
But, just to make sure could each of you send me a list of each of the companies you handle.
Specifically, we need the name of any of these companies in which Enron has a 10% or greater interest.
If you could identify each as a producer, gatherer or processer, it would help.
Also, we need to know whether the company sells gas at any point other than its own facilities.
Please call if your have any questions.
Thanks for your help.

Frazier King

Subject:	Natural Gas Origination


Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

I spoke with the ""WebMeister"" of the Colorado PUC today.  He did not think that the PUC would post on its website the filings by other parties in this docket.  He could only find one other party's filing (People's) and didn't see any other comments on file, either in the data base or on other analyst's desks.  I will continue to check with him.  The hearing is scheduled November 1.

Significant issues raised in People's comments are as follows:

Rules should be revised to include a Fixed Gas Cost option (without true-up) in addition to a traditional PGA-type offering - However the comments did not address administrative problems or cross-subsidization issues.
Rules did not go far enough in assuring utilties that hedging costs will be recoverable through the GCA
The calculation of interest on underrecoveries should be allowed.  Currently the interest calculation is asymmetrical.

I spoke with the ""WebMeister"" of the Colorado PUC today.  He did not think that the PUC would post on its website the filings by other parties in this docket.  He could only find one other party's filing (People's) and didn't see any other comments on file, either in the data base or on other analyst's desks.  I will continue to check with him.  The hearing is scheduled November 1.

Significant issues raised in People's comments are as follows:

Rules should be revised to include a Fixed Gas Cost option (without true-up) in addition to a traditional PGA-type offering - However the comments did not address administrative problems or cross-subsidization issues.
Rules did not go far enough in assuring utilties that hedging costs will be recoverable through the GCA
The calculation of interest on underrecoveries should be allowed.  Currently the interest calculation is asymmetrical.

What does the T stand for?  PT...reminds me of the circus, are you really 
that much fun?  My ""boy toy"" is standing me up tonight, can you believe it?  
Oh...the agony!  Besides the afro, what else have you picked up for your 
costume?  You need to rent some white tuxedo shoes and a white belt to go 
with your orange or light blue, polyester bell bottoms.  (these MUST fit 
quite snug)  Not to mention a very hip large collar disco shirt.  The girls 
will be squealing with delight.

I'm very happy that we will continue to become better friends and I can't 
wait to spend some time with you again.  So incredibley cool that we agree 
on the same ground rules.  I'm sending big wet kisses your way...LOOK OUT! -

Kim,

I've attached a spreadsheet that I'd like to use as an illustration for our phone call.  I won't bother explaining it here but if you could print it out for our call that would be great.

Mark, attached is a file regarding what the payment structures could look like. The plug is the total PV $'s that we will put towards the equation... other than that it is simply a demand charge calculation.

Pls coordinate and let me know.

Mark,

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

Mark,

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

I realize you may be concerned about sending information to a hotel fax, so don't send if you feel it is inappropriate.

These are draft versions of the interruptible purchase agreement and

Thanks..

We should know something about the well we are currently reentering next week.  Timing on the gathering line is still uncertain.

>>> ""Whitt, Mark"" <Mark.Whitt@ENRON.com> 10/23 8:33 AM >>>

These are draft versions of the interruptible purchase agreement and
confirm for your gas into Fort Union.  Think about what you what to do
for term, volume etc.  We will then add in the gathering charges.  We
are pretty flexible, so let me know what works for Patina.

Thanks,

Mark

Mark,

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

The convention dates are now January 26-29, 2002.
 
I'm sending you a new confirmation from the NADA for these dates.  They are using some of the NFL money to refund 100% of the registration fees for the dealers and managers and 50% of the fees for the guests.  Of course I registered everyone before September 11; otherwise I would have registered everyone as managers!  I' m sure that's what everyone will do that registers now.

Subject:	Income Tax Issue

Hello Penny,

It was nice meeting you and your associates yesterday.  I presented the income tax issue that we discussed to some of our accountants and they see things a little differently.  It is our opinion, that since a cash payment would be offset by the demand charge obligations associated with the capacity contract, it is not income per se, but rather funds dedicated to meeting an out-of-the-money contract obligation.  Depending on your accounting method, that money would probably be amortized over the term of the contract.  Let me know what you think, perhaps we should have our accountants talk.

As for adjusting the cash amount after the San Juan/Permian allocation issue is settled (I'm not sure you could hear all that at your end of the table) we are not really interested in any type of post assignment ""true-ups"".   But we are willing to talk about what those allocation percentages should be.

Regarding next steps, on Monday I will provide you with some ""alternative"" forms of payment and some ways we might spread the payments out0.  After that we will look to you guys for your preferred deal structure and payment terms.  I'll follow up this email with a phone call today.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

Calger asked my to be your Sr. Commercial guy on this potential tranaction....It would be helpful if you would spend a little time with me to better explain the business proposition that you see we would promote.  I will be available for a meeting in Denver.  In fact, I am planning on being their the weekend of Nov. 3.  Maybe we can schedule something around that date.

Mark - do you have historical information on the average price of gas sold
on enrononline vs the cig index.   This information would be helpful for us
in determining how much volume we would want to utilize on the enrononline

Louise, further to our conversation of yesterday... here is a list ( in order of priority) that I have reviewed with the Denver office.  In all cases, if Fred's group is able to make a case that the CFO truly is the financial contact, then we are prepared to leave as is.... otherwise as per Mark's note, I would like to clarify the marketing role regarding all Rockies and San Juan producers ( both physical and paper ) and transfer the primary responsibilities back to the Denver office as we had always planned.

Pls review and advise if you need anything further. 

BT

Hello Paul and Mark.  FYI:  CIG proposes to construct and operate facilities necessary to transport additional volumes of approximately 55 MDth per day of natural gas out of the Raton Basin Area in Colorado and New Mexico.  

The total cost of the project is $26,896,800  with a proposed rolled-in treatment for the expansion out of the Raton Basin Area.

Question - Do you all have any issues that you want us to address in regards to the expansion or will a plain vanilla intervention be fine?  The intervention is due Nov. 5th.

If you could get to me between now and the early part of next week, that would be great.

Ruth,

Here is the amendment to the purchase contract, please look it over.  It contains all the transportation options we have talked about and provides us the flexibility we need to re-price the CIG Index piece if there are additional future opportunities.  I will be giving you a call to make sure you have received this amendment and to answer any questions you may have.


Paul

This is today's New Dem Daily (10/17/01) . Sen. Joe Lieberman is the 
immediate past  chair of the national DLC.   His speech is at 
http://www.ndol.org/ndol_ci.cfm?kaid=106&subid=122&contentid=3851.  Please 
let us know what you think.

Earlier this week, Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-CT) made a thoughtful speech about 
the success of New Democrats in reviving their party's traditional 
commitment to a ""foreign policy that was values-based and fully engaged, a 
defense policy that was muscular and modern, and an economic policy that 
was internationalist."" Indeed, Lieberman suggested that the Bush 
Administration has moved in a similar centrist direction in its 
impressively unifying response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 
eschewing its previous tendency towards unilateralism and a values-neutral 
""realism.""

But Lieberman made news in his address to the fall conference of the New 
Democrat Network by openly saying what many Americans have privately 
concluded during the last month: the logic of the President's 
well-articulated position on the scope of the war on terrorism means that 
we cannot necessarily limit military action to Afghanistan. In Lieberman's 
words, we must at some point become ""unyielding in our demands that 
countries like Syria and Iran end their support of terrorism before we will 
contemplate working with them."" Moreover, said Lieberman, ""it should make 
us unflinching in our determination to remove Saddam Hussein from power in 
Iraq before he, emboldened by September 11, strikes at us with weapons of 
mass destruction.""

Lieberman is one of the few elected officials from either party to publicly 
connect the dots between our proclaimed war on any form of terrorism ""with 
global reach,"" and the obvious existence of a Middle Eastern rogue state 
that is sponsoring terrorism, pursuing weapons of mass destruction, 
continuing to threaten its neighbors, and is dedicated to the elimination 
of the U.S. presence in the region -- much of it necessitated, of course, 
by Iraq's continued behavior. The President has eloquently and repeatedly 
said any country that is not on our side in the war on terrorism must be 
treated as a ""hostile power."" By any measure, Iraq is a supremely hostile 
power that shares every anti-American impulse of both Al Qaeda and the 
Taliban, while having far superior means for attacking us. How can Iraq 
possibly be treated as irrelevant to this struggle? How can we possibly 
demand that friendly regimes in the region decisively side with us, while 
we ignore Iraq?

Unfortunately, there have been several signals from the Administration that 
the U.S. might shrink from the broader task of fighting terrorism -- even 
to the extent of leaving elements of the Taliban in power in Afghanistan -- 
if the more immediate task of capturing or killing Osama bin Laden and 
other top leaders of Al Qaeda can be accomplished. The logic seems to be 
that removing the Taliban, much less Saddam Hussein, from power could 
create a dangerous ""power vacuum"" in those countries, while destabilizing 
the international coalition against terrorism. This line of argument is 
reminiscent of the reasoning behind the decision in 1991 to leave Hussein 
in power in Iraq, followed by an unsuccessful sanctions regime and the 
permanent stationing of U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf region.

Whatever you think about that decision and its consequences, it's clear now 
that we cannot let excessive concern for political stability and 
coalition-building keep the United States from destroying the terrorist 
network and protecting our country from terrorist threats that continue 
every day. Surely we learned on September 11 that there are worse things in 
the world, and worse things in the Middle East, than ""power vacuums."" The 
Taliban, after all, was created in large part to bring order to 
Afghanistan, which led to its active sponsorship of violent disorder 
elsewhere, including our own country.

As for the anti-terrorist coalition, we should remember that coalitions are 
a means to an end, not ends in themselves. A coalition that cannot accept 
changes of regime in terrorist states, whether in Kabul or Baghdad, is not 
a terribly useful coalition to begin with. As Lieberman put it, ""if it 
becomes necessary, as we hope it will not, we could benefit from a dose of 
the Administration's previous preference for unilateralism."" As New 
Democrats have always argued, multilateralism is the preferred means in a 
post-Cold War world for the vindication of Americans' interests and values. 
But especially in the case of an attack on the United States itself, 
multilateralism should not become an excuse for inaction. Does this mean we 
have to go to war in Iraq? No, but it does mean the matter must remain open 
so long as the terrorist network still threatens us.

Non-military steps, including a different regime of ""smart sanctions"" that 
hit Saddam's thugs more than his already victimized citizenry, are 
possible. So, too, are military steps that could create truly autonomous 
Shiite and Kurdish regions in Iraq while leaving Saddam with a smaller 
domain. But the point to remember is this: we cannot treat the war on 
terrorism as a small skirmish in Afghanistan aimed solely at bin Laden and 
his closest associates. As Joe Lieberman rightly said: ""Our fundamental 
principles are at least as much on the line in this war against terrorism 
as they were in our battles with Nazism and Communism during the last century.""

Lieberman performed a valuable service in reminding Democrats of the 
heritage of tough-minded internationalism that characterized Democratic 
leaders like Truman and JFK during the post-World War II era. It's a 
heritage whose time has come once again.  "

Ty and Phil, can you please advise as to the status and provide me copies of all documents related to payment # 1 and # 2 regarding the kern shippers. 

What I really want to do is tie out paper work, signatures and ensure that we are tight on all fronts. Pls advise ( by co. name ) the status of all pending documents and a plan to get signatures as required.

We expect a ruling in the 336 docket to allocate receipt point capacity on =
El Paso, and that could be done before the end of the year.  BUT, we expect=
 that will be subject of rehearing applications and possibly even court app=
eal.  And that allocation is likely to be revised if and when the full requ=
irements/capacity problems get addressed in the other dockets in which they=
 are pending.  So, the possibility of revisions to receipt point allocation=
s exist even after an order is issued, and is final and non-appealable in 3=
36.  The language in the draft agreement states that Huber acknowledges tha=
t EP's capacity allocation procedures are under review by FERC and that the=
 capacity under contract will be bound by any modifications resulting from =
any FERC proceeding related to such capacity allocation procedures.  I thin=
k this is broad enough to cover all potential FERC actions, as it says ""any=
"" FERC proceeding.  Since we want to keep it open for future revisions, I w=
ould not advise inserting the usual  ""final, non-appealable order"" since yo=
u want to be able to track any changes that come along, however they may be=
 themselves changed by a later order. =20

Hope this makes sense.  =20

Subject: Third Quarter Earnings Results
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Attached are the latest based on our discussions.  I couldn't redline the Capacity Release Agreement, so I am only sending a clean version.  I would still make a general caveat, that we still need to do a final review of the gathering agreement.  This could add to the Transaction Agreement.

MArk--I put out a couple of calls to find on the 2002 Governors race in Wyoming, and the feedback I got was similiar to what we talked about.....there has not been a clear candidate yet, and Joe Meyers name is one of three possible Republican contestants. (the other two that are being talked about are Eli Bebout and Ray Hupkins--don't know if I got my spelling right on these boys!).  Apparently there was alot of discussion about the current US Senator, Craig Thomas, wanting to run and so everybody was pretty much waiting until he made up his mind before jumping into the race.  My understanding is that Thomas did make up his mind about 2 weeks ago to stay in the Senate, so your Mr. Meyers may very well be strongly considering a run."

Barry,

The Jackson Hole Lodging (Huff House) for Mark and Paul was all charged on Mark's card.  The way the lodging was broken up is as follows: 2 rooms, 2 night stay, $215.00 per night per room + 6% tax.  So, actual charges for Mark Whitt was $455.80, and for Paul Lucci was $455.80, for a grand total of $911.60.  

Paul has not given me his receipts from this trip just yet, but the only major travel associated charges he should have to expense would be airfare, which was $251.50. As Mark also had the rental car charged to his expenses.

Please let me know if you need anything further on this, or if you have questions.

Thanks,
Heidi

Heidi, Please sum up my costs and Paul's cost for this trip and forward to Barry.

Barry,  All of the Hotel costs were on my credit card, so all Paul should have is his airfare and incidentals.  But we will sum it up for you.

Thanks. BT

Subject: 



To My Dear Wife: 
During the past year I have tried to make love to you 365 times. I have succeeded 36 times, which is an average of once every ten days. The following is a list of why I did not succeed more often: 

54 times the sheets were clean 
17 times it was too late 
49 times you were too tired 
20 times it was too hot 
15 times you pretended to be asleep 
22 times you had a headache 
17 times you were afraid of waking the baby 
16 times you said you were too sore 
12 times it was the wrong time of the month 
19 times you had to get up early 
9 times you said weren't in the mood 
7 times you were sunburned 
6 times you were watching the late show 
5 times you didn't want to mess up your new hairdo 
3 times you said the neighbors would hear us 
9 times you said your mother would hear us 
Of the 36 times I did succeed, the activity was not satisfactory because: 

6 times you just laid there 
8 times you reminded me there's a crack in the ceiling 
4 times you told me to hurry up and get it over with 
7 times I had to wake you and tell you I finished 
1 time I was afraid I had hurt you because I felt you move 




To My Dear Husband: 
I think you have things a little confused. Here are the reasons you didn't get more than you did: 
5 times you came home drunk and tried to screw the cat 
36 times you did not come home at all 
21 times you didn't cum 
33 times you came too soon 
19 times you went soft before you got in 
38 times you worked too late 
10 times you got cramps in your toes 
29 times you had to get up early to play golf 
2 times you were in a fight and someone kicked you 
    in the balls 
4 times you got it stuck in your zipper 
3 times you had a cold and your nose was running 
2 times you had ! ! a splinter in your finger 
20 times you lost the notion after thinking about it all day 
6 times you came in your pajamas while reading a dirty book 
98 times you were too busy watching football, baseball, etc. on TV 

Of the times we did get together: 
The reason I laid still was because you missed and were screwing the sheets. 
I wasn't talking about the crack in the ceiling, what I said was, ""Would you prefer me on my back or kneeling?"" 
The time you felt me move was because you farted and I was trying to breathe. 

Once you read this letter you have to keep it going. 
This game has been played since 1996. 
You must send this letter to 7 people. 
On the 5th day someone will ask you out or say ""I love you."" 
This is not a joke.  It has worked for many years. 
If you break the chain, you will have bad luck with guys/girls 
forever. 
This is just for future readers. 
This began in 1996, not much of a past, but it works. 
So here are the rules: 
*If you read this on a Sunday, wish for a really fun week 
*If you read this on a Monday, wish for money 
*If you read this on a Tuesday, wish for love 
*If you read this on a Wednesday, wish for success 
*If you read this on a Thursday, wish for anything you want 
*If you read this on a Friday, wish for a really hot date 
*If you read this on a Saturday, wish for an important phone call 
Send this to seven people (after you make a wish). 
Make sure it is sent as soon as you read it or your wish won't come true. "

I've consolidated the presentation slides we decided on (and added a few).  It is still very rough and probably too long, but at a good point to dig in and really discuss what we want to say and how we want to say it.

Further to our conversation please find attached the curves on the JM Huber transaction that we have agreed to work off of. The 30,000/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with HUBER is effectively completed. In the event that this deal does not close, then the West desk will resume with the same MTM risks that you presently have.  

Any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk... plus ENA Orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals. 

In addition to the transportation income being generated, additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks. I believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book ( by Mark Whitt ) and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly.

I trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and I am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone..

Pls review file and if there are any questions give me a call.

BT

Eric,

This spreadsheet summarizes the pricing terms for the proposed Kennedy Oil transaction that we discussed earlier.

 
Also, attached in the e-mail below, I have included a ""Discussion Document"" that Mark and Pual put together for the purpose of discussions with Kennedy.  It provides more specifics on the pricing and volume allocation, if you desire.

Based on my calculations, the 10,000/d priced at NYMEX minus $0.62 is roughly $300,000 in the money and the 5,000/d priced at NGPL MidCon minus $0.47 is roughly $500,000 in the money.

I will be out next week, but Mark and Paul will keep you posted as to the expected close date and any changes in the deal terms.  Please give me a call today if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tyrell

This is worth considering. Let's all be careful!=20


Hi All -=20

I think you all know that I don't send out hoaxes and don't do the=20
reactionary thing and send out just anything that crosses my path.  This on=
e,=20
however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough credibility in my=
=20
mind that I'm writing it up and sending it out to all of you.=20

My friend's friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a month ago.=
=20
She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up. She was understandably=
=20
upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied.=20

On 9/10, she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished=
=20
he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it had to be like=
=20
that. The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get on any=20
commercial airlines on 9/11 and to not to go any malls on Halloween. As=20
soon as everything happened on the 11th, she called the FBI and has since=
=20
turned over the letter.=20

This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on.  This came=
=20
from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last night.=20

I may be wrong, and I hope I am. However, with one of his warnings being=20
correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the second=
=20
and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same information=
=20
that I did.=20

Mark, I have approved this expense report.. With regards to the Wyoming Gas Fair.  What is the total cost of that trip for you,looks like $ 3,000 or so including airfare, hotel and ancillaries, also ( I believe Paul was there ).  What are his expenses going to be for this? 

Thanks. BT

That is what I love about you that you will do just about anything three or four times! 

I love you so much and thanks for the nookie this morning.  You know all my health books say that it is really good to have sex/orgasms twice a week during the cold/flu season because it helps to strengthen the immune system.  This sounds dorky but maybe we should set lovemaking dates everyweek and just stick to it! 

Love and Kisses"

For everyone's information, we're terminating the compression payment services that we were providing for MTG Operating...(see attached letter).
 
As the Originator of this deal (which has been much below our/my expectations), I think I can speak for everyone when I say...""yeah"".
 
Thanks.

Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=
e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=
l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =
there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=
e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=
es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=
ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=
trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=
e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =
(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B=
rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=
e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, =
or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=
he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=
tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =
Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =
picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=
. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=
ication).=20

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=
 in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=
rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=
r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=
tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=
adged contractor at all times.

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=
yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=
n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=
ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=
 the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=
, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =
escorting employee or badged contractor.

?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =
workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=
rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=
ou or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=
uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=
 in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=
pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=
se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=
tions:

?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=
s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=
ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=
istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=
rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =
planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=
bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=
y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =
reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=
ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=
sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=
ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=
eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=
 that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=
 as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=
gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=
ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""regi=
stration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=
t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros=
sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=
torically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, =
but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=
 would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=
urrent lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=
ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01 
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 

This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 

In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 

Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 

But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 

As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 

Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 

Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 

Duress alleged 
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 

""We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically,"" said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. ""We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal."" 

Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 

Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 

""The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts,"" Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 

""Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts,"" Shames said. 

Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 

Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 

He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
""To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster,"" said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. ""There were other means to manage the emergency."" 

The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
""First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms,"" said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.

Willingness to deal 
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 

The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are ""just and reasonable."" FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 

Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 

For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
""In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so,"" said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. ""We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone."" 

Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 

Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
""The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market,"" said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 

The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 

Sempra says contract fair 
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 

San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 

Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 

""It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' "" Niggli said. 
But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 

White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
""There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to,"" White said. ""The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 

""But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?"" 
***************************************************************** 
State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
OC Register, 10.07.01 
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 

Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 

The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 

Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 

""We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 

A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 

In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 

Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. ""The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. 

Said Freeman: ""We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks."" 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 

Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 

The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called ""peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 

The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 

Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 

""I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 

Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 

Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 

Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 

""I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 

The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 

The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
""It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But ""it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 

Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 

Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
""The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. ""Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''"

As could be expected PSCO has finally implemented PRM this year and did a great job of ""buying the high'.  Now the rate payers will have lower prices than last year but probably twice as high as they should be.  I would definitely like to discuss it with you.  How about 1:30 central on the 8th?

Mark/Barry--- I finally had a chance to look this week at the Colorado PUC proposed rulemaking amendments regarding price risk management (PRM) for gas utilities.  As we had generally talked about, the appetite for meaningful change to the PUCs rules has been pretty weak by staff and to a great extent by the Commissioners themselves.  These proposed rules reflect some movement toward encouraging utilties to implement PRM, but does NOT require them to implement, nor is there a clear statement that the PUC will allow recovery of costs.  Here's a short list of what's in the rules:

        > costs related to prm may be allowed, and new language is added to better define the standard of review as ""whether the utility action was reasonable in light of the information known, or should have been known, at the time of action or inaction"".    

        > in the utility's annual Gas PUrchase Plan they must include an exhibit that describes and analyzes the steps the utility has taken to reduce gas price volatility.  It appears to be an informational filing only, but clearly signals that the PUC expects them to take some action or explain why they didn't. 

        > the utility's actual portfolio purchases, included in the costs of purchasing risk managment products,  need to be included in a Gas Purchase Report to be filed annually. This report presumably is the document that the PUC will then use to determine reasonableness of gas cost pass thru.


There are numerous areas that we could comment on in this proposed rulemaking---anywhere from pushing them to be more explicit in advocating that the utility must do prm and that they will recover the costs, to something along the line of turning over their gas supply portfolio to a company that can more effectively manage it.  There is a hearing scheduled for November 1 in Denver, with comments due on or before October 21.  

We would be happy to intervene and file comments in the proceeding and work the issue if you guys would like us to. Might be kind of fun to tweak our friends at Xcel just a bit! Is there a time on Monday Oct 8 or Tuesday Oct 9 that we could talk via phone to determine your level of interest?  I am available mid day on Monday (between 10 and 2:30 central) or Tuesday anytime up until about 3:30.  Please let me know via return e mail or give me a call   #612-339-4599"

Please find the attached LOI.  See if it meets with your understanding of the deal.  The document is non-binding but will serve as a framework for the actual agreements.  I will send you draft versions of the other documents on Monday.

It was a pleasure to see you and Mark Whitt at the Ziff conference.  As I
mentioned, Clatskanie has elected to proceed with negotiations with another
supplier based upon a proposal providing multi-year primary firm Williams
transportation to Deer Island.

And, as we discussed, sometime during November, as plant operations
approach, it would be appropriate for you and Jeff Shields to get together
with the EWEB and Clatskanie folks to present your ideas (suggested in your
proposal) for mutual business opportunities among Enron, Clatskanie, and
EWEB.  Give me a call at that time and we will coordinate a phone call or
meeting.

Thank you for your participation in our RFP.

One of the guys here recieved a call from a guy at EES looking for contacts at gas utilities in the Northwest.  They are hoping to sell them some sort of deal where they provide the utility structured products and the utility pushes them through to the endusers... isn't that my Cascade deal?  Let's discuss Monday, it sounds like something we need to nip in the bud."

Mark,
Help me out here!
I took our current marketing arrangements, selling into the spot
market, assuming the worst at EPNG-SJ Index - $0.10, and compared it to
the pricing under the three tranches.  I realize we are mixing IF and
GDA, but IF can be swapped for GDA and vice-versa in the swing swap
market.  My dilemma is that the firm transportation does not appear to
be accretive, in fact it results in $0.05 / mmbtu  less than current
arrangement (accross the total volume).  What is really killing it is
the NW basis and discount...am I using the right one?  (FYI, I used
ENA's mid-market basis for the 12-month strip going forward).  What am I
missing here?"

Gents--

Hopefully, I've attached a general information packet below for the Calgary office &/or Suncor.

[One note: we've rolled the original (overvalued by T-Bone) CGS assets into Bear Paw, so that's why you don't see a reference to CGS (fomerly EMS) anymore.]

Thanks.

America's Tragedy: TLU Responds

 

Alumni Reports - On behalf of TLU and its alumni, staff members have been calling and sending e-mail messages to alumni and friends of TLU who live in New York City and the District of Columbia or who grew up in these regions. As of today, Friday, Sept. 27, we have not heard of any deaths or missing people among those whom we have attempted to call.

 If you hear word of alumni, friends or other members of the TLU community who have been affected by the Sept. 11 tragedy, please e-mail alumni@tlu.edu <mailto:alumni@tlu.edu> or call 830-372-8020 so that we can send cards and spread the word to alumni and the campus. Thank you.

 First-hand Account - Douglas Rosa, 88G, works as the vice president in the Controller's Division of Deutsche Bank, Manhattan branch. The bank's offices are located some 150 feet from the World Trade Center in downtown NYC. Rosa and his family are shaken, but fine. A first-hand account of Rosa's experience on Sept. 11 follows.

 Having worked some 150 feet from the World Trade Center Tower 2, Sept. 11, 2001 was a day unlike any other in my life. I arrived at work approximately 6:20 a.m. and before entering my Deutsche Bank building at 130 Liberty St. (on the south side of the WTC #2 Tower and connected by a walking bridge), I purchased a package of six apple cider donuts from the Farmers Market that, just like any other Tuesday or Thursday, was setting up shop outside WTC #5.

 At approximately 8:50 a.m., I called my wife, Dorothy, home in Caldwell, NJ, from my office on the east side of the 21st floor, to tell her that our building just shook and that there was a large noise - as if a plane had crashed some place near by. 

 After hanging up, I was told a plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. I looked out my window and saw people running for their lives. There were cars on fire and debris flying everywhere. Our building was getting hit with pieces of the debris, and it sounded like a major hailstorm. We could see this remarkable amount of flame and smoke coming from the hole in Tower 1. I screamed to my co-workers to get away from the windows. At that point, many of us gathered our bags, and began walking down the stairs. As we reached the 7th floor, an announcement was made to stay on our floors, not to evacuate. Knowing that it looked pretty dangerous outside, we went back to floor 21. 

 Then another crash came, bigger than the first one. Someone began screaming, ""Run, it's coming down.""  We all ran to the south side of the floor and waited for the next announcement. When it was finally made, they began evacuating floors 1-7. We waited some more. Everyone was shaking from nervousness. 

 Then they announced that everyone (all 41 floors) should evacuate as soon as possible and to use the elevator if needed. We began our descent quickly and orderly.

 As we reached the second floor lobby, we were told to exit the building and head south. And so we did. I headed 10 blocks south to Battery Park and began looking for ways to travel back to New Jersey. People told us that the ferries were still leaving from the World Financial Center, directly west from the WTC, so a co-worker and I began walking north along the Hudson River walkway, through Battery Park. As we approached the ferry dock, everyone around just screamed and began running for cover. I ran straight for the Hudson River and never looked back.

  I jumped over the barrier wall and stood there watching as this mushroom cloud of dust kept chasing me. I decided in my own mind to jump in the water if it reached me. Finally, though, it just stopped coming. Needless to say, the ferry never reached the dock. Tower 2 had fallen, and most of us never even realized that it was no longer up there somewhere behind the smoke and dust. Then the radio confirmed it, and we also heard about the attack on the Pentagon.

 Feverishly, the police directed us further north. As we continued on the sidewalk surrounded by all-glass towers, we were all very nervous. People listened on their walkmans and desperately tried to use their cell phones to reach loved ones. I stopped for an instant to lead a blind woman with a young girl to a policeman. 

 Although everyone was nervous, most people kept walking in an orderly fashion without pushing. We continued up the West Side Highway when, suddenly, the Tower 1 gave way. I turned to watch, but quickly turned away and walked even faster. People dropped to their knees to pray. Eventually, I reached another ferry terminal. I waited an hour and a half in line and borrowed several cell phones to call my wife. I never got through to her until I reached New Jersey, though.

  Before I got home that night, I walked and ran a lot more. I even found myself in the middle of a bomb scare inside the Hoboken Train Terminal. I ran to Jersey City and spent the late afternoon hours with my cousin, Sr. Lilian Silkowski, a Roman Catholic nun that lives in Jersey City. I was told that two of her students, siblings, in the parish's high school had lost both their mom and dad. That's when it hit me how many lives had been affected. The parents worked in the upper floors of the WTC. Several other students have been taken out of school because their parents were employed in the WTC and have since lost their jobs, and they can no longer afford the tuition.

When I arrived home at 8 p.m. that evening, I kissed my wife and my kids. I thanked God for getting me home safe. 

 As I watch TV, I realize how much danger I was in and thank God for looking after me. The experience has reminded me of all my friends and family. Although we don't always talk, we are connected. Among them are many of my TLU family. My wife and I have been getting phone calls from all of you. From Texas to Chicago to Phoenix to Connecticut to Virginia and South Carolina. Thank you to Gary, Angelique, Kim, Steve, Debbie, Becky, Chris, Mike, Andrew, Shirley, Charlie, Lana, Kim, Alex, Kris, etc. You are my family. It's nice to be able to say that your phone is ""ringing over"" from love and support. Thank you all for your prayers and thoughts. I truly believe that they made the difference for me that day.

 For those TLU alumni that are looking for ways to help, may I suggest the following. The families in my cousin's school listed above have many challenges ahead. The school has begun a fund for the two siblings who lost both parents, and the address is as follows: St. Mary's High School WTF Fund, 209 Third St., Jersey City, NJ 07302 attn. Sr. Jacqueline Carey.

 God bless the TLU family and God bless America.

Alumni Event Reports

 

Women of TLU Reports 

 

San Antonio Women of TLU- The San Antonio Women of TLU met Sept. 8 at the San Antonio Country Club to discuss ""Kneading the Dough: Women, Faith, and Financial Resources."" Dr. Annette Citzler, professor of economics and business administration, was the guest speaker. This event went very well, with approximately 30 women in attendance. Citzler discussed how and why women tend to be more averse to risk and how to move into the future with a better understanding of our finances. 

 

Dallas/Fort Worth Women of TLU - The Dallas/Fort Worth Women of TLU held their founding meeting Sept. 22 at the home of Marion Brekken, wife of Board of Regent Dr. Alvin Brekken. This Women of TLU brunch, at which President Jon N. Moline spoke, was a great success! There were about 30 women in attendance, and since this was their first meeting, there was a great amount of discussion and many ideas were brought up for future meetings. All the Dallas/Fort Worth-area women are excited to have this group in their area and look forward to their next meeting in the spring.

 

Houston Women of TLU - The Houston Women of TLU will meet at 1 p.m. Friday, Oct. 5, for a tour of Rienzi, the former home of Carroll and Harris Masterson. Rienzi is now the Center for European Decorative Arts at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. The day will end with coffee and dessert at Europa Caf?. 

 

Austin Women of TLU - The Austin Women of TLU will meet at 10 a.m. Saturday, Oct. 6, at the Lakewood Club House. Speaker Ramona Magid from Komen Austin will lead discussion on the topic ""Breast Cancer: Helping Yourself, Helping Others.""

 

Seguin-New Braunfels Women of TLU - If you are a member of the Seguin-New Braunfels Women of TLU organization, please note that the program for the Oct. 6 event has changed. Author Janice Woods Windle, who was scheduled to speak, has unfortunately cancelled. Instead, however, a panel of alumnae will lead a discussion on America at War: A Woman's Perspective. The alums - Virginia Woods, 58G; Betty Jean Jones, 46G; Patt Linden, 60G; plus others - will be joined by a current TLU student. They will each give brief presentations of their own memories of times when America has been vulnerable - Pearl Harbor, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam, Korea and Oklahoma City - before opening the event up to general discussion with everyone in attendance. 

 

Our apologies about the change in program. We will be working to personally contact those of you who have RSVP'd over the next few days to talk to you about the change. The brunch will still begin at 10 a.m. Saturday, Oct. 6, in the Timmerman Room of Hein Dining Hall on campus.

On Campus

 

U.S. News Rankings - Texas Lutheran University has again been listed in this year's U.S. News & World Report college rankings as one of the best comprehensive colleges and the No. 1 value among comprehensive colleges in the Western United States. Among comprehensive undergraduate colleges in the Western United States, TLU was ranked third in overall quality and the No. 1 value. TLU is the highest-rated Texas college in its category. U.S. News has repeatedly recognized TLU as a top quality institution since the magazine began its rankings in 1983.

 This is the second year in a row TLU has been ranked No. 1 for value, posting numbers showing that 61 percent of its students receive grants based on need, with an average discount of 39 percent.

 A complete account of TLU's placement in the U.S. News & World Report rankings is in the Fall Torch, due in your mailbox in October.

 

Cultural Events Calendar - A vocal performance by a stellar soprano, an art exhibit featuring the works of four international women artists, the traditional Christmas Vespers, and a look at ""Scary Frontal Freakin' Skullheads"" are some of the highlights of the 2001-2002 cultural events calendar at Texas Lutheran University.

 A calendar of events has been sent to people on the university's arts mailing list. If you would like to receive a calendar, please call the TLU University Relations Office at 830-372-8020. To view it online, please click here:

 <http://www.tlu.edu/> and look under the ""Other Updates"" section for more information.

Enrollment Up - With official class rosters complete, Texas Lutheran University registered a total student enrollment of 1,473 for the 2001 fall semester. This growth continues a trend of increased enrollment at Texas Lutheran, which has grown steadily since the mid-1990s.

 Numbers show a record main-campus enrollment for TLU, with 1,358 students enrolled in courses on the main campus. Also, 1,257 of those students are full time enrollees - another record for the university.

 The university has set a strategic planning goal of 1,600 full-time students on the main Seguin campus. This number will preserve the university's community feeling, and allow for the small classes and personal attention that are the hallmark of a TLU education.

 This year's average class size is 21, and TLU maintains a 15.5 to 1 student/faculty ratio.

             Other details about the current TLU student body at the main campus:

?        92 percent us hail from Texas, though there are representatives from 25 other states and 16 countries, notably Minnesota and Arizona, as well as Japan and Macedonia.

?        A slight majority - just over 500 individuals - is majoring in disciplines in the TLU College of Professional Studies (business administration, education, kinesiology and social work). 

?        Traditional liberal arts majors offered in the College of Arts Humanities and Social Science (art, English studies, psychology, sociology, etc.) come in a close second, with 416 students majoring in those areas.

?        Almost 300 students have selected majors in the College of Natural Science and Mathematics (biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics etc.), and just over 200 are undecided.

Dave,
 
I mentioned this project to Barry and he suggested that I forward the e-mail to you.
 
AJ is somewhat cagey but here is what I have gathered.

He has rights to several leases within the Mist field
He acquired these thru his association with Enerfin Energy which is actively producing leases adjacent to NW Natural's Mist Field
NW Natural has an agreement with Enerfin that gives them the right to convert all producing properties to storage when they reach their economic limit.
AJ's leases are not subject to this agreement but he expects that NW Natural would take a piece of the field
He has had some conversations with NW Natural but no specifics have been worked out.

He is in desperate need of equity and so came called, hat in hand, so to speak.
 
Just wanted to see if you had any thought son the project or what you interest might be, if any.

From: 	Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-Enron+20Announcements_Corp_Enron+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  On Behalf Of Ken Lay - Chairman & CEO@ENRON
Sent:	Thursday, September 13, 2001 9:09 PM
To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy


The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

Hi Mark:

I've been talking to the folks at Pioneer Oil Company regarding their coalbed methane project in Sheridan County, WY and have quoted them a gathering rate for redelivery into Big Horn.  They currently have only 5 wells drilled, with plans to drill a total of 13 sites, 3 coals each by years end.  Based on the results of this pilot project, an additional 100 wells will be drilled in the first quarter of 2002.  This pilot project is located in T55N, R79W and is a ""stones throw"" from BHGG.

They are interested in discussing transportation and marketing options.  Wayne Fisher has been my primary contact to date and is a consultant working with Pioneer in Sheridan.   Tad Butt is President of Pioneer and is located in Billings, MT.  (This is their first coalbed methane play; Pioneer Oil Company is a supplier of equipment and services to the asphalt paving industry.)

A man boarded an airplane and took his seat.  As he settled in, he
glanced 
up and saw a very beautiful woman boarding the plane.  He soon realized
she 
was heading straight toward his seat.  Low and behold, she took the seat

right beside his.  Eager to strike up a conversation, he blurted out, 
""Business trip or vacation?""

She turned, smiled and said, ""Business.  I'm going to the annual 
Nymphomaniac Convention in Chicago.""

He swallowed hard.  Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen 
sitting next to him and she was going to a meeting for nymphomaniacs!  
Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, ""What's your
business 
role at this convention?""

""Lecturer,"" she responded.  ""I use my experience to debunk some of the 
popular myths about sexuality.""

""Really, what myths are those?"" he asked.

""Well,"" she explained, ""one popular myth is that African American men
are 
the most well endowed, when in fact, it's the Native American Indian who
is 
most likely to possess that trait.  Another popular myth is that French
men 
are the best lovers, when actually it is the men of Jewish descent.  We 
have, however, found that the best potential lover in all categories is
the 
Southern redneck.""

The woman started to feel a little uncomfortable and blushed.  ""I'm
sorry,"" 
she said, ""I shouldn't really be discussing this with you, I don't even
know 
your name.""

""Tonto,"" the man said.  ""Tonto Goldstein, but my friends call me Bubba.""

Paul, 
Thanks for writing, This is definitely a source for amusement. I too have been playing with this for a short time (about a week). I don't use my computer that often in my work, so I'm kind of new at this stuff. I don't even know how to put my picture in my profile. 
      Sometimes I think I moved to the sleepiest town in Colorado. Everytime I tell someone where I live they say ""Superior? Where's That?"" 
My favorite Italian Restaurant is in Broomfield, Original Pizza on Midway. Have you been there? 
Yeah lets meet. A drive around the city sounds great and a drink always  helps. 
Wait, How do I know your not the freakish type that might try and take advantage of me. After all, you know this city better than I do. Humm, This Could be Trouble. 
Why don't you give me a call and I can try to size you up on the phone. 
Home # 303-543-1108   Cell# 720-313-4857 
                                                Talk to ya soon

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com."

Mark,
Mark,
Hope all is well with you guys in Denver.  
I  hope you are able to continue to make deals and are not caught up in the unbelievable craziness here in Houston.  
I was looking for companies to approach about employment and Burlington Resources name came up.  I assume Lee Hanse is still with them. I was going to send him an e-mail with my resume.  Any thoughts about BR.
Thanks,
Andy    "

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken"

This email is the monthly update for December on the progress of the 
Colorado Democratic Leadership Council and New Democrat Movement in our 
state.  The Colorado DLC is a think tank focused on local, state and 
federal issues of interest to this region.  The New Democrat Update is 
distributed to more than 3,600 elected officials and private citizens the 
first week of each month.

**REJUVENATING RURAL COLORADO**

In the old economy, most rural areas had reasonably strong and stable 
economic bases to support growth and jobs.  In addition to low costs, 
plentiful labor and adequate physical infrastructure, rural regions 
depended on innovative economic activities ""filtering down"" from urban areas.

Clearly, those days are over.  The innovative, well-paying industries 
increasingly cluster in the metropolitan suburbs, providing minimal 
economic benefits to rural Colorado.  To date, most rural economies have 
been largely left out and are having significant difficulty competing and 
prospering in the New Economy.

Rural communities face a new opportunity and challenge to prosper in this 
new world. The opportunity -  unlike the old economy, new technologies 
allow economic activity to be geographically farther apart while still 
functionally tight.  The challenge - much of rural Colorado has limited 
access to high-speed telecommunications technologies, a critical factor in 
determining business location and expansion decisions.

Federal, state and local governments, in partnership with the private 
sector, must help rural communities adapt and develop innovative, 
technology-based economies through seed venture programs, 
technology-incubators, industry-university research partnerships and 
collaborative technology modernization projects.  Ideally, nonprofit 
entrepreneurial organizations, linked to the private sector, should run 
these initiatives.

Much like the digital economy, today's economic strategies take a strong 
combination of good hardware and software.  The Colorado congressional 
delegation can help with the ""hardware"" by pushing for federal funding to 
co-invest in business applications with rural broadband telecommunications 
providers.  In addition, they should support Senator Tom Daschle's proposal 
to provide federal loans to rural utility providers for deployment of 
broadband telecommunication connections.

Growing and prospering in the New Economy also requires the right 
""software"" - in this case, the skills and knowledge of young people.  As a 
result of an undue reliance on property taxes, many rural school districts 
experience gross inequities.  The state can become a much better partner by 
overhauling its antiquated K-12 public school funding system.  While money 
alone will not solve educational problems, neither will a lack of resources.

Innovative private-public partnerships like PowerUP can also help.  With 
centers that have between 10 and 20 Internet-connected computers, PowerUP 
provides practical training to young people by getting technology into 
schools, community centers and other organizations.  The sites are open and 
welcoming, as well as safe places for young people to spend time.  Staff 
encourage students to work together, and computers are placed so that 
supervisors can see what is on each person's monitor at all times.

Among PowerUP's notable partners is the Corporation for National Service's 
AmeriCorps program, which provides young volunteers who, in exchange for 
help with college tuition, go into communities to set up and help manage 
the computer centers.  As non-technical users and innovators, these 
""Digital Brigades"" help train local students while implementing 
technology-based projects that improve and help the community.

Colorado state and local governments should partner with the private sector 
and provide matching funds to spur development of rural technology 
centers.  The State of Florida has taken that approach, leveraging a 
relatively modest $500,000 investment and creating 25 computer lab sites 
across the state.

Universities and community colleges can strengthen the competitiveness of 
rural firms by analyzing the specific needs of local economies and offering 
consulting services on technology and processes.  Public matching funds for 
joint university-private sector research can be tied to new product 
development.

Nonprofit corporations, which share technological innovations and identify 
new product and process opportunities, should be organized.  New technology 
clearinghouses can provide data on new patents and ideas relevant to local 
industries.

Forming innovative alliances  - as well as leveraging private/public sector 
funding, leadership, and volunteers - can effectively meet rural Colorado's 
economic challenges.  We have no time to waste.

**CONNECTING TO RURAL COLORADO**

To develop a progressive majority coalition, Colorado Democrats must do 
much in better in rural regions of the state.  Republicans control almost 
75 percent of county commissions and Democrats send a very small handful of 
rural legislators to the State House.  In the last presidential election, 
Vice President Al Gore lost the rural vote by 20 points.

State Democrats at all levels of government can close this gap by closely 
examining Mark Warner's gubernatorial victory last month in Virginia.  His 
statewide message - improvements in education and the quality of life would 
bring ""knowledge jobs"" to all parts of the state - proved decisive.

Just as important, Warner embraced mainstream, values-based positions on 
cultural issues, realizing that tone matters as well as substance.  Our 
party can speak about tough issues like gun control and gay rights without 
implying that no decent and reasonable person can have a different 
view.  Voters who feel marginalized, even demonized, by hard-left rhetoric 
will almost certainly retaliate.

For many rural voters, the role of government is in part an issue of 
values. The New Democratic stance on this issue - that government should 
equip people to solve their own problems - is sure to make significant 
inroads into the rural electorate.

**NEW WORLD, NEW WAR**

The November/December issue of Blueprint provides a roadmap on how America 
can defeat terrorism, grow the economy and ask all Americans to give 
something back.  This edition includes provocative articles by DLC national 
Chair Evan Bayh, former President Bill Clinton, Senator Joe Lieberman, and 
Senator John Kerry.  Other pieces provide insight on modernizing our 
intelligence services, strategies to defend the country from weapons of 
mass destruction, beefing up homeland defense, the crisis in the Mideast, 
reinventing NATO, why Saddam Hussein's Iraq must be the next target and more.

You can read Blueprint online by visiting www.coloradodlc.org and clicking 
on ""New World, New War.""  It is the first item under What's Up 
Nationally.  If you would like a hard copy, contact Jim Gibson at

The convention dates are now January 26-29, 2002.

I'm sending you a new confirmation from the NADA for these dates.  They are using some of the NFL money to refund 100% of the registration fees for the dealers and managers and 50% of the fees for the guests.  Of course I registered everyone before September 11; otherwise I would have registered everyone as managers!  I' m sure that's what everyone will do that registers now.  Who said ""the early bird gets the worm?""

Good afternoon, Mark.

Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you on the 15th and regale you
with the background and talents of Christian Schutz.  Just following up to
see if there are any opportunities within your offices that you would be
interested in speaking with him about.  Christian is extremely motivated to
get to Denver and asked that I follow up with you.

Thank you and best regards,

 <<Enron Blew It - 11-01.doc>>  
I just opened my Texas Monthly, only to find more Enron news.

Did you see it?  The article entitled 
""HOW ENRON BLEW IT""
Enron's Cutthroat Culture (on the cover)
Texas Monthly, November 2001 By Mimi Swartz

For Houston's sake as the Energy Capital, we hope the best for Enron as it
turns this thing around.
Attached is the article and below is the link and an excerpt.  

If you have any comments on the article, we always like to hear them.

Best, Mark

INTRO EXCERPT
The Houston-based energy giant put the pursuit of profits ahead of all other
corporate goals, which fostered a climate of workaholism and paranoia.  And
that was only part of the problem.  (from the table of contents).

Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything:
money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the
most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, Wall Street is
bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?

During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Regards,
Ken Lay "

I know this could be much more thorough, but I just wanted to shoot it out 
to you asap.  If you need any more detail on the previous job duties that I 
had, just let me know and I can revise and buff it up for you.  Thanks

We will but choose the words you use very carefully with regards to what those may be.... LC's, cash are difficult. Basically the most that they are ever exposed to us for is 55 days of gas... and very little mark to market valuations.

I have changed the dates and prices in these agreements, but those
should be the only changes necessary.  Let me know if either of you
see
any other changes that are necessary.

Brian, let's get together this afternoon and see if we can organize
our
other capacity release transactions that need to be completed by
December 1.  Does 3:00 your time work?

Mark,

I'm mailing you some newspaper clippings from the Houston 
Chronicle.  We spent the night in Houston Saturday night.

We went to Chad Denman's wedding there in the Woodlands.

Still living in the apartment, trying to decide what to do with the house
(repair or rebuild). Things continue to deteriorate with Nadine. Between you
and me I doubt if we'll make it to our 20th anniversary unless it's for
Meaghan's sake.
 
How's your clan? Girls driving you nuts?
 
What's your take on what you'll do with the merger or is it too soon to
call?
 
Take care, Murph.

                                       For a perfect mix of performance, sound and looks in a cat back exhaust system, this is it. Corsa's patented Power Pulse RSCTM (Reflective Sound Cancellation) technology uses sound waves to enhance the throaty LS1 power pulses and eliminate exhaust drone and interior resonance. The Touring Edition provides a crisp, exotic car sound with a whisper quiet cruise note. The Pace Car Edition has a broader, more aggressive tone at full throttle.  Exhaust systems are hand built of 316L stainless steel and feature a 2 1/2 straight through muffler design to increase flow 45% over the stock system.

Along with FREE SHIPPING, Zip Products has some great November specials on Corsa Exhaust Systems and Cross-Over Pipes.

Chris--

Could you find out if Patina has performed a gas analysis on the zone to be completed at your new well.  If/when you receive a gas analysis, our operations guys like to review this data for all new interconnects (obviously, this information is kept confidential).

Thanks.

All of our producers have cut us off, and I hate to try and get them in a deal with us because I don't know if they will get paid.  I would talk to Lee at BR, I know he is under water with the Canadian Hunter acquisition.  You would be a major star at Hanover, any interest?  I think I would talk to Kinder Morgan.  They have a lot of projects on the books, as well as Calpine.  They really need gas help.

Hope all is well with you guys in Denver.  
I  hope you are able to continue to make deals and are not caught up in the unbelievable craziness here in Houston.  
I was looking for companies to approach about employment and Burlington Resources name came up.  I assume Lee Hanse is still with them. I was going to send him an e-mail with my resume.  Any thoughts about BR.

Dear Mr. Whitt,

It is a pleasure to announce our ninth annual Aspen Clean Energy Roundtable.  In keeping with our continual renewal of spirit and enthusiasm, we are holding this event in spring 2002.  This will be our first ski-season Roundtable!

ASPEN CLEAN ENERGY ROUNDTABLE IX
The Aspen Meadows Resort, March 21-23, 2002

- THURS, March 21:  Travel to Aspen; evening registration & reception
- FRI, March 22:  Roundtable sessions & discussions, gala dinner
- SAT, March 23:  Morning Roundtable sessions; optional afternoon discussion
- SUN, March 24:  Departures

We are excited to meet in early spring in Colorado, and hope these dates work for you.  A preliminary program will be posted on our website next week.

The Aspen Clean Energy Roundtable was created in 1994 to discuss investment in clean and sustaining energy and transportation technology solutions.  These include hybrid & electric automobiles, microturbines, fuel cells, hydrogen production & storage, batteries, and distributed energy systems.

Energy security will again be a key component of this year?s discussion, which will include policy and investment implications for oil, gas, coal, nuclear, and renewable energy.  Innovative technologies will again be highlighted.

The Aspen Meadows will be an ideal venue for this year?s Roundtable (please note this event is not connected with the Aspen Institute). Participation is strictly limited to 100 senior executives.  All sessions are ""off the record"" in order to facilitate an open dialogue.

Spouses are welcome!  There will be ample skiing opportunities before and after the Roundtable.

I am also pleased to share that we will soon open our new office in Denver, Colorado.  Our new phone and fax details will be provided shortly; in the meantime, please contact me via my email address.

We hope you can join us in Aspen in March!

Yours truly,

Andrew

I've updated the spreadsheet to show the payables totals for the existing and proposed deals as Jan 25, 2002 and July 25, 2002, respectively.  I have also modified the payables calculation to consider only 2002 prices, as this is the applicable period for our exercise.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under ""SEC Filings.""

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=

I received this email from Karen Taylor at Duke Field Services.  I have been working with her on gathering deals whereby ENA could purchase 3rd party gas on the Jonah Gas Gathering system.  As you can see, a numerber of our larger trading counterparties are not willing to trade with us, but are unwiling to tell us directly.  I hope this is a short term problem, as most of the larger counterparties account for the majority of our transactions.  I've included the second part of the email to show you both that I am willing to extend myself in whatever manner to bring value to the once mighty Enron.

PS  I haven't been able to close any deals with Karen, but I feel that I am very close!

Energy legislation that is helpful to our industry still has a chance of be=

contacting members of congress to voice your support for H.R. 4.  Read Belo=

Although energy legislation appeared dead in this session of congress, Cong=

I am trying to get an electronic version of the communication which was fax=

I thought you might appreciate the following article in Energyfax.  Read Ken Lay - Honest Man.  Apparently overstating earnings and misstating financials for years while at the same time exercising options and making yourself over $100 million is a sign of virtue.

Subject: RE: Stock Options after merger


Tyrell,

The following is the information that we have been provided thus far
regarding your questions below.  If the merger between Enron and Dynegy
closes, all terms and provisions of the option awards before the close are
preserved through and after the close except:

(1) number of options in Dynegy will be number of Enron options before the
merger times the merger ration of .2685

(2) the strike price for Dynegy options will be the strike price of Enron
options before the merger divided by the merger ration of .2685

The proposed transaction is considered an ""approved"" change in control for
purposes of the Enron Corp. stock plans.

I hope this helps with some of the questions.  If you have further questions
that I have not answered I would refer you back to Enron for clarification.

What happens to the Enron options after the merger?
Are all options vested upon completion of the merger?
What happens to the number of options and the strike price, given the
ratio of 1 share of ENA = .2685 share of DYN?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband wants a threesome with my best friend and me.


A: Obviously your husband cannot get enough of you! Knowing that there is
only one of you he can only settle for the next best thing - your best
friend. Far from being an issue, this can bring you closer together. Why
not get some of your old college roommates involved too? If you arestill
apprehensive, maybe you should let him be with your friends without you.
If you're still not sure then just perform oral on him and cook him a nice
meal while you think about it.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband continually asks me to perform oral sex on him.


A: Do it... Sperm can help you loose weight and gives a great glow to your
skin. Interestingly, men know this. His offer to allow you to perform oral
sex on him is totally selfless. This shows he loves you. The best thing to
do is to thank him by performing it twice a day. Then cook him a nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband has too many nights out with the boys.


A: This is perfectly natural behavior and it should be encouraged. The man
is a hunter and he needs to prove his prowess with other men. A night out
chasing young single girls is a great stress relief and can foster a more
peaceful and relaxing home. Remember, nothing can rekindle your
relationship better than the man being away for a day or two (it's a great
time to clean the house too)! Just look at how emotional and happy he is
when he returns to his stable home. The best thing to do when he gets home
is for you and your best friend to perform oral on him. Then cook him a
nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband doesn't know where my clitoris is.


A: Your clitoris is of no concern to your husband. If you must mess with
it, do it in your own time or ask your best friend to help. You may wish to
videotape yourself while doing this, and present it to your husband as a
birthday gift. To ease your selfish guilt, perform oral sex on him and coo
him a delicious meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband is uninterested in foreplay.


A: You are a bad person for bringing it up and should seek sensitivity
training. Foreplay to a man is very stressful and time consuming. Sex
should be available to your husband on demand with no pesky requests for
foreplay.  What this means is that you do not love your man as much as you
should he should never have to work to get you in the mood. Stop being so
selfish!Perhaps you can make it up to him by performing oral sex on him and
cook him a nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband always has an orgasm then rolls over and goes to sleep never
giving me one.


A: I'm not sure I understand the problem. Perhaps you've forgotten to cook
him a nice meal.

This is a great site to visit but be SURE and control your volume and your
screen.  It takes a little while to download but the song/video is not long
at all.  (If you don't feel good about listening to the song in your office,
I encourage you to check out the site at another location - but check it
out!)

should he should never have to work to get you in the mood. Stop being so
selfish!Perhaps you can make it up to him by performing oral sex on him and
cook him a nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband always has an orgasm then rolls over and goes to sleep never
giving me one.


A: I'm not sure I understand the problem. Perhaps you've forgotten to cook
him a nice meal.

Hi Mark,

How was your trip this weekend?  Happy Anniversary!  Did you get a chance to 
check into the Montaneros Lodge?  What did you think.

Thanks,

Jeanie, as I read this e-mail i cringe at the thought that we have been dancing around this issue for  4 months yet all around us we will be laying off some very good employees who really deserve to be here, and more importantly, want to be here.

Plenty of time has been given to this issue..... please fix as soon as possible. Do you need anything from me?

As a follow up to the written warning on August 14, 2001 to Heidi Dubose regarding her poor job performance I would like to submit the following commentary:

Heidi's phone coverage is still very inadequate.  I have had two discussions with her in the last 2 weeks regarding this.  She consistently does not take messages properly.  Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding.  When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time.  She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled.

The kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty.  She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them.  If she does it is after they have been in there for days.

We continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs.


In summary, Heidi's performance has improved some since August 14 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis.  She has not elevated her performance to the level which is required to manage the office.

Mark, for right now, I would not suggest we pursue any external hires. We are going to see  a lot of internal staff from different business groups looking for work.

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

This morning, WIC requested authorization from the FERC to place the
Medicine Bow Loop project (pipeline and compression) into service.  We
requested and anticipate approval next week, and assuming that approval, the
project will  be placed in service late next week.  Under the terms of your
Medicine Bow Loop contracts, the reservation rates and your initial first
month MDQ's will become effective December 1, 2001.  I will update you on
any developments and notify you when we have received and accepted the
approval requested above.

For Medicine Bow Lateral Shippers, your MDQ's will proceed as set forth in
your contracts, and you will see a reduction in your rate for November to
12.6 cents per dth (to reflect total MDQ's exceeding 350 Mdth/day) and for
December to 12.0 cents per dth (to reflect the Medicine Bow Loop
in-service).

Please call me if you have any questions.     

Laine Lobban

As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  

I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, ""it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new."" 


Paul

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter."

The PGA Tour Championship will be held at the Champions Golf Club on October 29 - November 4, 2001.  This year, EES and EWS have joined together to provide a unique customer entertainment option at this event.  Instead of the normal hospitality tent at the course, we have obtained a house that overlooks the 18th fairway and 17th tee box.  Food, beverages and shuttle service will be provided daily.  Due to security issues, no personal cars will be allowed to park at the house.  Attached is the preliminary program agenda and shuttle service information.

EWS has access to 25 tickets daily.  

To order tickets, please send an E-Mail Request to Laura Pena including the following information:
Name, title and location of requestor
Company name		
Department name
Number of tickets
(No charge will be allocated to individual cost centers)

>  >> Dear Mr. Abby:

>  >> your best
>  >> friend to help. You may wish to videotape yourself

<br>

<br>
Zip Products has teamed up with CorvetteMagazine.com for an in-depth article on how to rebuild your 84-87 Corvette headlight motors.  Tech writer Justin Abbott has completely disassembled his 1986 Corvette headlight motor and replaced the original stripped gears with a new set of bronze headlight gears.  Follow along, getting rid of that wink is not that hard.

Do you have a list of Enron people who received a total of $55MM in bonus two days prior to the bankruptcy filing?

Hope you were one of 'em.  Probably only Bear Paw people got any money over here...you know, our ""Stars"".

All of our producers have cut us off, and I hate to try and get them in a deal with us because I don't know if they will get paid.  I would talk to Lee at BR, I know he is under water with the Canadian Hunter acquisition.  You would be a major star at Hanover, any interest?  I think I would talk to Kinder Morgan.  They have a lot of projects on the books, as well as Calpine.  They really need gas help.

Good Luck and stay in touch.

Mark,
Mark,
Hope all is well with you guys in Denver.  
I  hope you are able to continue to make deals and are not caught up in the unbelievable craziness here in Houston.  
I was looking for companies to approach about employment and Burlington Resources name came up.  I assume Lee Hanse is still with them. I was going to send him an e-mail with my resume.  Any thoughts about BR.
Thanks,
Andy    "

I spoke with Jill at the agency, and I will either meet with her later this 
afternoon or tomorrow morning.  She basically just needs some paperwork on 
me and I am then able to start working for you as soon as you'll have me.  
When would you like me to begin?  This week...Thurs?  Just let me know what 
you'd prefer and I'll be there...with bells on!

Oh...the agony!  Besides the afro, what else have you picked up for your

with your orange or light blue, polyester bell bottoms.  (these MUST fit 
quite snug)  Not to mention a very hip large collar disco shirt.  The girls 
will be squealing with delight.

I'm very happy that we will continue to become better friends and I can't

on the same ground rules.  I'm sending big wet kisses your way...LOOK OUT! -

Mark, attached is a file regarding what the payment structures could look like. The plug is the total PV $'s that we will put towards the equation... other than that it is simply a demand charge calculation.

Pls coordinate and let me know.

Mark,

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

I plan to continue my normal schedule of working 6am to 4pm which coincides with noramal Houston hours, covers spot gas trading, covers spot power trading and overlaps with most of my customers hours in the west.  When necessary I will come in early or stay late.  Please let me know if there are any issues there.

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

These are draft versions of the interruptible purchase agreement and confirm for your gas into Fort Union.  Think about what you what to do for term, volume etc.  We will then add in the gathering charges.  We are pretty flexible, so let me know what works for Patina.

Thanks,

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

Subject:	CIG's Raton Basin 2002 Expansion Project

Hello Paul and Mark.  FYI:  CIG proposes to construct and operate facilities necessary to transport additional volumes of approximately 55 MDth per day of natural gas out of the Raton Basin Area in Colorado and New Mexico.  

The total cost of the project is $26,896,800  with a proposed rolled-in treatment for the expansion out of the Raton Basin Area.

Question - Do you all have any issues that you want us to address in regards to the expansion or will a plain vanilla intervention be fine?  The intervention is due Nov. 5th.

If you could get to me between now and the early part of next week, that would be great.

We are going to do a month to month interupptible purchase agreement with Patina Oil and Gas.  The gas will be delivered into Lost Creek.  The price will be Gas Daily Cig Midpoint index flat.  The flows will vary daily depending upon well production.  I am not sure if we have an interruptible purchase agreement with Kennedyl

The convention dates are now January 26-29, 2002.
 
I'm sending you a new confirmation from the NADA for these dates.  They are using some of the NFL money to refund 100% of the registration fees for the dealers and managers and 50% of the fees for the guests.  Of course I registered everyone before September 11; otherwise I would have registered everyone as managers!  I' m sure that's what everyone will do that registers now.

Subject:	Income Tax Issue

Hello Penny,

It was nice meeting you and your associates yesterday.  I presented the income tax issue that we discussed to some of our accountants and they see things a little differently.  It is our opinion, that since a cash payment would be offset by the demand charge obligations associated with the capacity contract, it is not income per se, but rather funds dedicated to meeting an out-of-the-money contract obligation.  Depending on your accounting method, that money would probably be amortized over the term of the contract.  Let me know what you think, perhaps we should have our accountants talk.

As for adjusting the cash amount after the San Juan/Permian allocation issue is settled (I'm not sure you could hear all that at your end of the table) we are not really interested in any type of post assignment ""true-ups"".   But we are willing to talk about what those allocation percentages should be.

Regarding next steps, on Monday I will provide you with some ""alternative"" forms of payment and some ways we might spread the payments out0.  After that we will look to you guys for your preferred deal structure and payment terms.  I'll follow up this email with a phone call today.

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

Didn't want to inflame him as he masterminded the whole thing. When he made
the comments about a pay cut to work at Western, he wasn't talking about
salary and bonus and normal such things.  He was talking about the Enron
management investment gain scheme for which they reaped millions.  Hell, he
and Luce and other employees at Enron probably made a killing shorting the
stock from 80 to 30.

> Among junk credits, 93 issuers were downgraded--versus only 19

> 
> Recently, Moody's reported a third-quarter surge in junk defaults. The

I can show you what the difference is between Cheyenne Hub daily prices and CIG first of the month index prices, but that is kind of like apples and oranges.  To clarify, you do not have to buy on Enron Online (EOL), we can quote you physical prices over the phone and you can use EOL for price discovery.  You do not have to decide that now.  My recommendation is the attached:


Major changes are:

Volume - 20,000 mmbtu/d
Price - Gas Daily Cheyenne Midpoint plus $.05
Demand Charge- $6,000 per month

In addition. Enron will provide market based pricing for additional volumes above 20,000 mmbtu

All of this is of course subject to negotiation of the appropriate contracts and Enron's review of the PSCo transportation contract.

Let me know what you think.

Mark - do you have historical information on the average price of gas sold
on enrononline vs the cig index.   This information would be helpful for us
in determining how much volume we would want to utilize on the enrononline
pricing.

In all cases except for Hallwood, ENA Denver has a relationship with these customers that primarily covers their physical business, we would like to expand that business to cover their Derivative business as well.  The list is based on priority.  We would be willing to cover them for their West Gas business only.  Fred could continue to cover their East, Central and Oil/Liquids business.

Mark,
	Business Controls, which includes Corporate Security at Enron Corp, would like to conduct a security survey of Enron's offices in Denver.  I am tentatively planning on travel to Denver 10/18-10/19.  If I could impose on you to provide some information about the office it would help greatly in my planning.
	In particular, could you briefly describe the office(s); location, which floor, how large, how many employees, and any other Enron subsidiaries or offices in Denver.  Additionally, would you be my point of contact, or can you designate someone?  Lastly, if the above dates do not work for you, please feel free to suggest alternates.  Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.

Eric,

This spreadsheet summarizes the pricing terms for the proposed Kennedy Oil transaction that we discussed earlier.

 
Also, attached in the e-mail below, I have included a ""Discussion Document"" that Mark and Pual put together for the purpose of discussions with Kennedy.  It provides more specifics on the pricing and volume allocation, if you desire.

Based on my calculations, the 10,000/d priced at NYMEX minus $0.62 is roughly $300,000 in the money and the 5,000/d priced at NGPL MidCon minus $0.47 is roughly $500,000 in the money.

I will be out next week, but Mark and Paul will keep you posted as to the expected close date and any changes in the deal terms.  Please give me a call today if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tyrell

sometimes things really suck out loud, don't they?  I still plan on coming 
into the office tomorrow.  Like I said, maybe we just need to ride it out 
and things will be fine...and we'll all live happily ever after!  (keeping 
my finger and legs crossed)  Still feel like going out on Friday?  Maybe we 
should do it downtown somewhere.  Comedy works first then dancing?  Keep

Attached are the latest based on our discussions.  I couldn't redline the Capacity Release Agreement, so I am only sending a clean version.  I would still make a general caveat, that we still need to do a final review of the gathering agreement.  This could add to the Transaction Agreement.

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

This morning we received FERC approval for the fourth tie-in segment (to
gate #7) contracted  for  92 Mdth/day.  This brings the firm capacity of the
Medicine Bow system to 472 Mdth/day.  The contract effective date will be
October 19, but you will be able to utilize this capacity as soon as we have
it set up in the system today.  

Please call me if you have any questions.

Subject: 2002 Governor's race


MArk--I put out a couple of calls to find on the 2002 Governors race in Wyoming, and the feedback I got was similiar to what we talked about.....there has not been a clear candidate yet, and Joe Meyers name is one of three possible Republican contestants. (the other two that are being talked about are Eli Bebout and Ray Hupkins--don't know if I got my spelling right on these boys!).  Apparently there was alot of discussion about the current US Senator, Craig Thomas, wanting to run and so everybody was pretty much waiting until he made up his mind before jumping into the race.  My understanding is that Thomas did make up his mind about 2 weeks ago to stay in the Senate, so your Mr. Meyers may very well be strongly considering a run."

Eric,

This spreadsheet summarizes the pricing terms for the proposed Kennedy Oil transaction that we discussed earlier.

 
Also, attached in the e-mail below, I have included a ""Discussion Document"" that Mark and Pual put together for the purpose of discussions with Kennedy.  It provides more specifics on the pricing and volume allocation, if you desire.

Based on my calculations, the 10,000/d priced at NYMEX minus $0.62 is roughly $300,000 in the money and the 5,000/d priced at NGPL MidCon minus $0.47 is roughly $500,000 in the money.

I will be out next week, but Mark and Paul will keep you posted as to the expected close date and any changes in the deal terms.  Please give me a call today if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tyrell

He weighed 8.8 out of the box (I will never admit to saying that).  He then lost back to 7.2 while in ICU but is back on track to 9.2 after three weeks.  He may have a chance.  Lance, the middle man, is one bad mother fro!!!  He takes Luke tot he mat daily just fro sport.  I'm going to have to let Luke defend himself soon - currently we have been telling him he can't hit Lance, but Lance pushes him on a daily basis - must have gotten that from his mother!!

Subject: 



To My Dear Wife: 
During the past year I have tried to make love to you 365 times. I have succeeded 36 times, which is an average of once every ten days. The following is a list of why I did not succeed more often: 

54 times the sheets were clean 
17 times it was too late 
49 times you were too tired 
20 times it was too hot 
15 times you pretended to be asleep 
22 times you had a headache 
17 times you were afraid of waking the baby 
16 times you said you were too sore 
12 times it was the wrong time of the month 
19 times you had to get up early 
9 times you said weren't in the mood 
7 times you were sunburned 
6 times you were watching the late show 
5 times you didn't want to mess up your new hairdo 
3 times you said the neighbors would hear us 
9 times you said your mother would hear us 
Of the 36 times I did succeed, the activity was not satisfactory because: 

6 times you just laid there 
8 times you reminded me there's a crack in the ceiling 
4 times you told me to hurry up and get it over with 
7 times I had to wake you and tell you I finished 
1 time I was afraid I had hurt you because I felt you move 




To My Dear Husband: 
I think you have things a little confused. Here are the reasons you didn't get more than you did: 
5 times you came home drunk and tried to screw the cat 
36 times you did not come home at all 
21 times you didn't cum 
33 times you came too soon 
19 times you went soft before you got in 
38 times you worked too late 
10 times you got cramps in your toes 
29 times you had to get up early to play golf 
2 times you were in a fight and someone kicked you 
    in the balls 
4 times you got it stuck in your zipper 
3 times you had a cold and your nose was running 
2 times you had ! ! a splinter in your finger 
20 times you lost the notion after thinking about it all day 
6 times you came in your pajamas while reading a dirty book 
98 times you were too busy watching football, baseball, etc. on TV 

Of the times we did get together: 
The reason I laid still was because you missed and were screwing the sheets. 
I wasn't talking about the crack in the ceiling, what I said was, ""Would you prefer me on my back or kneeling?"" 
The time you felt me move was because you farted and I was trying to breathe. 

Once you read this letter you have to keep it going. 
This game has been played since 1996. 
You must send this letter to 7 people. 
On the 5th day someone will ask you out or say ""I love you."" 
This is not a joke.  It has worked for many years. 
If you break the chain, you will have bad luck with guys/girls 
forever. 
This is just for future readers. 
This began in 1996, not much of a past, but it works. 
So here are the rules: 
*If you read this on a Sunday, wish for a really fun week 
*If you read this on a Monday, wish for money 
*If you read this on a Tuesday, wish for love 
*If you read this on a Wednesday, wish for success 
*If you read this on a Thursday, wish for anything you want 
*If you read this on a Friday, wish for a really hot date 
*If you read this on a Saturday, wish for an important phone call 
Send this to seven people (after you make a wish). 
Make sure it is sent as soon as you read it or your wish won't come true. "

I have been sick all week so it has limited my drinking ability.  Plan on getting lit tonight.  Industry response has been great towards us personally and we have quite a few options.  It is possible that on Monday you will see an announcement on a sale of the trading company, or at least it's employment contracts.  I will let you know what happens.

He weighed 8.8 out of the box (I will never admit to saying that).  He then lost back to 7.2 while in ICU but is back on track to 9.2 after three weeks.  He may have a chance.  Lance, the middle man, is one bad mother fro!!!  He takes Luke tot he mat daily just fro sport.  I'm going to have to let Luke defend himself soon - currently we have been telling him he can't hit Lance, but Lance pushes him on a daily basis - must have gotten that from his mother!!

That is what I love about you that you will do just about anything three or four times! 

I love you so much and thanks for the nookie this morning.  You know all my health books say that it is really good to have sex/orgasms twice a week during the cold/flu season because it helps to strengthen the immune system.  This sounds dorky but maybe we should set lovemaking dates everyweek and just stick to it!

Dave,

Just wanted to clarify what kind of deadline your aiming for with this
transport proposal.  The reason I am asking is I have taken this to the next
level and we will probably need several days to run through our internal
processes.  I know you are working with multiple parties so if you let me
know how you would like to proceed then we can be working on a similar
timeline.

Hey Penny,

One more thought on the EPNG capacity valuation we've been discussing...
physical gas in the San Juan is selling at a discount to index,
therefore we are incorporating that into our valuation.  I thought you
might want to consider that as well. 

Thanks,

This is worth considering. Let's all be careful! 


Hi All - 

I think you all know that I don't send out hoaxes and don't do the 
reactionary thing and send out just anything that crosses my path.  This one, 
however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough credibility in my 
mind that I'm writing it up and sending it out to all of you. 

My friend's friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a month ago. 
She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up. She was understandably 
upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied. 

On 9/10, she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished 
he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it had to be like 
that. The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get on any 
commercial airlines on 9/11 and to not to go any malls on Halloween. As 
soon as everything happened on the 11th, she called the FBI and has since 
turned over the letter. 

This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on.  This came 
from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last night. 

I may be wrong, and I hope I am. However, with one of his warnings being 
correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the second 
and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same information 
that I did.

Further to our conversation please find attached the curves on the JM Huber transaction that we have agreed to work off of. The 30,000/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with HUBER is effectively completed. In the event that this deal does not close, then the West desk will resume with the same MTM risks that you presently have.  

Any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk... plus ENA Orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals. 

In addition to the transportation income being generated, additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks. I believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book ( by Mark Whitt ) and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly.

I trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and I am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone..

Pls review file and if there are any questions give me a call.

BT

Theresa Staab and I would like to come to Houston on Monday and spend some time with you and Jason on Tuesday.  We need to discuss some specifics on the purchase proposal such as how you want each netback to be determined, logistics and documentation.

Let me know what time would work for you on Tuesday.  We probably need a fair amount of time.

Tyrell and I are working on a monetization structure for your gathering system.  Can you tell me if the Oil and Gas Division was able to keep the gains associated with the rollout of the hedges?  We think we might have a structure worth looking at.

P.S. Dan and I would like to call you on Friday in regards to the Ft Union capacity.  Some time in the afternoon."

Brian, After talking to our legal department it seems that in order to effectuate the wellhead purchase we will need assignment of the Williams contract instead of being agent.  This is important because we will have title to the gas at Durango.  Therefore we need to have the contract assigned to us.  Can you talk to Williams ASAP and see if that is a problem?

Thanks

      Sometimes I think I moved to the sleepiest town in Colorado. Everytime I tell someone where I live they say ""Superior? Where's That?"" 
My favorite Italian Restaurant is in Broomfield, Original Pizza on Midway. Have you been there? 
Yeah lets meet. A drive around the city sounds great and a drink always  helps. 
Wait, How do I know your not the freakish type that might try and take advantage of me. After all, you know this city better than I do. Humm, This Could be Trouble. 
Why don't you give me a call and I can try to size you up on the phone.

Please find the attached draft version of our proposed gas supply structure.  We have focused on minimizing your fixed charges while still giving you the right to call on up to 30,000 mmbtu/d of Firm Cheyenne supplies.  In addition, Enron will manage your transportation and imbalances associated with your PSCO transportation contracts.  Obviously we will need to see those contracts prior to finalizing this transaction in order to assure we can meet those obligations.  In addition, I am sure we will need to ""tweak"" this proposal to meet you physical requirements (volumes, terms etc.)  Please give me a call once you have had a chance to review the attached.

FYI.  Appears that the two sides may be crawling toward renegotiation. 

Best,

Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01 
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 

This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 

In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 

Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 

But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 

As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 

Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 

Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 

Duress alleged 
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 

""We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically,"" said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. ""We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal."" 

Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 

Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 

""The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts,"" Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 

""Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts,"" Shames said. 

Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 

Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 

He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
""To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster,"" said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. ""There were other means to manage the emergency."" 

The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
""First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms,"" said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.

Willingness to deal 
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 

The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are ""just and reasonable."" FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 

Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 

For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
""In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so,"" said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. ""We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone."" 

Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 

Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
""The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market,"" said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 

The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 

Sempra says contract fair 
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 

San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 

Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 

""It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' "" Niggli said. 
But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 

White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
""There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to,"" White said. ""The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 

""But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?"" 
***************************************************************** 
State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
OC Register, 10.07.01 
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 

Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 

The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 

Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 

""We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 

A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 

In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 

Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. ""The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. 

Said Freeman: ""We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks."" 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 

Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 

The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called ""peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 

The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 

Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 

""I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 

Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 

Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 

Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 

""I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 

The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 

The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
""It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But ""it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 

Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 

Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
""The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. ""Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''"

Timely note, and once again I am already hard at work prospecting for you up here.
They are getting ready to drill CBM this fall. I've been meeting with them on this and actually set them up to do a deal with ATS on production/revenue/lease acctg in the US (next mtg Oct 9 in Calgary).  I gave them a presentation a few weeks ago on the general things we and ATS can do for them in Denver/Dallas.  I want to send them something more specific about all we can do in the Rockies on the gas mktg side.  I'll also build in some data on Hanover for them so will draw that from Producer One.
Can I get some general slides about all the good things Mark and the gang do in Denver.
Timing is next few days.  I'd like to get this to them by sometime Friday if possible (not the end of the world if it's early next week). 
Thanks.

Subject:	Mourning the Loss of a special man

I am so sorry about Jack.  It is very difficult for me to accept that he is gone.  He was a very special man to me as I was growing up.  Jack was as much like an Uncle to me as any of my blood relatives.  He always represented the pillar of strength while still being able to to be one of the most loving and compassionate people I have ever known.  To me Jack was everything a man was supposed to be.  

It always made me proud to talk to Jack about my football games and later on the oil and gas business.  It was neat that in a way I was following a similiar path in life to the one that Jack had taken.  And when my daughter was born I began to see how he must of felt about his three wonderful daughters, who I still consider to be like sisters to me.  I was so excited when Little Jack was born this year because I knew how proud and excited he must have been to finally have his boy.  I hope someday I have the opportunity to tell him what a special man his Grandpa was. 

The thing I always will remember about Jack was that when he walked into a room, he filled it up, not because of his size, but because of his enormous personality and lust for life.  He could always put a smile on your face. The world has lost a very special man.

I know this is hard for you and the girls.  It is hard for me to write this without breaking up. I Love you guys and wish I was there with you.

I am so sorry about Jack.  It is very difficult for me to accept that he is gone.  He was a very special man to me as I was growing up.  Jack was as much like an Uncle to me as any of my blood relatives.  He always represented the pillar of strength while still being able to to be one of the most loving and compassionate people I have ever known.  To me Jack was everything a man was supposed to be.  

It always made me proud to talk to Jack about my football games and later on the oil and gas business.  It was neat that in a way I was following a similiar path in life to the one that Jack had taken.  And when my daughter was born I began to see how he must of felt about his three wonderful daughters, who I still consider to be like sisters to me.  I was so excited when Little Jack was born this year because I knew how proud and excited he must have been to finally have his boy.  I hope someday I have the opportunity to tell him what a special man his Grandpa was. 

The thing I always will remember about Jack was that when he walked into a room, he filled it up, not because of his size, but because of his enormous personality and lust for life.  He could always put a smile on your face. The world has lost a very special man.

WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN

Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.

The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application (CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction by the following April.

Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as ""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""

Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""

To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.

""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months."" With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.

The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub."

We are probably more interested in people who have more experience in the Western U.S.  Preferably direct producer relationships and Rocky Mountain Utilities and Industrials.  We don't do any trading in the Denver office.

Thanks for coming to Denver for the meeting.  I know it seems like a longshot but if it happens I think we have an excellent shot at being involved in some respect.

Thanks again.

WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN

Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.

The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application (CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction by the following April.

Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as ""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""

Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""

To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.

""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months."" With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.

The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub."

Mark, Brian,
The US based Producers that are taking over Canadian Producers are moving alot of hedging control back to the US.  I want to make sure that we up here are passing on information to you and vice versa about plans to hedge.  In the case of the Devon hedge, it was fairly well publicised that they had to do something to hedge the Anderson purchase, but there are other cases where we might get some news and need to pass it on for coverage down south.
Should it be you two we contact?

We specfically need to think some about coordinating on companies like Apache, Hunt, Devon, Burlington, Murphy.

Did we get any of the Devon volume in Houston?  It was alot of gas.    "

I had not heard that there was a discussion today. However, since we ran the economics for Huber and discovered that Enron's books do not appropriately value the Permian capacity, we have been trying to convince BP that the value of the capacity is greater than the basis spread becase of the optionality associated with the variable costs of fuel and commodity.  We used to have a model that the transport group used to use to value that optionality based upon the volatility of the basis spreads and the variable costs.  Steph and Phil are running numbers to determine Enron's ""extrinsic value"".  We need to discuss how and what information we share with BP in order to convince them that the capacity is worth more than the value than that the  outright basis markets .

We usually see mostly regional basis deals out of our office.  Especially with the bigger guys.  We do some Nymex trades for our smaller producers.  It seems the big guys use their banks for most of their  basis.  Thanks for the info.

Decision and physical/financial hedging are all done in the US and with ""US types"".
They might allow the Cdns to do the odd Aeco basis deal.

Hey guys, new subject.
Got a call today from a cogen in the PNW lookin for AECO, Sumas and Rockies gas.  They're issuing an RFP.  I'll forward it on as soon as I get it and we'll work it together.

Are you saying that the U.S. Producers are hedging their Canadian Production with U.S. counterparties as opposed to Canadian counterparties?  Or are the decisions being made in the U.S. and executed in Canada?

Mark, Brian,
The US based Producers that are taking over Canadian Producers are moving alot of hedging control back to the US.  I want to make sure that we up here are passing on information to you and vice versa about plans to hedge.  In the case of the Devon hedge, it was fairly well publicised that they had to do something to hedge the Anderson purchase, but there are other cases where we might get some news and need to pass it on for coverage down south.
Should it be you two we contact?

We specfically need to think some about coordinating on companies like Apache, Hunt, Devon, Burlington, Murphy.

Did we get any of the Devon volume in Houston?  It was alot of gas.    "

Fascism
You have two cows.
The government takes both, hires you to take care of them and sells you the
milk.

----------

Pure Communism
You have two cows.
Your neighbours help take care of them and you all share the milk.

----------

Applied Communism
You have two cows.
You must take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.

----------

Totalitarianism
You have two cows.
The government takes them both and denies they ever existed. Milk is banned.

----------

Pure Democracy
You have two cows.
You and your neighbours decide who gets the milk.

----------

Representative Democracy
You have two cows.
Your neighbours pick someone to tell you who gets the milk.

Mexican Democracy
You have two cows.
The government takes both and drafts you into the army.


----------

European Democracy
You have two cows.
The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking apply.
If
there aren't any, they invent some. They pay you not to milk the cows.
They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down the
drain.
They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.


----------

American Democracy
The government promises to give you two cows, if you vote for it.
After the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow
futures.
The press dubs the affair ""cowgate,"" but supports the president.
The cows sue you for breach of contract.
Your legal bills exceed your annual income.
You settle out of court and declare bankruptcy.


----------


Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell one and buy a bull.
Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the
income.


----------

Enron Venture Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of
credit
opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap
with
an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax
exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are transferred
via an
intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority
shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed
company.
The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one
more.

The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.  Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.

No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.  The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.  In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.

We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.  In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.  We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information."

Subject: Medicine Bow Tie-In Capacity


Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

We received notification that the 6th segment to gate valve 5 providing a
total firm capacity of 519 Mdth/day was approved by FERC yesterday and is
available for transport.  The contract effective date for this additional
capacity will be on Monday, November 5.  We plan on filing the request for
the final segment of additional contacted capacity to gate valve 4 today or
Monday.

Based on conversations with many of you, it appears the 192 Mdth/day of
additional (572 Mdth/day total) capacity on Medicine Bow provided by this
last segment commissioning will be sufficient to accomodate your
transportation requirements until the entire project goes into service
(anticipated late this month).  For the month of October, the capacity
contracted was approximatly 90% utilized, and we anticipate even greater
utilization for November.  While a few of you have mentioned possibly having
production in excess of your contract, it appears that the remaining
shippers will have underutilized capacity and no additional capacity will be
necessary until the Loop goes in service.    

Following the last segment approval notice, I will continue to update you on
the progress and timing for the entire Loop in-service for your information
and planning. 

Please call me if you have any questions.

We have a very good relationship, and long term gas sale with Thermo Partners who manage the 270 MW Ft. Lupton facility.  They have inquired as to Enron's interest in either buying the energy, tolling or buying the entire plant.  The effective date would be July 2002.  The plant is currently under a QF contract with PSCo.

Mike, I would like to see if you have some time on Monday afternoon to discuss the particulars and we can devise a game plan to get you connected with these guys.  Let me know your availability.

Thanks

During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Regards,
Ken Lay "

I know this could be much more thorough, but I just wanted to shoot it out 
to you asap.  If you need any more detail on the previous job duties that I 
had, just let me know and I can revise and buff it up for you.  Thanks 
again, so much, for being willing to even consider me.  (I'd make a great 
parking attendant!) :) - Christina

I have changed the dates and prices in these agreements, but those should be the only changes necessary.  Let me know if either of you see any other changes that are necessary.

Brian, let's get together this afternoon and see if we can organize our other capacity release transactions that need to be completed by December 1.  Does 3:00 your time work?

I've been giving this some thought for the past few weeks actually, trying 
to figure out how I'd manage as a working mom.  Been there, done that, 
although not with 3 kids, but it's definitely manageable.  Fortunately, 
Brigette is old enough to manage for a few hours after school with the kids, 
until I get home.  My issues would be finding something structured for 
Christian and Brianna during the summers and arranging transportation to and 
from school.  Already have some ideas and options.  It's just a matter of 
committing to one plan or another, and finding out how soon this needs to be 
arranged.  How does my resume look?  Do I need to polish it up for the ""big 
wigs"", I know it should look more professional.  Are you still thinking a 
temp. position or sending me to the other office for something more 
permanent? Still think you need me in your office though! - Christina

Having major problems with my server for some reason.  Can't stay connected. 
  9:30 sounds great.  How much time should I plan on spending down there?  
Planning to take me to lunch as well, or is this strictly a business 
meeting?  Thanks again....Christina

Thanks for the update, we will coordinate with Jason while you are out.  As you evaluate the latest proposal, I understand that Huber may have credit concerns with Enron given all the rumors that are circulating.  You know we are confident we will straighten things out soon. However, please understand that we are willing to do what is necessary to make Huber comfortable (Pre-pay, Letter of credit etc).  If you have any questions just give me a call.

We will but choose the words you use very carefully with regards to what those may be.... LC's, cash are difficult. Basically the most that they are ever exposed to us for is 55 days of gas... and very little mark to market valuations.

I have to give the Broker a tentative number on the 12th.  I will let you know what kind of count I have at that point.  I've put down $500 as a deposit and the remainder will be put on someone's card.  

As far as the cost, it's approximately $100/person, depending on how much we drink.  I can either figure a total for your group prior to the evening or wait until the final bill is determined and invoice you for the relative cost.

However you want to work it is fine with me.

The FERC notice on this project has been issued and comments are due by November 21.  Do we have any interests that would warrant more than a plain intervention?  Let me know if you want a copy of the original filing, with maps, etc.

INSIDE FERC-October 29, 2001
WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN
Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies
and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by
filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.
The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds
of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application
(CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it
asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction
by the following April.
Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open
season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins
- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline
would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of
affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as
""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced
transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""
Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams
Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America
and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central
Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""
To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the
mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding
out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to
be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo.
Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co.
(75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc.
(15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10
years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional
two years, said the application.
""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and
active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that
Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months.""
With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to
accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued,
pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand
increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to
installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter
generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to
more than double by 2004, said Williams.
The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline
Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS
would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2.
Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a
combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the
Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for
Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under
the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub."

I didn't know you were living in an apartment.  When did this happen.  What do you mean repair or rebuild?  I hate to hear about you and Nadine.  That is too bad.  Didn't she know you were a piece of shit when she married you!  I hate that these women forget that we have always been shitty.  
 
The kids are great!  Brock is finally becoming alot more fun.  He and Lauren get along really well.
 
Too hard to tell what will happen with Dynegy.  Not sure I want to work for this new regime.  I guess it all comes down to money.  As always I'm still a whore.

Still living in the apartment, trying to decide what to do with the house (repair or rebuild). Things continue to deteriorate with Nadine. Between you and me I doubt if we'll make it to our 20th anniversary unless it's for Meaghan's sake.
 
How's your clan? Girls driving you nuts?
 
What's your take on what you'll do with the merger or is it too soon to call?
 
Take care, Murph.

Wow, I didn't know that you got flooded!  That's awful.  I hate to see that you and Nadine have deteriorated to that point, but if it is over you just have to keep your head up and move on.  If it was me, I think I would start looking for one of those Russian Mail Order brides.  It will cost you a plane ticket and some braces but you won't have to buy a boob job because they all have great tits!  You can't be getting fat.  Aren't you still running?  If not you need to start.  If not for your body do it for your mind.  It is the best thing for that!

Tropical storm Allison did us in. 2 feet of water in the casa. Lost everything except some furniture. Nad's can't make up her freaking mind as to what she wants sooooo, we are moving at a ""deliberate"" pace. I've reached my ""let's make a decision"" point a long time ago. We do not like each other anymore, and fight like cats and dogs. I give her until the end of the year before she tells me to hit the road. Without Meaghan I would have been gone long ago. Know anyone who wants to have fun with an old fart? I may be fat and ugly but I have been celibate for THREE YEARS.

We are planning on joining Crestone for a combined Denver Christmas party.  The cost for our share will be approximately $1,000.  I know it is not cheap, but I think it is an important signal and morale booster which is critical at this time.  We have a long way to go in this deal."

Blueprints	$6,000
Construction	$70,000
Furniture	$3,000
Voice/Data	$4,000 	
*Commisions	$16,000

Subject:	Change of Control Provisions


As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

The only other thing would be if you wanted to add intrastates systems (like OTTCO) and then the pipes at either end of I-80 like Trailblazer, KM, PSCO, KRGT, NWP, Overthrust, and Questar.

Way too close to home!

Male Maturity

When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.

When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I
needed a
passionate girl with a zest for life.

In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything
was an emergency;
she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.

When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was
totally
predictable and
never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I
needed a girl with some
excitement.

When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her.
She
rushed from one
thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things
and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and
very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.

When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted
firmly on the
ground and married her.

She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits.

Lucci reccomends www.matchmaker.com and www.russianbrides.com.  Actually he's not sure those are right but he will get them for us.

Way too close to home!

Male Maturity

When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.

When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided
I
needed a
passionate girl with a zest for life.

In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional.
Everything
was an emergency;
she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.

When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was
totally
predictable and
never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided
that I
needed a girl with some
excitement.

When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her.
She
rushed from one
thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous
things
and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and
very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.

When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted
firmly on the
ground and married her.

She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits.

I thought that was classic.  Shamu Club.  Haven't gotten the articles yet.  Looking forward to our Vail trip to celebrate our anniverary this weekend.  Nadine comes to our house today.  When you come to our house for Xmas try to be here by Saturday afternoon.  The party that Lenny and Laurie usually have may be at our house since they are in the middle of building their house.  They are driving to Florida after xmas and want to stop and see you either on the way or on the way back.  I gave the Dad's 1-800 number.

Hi Mark~~Is Alicia a strick vegetarian?  I havent picked the menu yet, but here's what I'm thinking:
 
Filet Mignon or Filet Wellington
Some sort of fish--Trout, tuna, king salmon
Rack of Lamb or chx chardonnay
Prime rib or another type of steak
 
If any of these will work let me know.  I can choose 4 dinners.  If she is a strick vege, I will see if I can single order off of their vegetarian meal.
 
Thanks,
Kristen

I received this email from Karen Taylor at Duke Field Services.  I have been working with her on gathering deals whereby ENA could purchase 3rd party gas on the Jonah Gas Gathering system.  As you can see, a numerber of our larger trading counterparties are not willing to trade with us, but are unwiling to tell us directly.  I hope this is a short term problem, as most of the larger counterparties account for the majority of our transactions.  I've included the second part of the email to show you both that I am willing to extend myself in whatever manner to bring value to the once mighty Enron.

PS  I haven't been able to close any deals with Karen, but I feel that I am very close!

Way too close to home!

Male Maturity

When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.

When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I
needed a
passionate girl with a zest for life.

In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything
was an emergency;
she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.

When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was
totally
predictable and
never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I
needed a girl with some
excitement.

When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her.
She
rushed from one
thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things
and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and
very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.

When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted
firmly on the
ground and married her.

She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits.

Are you sending out Xmas cards.  We usually do, and we usually send a small $25 gift to our best customers (ones we make money off) and those who do operational favors for us.

There is an Enron card but it does not say Enron or we can order some.  Probably $.75 plus postage and 150 cards.  Gifts probably go to 20 customers for a cost of $500 - $600.

What do you think?

Tyrell,

The following is the information that we have been provided thus far
regarding your questions below.  If the merger between Enron and Dynegy
closes, all terms and provisions of the option awards before the close are
preserved through and after the close except:

(1) number of options in Dynegy will be number of Enron options before the
merger times the merger ration of .2685

(2) the strike price for Dynegy options will be the strike price of Enron
options before the merger divided by the merger ration of .2685

The proposed transaction is considered an ""approved"" change in control for
purposes of the Enron Corp. stock plans.

I hope this helps with some of the questions.  If you have further questions
that I have not answered I would refer you back to Enron for clarification.

Subject: Stock Options after merger


What happens to the Enron options after the merger?
Are all options vested upon completion of the merger?
What happens to the number of options and the strike price, given the
ratio of 1 share of ENA = .2685 share of DYN?

Thanks in advance for your help.

As a follow up to the written warning on August 14, 2001 to Heidi Dubose regarding her poor job performance I would like to submit the following commentary:

Heidi's phone coverage is still very inadequate.  I have had two discussions with her in the last 2 weeks regarding this.  She consistently does not take messages properly.  Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding.  When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time.  She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled.

The kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty.  She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them.  If she does it is after they have been in there for days.

We continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs.


In summary, Heidi's performance has improved some since August 14 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis.  She has not elevated her performance to the level which is required to manage the office.

As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  

I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, ""it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new.""

What is the word dudes?
 
Subject: Four Good Management Lessons!!


Lesson Number One 
***************** 
A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. 
A small rabbit saw the crow, and asked him, 
""Can I also sit like you and do nothing all daylong?"" 
The crow answered: ""Sure, why not."" 

So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested. 
All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it. 

Management Lesson: 
To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Two 
***************** 
A turkey was chatting with a bull. 
""I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,""sighed the turkey, 
""but I haven't got the energy. 
""Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?"" replied the bull. 
""They're packed with nutrients."" 

The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him 
enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree. 
The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. 
Finally after a fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. 
Soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree. 

Management Lesson: 
Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Three 
******************** 
When the body was first made, all the parts wanted to be Boss. 
The brain said, 
""I should be Boss 
    because I control the whole body's responses and functions."" 
 
The feet said, 
""We should be Boss 
    as we carry the brain about and get him to where he wants to go.
 
"" The hands said, 
""We should be the Boss 
    because we do all the work and earn all the money."" 

And so it went on and on with the heart, the lungs and the eyes.... 
 
until finally the asshole spoke up. 
 
All the parts laughed at the idea of the asshole being the Boss. 
So the asshole went on strike, 
    blocked itself up and refused to work. 

Within a short time the eyes became crossed, the hands clenched, 
the feet twitched, the heart and lungs began to panic and the brain fevered. 

Eventually they all decided that the asshole should be the Boss, 
so the motion was passed. 
 
All the other parts did all the work while the Boss just sat and passed out the shit! 

Management Lesson: 
You don't need brains to be a Boss - any asshole will do. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Four 
******************* 

A little bird was flying south for the winter. 
It was so cold, the bird froze and fell to the ground in a large field. 
While it was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on it. 
As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung,
it began to realize how warm it was. 
The dung was actually thawing him out! 
He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. 

A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. 
Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, 
and promptly dug him out and ate him! 

Management Lessons: 
1) Not everyone who drops shit on you is your enemy. 
2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend. 
3) And when you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut!

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

This morning, WIC requested authorization from the FERC to place the
Medicine Bow Loop project (pipeline and compression) into service.  We
requested and anticipate approval next week, and assuming that approval, the
project will  be placed in service late next week.  Under the terms of your
Medicine Bow Loop contracts, the reservation rates and your initial first
month MDQ's will become effective December 1, 2001.  I will update you on
any developments and notify you when we have received and accepted the
approval requested above.

For Medicine Bow Lateral Shippers, your MDQ's will proceed as set forth in
your contracts, and you will see a reduction in your rate for November to
12.6 cents per dth (to reflect total MDQ's exceeding 350 Mdth/day) and for
December to 12.0 cents per dth (to reflect the Medicine Bow Loop
in-service).

Please call me if you have any questions.     

Laine Lobban

Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband wants a threesome with my best friend and me.


A: Obviously your husband cannot get enough of you! Knowing that there is
only one of you he can only settle for the next best thing - your best
friend. Far from being an issue, this can bring you closer together. Why
not get some of your old college roommates involved too? If you arestill
apprehensive, maybe you should let him be with your friends without you.
If you're still not sure then just perform oral on him and cook him a nice
meal while you think about it.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband continually asks me to perform oral sex on him.


A: Do it... Sperm can help you loose weight and gives a great glow to your
skin. Interestingly, men know this. His offer to allow you to perform oral
sex on him is totally selfless. This shows he loves you. The best thing to
do is to thank him by performing it twice a day. Then cook him a nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband has too many nights out with the boys.


A: This is perfectly natural behavior and it should be encouraged. The man
is a hunter and he needs to prove his prowess with other men. A night out
chasing young single girls is a great stress relief and can foster a more
peaceful and relaxing home. Remember, nothing can rekindle your
relationship better than the man being away for a day or two (it's a great
time to clean the house too)! Just look at how emotional and happy he is
when he returns to his stable home. The best thing to do when he gets home
is for you and your best friend to perform oral on him. Then cook him a
nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband doesn't know where my clitoris is.


A: Your clitoris is of no concern to your husband. If you must mess with
it, do it in your own time or ask your best friend to help. You may wish to
videotape yourself while doing this, and present it to your husband as a
birthday gift. To ease your selfish guilt, perform oral sex on him and coo
him a delicious meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband is uninterested in foreplay.


A: You are a bad person for bringing it up and should seek sensitivity
training. Foreplay to a man is very stressful and time consuming. Sex
should be available to your husband on demand with no pesky requests for
foreplay.  What this means is that you do not love your man as much as you
should he should never have to work to get you in the mood. Stop being so
selfish!Perhaps you can make it up to him by performing oral sex on him and
cook him a nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband always has an orgasm then rolls over and goes to sleep never
giving me one.


A: I'm not sure I understand the problem. Perhaps you've forgotten to cook
him a nice meal.

Subject:	Program Changes


As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Little Johnny went up to his father and asked him, ""Dad, what is the
difference between potentially and realistically?""

The father thought for a moment, then answered, ""Go ask your mother if
she would sleep with Robert Redford for a million dollars. Then ask
your sister if she would sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars,
and ask your brother if he'd sleep with Tom Cruise for a million
dollars. Come back and tell me what you learn from that.""

So little Johnny went to his mother and asked, ""Would you sleep with
Robert Redford for a million dollars?"" The mother replied, ""Of course
I would! I wouldn't pass up an opportunity like that."" Johnny then
went to his sister and asked, ""Would  you sleep with Brad Pitt for a
million dollars?"" The girl replied, ""Oh absolutely, I'd just love to
do that! I'd do it for free!"" Then he went to his brother and asked,
""Would you sleep with Tom Cruise for a million dollars?"" ""Of course,""
the brother replied. ""Do you know how much a million could buy?""

Johnny pondered that for a few days, then went back to his dad. His
father asked him, ""Did you find out the difference between potentially

What is the word dudes?
 
Subject: Four Good Management Lessons!!


Lesson Number One 
***************** 
A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. 
A small rabbit saw the crow, and asked him, 
""Can I also sit like you and do nothing all daylong?"" 
The crow answered: ""Sure, why not."" 

So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested. 
All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it. 

Management Lesson: 
To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Two 
***************** 
A turkey was chatting with a bull. 
""I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,""sighed the turkey, 
""but I haven't got the energy. 
""Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?"" replied the bull. 
""They're packed with nutrients."" 

The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him 
enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree. 
The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. 
Finally after a fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. 
Soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree. 

Management Lesson: 
Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Three 
******************** 
When the body was first made, all the parts wanted to be Boss. 
The brain said, 
""I should be Boss 
    because I control the whole body's responses and functions."" 
 
The feet said, 
""We should be Boss 
    as we carry the brain about and get him to where he wants to go.
 
"" The hands said, 
""We should be the Boss 
    because we do all the work and earn all the money."" 

And so it went on and on with the heart, the lungs and the eyes.... 
 
until finally the asshole spoke up. 
 
All the parts laughed at the idea of the asshole being the Boss. 
So the asshole went on strike, 
    blocked itself up and refused to work. 

Within a short time the eyes became crossed, the hands clenched, 
the feet twitched, the heart and lungs began to panic and the brain fevered. 

Eventually they all decided that the asshole should be the Boss, 
so the motion was passed. 
 
All the other parts did all the work while the Boss just sat and passed out the shit! 

Management Lesson: 
You don't need brains to be a Boss - any asshole will do. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Four 
******************* 

A little bird was flying south for the winter. 
It was so cold, the bird froze and fell to the ground in a large field. 
While it was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on it. 
As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung,
it began to realize how warm it was. 
The dung was actually thawing him out! 
He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. 

A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. 
Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, 
and promptly dug him out and ate him! 

Management Lessons: 
1) Not everyone who drops shit on you is your enemy. 
2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend. 
3) And when you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut!

Dear Mark Whitt,

Thank you for your recent order via our website. Fortunately, we were able
to change your shipping method before the package shipped. It will now be
shipped via expedited ground, and should arrive in 5-7 business days. This
will change the total cost of your order to $79.40.

Unless you choose another method, all web orders are shipped SURFACE (via
Parcel Post). This is your most cost effective shipping option (unless time
is a factor), because it's based on the very low ""bulk"" rates Sierra Trading
Post is able to negotiate due to its huge shipping volume.

If you would like to specify another method of shipment, please remember to
do so in the ""Shipping"" choices section during check-out, or place a note in
the ""Comments"" section. 

Thanks for shopping with us. We appreciate your business.

Sincerely,

Vici
Customer Service
Sierra Trading Post

A fire fighter is working on the engine outside the
station when he notices a little girl next door in a
little red
wagon with little ladders hung off of the side and a
garden hose
tightly coiled in the middle.

The girl is wearing a fire-fighter's helmet and has
the wagon tied to a dog and a cat.

The fire fighter walks over to take a closer look.
""That sure is a nice fire truck,"" the fire fighter
says, with
admiration.

""Thanks,"" the little girl says.

The fire fighter looks a little closer and notices
the girl has tied the wagon to the dog's collar and
to the cat's
testicles.

""Little partner"" the fire fighter says, ""I don't
want to tell you how to run your fire truck, but if
you were to tie
that
rope around the cat's collar, I think you could go
faster.""

The little girl says, ""You're probably right, but
then I wouldn't
have a siren.

Mark,

Thanks so much for your kind hospitality.  Please thank Alicia again for me.  
How did Lauren's play go last night?  I am getting more excited about a move 
away from Houston, especially to Denver.  I hope you and your family have a 
great trip and please do give us a call if you swing into Houston.  Talk to 
you soon.

Kind regards,

Everything is ok, just boring.  Went to the Diamond cabaret for lunch.  We are heading to Texas for Xmas but I doubt we will get to Houston.  Interviewing alot but also waiting on the sale.  We have been promised it will be a good deal.  Oh well, not much else to do.

Take care and thanks for the note.

Been thinking about you, but figured you were busy.  Asked the Jernigan's
how you were doing and if your group was included in the filing.  They said
it was, you were trying to sell your group and that you didn't seem worried
at all, which is good.  Good Luck with that as I know it will be tough.  On
the bright side, if you sell it, you are a friggin hero for pulling off a
deal in a tough environment.  If you don't and go get another job, well
that's what everyone expects anyway.  Again, good luck, tell Lucci hey and
have a Merry Christmas.

I will be out the 19th but should be in the 20th.  Amy Felling should be your contact on the 19th.  She is most familiar with our computer systems.

The Enron North America offices are at 1200 17th St. Suite 2750 in Downtown Denver.
The office is over 9,000 Square Feet but is currently under construction in order to sublease approximately half of that space.
We currently have 6 employees.
I believe that you have copied all of the Enron offices that I know of.

The only other potential office is EOTT.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Mark, Brian, and Steve,
	Further to my conversation two weeks ago with Mark, I would like to schedule a visit to Denver 11/19-20.  As a reminder, Business Controls is looking at the security posture of Enron facilities worldwide.  Currently, we are focusing our resources on domestic sites.  At the moment, I am planning for one of our IT specialists to travel from Portland to assist me with reviewing IT back-up procedures, recovery, and continuity issues.  If I could impose on you to provide some information about the office, it would greatly help in our planning.
	In particular, could you briefly describe the office(s); physical location, which floor, how large, how many employees, and any other Enron subsidiaries or offices in Denver.  Additionally, would you be our point of contact, or can you designate someone?  Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.

Mark, pls encourage everyone to talk to their customers today and let's let the street know we are as busy as always and that the overall issues are behind us. I have no new info regarding this matter but believe that the proper vehicles are in place to maintain liquidity.  

I am very interested in what the wholesale customers have to say about our issues.  Do they have a mandate to not trade, are they wanting to turn down their exposures etc. If any customers say this, then let me know.

Pls keep me posted.

WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN

Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.

The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application (CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction by the following April.

Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as ""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""

Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""

To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.

""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months."" With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.

The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub."

I don't have a problem with it.  I think he would be as good or better of a trader as some of the ""kids"" I have seen down there losing $30 MM.  At least he has some concept of the physical market and how it works.  I would think to get the best value he would have to be located in Houston for that role.

Subject:	RE: Western Frontier update

I spoke with Dale Sanders at Williams today.  They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work.  I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003.  I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity.  However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity.  Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality. 

Williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d.  I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d.  Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely.

If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest.  Especially on the heels of the Kern River expansion. In addition, the Cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years.

Call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments.

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PA  have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Mark,

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

I spoke with Dale Sanders at Williams today.  They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work.  I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003.  I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity.  However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity.  Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality. 

Williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d.  I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d.  Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely.

If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest.  Especially on the heels of the Kern River expansion. In addition, the Cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years.

Call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments.

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PA  have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

attached is my resume for your consideration.  Please pass on to the
appropriate people.   I am motivated in finding a position with a
progressive marketing company who could use my experience and knowledge of
the NW gas and electric market and where I can be part of a team that has
much larger view on the markets..   I definitely know that Enron fits that
model...

Subject:	Natural Gas Origination


Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Robert--isn't it kind of odd that the parties who had commented before would not at least file comments in support of the rules?

I spoke with the ""WebMeister"" of the Colorado PUC today.  He did not think that the PUC would post on its website the filings by other parties in this docket.  He could only find one other party's filing (People's) and didn't see any other comments on file, either in the data base or on other analyst's desks.  I will continue to check with him.  The hearing is scheduled November 1.

Significant issues raised in People's comments are as follows:

Rules should be revised to include a Fixed Gas Cost option (without true-up) in addition to a traditional PGA-type offering - However the comments did not address administrative problems or cross-subsidization issues.
Rules did not go far enough in assuring utilties that hedging costs will be recoverable through the GCA
The calculation of interest on underrecoveries should be allowed.  Currently the interest calculation is asymmetrical.

Subject:	Plane ride


A man boarded an airplane and took his seat.  As he settled in, he
glanced 
up and saw a very beautiful woman boarding the plane.  He soon realized
she 
was heading straight toward his seat.  Low and behold, she took the seat

right beside his.  Eager to strike up a conversation, he blurted out, 
""Business trip or vacation?""

She turned, smiled and said, ""Business.  I'm going to the annual 
Nymphomaniac Convention in Chicago.""

He swallowed hard.  Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen 
sitting next to him and she was going to a meeting for nymphomaniacs!  
Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, ""What's your
business 
role at this convention?""

""Lecturer,"" she responded.  ""I use my experience to debunk some of the 
popular myths about sexuality.""

""Really, what myths are those?"" he asked.

""Well,"" she explained, ""one popular myth is that African American men
are 
the most well endowed, when in fact, it's the Native American Indian who
is 
most likely to possess that trait.  Another popular myth is that French
men 
are the best lovers, when actually it is the men of Jewish descent.  We 
have, however, found that the best potential lover in all categories is
the 
Southern redneck.""

The woman started to feel a little uncomfortable and blushed.  ""I'm
sorry,"" 
she said, ""I shouldn't really be discussing this with you, I don't even
know 
your name.""

""Tonto,"" the man said.  ""Tonto Goldstein, but my friends call me Bubba.""

Gentlemen -

Well, even though we still have a Monday Night Football game yet to be 
played, it's not too early to call the winners of Week 1 of the playoffs:

Megaboof XL beats Refugees
Memphis Blues beat Austin Powers


Once again, Ironballs makes an early exit from the playoffs.  The more things 
change, the more they stay the same.  And Michael just unloaded on Yellig.  
Talk about your running start, unlubricated backdoor violations.  Brutal.


So here are the matchups for next week's contests:

Goodfellas vs. Megaboof XL
Postal Crampage vs. Memphis Blues


Good luck to all our remaining competitors.



Jay-san R. Williams
CEO and Chief Shogun, Shokohachi Football Club of Japan
Imperial Football Genius
The Greatest DeFacto Commissioner in FFL History"

Please review the attached Response to RFB for the California Department of 
Water Resources as soon as possible and let me know of any material changes 
we need to make.   

Although it is important to make the document as accurate and polished as 
possible, we do not have the luxury of incorporating stylistic or similar 
non-material changes at this time.

The format has changed somewhat from versions distributed earlier in order to 
reduce the length of the cover letter. 

Chris Calger will execute the letter.

Please provide any comments you have to me within the next 15 minutes (sorry 
about that--the deadline is upon us).

Thanks.

		 cc: 
		 Subject: RAC Teams

As mentioned in our floor meeting recently, attached are listings of teams 
that we are forming to better address the business needs of Enron as it 
expands both in volume and scope. Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided 
the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be 
adjusted from time to time. Only the more senior people were included, but 
others will be included as appropriate. Many will have to be 
multidimensional. There will be no formal leader of the teams because each 
member is responsible for the activities of the team, regardless of the RAC 
group that you are in. Following are several thoughts concerning this process 
for consideration.

- The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer, the 
commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework.
- Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heightened 
awareness of RAC issues. ""De-silo-ization"" .
- All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment.
- Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude 
among the teams.
- Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect.
-  Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues. Transactions will 
require more frequent informal meetings.
- There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of 
credit, market risk or our portfolio.
- All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction. Offer to 
help out if needed.
- If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen.
- Encourage weak links in team to perform.
- Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business 
unit with the team present. This may take one quarter to implement.
- If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it 
with your supervisor.
- Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC 
and compensation processes.

The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a 
catalyst to the recent reorganization there. You can have an impact.

This process should begin immediately. 

Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort.

Rick

Chip,

Pursuant to my voice message, attached please find the term sheet that I 
believe has already been circulating in Houston.  Spoke with Dave Fuller 
earlier re. the ""all in package"" that ENA West Orig. has presented to the 
cp.  Dave asked for the cp to provide some feedback no later than this coming 
Monday.  Figured RAC could scrub the package and find ways to structure the 
contracts in order to reduce credit risk.  FYI, Jay Williams and I have done 
a credit analysis on the cp in the past when working on the previous RFP's 
that we've responded to.

I will try and speak with Jay W. by the end of today to scrub the deal from a 
credit perspective.  Perhaps you could help with the asset/dispatch rights 
that ENA would have.

Lets speak soon.

Regards,
Tracy

Jay,

I wanted to send an e-mail to Imperial Sugar regarding the credit terms that 
we just talked about.  I wanted to run this e-mail by you first before I send 
it to  the customer.

Before entering into any trades, Imperial needs to post initial margin of 
$2MM with Enron.  Enron will continue to hold this cushion amount of margin 
as long as Imperial has any positions on with Enron.

Enron has the right to margin Imperial any time their MTM exposure to Enron 
exceeds $1.5MM.  We will margin in increments of $25,000.  If their exposure 
drops below $1.5MM we will return margin to them.  However, we will always 
maintain the cushion of $2MM.

Thanks,
Craig"

TNgo -

A bit of a gray area.  There are SOME credit terms in the ISDA draft, but no 
collateral threshold.  You'll have to sell this to Fuller to collect on your 
wine...

Tana -

Attached is the ISDA worksheet for Clark County, Washington.  You will note 
that this worksheet indicates no collateral threshold, as Clark County is a 
counterparty that will require a contract where we maintain no collateral 
rights.  NOTE TO TRACY AND DAVE:  If you feel like we can get Clark County 
PUD to agree to margin rights, then we should (obviously) try to put a draft 
in front of them with a threshold and margin rights.  Please let me know your 
thoughts on this issue.


Thanks,

Jay

Jay,

To reconfirm my conversation yesterday with Reid Grossman, a consultant hired 
by the referenced counterparty to negotiate their trading documents with us:

1.  PUD #1 would also like to get gas and power trading agreements in place 
with us.  Per my conversation with Dave Fuller yesterday, the physical 
trading agreements are of a higher priority than the financial trading 
agreement.
2.  They would like to get a draft of a collateral annex from us.  Their 
suggested trading threshold for themselves was in the $3.5-5mm range.
3.  They would already be in default of the MAC's you sent me in the credit 
worksheet dated 1/25/01.  We need to revisit the MACs.
4.  They think a 3rd party debt threshold of $1mm is too low for them, they 
suggested a threshold of $10mm.
5.  The agreement provides for annual and quarterly financial statements.  I 
don't think they have quarterly.  You need talk to them about what they 
can/will provide.

If you would like to talk to Reid directly, his ph no. is 509/252-5096.

By the way, Reid is an old buddy of Bill Bradford from Reid's Avista/PG&E 
days, and Reid sends his regards to Bill.  If you see Bill pass this message 
on..."

Could you check into credit for Hayes Lemmerz?  We are looking at delivering

G'Day.  Hey, mate, I got a call from Mike Midden at ANZ Bank, looking for a 
guaranty from Enron Corp. for FX trading of Enron Japan.  He said that YOU 
had given him MY name as the contact for this in your absence.  Imagine my 
surprise when he asked for the status!!!!  Boy, that was THE BEST.  I told 
him that you had been fired and I was hot on your heels to the unemployment 
office and not to put any faith in either of us.

He didn't think it was too funny.

In any case, what IS the deal with this guarantee?  What are you doing on 
this, John?  Tell me!!!!  "

Devon Energy also has appx. [$12MM to $15MM] of monthly exposure to EOTT 
Energy Operating, LP.

We are requesting the ability to ""carve out"" $30MM (2 months sales) from the 
existing Enron Guaranty to cover any exposure that we have with EOTT.

We could document this a letter agreement attached to the current guaranty.

Don--

I apologize for not getting back with you sooner, but it's been really crazy 
around here.  Jason Williams (a manager here in the credit group) and I have 
reviewed Black Hills and can accept a parental Gty in the amount of $7.5MM to 
cover financial and physical transactions with Enron North America Corp.  I 
have attached a Gty draft below for you to review.  

However, to cover the current physical business between ENA and Enserco, we 
still need to obtain an increase in the current L/C.  We have an estimated 
$4.8MM outstanding (with the bulk of the exposure stemming from December 
sales to Enserco).  As we discussed before, we can look at decreasing the 
Enron Canada L/C to cover the increase that is needed.  

Please give me a call to discuss our positions at 713-646-6002.



Thanks,

Veronica Espinoza"

As you are aware, your business unit has been selected to participate in 
Project GEM (Global Enron Migration) for the rollout of Windows 2000.  In 
preparation for this rollout, it is imperative that we gather information 
about your workstation and the applications you use.  To begin this data 
collection, we have automated the process.  In fact, your system has just 
been inventoried.   Once this information is received, we will be working 
with your local department coordinator to consolidate this information to 
ensure this transition is as smooth as possible.

The GEM team would like to thank you for your participation.  If you have any 
questions, please contact Mike Hernandez at (713)853-7740."

Subject: GAS DEAL w/Oregon Steel Mills

Gas team,

Dave Fuller in West Origination is trying to get the credit requirements for 
the following 3 year gas financial deal:

Term:  01/01/2001 thru 12/31/2003
Volumes:  7,500MMBtu/day
ENA pays float (Sumas Inside Ferc)
CP pays fixed ($$$$???)

Since I need to get the fixed price for this deal, hypothectically though, 
the cp is a ""credit upfront"" customer.  Assuming prevailing market prices, 
what would your estimated Letter of Credit be for the deal above?  I've sent 
a cws to legal for a draft ISDA.

Quick response appreciated.  Please let me know if you need more info to swag 
this L/C.  I would assume that we need lots of cushion should the market tank.

Tracy

Mike,
 I have checked with the credit group and the suggested changes to the 
confidentiality agreement and to Exhibit ""C"" and ""D"" are acceptable.  They 
did point out a typo in the collateral threshold provision.  It should read 
$1,500,000 instead of $1,5000,000.  Please accept the redlined changes to the 
documents and make the above correction and the documents should be ready for 
you to start the execution process.  I am informed that credit will not make 
any changes of the $1,500,000 collateral threshold amount until they have had 
an opportunity to review the Ormet financial information.  Thereafter we can 
work on an amendment if they feel that the financial information warrants 
making a change.

Attached is a marked-up draft of the Enron standard confidentiality 
agreement.  Please review it and get back to me with your comments.

Additionally, I have attached a copy of the Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement that 
makes Ormet's changes to the Guarantee Agreement on Exhibit D consistent on 
the Exhibit C Guarantee Agreement.

Pending your comments on the Confidentialty Agreement, the only item 
outstanding is the $1.5 million collateral threshhold.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Mike

Mary,

Linder Oil Company, A Partnership- ENA is currently purchasing approximately 
620,000/mmbtu/firm/month through March'01 under GTC contracts.  The current 
dollar value of this notional volume is approximately $5.5MM.  No outstanding 
financial trades exist.

Linder Energy Company - ENA is currently long one financial swap (nb3995.2) 
for 6,500/mmbtu/d Cal'01 @ $2.755.  The financial mark to market value of 
this trade is approximately $7.3MM.  The Annex B that was attached to this 
omnibus confirmation contained credit language that provided a $600M credit 
line and specified an additional amount of $700M.  We received and continue 
to hold an LC for $700M to secure the additional amount, but made no other 
margin call.

Lousiana General Oil Company - ENA is currently long one financial swap 
(nb3939.2) for 1,625/mmbtu/d Cal'01 @ $2.755.  The financial mark to market 
value of this trade is approximately $1.8MM.  The Anned B that was attached 
to this omnibus confirmation contained credit language that provided a $100 
credit line and specified an additional amount of $175M.  We received and 
continue to hold an LC for $175M to secure the additional amount, but made no 
other margin call.

This morning we called Linder Energy and Louisiana General for margin.  They 
can't post.  We would like to assign the two outstanding financial trades to 
Linder Oil Company and put into place language that would allow 
physical/financial offset in an early termination event.

Could you please give me a call on this when you get a chance.

thanks
brant

Dr. Blair,

You probably do not remember us, but oh, we remember you.  It was you who 
taught us the ways of Marketing in the Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of 
Management in the fall of 1996.  It  was you who challenged us with a 
particular project.  It was you who openly and categorically disagreed with 
our recommendation (giving each of us a less than satisfactory grade of 
""B"").  It was you who thought the brand name Oldsmobile could and should be 
saved with Marketing hocus pocus and wizardry.  It was we three who 
recommended that General Motors discontinue the Oldsmobile line, moving the 
one or two ""best sellers"" in the ridiculous line of cars to Buick or 
Chevrolet.  As we recall:

Oldsmobile had blown its image with the failing ""This is not your father's 
Oldsmobile"" campaign.
Oldsmobile could not afford to retool its line.
Oldsmobile was not competitive from a safety standpoint.  
Oldsmobile was not competitive from a luxury standpoint. 
Oldsmobile was not competitive from an affordability standpoint. 
Oldsmobile was not competitive from a dependability standpoint. 
Oldsmobile was not competitive from a sex appeal standpoint. 

Let's face it, Ed:  Oldsmobile simply was not competitive on any front, and 
as we argued (and as our classmates supported), there was no hope.  In 1996, 
Oldsmobile had suffered a 90% downturn in car sales over the course of a 
decade and its cars did not appeal to any facet of the population. They were 
expensive, poorly engineered, unattractive, and basically had been at the 
bottom of their respective performance/satisfaction ratings across the board.

Attached are some articles for your review.  Themes constant across these 
articles are those that we expounded four years ago.  Two questions remain: 
 
1) How much money has Oldsmobile vomitted over the last four years?

2)  Can grades be changed four years after the fact?  



Yours Truly -

In the spirit of Christmas, God bless you every one, but grades are not
changed after the fact.

I thought of you guys when I saw the announcement of Oldsmobile's
demise. Before you break your arm patting yourself on the back, let me
remind you that the assignment was to think about the basis for
attitudes and how one might changes attitudes, and, by giving up and
shutting down Oldsmobile, you were basically taking a whiff on the
assignment. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I'm tempted to
see if your grades can be reduced.

Anyway, it's good to hear from you. I hope that things are going well
for all of you.

Subject: Re-Alignment

Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in=20
2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=
he=20
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=
e=20
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=
=20
and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=
=20
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=
e=20
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=
=20
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=
=20
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=
=20
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=
=20
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=
=20
our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=
nd=20
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=
=20
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=
e=20
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=

in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are=20

responsible for covering the LDC=01,s, muni=01,s/co-ops, industrials, IOU=

and the producers.  There will be an increasing focus on the upstream side =

addition to market area opportunities. The team will utilize all of ENA=01,=

Phillip Allen and Barry Tycholiz, who will be joining us in Houston from th=

Canadian team. The Denver office under Mark Whitt will be integrated under=

this team.
Central Gas =01)  in a similar manner, a Central Gas Team will be formed=20
co-managed by Hunter Shively and Laura Luce. The Chicago office will be=20
integrated into this team.
Texas Gas =01) the Texas Gas Team will be managed by Tom Martin. This team =
will=20
continue to manage the gas trading business around HPL until the pending sa=

is concluded in Q2 2001.  After the sale of HPL, this team will build a Tex=

significant changes.
Derivatives =01) this group, lead by Fred Lagrasta, will offer derivative a=

industrial accounts where relationships are well formed. Otherwise,=20
mid-market coverage will gravitate to the regions. The New York office gas=

marketing efforts will continue to be managed by Fred.
Upstream Products =01) this group, lead by Jean Mrha, will develop several=

distinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market.  Thi=
s=20
group will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions.=
=20
This is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and=

greater market penetration in the upstream segment.  These products include=
=20
producer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor=20
relationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor=20
services, wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital=20
products.  In addition, Jean will manage our Bridgeline joint venture with=

Texaco. =20
Gas Structuring =01) this group will be lead by Ed McMichael, reporting to =
Frank=20
Vickers, will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams.
Gas Fundamentals =01) this group will be lead by Chris Gaskill, reporting t=

Julie Gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identifi=
ed=20
projects including long-term supply/demand analysis and, natural gas=20
transportation capacity trading opportunities.
=20
There is an expectation of some customer overlap between the gas and power=
=20
groups; for example, the combination utilities and the IPP=01,s.  The teams=
 will=20
coordinate with regard to the combination utilities like Con. Edison or=20
PG&E.  With regard to the IPP=01,s, to the extent that the product offering=

involves an underlying power position, the power teams will manage. We have=

asked Janet Dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two=20
organizations in Houston.=20

e) Technical/Restructuring - In the effort to consolidate and centralize ou=
r=20
technical resources (engineering, development, operations, pipeline) to=20
ensure that this skill base is available to all ENA groups and utilized=20
productively across the organization, Brian Redmond will form and manage th=

Technical Services Group.  This group will manage ENA=01,s technical risks =

In addition to these responsibilities, Brian will manage the pending sale a=

i) Energy Capital Resources =01) there will be no changes to this group=20
currently lead by C. John Thompson and Scott Josey.  John and Scott will=20

As a final note in the interest of keeping things simple, Enron Americas wi=
ll=20
have two operating divisions  - Enron North America and Enron South America=

As a result, we will continue to conduct business under these two operating=

If you are currently a commercial employee of ENA or ESA you will continue =

We look forward to another exciting year in the North American energy=20

Hello,

I hope everyone had a special holiday.  Regarding Westpark, there is NO 
CREDIT RISK...
Historically, the customer places limit orders and stop loss orders with Jim 
Schwigger for NYMX related NG contracts.  Activity is not heavy and trade 
volume is usually limited to a Bcf or less.  We currently hold $1.5MM in cash 
as security on a static position.
January - is off the board.  Enron owes them $6.6MM.
February - has no open volumes.  All positions have been unwound.
March - has no open volumes.  All positions have been unwound.
The issue at bar (to use a legal term) is management strategy.  What I 
proposed and they accepted was $300M for each Bcf open.  Recognizing the fact 
that (i) this is a one man shop and (ii) he (Patrick Locke) is definately 
speculating, is $1.5MM enough security.  Probably not.  I have left word with 
Patrick and Jim about revisiting our philosophy, but he is willing to provide 
collateral and all confirmations are bound by the existing Master Agreement 
that contains a $0 credit line.

Recommendation:  We increase the collateral being held from $1.5MM to $2.5MM 
and margin them for all amounts postive.  Pursue an amendment to the Master 
Agreement that changes the independant amount from $150M to $2.5MM.

That's it.....Move on people...Get a life......

Tanya,

I have run a VAR on Westpark (see below) and as you can tell the one day VAR, 
at the 95 percentile, for current transactions is $2.5MM.  The 5-day VAR is 
$5.7MM.
Our current exposure is out of the money $7.1MM, thus a net for this period 
is potentialy out of the money $1.4MM.

Thanks
Russell.

Ken:

Subject to final confirmation with the gas desk in Houston, Enron is prepared 
to provide gas supply to CanFibre according to the terms on the attached.  If 
you want to do something, please arrange for the first wire transfer (or

See below.  No e-dash necessary.....

I have already informed accounting and will do the same for treasury.  I was 
told treasury needs to know by 2:00 pm today if the funds need to be wired 
tomorrow.

I will call soon to discuss.  I am still working on the outstanding 
receivable amount.  According to physical settlements (Darla Saucier) they 
only owe us $1,190,803 for December gas on both deals, $789,973 for the one 
month deal and $400,830 for the 10-year deal.

Jay Williams in Credit is verifying this and we will check in TAG to make 
sure we are not missing a deal.

Eric,

I spoke to Dave Gorte regarding this National Steel transaction, and he 
indicated that he did not think the EDASH was necessary as there is no risk 
in the transaction as we are only closing an existing position.  It is 
clearly a funding issue, and we need to be certain that Joe and the Treasury 
group are aware of the exact dollars going out on which day.  Please give me 
a call to discuss.

Thanks,

I have another counterparty that is interested in doing a gas deal.  They are 
smaller but we are trying to do some gas deals with these smaller 
counterparties so that they will potentially do some power deals with us.

Calgary Winter Club
4611 14 Street NW
Calgary, Alberta 
Canada
TT2K 1J7

Contact person:  Gary Maher
Number:  403-289-5511

I have included the file below which outlines the potential volumes we would 
be looking at with this counterparty.

Give me a call if you have any questions on this.

Regards,

Shawn

Bill -

The following are some issues that I have encountered that merit some 
attention from a Credit Risk Mgmt. standpoint.  Most of these issues are 
related to the way other groups within the company do their jobs, so we need 
to think about how much political capital would be expended to make some 
changes happen, and whether it is worth it to fight those battles.


1.  VERBAL APPROVAL FOR TRADES

I spoke to one of the day gas traders last week, and she informed me that 
their group had recently had a meeting to discuss issues related to credit.  
In particular, they were discussing the Credit Watch List.  It was made very 
clear to those traders that if they executed a transaction with a 
counterparty on the Watch List without Credit approval that they would be 
fired.  This is, of course, good news and bad news.  The good news is that we 
should now be able to better monitor these transactions.  The bad news is 
that this puts a burden on Credit to keep the Watch List up-to-date.  We 
should be doing this, but it is an issue of freeing up enough time to review 
the companies that we think might merit removal from the list.  Easier said 
than done.

The inevitable conclusion of this meeting/pronouncement from the traders' 
management is that the traders will now be looking for some way to prove that 
their trade was approved by Credit.  This is going to lead to a need  


2.  COUNTERPARTY NAME ISSUES

It is not a new development that traders call down looking to do a trade and 
they don't know which exact entity that they're dealing with.  In most cases, 
we can figure out where a trade needs to be booked and we can do the proper 
analysis with respect to the trade at hand.  For the counterparties with whom 
we have master agreements and do regular business this is not such a big 
deal; we know the parent entities and the associated subs and trading arms.  
However, this issue of traders not knowing who they are dealing with is 
creating a lot of problems for CPR/day gas transactions.  Traders are calling 
down for approval on monthly/day gas and giving the wrong counterparty name 
so our credit analysis is absolutely worthless.  

For example,   I approved a deal for Alain Diza for a small volume of January 
gas for ""Fulton County (NY) Board of Education.""  The total receivable was 
$36,000 so I approved the trade, reasoning that a county board of education 
would be able to cover a $36k bill.  It turns out that the actual 
counterparty was ""Fulton Housing Authority"", an operator of low-income 
housing governed by the New York State Division of Housing.  This entity has 
a total of $52,000 in its bank accounts.  The solution is to make 
traders/originators accountable for providing the correct counterparty name.  
If credit losses arising from this issue were deducted from the appropriate 
trader's P&L, then there would be a lot more incentive for them to get the 
entity specified correctly.


3.  BACK OFFICE ISSUES

It is very difficult for us to chase down the originator of a trade through 
TAGG, because the back office aren't doing their jobs well.  When we have 
pendings issues, we have to chase down the trader through the confirms people 
or the book admins.  It is a process that takes too much of our time.  If the 
book admins would just put the trader's name on the ticket, it would save us 
countless phone calls.  I have mentioned to Debbie that we need to pound 
Sally Beck on this issue, and she said that she would discuss it with her.  
However, Beck's group still is not getting it done.

Bill -

Southwest Royalties' credit quality is extremely poor:  E-rating of 11, 
negative equity, very little liquidity and no bank lines available to them.  
We currently have 5 trades on the books with them (all financial) with a 
total net position ~$2.6 MM out of the money to Enron.

I would normally not move up the payment for this counterparty, but all of 
our trading with them has been limited to selling them financial puts.  As 
such, Enron will not incur any exposure to Southwest Royalties, and I feel 
that an earlier pay date can be justified from a credit standpoint.

Please let me know if you have any questions.


Jay

Jay,

Please review Southwest Royalties for our comfort with paying them earlier in 
the billing cycle.  Please keep in mind that our payable can be used as an 
offset against any MTM exposure.

Let me know.  Thanks,

Doug,

Another example of the ""data integrity"" issues Bill and I referred to 
previously.  Before setting up either of the CrossTimbers companies, we would 
expect and recommend a thorough review of the booking of their existing 
trades, from TAGG deal entry through Sitara/CPR and Unify.

Regards,
Debbie

Please Consider Cross Timbers Oil Company for CL application

Also, for our information, both Cross Timbers Oil Company and Cross Timbers 
Energy Services have transactions booked on our systems.

Cross Timbers Oil Company
Prior Month's Gas (Early Pay)             $6,505,113.57  
Current Month's Gas (Pre-Pay)         $14,506,601.59  
Contracted Future Gas Delivery       $93,851,244.49  

Cross Timbers Energy Services
Prior Month's Gas (Early Pay)              $636,838.74  
Current Month's Gas (Pre-Pay)            $228,130.60  
Contracted Future Gas Delivery                        -0-

Are the deals with CTES booked incorrectly?    The numbers for prior month 
are coming from Unify, and the current month are coming from CPR

""Tentatively approved"" means that we should assume that Tenaska will be 
granted full approval unless we hear otherwise from Debbie, Bill, or Jason 
Williams by COB Thursday.  

Please mail the letter and UserID out to Tenaska today.   I have set up the 
counterparty in CL system with appropriate interest rates and privileges, and 
you guys in PCG should set up the user as usual in the CL system.  

I really appreciate everyone's speed on this issue;  I believe that there is 
a good chance Tenaska will want to transact on Friday.  I told them the 
earliest they would be able to do so was Friday, pending our usual setup 
processes and credit check.

thanks again!

Sorry guys - I inadvertently hit send without the following comment.  You can 
delete the previous version of this.

Based on my conversation with Debbie this morning, we can send it out today.  
If we do this, there is a better chance they will have a chance to look at 
the site on Thursday late afternoon before actually transacting.

""Tentatively approved"" means that we should assume that Tenaska will be 
granted full approval unless we hear otherwise from Debbie, Bill, or Jason 
Williams by COB Thursday.  

Please mail the letter and UserID out to Tenaska today.   I have set up the 
counterparty in CL system with appropriate interest rates and privileges, and 
you guys in PCG should set up the user as usual in the CL system.  

I really appreciate everyone's speed on this issue;  I believe that there is 
a good chance Tenaska will want to transact on Friday.  I told them the 
earliest they would be able to do so was Friday, pending our usual setup 
processes and credit check.

thanks again!

Tanya -

An update on National Steel Corporation:  the unwind/monetization deal was 
closed today with this counterparty.  I am still trying to get details, but 
it is my impression that we wrote NSC a check to cover the out-of-the-money 
position, with a net-out for December gas invoices only.

I say ""only"" because I had made it clear to Troy Black, Frank Hayden, John 
Griffith, and anyone else involved that I was not willing to write a check to 
this counterparty without deducting 100% of the amounts owed to Enron by 
National Steel.  While I'm still working on getting details, "

There are several outstanding issues currently with Tenaska--the most 
significant being their change in ownership.  They are no longer an 
affilitate/sub of Illinova Corp. (As Illinova has been acquired by Dynegy), 
but have now seperated into the entities Tenaska Energy, Inc. and Tenaska 
Energy Holdings (their financials are combined).  The Guarantor is 
collectively both entities.

I'm currently working on amending the Master Swap Agreement, as the credit 
support provider has changed.  Preliminary revised thresholds are between 
$5-10MM.  ENA has not Mac'd the counterparty b/c the Illinova's gty, etc. 
will remain acitve until April 01.  Nontheless, we need to amend accordingly 
ASAP.  Our current Financial MTM is $9MM.  I will also contact the physical 
legal group to have a new contract issued out (as we have an old 91 Master 
Physical Gas contract).

On the physical side, attached below is a breakdown of our positions.  Please 
note that we have formal gas netting agreements for the ENA business:



As you can see, the majority of the exposure is with the Canadian sales to 
their Canadian affitliate.  Also note that all of this business is still 
gty'd by Illinova until April 01.  

An important note here is that I received a gty from the new guarantors today 
in the amount of $20MM, covering Enron Corp and all of its' subs.  It covers 
the physical business of Tenaska Marketing Ventures, Tenaska Marketing 
Canada, a Division of TMV Corp., and Tenaska Gas Storage, LLC.  Tenaska is 
also doing business with EES.  Once the ISDA is amended, the new financial 
gty's will be issued out accordingly.  Also, I'm working with Global 
Counterparty to change the system accordingly.

I will keep you all updated on any changes/progress.   Please let me know if 
I've left anything out.

Doug - 

Pursuant to the strict written instructions I have received from Credit, and 
in accordance with our standing policy, we will not be issueing the User ID 
and Welcome Letter to Tenaska until AFTER Credit approval has been granted.

That being said however, we understand the sense of urgency, and have:

1) verified the authority of the User
2) created the User ID and Welcome Letter
3) prepared same for mailing
4) confirmed with the Mail Room that overnight delivery will have the package 
to the customer by 10am next day.

So, you can assured that there will be ABSOLUTELY NO DELAY on the behalf of 
PCG once we have received the appropriate credit approval.

Sorry guys - I inadvertently hit send without the following comment.  You can 
delete the previous version of this.

Based on my conversation with Debbie this morning, we can send it out today.  
If we do this, there is a better chance they will have a chance to look at 
the site on Thursday late afternoon before actually transacting.

If anything, life sucks worse.  There is a guy
retiring today and I'm basically supposed to replace
him on this project, but I've been so busy with other
projects that I haven't had any time to pick his
brain.  So I am fucked but large.

Send the package to the office.  Our secretaries don't
do shit for me ever, so they can at least lug my
gifts around.

This weekend isn't good for a chat, unfortunately.
I leave for Boston tonight and T and I might go
skiing.
This is the last time I'll see her until after Vegas,
since she leaves for India on Tuesday and I leave
for my 6 week sojourn after that.  So I plan to get
very acquainted with my right hand.  Maybe I'll have
time to acquire some skill with my left.

I may very seriously blow my brains out while we're in
Vegas.  I saw Fight Club yet again last night and
shooting himself in the head seemed to work for Ed
Norton.  One thing is for sure, there is definitely
no downside to shooting yourself in the head.  Unless
you paralyze yourself or something.  That's the thing
about life.  As awful as it is, it can always be
worse.  In my case, losing the ability to terminate
myself at any time would be the worst thing ever.

Its raining today, also.

Russell,

As discussed, attached is the model for the City of Mesa deal. Here is the 
summary....

ENA is currently selling gas to the City of Mesa at a fixed price of 
$3.74/mmbtu.  It is a 1 year deal that began in August of 2000 and expires in 
July 2001.
City of Mesa wants to use the value in this contract to buy down an new index 
(physical delivery) deal that begins August 2001 and ends January 2002.
They are willing to raise the price on the existing deal to about $4.50/mmbtu 
and use the value to discount the new floating index deal about $.30/mmbtu

The summary page is the best place to start and probably has all the info you 
need for your analysis.


Again, the orginators (Dave Fuller and Jeffrey Oh, Portland) are looking to 
transact on Monday (Jan 22).

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will touch base with you 
mid-morning on Monday.

Thanks in advance,

Eric

Dave/Jeff,

I spoke with Jason Williams (Enron Credit) and he confirmed there will be no 
credit reserve on the new index deal.  He is verifying that there is no need 
to ""e-dash"" the deal.  I will get back to you as soon as I hear word.  If one 
is required, we will help get the document pushed through the system.

The next step, if you and the City of Mesa are ready, is to get a firm quote 
from Mike Grigsby this afternoon.

Let me know.

Regards,

Eric


PS - Attached is an e-dash.  If one is needed, you will need to complete the 
first section describing the deal.  As you can tell by the matrix, it does 
not appear an e-dash is necessary because the City of Mesa has a AA- rating 
and the transaction is approx $8 million and less than 1 year.

Team - 

We need to draw up an Omnibus confirmation for the above referenced deal.  
The Enron entity transacting is Enron Canada Corp. but as I understand, this 
is to be done out of the Houston legal group, using the usual Schedule B 
attached to the GTC.  If this is not the case, someone please speak up.  The 
deal is pending credit being put into the contract and Legal's review of 
contracts.  Peter - do you want to sign-off on this prior to the confirmation 
being sent or do you want Houston Legal to sign-off?

The counterparty is Slater Steel Inc. and the terms are as attached.  
Veronica - please have this counterparty set up in Global counterparty and 
have the deal entered into Credit -Ag as we would enter a Master (to allow us 
to monitor exposure/collateral thresholds/collateral held etc. on a 
go-forward basis).

Please let me know if any of you have any questions.

Thanks - 

John

The equity of Edison International and PG&E will trade substantially higher 
at the opening today ....


01/25 08:57 Western Gas extends gas deliveries to PG&E 

NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Western Gas Resources Inc. <WGR.N> said Thursday 
it will deliver an additional 5,000 million British thermal units (mmBtu) of 
gas per day through Feb. 7 to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. pursuant to recent 
orders issued by the U.S. secretary of energy. 

According to the Temporary Emergency Natural Gas Purchase and Sale Orders, 
issued by the secretary of energy on Jan. 19 and 23, Western Gas will make 
the deliveries under terms consistent with a terminated supply agreement, 
excluding any terms requiring prepayment, the company said in a statement. 

The 5,000 mmBtu/day represents less than one-half of one percent of PG&E's 
typical daily supply requirements of 1.44 billion cubic feet (bcf) per day 
for the month of January. 

PG&E is a regulated energy delivery company serving northern and central 
California. The utility is owned by energy holding company PG&E Corp. <PCG.N> 
of San Francisco. 

The utility, which serves 3.8 million gas customers in the the region, said 
earlier in the week it has piled up more than $7 billion in wholesale power 
costs, which cannot be passed on to customers because of a rate cap imposed 
by the state's 1996 deregulation law. 

California, which experienced two days of rolling blackouts last week in the 
northern and central parts of the state, continues to see paper-thin power 
reserve levels. 

Western, an independent natural gas company based in Denver, estimates it 
will have total invoices outstanding pursuant to the terminated supply 
agreement and including deliveries through the duration of these orders 
totaling $2.2 million. 

Western said it has no other outstanding exposure to either PG&E or 
California's other regulated energy delivery company, Southern California 
Edison Co. 

Southern California Edison, which serves customers in southern California, is 
a subsidiary of energy holding company Edison International <EIX.N> of 
Rosemead, Calif. 

""Western will comply with the Department of Energy's orders and sympathizes 
with the citizens of California during this period of uncertainty, however, 
we believe that this issue is best addressed by PG&E, the California Public 
Utilities Commission and the State of California,"" Western Chief Executive 
and President Lanny Outlaw said in the statement. 

""We have difficulty understanding how our company, our employees in Colorado, 
Wyoming, Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana and Oklahoma, and our shareholders can 
be expected to bear any loss as a result of these orders. We intend to 
vigorously act to recover any losses and protect our numerous stakeholders,"" 
Outlaw added.

I'm supposed to get their comments today, I thought there was a section on 
margining in the draft I sent them.  Let me investigate and I'll let you 
know.  Also, there are some seriuos legal questions regarding their authority 
to do a pure financial transaction.  I'll keep you up to date on this too.

Tana -

Attached is the ISDA worksheet for Clark County, Washington.  You will note 
that this worksheet indicates no collateral threshold, as Clark County is a 
counterparty that will require a contract where we maintain no collateral 
rights.  NOTE TO TRACY AND DAVE:  If you feel like we can get Clark County 
PUD to agree to margin rights, then we should (obviously) try to put a draft 
in front of them with a threshold and margin rights.  Please let me know your 
thoughts on this issue.


Thanks,

Jay

Dave,

Attached is the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement.  The document you 
faxed me was the preprinted form of ISDA Master Agreement.  That document, 
TOGETHER with the attached Schedule is your full ""ISDA Master Agreement"".  
Also attached to this Schedule is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty and 
proposed form of Legal Opinion to be issued by Clark County PUD #1.

It is my understanding that you will provide these documents directly to the 
counterparty.  Again, the whole package above must be provided to the 
counterparty or you will not have a complete set of documents.  Call me if 
you have any questions.

With respect to assignment of the Fletcher Challenge ISDA over to Apache, I 
see no problems from a credit standpoint.  I do have one quick clarification 
on this issue, though.  The correct counterparty name is Fletcher Challenge 
Energy Canada Inc.  Other than that small item, I have no issues with making 
this assignment.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Subject: Fletcher Challenge/Apache

Tana Jones received a request to assign the Fletcher Challenge Canada ISDA to 
Apache Corporation.  As you may know, Fletcher Challenge has entered into an 
agreement to sell its oil & gas production operations in Canada and Argentina 
to Apache (and its New Zealand properties to Shell).  The deal is set to 
close sometime first quarter.  We need to approve the assignment of the 
contract.  To that end, please review Apache and determine the effect of the 
transaction on both companies.  Tana will forward documentation to us upon 
her receipt.

Thanks,
Tanya

Hello, my friend Jay W.

I just wanted to say what a great day I am having.  I
am at peace with my surroundings and getting up to go
to work is the highlight of every day, because it
interrupts the nagging sleep that cuts into work time.
I have a constant smile and my cheerfullness is
rubbing off on others.  We are all a happy family.  I
am sure that your life is the same.  I hope that I can
live to be 200 years old and that I am allowed to work
that long, because every second at the office is an
eternity of serene enlightenment.

God Bless you, friend, and peace be with you.

I am not sure we have any rights to take any action.  Given our overall

up with Lisa and John on a regular basis to insure we are on top of the issue.

Bill -

I talked to John Enerson about Heartland Steel, and he tells me that things 
are OK with respect to their payments on delivered gas.  Heartland has paid 
Enron for all of its physical delivered gas, and we now have them on 
pre-payment for future gas delivery.

The MTM exposure is another issue, of course.  Enerson thinks that Heartland 
will have to cease operations within the next 2-3 weeks.  Do we need to take 
any action with respect to the MTM exposure position???

guess I need to get hooked up with a room pretty soon, huh?

As for this weekend, sorry but

Jay,

Hey guess what:  GET MEASURED FOR YOUR TUX YOU DUMBASS!!!!!!!!!

Okay, now that we got that taken care of, what are you doing this weekend?  I 
would ask you to join me for some fun in big D, but I know your standard 
response to that .  Instead, a couple of my compadres have decided to take me 
to Shreveport for a good ol ""whiskey tango"" (read white trash) partying.  I 
imagine there'll be a little drinkin, a little gamblin, and possibly a little 
of nekidness.  Let me know if you are interested.

Hey, dude.  I need some help digging up some financial info on a new trading 
counterparty.  I prepared an ISDA draft about two months ago for FleetBoston 
Financial Group, the mega-huge, mega-powerful awesome credit banking 
company.  Tana Jones called me last week to inform me that they DIDN'T want 
to trade out of this entity but instead out of Fleet National Bank, which is 
a wholly-owned subsidiary."

To All:

This update clarify's our trading position with the Sempra relationship on 
EOL and over the phone:
-All Sempra entities on EOL should maintain their term of 36 months.  This is 
approved as a result of the credit controls of EOL.
-Trading over the phone is OK inside 12 months and should be managed between 
12 and 36 months accordingly based on the transaction, counterparty current
exposure, contract collateral rights and credit reserve, if any. 
-Exposures should be monitored daily by all members of the credit group.

SDG&E Update:
Short Term Power transactions are OK via phone transactions only.

Subject: Sempra and San Diego Gas & Electric Trading Policy

To All:

Per myself, Jason Williams and Bill Bradford, we have set forth a near term 
trading policy with Sempra and SDG&E in light of the California Power 
concerns. Please see below:

Sempra trading relationship:
Maintain all trading (any commodity) with in one year.  Transactions outside 
of one year need to be approved on a one off basis with due analysis and 
credit reserve if necessary.

San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E):
Financial and Physical Gas- limit trading to inside three months, no 
transactions outside of this term.
No Power transactions.

These relationships will be reviewed and updated once the California 
Legislature finalizes its Power bid's.


Regards,
Russell

Sorry guys - I inadvertently hit send without the following comment.  You can 
delete the previous version of this.

Based on my conversation with Debbie this morning, we can send it out today.  
If we do this, there is a better chance they will have a chance to look at 
the site on Thursday late afternoon before actually transacting.

""Tentatively approved"" means that we should assume that Tenaska will be 
granted full approval unless we hear otherwise from Debbie, Bill, or Jason 
Williams by COB Thursday.  

Please mail the letter and UserID out to Tenaska today.   I have set up the 
counterparty in CL system with appropriate interest rates and privileges, and 
you guys in PCG should set up the user as usual in the CL system.  

I really appreciate everyone's speed on this issue;  I believe that there is 
a good chance Tenaska will want to transact on Friday.  I told them the 
earliest they would be able to do so was Friday, pending our usual setup 
processes and credit check.

thanks again!

Doug - 

Pursuant to the strict written instructions I have received from Credit, and 
in accordance with our standing policy, we will not be issueing the User ID 
and Welcome Letter to Tenaska until AFTER Credit approval has been granted.

That being said however, we understand the sense of urgency, and have:

1) verified the authority of the User
2) created the User ID and Welcome Letter
3) prepared same for mailing
4) confirmed with the Mail Room that overnight delivery will have the package 
to the customer by 10am next day.

So, you can assured that there will be ABSOLUTELY NO DELAY on the behalf of 
PCG once we have received the appropriate credit approval.

Dale

Sorry guys - I inadvertently hit send without the following comment.  You can 
delete the previous version of this.

Based on my conversation with Debbie this morning, we can send it out today.  
If we do this, there is a better chance they will have a chance to look at 
the site on Thursday late afternoon before actually transacting.

""Tentatively approved"" means that we should assume that Tenaska will be 
granted full approval unless we hear otherwise from Debbie, Bill, or Jason 
Williams by COB Thursday.  

Please mail the letter and UserID out to Tenaska today.   I have set up the 
counterparty in CL system with appropriate interest rates and privileges, and 
you guys in PCG should set up the user as usual in the CL system.  

I really appreciate everyone's speed on this issue;  I believe that there is 
a good chance Tenaska will want to transact on Friday.  I told them the 
earliest they would be able to do so was Friday, pending our usual setup 
processes and credit check.

thanks again!

Bill -

Southwest Royalties' credit quality is extremely poor:  E-rating of 11, 
negative equity, very little liquidity and no bank lines available to them.  
We currently have 5 trades on the books with them (all financial) with a 
total net position ~$2.6 MM out of the money to Enron.

I would normally not move up the payment for this counterparty, but all of 
our trading with them has been limited to selling them financial puts.  As 
such, Enron will not incur any exposure to Southwest Royalties, and I feel 
that an earlier pay date can be justified from a credit standpoint.

Please let me know if you have any questions.


Jay

Jay,

Please review Southwest Royalties for our comfort with paying them earlier in 
the billing cycle.  Please keep in mind that our payable can be used as an 
offset against any MTM exposure.

Let me know.  Thanks,

Doug,

Another example of the ""data integrity"" issues Bill and I referred to 
previously.  Before setting up either of the CrossTimbers companies, we would 
expect and recommend a thorough review of the booking of their existing 
trades, from TAGG deal entry through Sitara/CPR and Unify.

Regards,
Debbie

Please Consider Cross Timbers Oil Company for CL application

Also, for our information, both Cross Timbers Oil Company and Cross Timbers

Cross Timbers Oil Company
Prior Month's Gas (Early Pay)             $6,505,113.57  
Current Month's Gas (Pre-Pay)         $14,506,601.59

Cross Timbers Energy Services
Prior Month's Gas (Early Pay)              $636,838.74  
Current Month's Gas (Pre-Pay)            $228,130.60  
Contracted Future Gas Delivery                        -0-

Are the deals with CTES booked incorrectly?    The numbers for prior month 
are coming from Unify, and the current month are coming from CPR

Mike,
 I have checked with the credit group and the suggested changes to the 
confidentiality agreement and to Exhibit ""C"" and ""D"" are acceptable.  They 
did point out a typo in the collateral threshold provision.  It should read 
$1,500,000 instead of $1,5000,000.  Please accept the redlined changes to the 
documents and make the above correction and the documents should be ready for 
you to start the execution process.  I am informed that credit will not make 
any changes of the $1,500,000 collateral threshold amount until they have had 
an opportunity to review the Ormet financial information.  Thereafter we can 
work on an amendment if they feel that the financial information warrants 
making a change.

Attached is a marked-up draft of the Enron standard confidentiality 
agreement.  Please review it and get back to me with your comments.

Additionally, I have attached a copy of the Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement that 
makes Ormet's changes to the Guarantee Agreement on Exhibit D consistent on 
the Exhibit C Guarantee Agreement.

Pending your comments on the Confidentialty Agreement, the only item 
outstanding is the $1.5 million collateral threshhold.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Mary,

Linder Oil Company, A Partnership- ENA is currently purchasing approximately 
620,000/mmbtu/firm/month through March'01 under GTC contracts.  The current 
dollar value of this notional volume is approximately $5.5MM.  No outstanding 
financial trades exist.

Linder Energy Company - ENA is currently long one financial swap (nb3995.2) 
for 6,500/mmbtu/d Cal'01 @ $2.755.  The financial mark to market value of 
this trade is approximately $7.3MM.  The Annex B that was attached to this 
omnibus confirmation contained credit language that provided a $600M credit 
line and specified an additional amount of $700M.  We received and continue 
to hold an LC for $700M to secure the additional amount, but made no other 
margin call.

Lousiana General Oil Company - ENA is currently long one financial swap 
(nb3939.2) for 1,625/mmbtu/d Cal'01 @ $2.755.  The financial mark to market 
value of this trade is approximately $1.8MM.  The Anned B that was attached 
to this omnibus confirmation contained credit language that provided a $100 
credit line and specified an additional amount of $175M.  We received and 
continue to hold an LC for $175M to secure the additional amount, but made no 
other margin call.

This morning we called Linder Energy and Louisiana General for margin.  They 
can't post.  We would like to assign the two outstanding financial trades to 
Linder Oil Company and put into place language that would allow 
physical/financial offset in an early termination event.

Could you please give me a call on this when you get a chance.

thanks

Hello,

I hope everyone had a special holiday.  Regarding Westpark, there is NO 
CREDIT RISK...
Historically, the customer places limit orders and stop loss orders with Jim 
Schwigger for NYMX related NG contracts.  Activity is not heavy and trade 
volume is usually limited to a Bcf or less.  We currently hold $1.5MM in cash 
as security on a static position.
January - is off the board.  Enron owes them $6.6MM.
February - has no open volumes.  All positions have been unwound.
March - has no open volumes.  All positions have been unwound.
The issue at bar (to use a legal term) is management strategy.  What I 
proposed and they accepted was $300M for each Bcf open.  Recognizing the fact 
that (i) this is a one man shop and (ii) he (Patrick Locke) is definately 
speculating, is $1.5MM enough security.  Probably not.  I have left word with 
Patrick and Jim about revisiting our philosophy, but he is willing to provide 
collateral and all confirmations are bound by the existing Master Agreement 
that contains a $0 credit line.

Recommendation:  We increase the collateral being held from $1.5MM to $2.5MM 
and margin them for all amounts postive.  Pursue an amendment to the Master 
Agreement that changes the independant amount from $150M to $2.5MM.

That's it.....Move on people...Get a life......

Tanya,

I have run a VAR on Westpark (see below) and as you can tell the one day VAR, 
at the 95 percentile, for current transactions is $2.5MM.  The 5-day VAR is 
$5.7MM.
Our current exposure is out of the money $7.1MM, thus a net for this period 
is potentialy out of the money $1.4MM.

Thanks
Russell.

See below.  No e-dash necessary.....

I have already informed accounting and will do the same for treasury.  I was 
told treasury needs to know by 2:00 pm today if the funds need to be wired 
tomorrow.

I will call soon to discuss.  I am still working on the outstanding 
receivable amount.  According to physical settlements (Darla Saucier) they 
only owe us $1,190,803 for December gas on both deals, $789,973 for the one 
month deal and $400,830 for the 10-year deal.

Jay Williams in Credit is verifying this and we will check in TAG to make 
sure we are not missing a deal.

Eric,

I spoke to Dave Gorte regarding this National Steel transaction, and he 
indicated that he did not think the EDASH was necessary as there is no risk 
in the transaction as we are only closing an existing position.  It is 
clearly a funding issue, and we need to be certain that Joe and the Treasury 
group are aware of the exact dollars going out on which day.  Please give me 
a call to discuss.

I have another counterparty that is interested in doing a gas deal.  They are 
smaller but we are trying to do some gas deals with these smaller 
counterparties so that they will potentially do some power deals with us.

Calgary Winter Club
4611 14 Street NW
Calgary, Alberta 
Canada
TT2K 1J7

Contact person:  Gary Maher
Number:  403-289-5511

I have included the file below which outlines the potential volumes we would 
be looking at with this counterparty.

Give me a call if you have any questions on this.

There are several outstanding issues currently with Tenaska--the most 
significant being their change in ownership.  They are no longer an 
affilitate/sub of Illinova Corp. (As Illinova has been acquired by Dynegy), 
but have now seperated into the entities Tenaska Energy, Inc. and Tenaska 
Energy Holdings (their financials are combined).  The Guarantor is 
collectively both entities.

I'm currently working on amending the Master Swap Agreement, as the credit 
support provider has changed.  Preliminary revised thresholds are between 
$5-10MM.  ENA has not Mac'd the counterparty b/c the Illinova's gty, etc. 
will remain acitve until April 01.  Nontheless, we need to amend accordingly 
ASAP.  Our current Financial MTM is $9MM.  I will also contact the physical 
legal group to have a new contract issued out (as we have an old 91 Master 
Physical Gas contract).

On the physical side, attached below is a breakdown of our positions.  Please 
note that we have formal gas netting agreements for the ENA business:



As you can see, the majority of the exposure is with the Canadian sales to 
their Canadian affitliate.  Also note that all of this business is still 
gty'd by Illinova until April 01.  

An important note here is that I received a gty from the new guarantors today 
in the amount of $20MM, covering Enron Corp and all of its' subs.  It covers 
the physical business of Tenaska Marketing Ventures, Tenaska Marketing 
Canada, a Division of TMV Corp., and Tenaska Gas Storage, LLC.  Tenaska is 
also doing business with EES.  Once the ISDA is amended, the new financial 
gty's will be issued out accordingly.  Also, I'm working with Global 
Counterparty to change the system accordingly.

I will keep you all updated on any changes/progress.   Please let me know if 
I've left anything out.

Russell,

As discussed, attached is the model for the City of Mesa deal. Here is the 
summary....

ENA is currently selling gas to the City of Mesa at a fixed price of 
$3.74/mmbtu.  It is a 1 year deal that began in August of 2000 and expires in 
July 2001.
City of Mesa wants to use the value in this contract to buy down an new index 
(physical delivery) deal that begins August 2001 and ends January 2002.
They are willing to raise the price on the existing deal to about $4.50/mmbtu 
and use the value to discount the new floating index deal about $.30/mmbtu

The summary page is the best place to start and probably has all the info you 
need for your analysis.


Again, the orginators (Dave Fuller and Jeffrey Oh, Portland) are looking to 
transact on Monday (Jan 22).

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will touch base with you 
mid-morning on Monday.

Thanks in advance,

Eric

Dave/Jeff,

I spoke with Jason Williams (Enron Credit) and he confirmed there will be no 
credit reserve on the new index deal.  He is verifying that there is no need 
to ""e-dash"" the deal.  I will get back to you as soon as I hear word.  If one 
is required, we will help get the document pushed through the system.

The next step, if you and the City of Mesa are ready, is to get a firm quote 
from Mike Grigsby this afternoon.

Let me know.

Regards,

Eric


PS - Attached is an e-dash.  If one is needed, you will need to complete the 
first section describing the deal.  As you can tell by the matrix, it does 
not appear an e-dash is necessary because the City of Mesa has a AA- rating 
and the transaction is approx $8 million and less than 1 year.

Team - 

We need to draw up an Omnibus confirmation for the above referenced deal.  
The Enron entity transacting is Enron Canada Corp. but as I understand, this 
is to be done out of the Houston legal group, using the usual Schedule B 
attached to the GTC.  If this is not the case, someone please speak up.  The 
deal is pending credit being put into the contract and Legal's review of 
contracts.  Peter - do you want to sign-off on this prior to the confirmation 
being sent or do you want Houston Legal to sign-off?

The counterparty is Slater Steel Inc. and the terms are as attached.  
Veronica - please have this counterparty set up in Global counterparty and 
have the deal entered into Credit -Ag as we would enter a Master (to allow us 
to monitor exposure/collateral thresholds/collateral held etc. on a 
go-forward basis).

Please let me know if any of you have any questions.

Thanks - 

John

I'm supposed to get their comments today, I thought there was a section on 
margining in the draft I sent them.  Let me investigate and I'll let you 
know.  Also, there are some seriuos legal questions regarding their authority 
to do a pure financial transaction.  I'll keep you up to date on this too.

Tana -

Attached is the ISDA worksheet for Clark County, Washington.  You will note 
that this worksheet indicates no collateral threshold, as Clark County is a 
counterparty that will require a contract where we maintain no collateral 
rights.  NOTE TO TRACY AND DAVE:  If you feel like we can get Clark County 
PUD to agree to margin rights, then we should (obviously) try to put a draft 
in front of them with a threshold and margin rights.  Please let me know your 
thoughts on this issue.


Thanks,

Dave,

Attached is the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement.  The document you 
faxed me was the preprinted form of ISDA Master Agreement.  That document, 
TOGETHER with the attached Schedule is your full ""ISDA Master Agreement"".  
Also attached to this Schedule is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty and 
proposed form of Legal Opinion to be issued by Clark County PUD #1.

It is my understanding that you will provide these documents directly to the 
counterparty.  Again, the whole package above must be provided to the 
counterparty or you will not have a complete set of documents.  Call me if 
you have any questions.

To All:

This update clarify's our trading position with the Sempra relationship on 
EOL and over the phone:
-All Sempra entities on EOL should maintain their term of 36 months.  This is 
approved as a result of the credit controls of EOL.
-Trading over the phone is OK inside 12 months and should be managed between 
12 and 36 months accordingly based on the transaction, counterparty current
exposure, contract collateral rights and credit reserve, if any. 
-Exposures should be monitored daily by all members of the credit group.

SDG&E Update:
Short Term Power transactions are OK via phone transactions only.

Subject: Sempra and San Diego Gas & Electric Trading Policy

To All:

Per myself, Jason Williams and Bill Bradford, we have set forth a near term 
trading policy with Sempra and SDG&E in light of the California Power 
concerns. Please see below:

Sempra trading relationship:
Maintain all trading (any commodity) with in one year.  Transactions outside 
of one year need to be approved on a one off basis with due analysis and 
credit reserve if necessary.

San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E):
Financial and Physical Gas- limit trading to inside three months, no 
transactions outside of this term.
No Power transactions.

These relationships will be reviewed and updated once the California 
Legislature finalizes its Power bid's.


Regards,
Russell

Please review the attached Response to RFB for the California Department of

we need to make.   

Although it is important to make the document as accurate and polished as 
possible, we do not have the luxury of incorporating stylistic or similar 
non-material changes at this time.

The format has changed somewhat from versions distributed earlier in order to 
reduce the length of the cover letter. 

Chris Calger will execute the letter.

Please provide any comments you have to me within the next 15 minutes (sorry 
about that--the deadline is upon us).

Thanks.

I am not sure we have any rights to take any action.  Given our overall

Bill -

I talked to John Enerson about Heartland Steel, and he tells me that things 
are OK with respect to their payments on delivered gas.  Heartland has paid 
Enron for all of its physical delivered gas, and we now have them on 
pre-payment for future gas delivery.

The MTM exposure is another issue, of course.  Enerson thinks that Heartland 
will have to cease operations within the next 2-3 weeks.  Do we need to take 
any action with respect to the MTM exposure position???

Chip,

Pursuant to my voice message, attached please find the term sheet that I 
believe has already been circulating in Houston.  Spoke with Dave Fuller 
earlier re. the ""all in package"" that ENA West Orig. has presented to the 
cp.  Dave asked for the cp to provide some feedback no later than this coming 
Monday.  Figured RAC could scrub the package and find ways to structure the 
contracts in order to reduce credit risk.  FYI, Jay Williams and I have done 
a credit analysis on the cp in the past when working on the previous RFP's 
that we've responded to.

I will try and speak with Jay W. by the end of today to scrub the deal from a 
credit perspective.  Perhaps you could help with the asset/dispatch rights 
that ENA would have.

Lets speak soon.

Regards,
Tracy

Jay,

I wanted to send an e-mail to Imperial Sugar regarding the credit terms that 
we just talked about.  I wanted to run this e-mail by you first before I send 
it to  the customer.

Before entering into any trades, Imperial needs to post initial margin of 
$2MM with Enron.  Enron will continue to hold this cushion amount of margin 
as long as Imperial has any positions on with Enron.

Enron has the right to margin Imperial any time their MTM exposure to Enron 
exceeds $1.5MM.  We will margin in increments of $25,000.  If their exposure 
drops below $1.5MM we will return margin to them.  However, we will always 
maintain the cushion of $2MM.

Thanks,
Craig"

A bit of a gray area.  There are SOME credit terms in the ISDA draft, but no 
collateral threshold.  You'll have to sell this to Fuller to collect on your

Tana -

Attached is the ISDA worksheet for Clark County, Washington.  You will note 
that this worksheet indicates no collateral threshold, as Clark County is a 
counterparty that will require a contract where we maintain no collateral 
rights.  NOTE TO TRACY AND DAVE:  If you feel like we can get Clark County 
PUD to agree to margin rights, then we should (obviously) try to put a draft 
in front of them with a threshold and margin rights.  Please let me know your 
thoughts on this issue.

Jay,

To reconfirm my conversation yesterday with Reid Grossman, a consultant hired 
by the referenced counterparty to negotiate their trading documents with us:

1.  PUD #1 would also like to get gas and power trading agreements in place 
with us.  Per my conversation with Dave Fuller yesterday, the physical 
trading agreements are of a higher priority than the financial trading 
agreement.
2.  They would like to get a draft of a collateral annex from us.  Their 
suggested trading threshold for themselves was in the $3.5-5mm range.
3.  They would already be in default of the MAC's you sent me in the credit 
worksheet dated 1/25/01.  We need to revisit the MACs.
4.  They think a 3rd party debt threshold of $1mm is too low for them, they 
suggested a threshold of $10mm.
5.  The agreement provides for annual and quarterly financial statements.  I 
don't think they have quarterly.  You need talk to them about what they 
can/will provide.

If you would like to talk to Reid directly, his ph no. is 509/252-5096.

By the way, Reid is an old buddy of Bill Bradford from Reid's Avista/PG&E 
days, and Reid sends his regards to Bill.  If you see Bill pass this message 
on..."

Don--

I apologize for not getting back with you sooner, but it's been really crazy 
around here.  Jason Williams (a manager here in the credit group) and I have 
reviewed Black Hills and can accept a parental Gty in the amount of $7.5MM to 
cover financial and physical transactions with Enron North America Corp.  I 
have attached a Gty draft below for you to review.  

However, to cover the current physical business between ENA and Enserco, we 
still need to obtain an increase in the current L/C.  We have an estimated 
$4.8MM outstanding (with the bulk of the exposure stemming from December 
sales to Enserco).  As we discussed before, we can look at decreasing the 
Enron Canada L/C to cover the increase that is needed.  

Please give me a call to discuss our positions at 713-646-6002.



Thanks,

Veronica Espinoza"

Subject: GAS DEAL w/Oregon Steel Mills

Gas team,

Dave Fuller in West Origination is trying to get the credit requirements for 
the following 3 year gas financial deal:

Term:  01/01/2001 thru 12/31/2003
Volumes:  7,500MMBtu/day
ENA pays float (Sumas Inside Ferc)
CP pays fixed ($$$$???)

Since I need to get the fixed price for this deal, hypothectically though, 
the cp is a ""credit upfront"" customer.  Assuming prevailing market prices, 
what would your estimated Letter of Credit be for the deal above?  I've sent 
a cws to legal for a draft ISDA.

Quick response appreciated.  Please let me know if you need more info to swag 
this L/C.  I would assume that we need lots of cushion should the market tank.

Tracy

KINGDON DECREASES EXPOSURE TO THE ENERGY SECTOR

According to its 13F for the first quarter of 2001, Kingdon Capital
Management reported approximately $1.6 billion in equity assets invested in
a portfolio of 144 companies.  This is a slight decrease from the previous
quarter, in which the firm reported $1.9 billion in equity assets invested
in a portfolio of 167 companies.

Top five holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001, included:  Arbitron
Inc. [ARB] with 1,090,000 shares valued at $100.8 million; Philip Morris
Cos. Inc. [MO] with 1,250,000 shares valued at $59.3 million; Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. [GS] with 500,000 shares valued at $42.5 million; Waste
Management Inc. [WMI] with 1,700,000 shares valued at $42.0 million; and,
Orion Power Holdings Inc. [ORN] with 1,150,000 shares valued at $35.3
million.

The firm's holding in Arbitron represents the largest new position this
quarter.  Other new positions for the firm include: Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. [LEH] with 450,000 shares valued at $28.2 million; Tosco Corp. [TOS]
with 600,000 shares valued at $25.7 million; Amgen Inc. [AMGN] with 367,400
shares valued at $22.1 million; and, General Motors Corp. [GM] with 400,000
shares valued at $20.7 million.

Despite a quarter in which the tech-heavy Nasdaq's plunge seemed
never-ending, the firm remained heavily weighted in the sector, increasing
its tech holdings slightly from approximately 20.5% in the fourth quarter of
2000 to 21.7% in the first quarter of 2001.  Perhaps, the biggest change to
the firm's portfolio was found in its energy sector holdings.  In the fourth
quarter of 2001, approximately 9.3% (valued at $172.5 million) of the firm's
portfolio was invested in energy companies compared to the first quarter of
2001 in which the firm sold approximately three times as much than it
bought.  As of March 31, 2001, Kingdon's energy holdings dropped to 3.3% of
the portfolio with a value of $50.7 million.

The biggest increases were felt in the consumer cyclicals sector, which
represented 10.6% of the firm's portfolio for a value of $196.7 million at
the end of 2000.  As of March 31, 2001, the firm's holdings in the consumer
cyclicals sector increased to 17.4% of the portfolio for a value of $271.4
million.  This increase was led by purchases in General Motors, Ford Motor
Co. [F] with 700,000 shares valued at $19.7 million; Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
[ANF] with 500,000 shares valued at $16.4 million; and, Galileo
International Inc. [GLC] with 724,100 shares valued at $15.9 million.

HEDGE FUND PROFILE: STARO ASSET MANAGEMENT

BRIAN STARK and MICHAEL ROTH met years ago at the prestigious Harvard Law
School.  While both may have intended to pursue very successful careers in
law, they found their success in a very different area.  After graduation,
the duo parted ways; Stark moved to Denver where he handled general
commercial litigation, antitrust law and intellectual property cases.  Roth,
on the other hand, moved to Washington, D.C. where he handled bankruptcy
cases.  It wouldn't be long before Stark would take what was once a hobby
and turn in into his profession.

Investing had always been of great interest to Stark.  According to an
article written by the Business Journal- Milwaukee, while Stark attended law
school he researched and wrote a book on complex investment strategies like
hedging, arbitrage and liquidation. This book was a culmination of his
interest in investing which began at a very early age.  With the knowledge
Stark accumulated over the years in the research and writing of his book and
managing his own money, Stark took this experience and decided to apply it
to his own investment partnership.

Founded in 1987, Staro Asset Management originally opened in New York and
later moved to Mequon, WI in 1993. The firm manages the Shepherd Investments
International, Ltd., Stark Global Fund, Ltd., Stark Europe Fund, Ltd. and
the Stark Investments, L.P. hedge funds.

The firm expanded its investment prowess when it launched BayStar
Management, which manages the Baystar Capital LP hedge fund.  Stark and Roth
are joined in the venture by STEVE LAMAR and LARRY GOLDFARB.  According to
MAR/Hedge, the fund invests in public companies through the purchase of
individually-negotiated, privately-placed securities, relying heavily on
investing in convertible securities.

Staro Asset Management uses a combination of top-down and bottom-up
analysis. In the top-down approach, the firm uses proprietary qualitative
models to screen a global universe of convertible and risk arbitrage
opportunities. The quantitative screens evaluate a convertible's fair value,
attractiveness from a historical perspective, and expected return.
Qualitative factors considered include the fundamentals of the underlying
common stock, short-term supply and demand forces affecting either the
common stock or the convertible security, and default risk. The firm then
relies on its vast experience and expertise to decide which of the uncovered
opportunities are real and which are merely apparent.  The firm will
purchase or short sell a convertible bond, convertible preferred stock,
warrant or option, coupled with the respective short sale or purchase of the
underlying security of which the convertible can be exchanged. Through out
all of the firm's affiliated funds there are no restrictions or limitations
on what sector, market-cap, or country the firm can invest in, thought it
concentrates on the G-7 markets.  It uses the same screening and selection
process in the bottom-up approach applied in uncovering optimal
risk-adjusted opportunities.

The firm's primary objective is to achieve an uncorrelated, absolute return
of 15% to 20%, net of fees. The primary strategy of the firm is convertible
hedging, which typically represents 70% to 90% of overall investing. Other
strategies are used on an opportunistic basis and will differ per fund.  In
its convertible hedging strategy, the firm will take advantage of temporary
mispricings between related securities to create positions that generate
significant streams of cash flow.  The firm finds the most attractively
priced convertible products in out-of-favor sectors.

In a shareholder letter dated May 4, 2001, the firm detailed its outlook on
the global market, stating, ""We have continued to decrease our exposure to
merger arbitrage and re-deploy the capital into other arbitrage strategies
that currently offer much more attractive risk/return profiles.""  The letter
goes on to state that, ""In convertible arbitrage, potential opportunities in
the near term are abundant.""

According to HedgeWorld, Staro Asset Management has approximately $1.5
billion in assets under management.

SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISTS UP THEIR DEMANDS

Many activist funds have continued to grow as a depressed stock market has
left many smaller cap companies with decreasing stock prices, making them
prime targets for corporate raiders and management shake-ups.   Many firms
are reluctant to become too active, instead trying to keep a low profile and
involving themselves when they believe their interest is not being
adequately represented.  Recently, Harvard Management Company entered the
fray when a company it was involved in received a tender offer.  While the
firm felt the tender offer fell short of the company's true value, it had to
take it, unable to persuade other shareholders of its position.

Many socially responsibly funds have also increasingly used proxy statements
to push their own agendas.  BP Amoco Plc - ADR [BP] recently faced a
shareholder proxy that would have forced the company to phase out its
production of oil and gas and instead focus on more environmentally friendly
means of energy production.  The measure failed, but had a good deal of
support from some pension funds and other institutional managers that have
had a record of support for environmental causes.

In a 13G filed in late October 2000, notable financier Carl C. Icahn
declared a 9.9% stake in VISX, Inc. [EYE].  However, Icahn recently failed
in his bid to oust the board of the eye surgery equipment maker.  Icahn had
repeatedly railed again VISX's management, hoping to elect his own nominees
to the company's board.

Memphis, TN-based Southeastern Asset Management, Inc. has made sizable gains
through its activist $3.4 billion Longleaf Partners Fund.  The fund was up
20.6% in an otherwise brutal 2000, and it was up 5.3% through April 30, 2001
according to Morningstar.  The fund is a traditional GARP investor, which
also takes into account, the underlying value of a company in the event of a
turnaround, or outright sale.  Stocks are purchased on current and projected
free cash flow, or cash profits minus expenditures necessary to run the
business.  When evaluating pricing, the firm determines a company's
liquidation value, or the sum of what a company's pieces would sell for on
the open market.

From January 6 to March 2, 2000, Southeastern Asset Management acquired
approximately 8.47 million shares of Aetna, Inc. [AET] according to a 13D
filing with the SEC dated March 8, 2000.  That gave Southeastern a 6.0%
share in the Hartford, CT-based insurer.   Aetna had been battered in the
market and many shareholders wanted to see the company spin off its less
profitable businesses.  In that filing, Southeastern announced its
interaction with other parties to determine the best way to increase Aetna's
true economic value.  About 1.77 million of the shares purchased were for
Southeastern's Longleaf Partners Fund.

""In this situation,"" the filing reported ""Southeastern has had conversations
with third parties, and intends to have additional conversations with these
and one or more other third parties and/or the Issuer's management,
regarding actions or transactions."" Southeastern typically works closely
with management to determine the best way to increase shareholder value.

Aetna had received a joint bid from Dutch financial company ING Group NV and
WellPoint Health Networks. ING was interested in Aetna's financial services
while WellPoint was interested in Aetna's U.S. HealthCare wing.
Southeastern's efforts were foiled, however, when Aetna sold off it's
financial services arm, while holding on to its health care operations.
Since then, Longleaf has slightly eased off on its stake, but still kept the
majority of its holding.

Top five holdings for the Longleaf Partners Fund as of March 31, 2001
included: Marriott International Inc. New [MAR] with 9,966,000 shares
(valued at $410.4 million); Waste Management Inc. Del [WMI] with 15,096,300
shares (valued at $372.9 million); General Motors Corp. [GM] with 5,000,000
shares (valued at $259.3 million); FedEx Corp. [FDX] with 5,615,000 shares
(valued at $234.0 million); and, Tricon Global Restaurants Inc. [YUM] with
5,615,000 shares (valued at $217.3 million).

Other funds have also adopted more intrusive activist programs.  The
California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) believes that good
corporate governance means the difference between short-term setback and
long-term financial difficulty.  CalPERS spent many years simply reacting to
situations, such as takeovers.  The firm has since taken a more proactive
approach to investments in adopting its Corporate Governance Core Principles
and Guidelines to achieve this end.

The firm believes that some measure must be taken to achieve long-term
profitability, but that some investors may not be willing to wait out
short-term difficulties.  The guidelines, however, are not absolute.
CalPERS readily realizes that some firm's are constrained by competitive
pressures, as well as a myriad of other factors.

The firm likes to see independent board members, and an open, shareholder
friendly environment.  This typically means the banning of greenmail and an
accessible CEO who is free of additional constraints and is capable of
acting in the best interests of shareholders.  Most important, in their
evaluation, is the appearance of an independent board of directors.

Hedge fund Wynnefield Capital Management L.L.C. has also recently entered
the fray.  The firm's Wynnefield Partners Small Cap Value L.P. recently
submitted a shareholder proposal to the board of directors at Airgas, Inc.
[ARG]. The firm is pushing for the company to sell itself or to seek out new
strategic partnerships.  The measure will go before shareholders at the
firm's annual meeting in August 2001.

Wynnefield's top five holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001
included: Sylvan Inc. [SYLN] with 1,068,886 shares (valued at $13.4
million); Pricesmart Inc. [PSMT] with 310,000 shares (valued at $12.1
million); First Aviation Services Inc. [FAVS] with 2,066,892 shares (valued
at $10.1 million); Delta & Pine Land Co. [DLP] with 275,500 shares (valued
at $6.6 million); and, CTB International Corp. [CTBC] with 723,500 shares
(valued at $6.3 million).

Many companies' boards of directors are under increasing outside pressure.
Growing demands on management from shareholders is increasingly an
inevitable part of the future.
