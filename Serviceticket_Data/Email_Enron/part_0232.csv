Okay! Real Time has finally drilled down on the problem we were having with 
deal 564094 (STCA buys from EES/HE 9-22 @ $160) and corrected the Real Time 
sheet to reflect our price. I apologize for the delay in finding the source 
of the problem, and as it turns out it was just a matter of someone putting 
the wrong price in the sheet they sent you. Very frustrating, I know, but 
I've attached the correct sheet nonetheless. Please call or e-mail with 
questions, and I'm sure I'll hear from you soon!



Thanks,

Thanks for following up on this, Melissa. I've forwarded your e-mail on to 
Chris Foster and asked him to discuss the counterparty name with Bob Ellery, 
his contact at Sierra Pacific Holding Co. I'll let you know which name we 
need (or if we need one at all) as soon as I hear back from him.

Thanks again,

Hello, Samuel Schott in Global Counterparty called this company and he was 
told that they should be set up in our system as Sierra Pacific Industries, 
Inc.  The contract has the long name on it so I am planning on asking Rhonda 
Denton about this tomorrow when she comes in.  I am not sure if it will work 
this way or not.  If you know anything else about this let me know.  Sierra 
Pacific Industries, Inc. is in Enpower but I am not certain if we should use 
that name.

I will let you know what Rhonda says tomorrow.  
Thanks,
Melissa

Subject: New CTPY Request

I just heard from Samuel (thanks for your message!) that I need to send 
Rhonda new counterparty information in order to get their names added to the 
system. I called Rhonda, but it turns out she's out of the office for the 
first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa. (That's a 
short explanation of why I'm sending this info. to all of you.)

Anyway, following is the information connected with the new counterparty name 
Chris Foster has requested:

Name: Sierra Pacific Holding Company, dba Sierra Pacific Industries
Address: PO Box 496028
    Redding, CA 96049
Or: 19759 Riverside Ave.
      Anderson, CA 96007
Phone: (530) 378-8179
Fax: (530) 378-8139
Contact: Director of Energy Resources - Robert Ellery

I also have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you'd 
like me to fax that over. Just let me know how I can help. We've already 
entered Chris's deal into the system with ""New Counterparty,"" so the sooner 
we can change that the better.

Thanks,
Kate

Chris -
Here's the latest I've heard on our request for a new counterparty name 
(Sierra Pacific Holding Co.) to be added to EnPower. I faxed the master 
agreement to Melissa Murphy so the Confirms group could reference it; then 
she passed the pertinent information along to Samuel Schott in Global 
Counterparty, whose job it is to set up new counterparties. But it looks like 
your contact at Sierra is saying this deal should be done with Sierra Pacific 
Industries - the parent company - rather than Sierra Pacific Holding Co. 

Do you have a preference either way? Maybe you could contact Bob Ellery and 
discuss this. Just let me know which name to add to the deal.

Thanks,
Kate

I spoke with Chris, and he called Alicia who said she still believes the deal 
should be for April, not May. Chris said they are in a dispute at this point, 
because he believes the term should be May. So he asked me to leave the deals 
alone for the moment, and he will be in touch later today. Would you like me

Here's the latest -
The Short Term West Services desk bought power from Sierra Pacific Holding 
Co. for 4/29 and 4/30. Then, Bob Ellery, our contact there, called the Real 
Time desk and said they had lost a unit and needed to buy some of the power 
back from us. The deals are in our system as follows:

594854
EPMI buys Sierra Pac.
NP-15
4/29 - 45 mw round-the-clock
4/30 - 40 mw round-the-clock
$218 off peak
$328 on peak

595714
Short Term West Hourly sells Automated Power Exchange (Sierra's scheduling 
coordinator)
NP-15
4/29 - 19 mw round-the-clock
$228
(Total Value = $103,968)

Because Sierra's buy-back was in the Real Time market, we sold to their SC, 
not Sierra itself. Also, confirm letters don't go out on hour-ahead trades, 
which could be why you're running into some confusion. Let me know if this 
helps, and I'll continue to look for a deal flowing on 4/30. The Real Time 
group told me there was one, but it's only for the first 6 hours, not the 
whole day. 

I'll get back to you soon.

Kate, what is the latest regarding Sierra Pacific Industries and the buy 
backs for the 29th & 30th in the amount of $103,968 for each day?  Let me 
know if I can obtain more information for you.  The payment terms are net 5 
days after receipt of invoice, which they faxed to me on April 30th.

Again, thanks for all your help regarding this and all the EES items.

Chris,
Good morning!  Hey, one thing I probably did not clarify to you yesterday on 
was that when the new deal ticket was set up for the $140 price strip (Deal 
#576468.1), the deal should only be in for (4/6/2001) according to APX's 
statement (not including 4/7/2001).  Therefore, the entire offpeak for your 
deal would be booked on Deal #572069.1 for the $150 price for 4/7/2001.  Let 
me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Chris,
One more quick thing on 4/6/2001- APX is showing 2 different prices for 
offpeak ($140 & $150 - different MW per strip).  EPMI is showing $150 @ 12/MW 
per offpeak hours.  This difference amounts to a $144 difference (APX has 
lower invoice).  Can you verify?  Everything else is fine....talk to you next 
week.  Have a good weekend.

To re-cap:

I've changed three Short Term West Hourly deals to reflect what all parties 
have agreed to - EPMI sells to Sierra Pacific Holding Co., HE 23-24 on 4/28, 
HE 1-24 on 4/29, and HE 1-6 on 4/30. Instead of selling to the Automated 
Power Exchange, we'll be using them as the broker, paying a $.03 per MW fee, 
and selling to Sierra Pacific. Following are the changed deal numbers, for 
reference:

595705
595714
595819

I believe this should clear up any discrepancies we had among different 
counterparties' invoices. Now all we have to do is cross our fingers....no, 
just kidding. Please let me know if you have questions, or if problems arise 
from these changes.

Thank you,

Chris,
Good morning!  Hey, one thing I probably did not clarify to you yesterday on 
was that when the new deal ticket was set up for the $140 price strip (Deal 
#576468.1), the deal should only be in for (4/6/2001) according to APX's 
statement (not including 4/7/2001).  Therefore, the entire offpeak for your 
deal would be booked on Deal #572069.1 for the $150 price for 4/7/2001.  Let 
me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Chris,
One more quick thing on 4/6/2001- APX is showing 2 different prices for 
offpeak ($140 & $150 - different MW per strip).  EPMI is showing $150 @ 12/MW 
per offpeak hours.  This difference amounts to a $144 difference (APX has 
lower invoice).  Can you verify?  Everything else is fine....talk to you next 
week.  Have a good weekend.

I've modified these deals to read as follows:

572069
West Services buys from APX
NP-15
On Peak - 12 MW @ $245 for flow 4/6-4/7
Off Peak - 12 MW @ $150 for flow 4/7
TOTAL MWH = 480

576468
West Services buys from APX
NP-15
Off Peak - 12 MW @ $140 for flow 4/6
TOTAL MWH = 96

Please let me know if this is correct. (I hope!) And don't hesitate to call 
me with questions or other deal corrections. I will be running between two 
different desks today, so if you can't reach me at my regular extension 
(503-464-7486), I can be reached at 503-464-3823.

Thanks,
Kate

Can you please modify that deal that you made the price $140 yesterday to 
make it for the 6th only?  The 7th is all at $150.

We did a deal in February (#533916) with a little different name.  Also we

I'm sorry my response has been such a long time coming on this issue, but 
I've visited with almost every department in our office trying to figure out 
what happened to this deal. Basically, Idaho got their scheduled cut by the 
Cal-ISO, which in turn means we have to cut our schedule flowing to Idaho. So 
Jeremy Morris, one of our California schedulers, cut the first Idaho deal he 
found and passed the remainder of the schedule to Real Time to fill, which 
they did in a separate deal. So EPMI and Idaho are in agreement that the 
schedule got cut, but that we kept them whole by selling the remainder to 
Idaho in the hour-ahead market. 

Now the question is, how do we confirm the deal? From your side, is it better 
if we leave the deal as-is, or restore it to the original 25 mw off peak and 
kill the real time deal (which wouldn't really be an accurate representation 
of what happened)? Just let me know, and we'll do what we can to help.

Thanks,
Kate

I spoke with Paul Choi, the mid-marketer who did this deal, and he said the 
deal should be with The City of Oakland, a municipal corporation, not Port of 
Oakland. Also, the contact is still Wing Lau @ 510-627-1457. I'll change it 
when Risk is done with the calc.

How in the hell do you get out of work at 3:45? Well, you've inspired me - 
I'm going to haul ass home and maybe make it there by 6 pm - whoo-hoooooo! 
But seriously, call me tonight if you get a chance. If not, I'll try you (if 
I can dig up your home number somewhere) or call when you get into town this 
weekend. I'll be around, so we HAVE to hang out at least once. 'Kay? Or I'll

I'm really sorry about the confusion - I actually just got filled in myself. 
I entered these deals for Mike Swerzbin yesterday, but he gave me an 
incorrect delivery point (mid-columbia instead of montana system border). 
Then Cara Semperger, in Scheduling, went in to change the delivery point and 
felt that the deal should be combined into one with three legs instead of 
three separate deals. 

So, in the end, she killed 597244 and 597245, and added two legs to 597246. 
I'm not sure she talked to John Malowney about any of this, otherwise he 
probably would have told her that he already approved the confirm letter.

Please let me know if you'd like comments added to this deal, and I'll do it 
right away.

Thanks for your help on this,
Kate

Help, I'm confused!  Yesterday I prepared a confirmation for three Montana 
Power deals, # 5467244, 597245, 597246.  I sent it to John Malowney and he 
approved it and I faxed it out. Today I noticed two of the deals have been 
killed and two legs added to the other deal.  I think it is the same deal, 
but can someone put notes into the deals saying what they did and why?

Thanks!

I just heard from Samuel (thanks for your message!) that I need to send 
Rhonda new counterparty information in order to get their names added to the 
system. I called Rhonda, but it turns out she's out of the office for the 
first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa. (That's a 
short explanation of why I'm sending this info. to all of you.)

Anyway, following is the information connected with the new counterparty name 
Chris Foster has requested:

Name: Sierra Pacific Holding Company, dba Sierra Pacific Industries
Address: PO Box 496028
    Redding, CA 96049
Or: 19759 Riverside Ave.
      Anderson, CA 96007
Phone: (530) 378-8179
Fax: (530) 378-8139
Contact: Director of Energy Resources - Robert Ellery

I also have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you'd 
like me to fax that over. Just let me know how I can help. We've already 
entered Chris's deal into the system with ""New Counterparty,"" so the sooner 
we can change that the better.

Thanks,
Kate

Joanie!
I have been soooo busy lately and I'm starting to feel like I sold my soul to 
the Enron devil. In fact, I have no time to be writing this e-mail right now, 
but I've been meaning to drop a line and catch up with you. I also just ran 
into Brigdet (from the class below us at SMA) at lunch - apparently she's 
married to some baseball player. Crazy! So right away I had to contact my 
ever-realistic ""single"" friend to bring me some sanity. I'm actually dating a 
guy right now, but it still gives me the chills to hear about anyone near my 
age walking down the toilet...I mean aisle. Anyway, call me, or I'll call you 
tonight - let's dish! I hope everything's great with you - I expect nothing 
less. I have lots of interesting stories to tell about how and why I've come 
to the decision that I'm sending my roommates to rehab.

Love,
Kate

I just heard from Samuel (thanks for your message!) that I need to send 
Rhonda new counterparty information in order to get their names added to the 
system. I called Rhonda, but it turns out she's out of the office for the 
first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa. (That's a 
short explanation of why I'm sending this info. to all of you.)

Anyway, following is the information connected with the new counterparty name 
Chris Foster has requested:

Name: Sierra Pacific Holding Company, dba Sierra Pacific Industries
Address: PO Box 496028
    Redding, CA 96049
Or: 19759 Riverside Ave.
      Anderson, CA 96007
Phone: (530) 378-8179
Fax: (530) 378-8139
Contact: Director of Energy Resources - Robert Ellery

I also have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you'd 
like me to fax that over. Just let me know how I can help. We've already 
entered Chris's deal into the system with ""New Counterparty,"" so the sooner 
we can change that the better.

Thanks,
Kate"

I've added the fee - these are supposed to default when traders enter the 
deals in Enpower, but for some reason Bloomberg fees aren't coming through 
lately. I'm checking with IT on this.

This is an index forward, so for round-the-clock deals we enter more than one 
in order to have peak and off-peak hours settle against the different index 
prices. 596722 is the off-peak part of this deal, and 596723 is the on-peak 
part.

Let me know if this makes any sense.

Thanks,
Kate

Because I'm not quite sure who to direct this request to, I'm e-mailing 
everyone I think might be involved in entering new counterparty names. One of 
our mid-marketers has executed a deal with Sierra Pacific Holding Company, 
which is a new counterparty name and needs to be added as a choice in 
Enpower. Please let me know if I've contacted the correct people, and if I've

I've changed both deals to FPL Energy Power Marketing. Tom said the guy who 
calls him from this counterparty each day says he's from Florida Power & 
Light - so he's going to ask him next time which counterparty he'd like us to 
specify in the deal. Also, I changed 570450 to a price of $80.

Thanks,

Kate, This is a Tom Alonso trade. For these two trades they are entered as 
Florida Power & Light. FPL Energy Power Marketing sent a confirmation over on 
this trade. Could you ask Tom if he entered the trade incorrectly for both 
deal numbers. Secondly on #570450 the confirmation shows a price of $80. We 
have $85.00 in the system. Which one is correct?

Thanks,

This deal discrepancy seems to have a few of us stumped - so I'm referring it 
to all of you in hopes that we can solve this today. Following are the terms 
of the deal:

Short Term California buys Enron Energy Services
Hours: HE 6-9
Delivery Point: SP-15
Term: 3/29/01
Price: $110

The deal was entered by Bert Meyers, a Real Time trader, on behalf of STCA. 
It was extended for HE 9 through 22 at a price of $160. In the spreadsheet 
Real Time sends to EES each day, it shows the deal as a sale at a price of 
$130, not a buy at a price of $160.  My first instinct was to simply modify 
the spreadsheet to match the deal in Enpower, but EES claims they see the 
price coming across as $130. I'm reluctant to send any more incorrect 
information to EES, as we've already dealt with enough confusion over this 
matter. Please take a look at the deal and its corresponding documents, and 
let me know which is the correct price.

Thanks for your help,
Kate"

Here's the status of those year-long deals I changed last night. Everything

Subject: Deal Change - Revision of last night's Deal Correction Report

This morning I was notified by Confirms in Houston that one of the deal 
changes I made last night didn't come through on their side. If you refer to 
the Deal Correction Report from yesterday, Mike Swerzbin did a deal with EES 
for Cal'03 that he mistakenly entered twice, once for Cal'03 (571920) and 
once for Cal'02 (571801). He killed 571920 and kept 571801, but the trade was 
actually for Cal'03. (Is everyone still with me?) So I restored 571920 and 
killed 571801 to reverse what he had done. But in my rush just before your 
calc last night I neglected to look at the volumes of the deal I was 
restoring, which incidently had been zeroed out, thus leaving Mike with no 
value for either of the deals. 

I've reinstated the volumes in deal 571920 and added the error to today's 
deal correction report. I just wanted to give you guys a heads up. Please let 
me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate

This morning I was notified by Confirms in Houston that one of the deal 
changes I made last night didn't come through on their side. If you refer to 
the Deal Correction Report from yesterday, Mike Swerzbin did a deal with EES 
for Cal'03 that he mistakenly entered twice, once for Cal'03 (571920) and 
once for Cal'02 (571801). He killed 571920 and kept 571801, but the trade was 
actually for Cal'03. (Is everyone still with me?) So I restored 571920 and 
killed 571801 to reverse what he had done. But in my rush just before your 
calc last night I neglected to look at the volumes of the deal I was 
restoring, which incidently had been zeroed out, thus leaving Mike with no 
value for either of the deals. 

I've reinstated the volumes in deal 571920 and added the error to today's 
deal correction report. I just wanted to give you guys a heads up. Please let 
me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate"

Yep - the trade's there all right. I just talked to Mike again and he said 
he'd love to take the trade, but he's sure it's an error. To avoid any 
confusion later, and because he's already left the office for today, let's 
have Mike talk to his Amerex broker tomorrow morning and clear this up. He 
just might get a sweet deal out of it!

Mike did a deal with these terms but a price of 380 - deal is #571917. But he 
said a price like $292.50 doesn't sound right for Sept. - possibly May?

Thanks for letting me know about the change in this deal. I looked at the 
audit viewer, and it jogged my memory a bit. Mike originally entered this 
deal as Q2 off peak; then he came over to me the next day and said it should 
have been Cal'03-Cal'04. So we changed it, and it must have messed up the 
strips somehow. Anyway, if it checks out with the broker, that sounds good 
enough for me.

Thanks again,
Kate "

I just talked to Chris about this. Apparently, the Reliant trader thought he 
was clicking an SP-15 trade, and called immediately afterward to ask Chris if 
it could be adjusted. It was more lucrative for Chris to do this deal at 
SP-15 than NP-15 anyway, so he agreed. I guess I'm unclear about the exact 
EOL guidelines in a situation like this, but please let me know if there's 
anyone you'd like me to talk to. Chris didn't have the trader's name offhand, 
but I could probably get him to research it a bit more. Just let me know what 
you need from us.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, 
#562373 was an EOL trade that Chris Mallory did. When it was done on line the 
delivery point was NP-15 now in Enpower it has been changed to SP-15. Could 
you check with Chris if this is correct. I thought that we were not allowed 
to change EOL trades. If he did then I will have to get with Legal to find 
out what our next step would be.

Thanks,

I've added the third leg to deal 566375 and changed comments in each leg to 
reflect that. We had a bit of confusion about who was actually adding the new 
pub code, but it's in the system now and the deal is ready to be confirmed. 
Just a note - I previously had all the Sunday and Holiday hours in the 
off-peak leg of this deal (so Risk could calc the value correctly), and now 
I've deleted those strips to account for leg 3 which contains only Sunday and 
Holiday hours. Please let me know if anything looks different, other than 
that, on your end.

I sent an e-mail to Les Rawson about these deals yesterday, but - oops! - 
he's not in the office. I just had Stan Cocke enter the unit names in them, 
so you should see the following in the comments section -

568866 - unit name is Willamett Industries Albany Paper Mill
568864 - unit name is Grays Harbor Paper Mill
568860 - unit name is Las Vegas Cogeneration Facility

DEAL 570473
bloomberg shows fee of .005

deal 570444
bloomberg shows fee of .005

deal 569957
Bloomberg shows cp as Allegheny Energy and we show Duke Energy
P.S. if this did should be Duke the correct entity should be Duke Power, a 
division.......not Duke Energy Marketing..

I've attached the EES March Dailies spreadsheet. It should reflect the latest 
volumes and hopefully will clear up some of the discrepancies we're seeing 
between EES and EPMI. Also, I've autoscheduled the following deals in an 
attempt to feed them through to the CARP report. Please let me know if you 
see the changes come through, Mark. 

The autoscheduled deals are:

533090 - 3/1/01-3/31/01
535419 - 3/2/01
535420 - 3/2/01
566081 - 3/1/01-3/31/01
550208 - 3/15/01



The last deal I'm checking on is #535568 - in your spreadsheet you said EES 
saw the on peak hours totalling 1070.75 MWH and believed the on peak hours 
should actually total 1016.75 MWH. Below are the volumes I see both in the 
EnPower deal and in the March Dailies spreadsheet. 


+____________
=         1016.75 

Maybe we need to autoschedule this one as well? Please let me know how the 
CARP report looks now, and call me with questions. Hopefully this wraps it up 
for March!

Thanks,
Kate

I just finally heard back from the traders on this deal. Apparently, Idaho's 
schedule was cut by the ISO on Sunday, and therefore, we had to cut our sale 
to them. The deal was originally 25 mw on peak, but was cut about 10 mw each 
hour. That's why each hour now shows 15 mw and some scraps. The remainder of 
the schedule we sold in the hour ahead market. This is a typical maneuver 
when the ISO cuts schedules, but I guess you guys haven't had to confirm 
daily deals in this situation before. Let me know if this is going to be a 
problem, and we'll figure something out.

Thanks,
Kate

Here is the information I received back from IT in Houston regarding the 
Forward Obligation Report. It looks like, for our purposes, the most accurate 
way to run the report is showing only term deals. The ""Schedule"" and 
""Liquidate"" versions of the report do not capture desk-to-desk deals, and 
therefore will not show our traders' positions in relation to each other, 
which I believe is what we're looking for. Am I right? Or totally crazy? Let 
me know what you think.

Thanks,
Kate

    Hi Diana & Kate,


    You are not wasting our time, you make our time valuable. You should be 
able to see ver 3.0.0.36 in production and ver 3.0.0.38 in stage,
    if not phone David Poston for support. Ver 3.0.0.38 is newer and includes 
insignifficant changes on the form for selection desks, which
    Corry Bentley requested here. They don't allow us to promote now things 
like that to production the last five days and the first day of the month.

   Now the report is able to show both the term and schedule (liquidation) 
data. The term data are the way the deal was entered with
   Deal Entry, Deal Blotter or EOL bridge, signed and confirmed. The schedule 
data should be very much the same with all the changes
   in Deal Scheduling. There is no difference between schedule and 
liquidation data, schedule data is a subset of liquidation one in time and
   it is about 2-3 weeks. At the moment the schedule strips for WEST contain 
data from 3/22/2001 to 4/5/2001, and the liquidation
   the same data from 4/2/1996. 

   Because we don't schedule normally desk-to-desk deals (I think we schedule 
between EAST and WEST only) we don't have schedule
   (liquidation) data for desk-to-desk. I hided the check box to avoid 
confusions. The option Show Desk is very simple, changes the format
   of the header for Region, nothing else.

Kroum,

I was running the new version of the Obligation Report.  I was not included 
in the testing phase of the new version and apparently the report is still 
not doing what the ""fix"" was initiated for.  Originally, my discussions with 
Doung Luu was for the Obligation report to capture: 1. All deals with any 
changes made in Deal Scheduling and  2.  All Desk to Desk deals.  Number 
(2),   I believe was the difficult one.  When selecting the option on ""Show 
Deals""  in order to capture schedule changes you must select ""Liquidate"".  
This does work, but it does not give you the option to select ""Show Desk to 
Desk"", which like I said before, was the intent of the changes.  Please 
contact me for further discussion.  I apologize for not participating and 
wasting your time.  

Sincerely,

Diana Scholtes

Subject: Forward Obligation Report Question

Good afternoon, IT Wizards -

I'm curious about a feature on the new Forward Obligation Report. It is now 
possible to run the report showing term, scheduled, or liquidated deals. In 
the past I've always run the report showing term deals, then entered my 
desk-to-desk deals from those numbers. Now I believe the report is designed 
to pull data from our scheduling database, so I'm wondering what the 
difference is between the term deal report and the scheduled deal report. 
Each produce completely different numbers! Please let me know when you get a 
chance.

There are several unit contingent deals that don't have the unit name in the

us a reference sheet, but I think it would be better if the trader would 
specify the unit in the comment section.

it probably should be confirmed.  Can you take a look at it and let me know?

Bill Williams just talked to Jake, the Sempra trader who did the trade, who 
recognized the deal and said he'd speak with Harry and clear it up. In the

These are the latest figures I have - I'm so sorry for the delay! I'm calling 
Willie Harrell in Global Risk right now to determine why these prices are not 
yet in pub posting and how we can come up with a more reliable system.

This was a futures contract done by Matt Motley, and I entered the forward 
deal. I wasn't aware that futures deals don't get confirmed. I only knew that 
when the contract expires, I need to enter a forward deal in EnPower to hold 
the trader's position. It looks like you've already added a comment about the 
trade going physical off of the NYMEX. Is there anything else you'd like me 
to add? If not, I'll just make a note in the comments section of forward 
deals entered in place of expiring futures contracts, and I'll mark ""no 
confirm"" on these deals as well.

Thanks,
Kate

Hello, 563928 is a deal that went physical off of the NYMEX.  I am not sure 
who entered the trade but if we could get you all to put a comment saying the 
trade went physical off of the NYMEX that would help us alot.  We do not 
confirm these trades.  We sent a confirm out to the counterparty for this 
trade and referenced the incorrect contract.

Thanks for your help,

DUDE! You're too good to be true. Between you and my roommates, the emanation 
of love germs is almost too much to handle. Hey, if you get this in the next 
half an hour, write back with your phone number and I'll call you when I get 
off work. (I'm leaving at 5 p.m. ON THE DOT today....whooo, hooo!) But this 
newfound life perfection sounds like it deserves a phone conversation.

Hey lady!

What's up?  I just had the most hectic week of my life!  I had such a great
time with Dad and Laura - is it just me or does he get cooler every time you
see him?  He took me, Nathan, Michelle and Monica out to this awesome
restaurant and totally paid for everyone.  I was so touched, especially
since I think they're kind of trying to watch the funds.  My car is great!
It's so little and perfect.  Then as soon as they left I went on my Outward
Bound weekend, which was incredible.  We went snowshoeing, did a ropes
course, and learned how to use a map and compass (the last thing was SO fun
- I want to buy a compass and carry it around with me everyday).  Anyway,
I'll have to tell you more about it on the phone since it was kind of
complicated, but super fun.  I had SUCH a great time, and I'm even more
convinced that this is the right job for me right now.  Nathan is still good
- I'm installing a toothbrush at his apartment, which I think is a good
sign.  He's great.

So what's going on in your life?  Call me tonight if you get a chance!

Love, yo sista

I'm not sure what's going on with these options, but I entered them as 2 PM 
expiry, then got a message that they were 2 AM from Stephanie Piwetz this 
morning, changed them AGAIN, and now they're back to 2 AM. I've changed them 
again, but I honestly have no idea why they keep going back. Please let me 
know if you see the expiry as 2 PM now.

I haven't heard anything back. I spoke with Willie on the phone Friday 
afternoon, and he said the best way to get this done quickly would be to send 
out an e-mail. I was actually just about to call and check on the request, 
but if you have a moment, could you find out where it's at in the chain of 
commmand?

Subject: New Pub Posting Request

The West traders have requested a new pub posting code to allow them to do 
deals against the Dow Jones Palo Verde Sunday index. In particular, Matt 
Motley, our Long Term Southwest trader, has executed a deal today for Cal'01 
through Cal'06 at the Palo Verde index price. It runs all days and all hours, 
so we need to enter three legs - one at the on peak price, one at off peak, 
and one at Sunday price. The 24-hour Sunday price is the only option missing 
from EnPower. Matt has asked that we get this pub code in as soon as possible 
so his deal can be entered and calced tonight. Please let me know what you 
can do.

Les -
I received this list from the Confirms group this morning. Looks like they 
need quite a few unit names for confirmation purposes. But if I remember 
correctly, you didn't want these deals confirmed. Please let me know when you 
get a chance, and I can go through and either change them to ""no confirm"" or 
add the unit names. 

Thanks,
Kate

Hello, can you check these deals and see if the counterparty name is wrong.  
They are in as Enmax Corporation and we are wondering if they should be Enmax 
Energy Corporation.  The contract did not come over correctly so we wanted to 
make sure the counterparty name is correct before we set up a new contract.

It's been changed to 250 - Chris is going to talk to Bloomberg, though, 
because he thought it was a deal for 247. I'll let you know what they work 
out.

The West traders have requested a new pub posting code to allow them to do 
deals against the Dow Jones Palo Verde Sunday index. In particular, Matt 
Motley, our Long Term Southwest trader, has executed a deal today for Cal'01 
through Cal'06 at the Palo Verde index price. It runs all days and all hours, 
so we need to enter three legs - one at the on peak price, one at off peak, 
and one at Sunday price. The 24-hour Sunday price is the only option missing 
from EnPower. Matt has asked that we get this pub code in as soon as possible 
so his deal can be entered and calced tonight. Please let me know what you 
can do.

Thanks,

Les -
Here's the latest list of unit contingent deals in need of unit names. I've 
tried referring to your unit name list and entering them myself, but it looks 
like some delivery points correspond to more than one unit. I.E. Navajo can 
originate from LV Cogen OR Saguaro Power. If you could add these unit names 
into the deals, or let me know what they are so I can enter them, it would be 
much appreciated.

Thanks,

I'd fill you in anyway. He's been talking to his contact at Constellation 
about changing these deals over, but hasn't received a concrete answer yet.

Hi Bob, I was wondering if you have contacted Constellation about the 6 
trades that are in the system with the Cal Px as the index price.  All of 
these trades start flowing in July of this year.

The deal numbers are as follows:

453152.01
453175.01
453294.01
462109.01
471888.01
471889.01

Let me know if Constellation agrees to change these deals to the Dow Jones so 
I can send a letter for them to sign.

Thanks,
Melissa

Mark -
I'm sending you two things that I hope will clarify some of these 
discrepancies. The first is an updated Real Time spreadsheet for 3/19 that 
shows the volumes for deal 553219. Bill Williams and I looked over their 
spreadsheets and could not find this deal in the 3/16 sheet - so I'm still 
wondering why EES thinks this deal should be in at a different date and 
price. 

The second document is a modified version of the sheet you sent me. In it, I 
answered the questions I could and changed things I knew were wrong. I also 
asked questions on deals where I can't find a discrepancy between my sheet 
and EnPower. 

Please keep in contact on this issue - I know this is only a start.

Kate you asked about deal #553219.1 EES shows this deal on the 16th at a

These are all West Services deals, and our services traders - Les Rawson and 
Stan Cocke - prefer to confirm their own deals with counterparties. So these 
should not be confirmed. Kim Hundl and I have been working on long lists of 
deals that went in to be confirmed and we've since gone in and changed them. 
Services, Real Time, and EES trades are among those. If you'd like, you can 
talk to her about what we decided to confirm and not confirm, or you can give 
me a call at (503) 464-7486.

You're right - Mike Driscoll entered this incorrectly, so I killed deal 
563929 and simply added three new legs to the existing deal they were trying 
to extend. Deal number 476578 now has legs 4, 5, and 6 to extend the deal 
under the same terms through April. Please let me know if this doesn't show 
up correctly for some reason.

I've made a change to a LTNW deal, per Mike Driscoll and John Malowney, 
because it was entered against the wrong index yesterday. Cara asked me to

made. And here they are -

563929 - KILLED

476578 - Legs 4, 5, and 6 added to extend deal through April

Because this is an index-forward deal, it needed to be entered against the 
on-peak, off-peak, and Sunday indices, which explains the three new legs. Let 
me know if you have any questions.

Subject: EWWW TOMATOES!

There are some Las Vegas Delight True Beef Steak tomatoes available by Jody's 
desk.

I wouldn't recommend taking ANY of them, as I'm sure they don't taste very 
good. (Yeah, right!) 

Tomatoes are available in limited quantity, so come and get it!

*NOTE* If you get a tomato that is somewhat green, that means it's probably 
not good. You can put it on my desk and I'll take care of it. =o) 
OR, you can keep it on your counter for a day or two and it'll be ripe and 
ready to go! (I recommend doing the first thing...)

Subject: Derivatives I Training Course - June 4th and 5th

We will be offering Derivatives I training on-site.  If you are interested in 
attending, please let Amy FitzPatrick know no later than May 21st.

Derivatives I - Applied Energy Derivatives
Presented by Paradigm Strategy Group

Date:    Monday, June 4th and Tuesday, June 5th
Time:  8:00 am to 5:00 pm

This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical 
understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that 
are traded and marketed today.  An emphasis is placed on understanding how 
financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management 
needs of clients.

Participants attending this seminar will be able to:

Formulate customer hedge strategies based on a solid understanding of risk; 
its impact on capital structures and approaches to its mitigation.
Develop and interpret forward prices in the context of arbitration 
disciplines, as well as understand the divergences from these disciplines 
that are characteristic of energy prices.
Identify marketing opportunities through an understanding of both the forward 
curve and the distortions created by the physical system of production and 
transportation.
Assemble the pricing of a transaction from a benchmark price curve.
Devise cost-reducing deal structures for gas storage from an understanding of 
price curves and their components.
Exploit differences in locational pricing with insights into the relationship 
between basis and transportation/transmission.
Structure a natural gas and power swap to hedge a company's risk position, 
explaining its risks and benefits as a risk management tool.
Price a swap from the price curve and customize the structure to meet various 
customer needs including earnings, cash flow and embedded financing. 
Apply basis swaps to either mitigate locational risk or to achieve a more 
favorable risk/reward position by altering the index location.
Attain a fluency in language concepts and hedging application of options.
Package strips of options to create caps, floors and zero-premium collars.
Create structures that provide energy users with sub-index pricing using 
embedded options.
Recognize options embedded in common supply contracts and their pricing 
implications, including swing, double-ups and index contracts with maximum 
prices, etc.

I'm checking with Chris Foster and Chris Mallory, who are apparently the ones 
initiating these trades. Both are out of the office right now, so it might be 
tomorrow before I can get back to you on this. But my guess is that if APX 
does not want to receive confirms on daily deals, then we don't need to send 
them. I'll let you know for sure as soon as I talk to the traders.

Thanks,

Hey Kate! I received a phone call from a Jim Cross from Automated Power 
Exchange. Now that we are confirming daily's he mentioned that he did not 
want to receive dailys per the APX Master Agreement. He told me that all 
trades are anonimus under the APX agreement and we should not be confirming 
theses. Examples: #563948 and #563381. Some of the trader doing these trades 
are Chris Mallory and Les Rawson. Could you ask them is we should continue to 
confirm these daily's or not?

Thanks

Following are the deals I changed to the correct time zones, per Will Smith's 
list:

520330 - forward
373613 - forward
359846 - EOL
353314 - EOL
352613 - EOL
349391 - EOL

349242 - EOL
330282 - EOL
300686 - forward
272524.2 - forward
220845 - forward

Most of these were just April deals, and it looks like they all suffered from 
the same incorrect default we ran into before. On the longer term deals I 
made sure to choose ""no"" when it asked if I would like to clear all routes 
for the deal; but let me know if you find anything out of the ordinary.

Subject: Re: APS/Pinnacle West  

Hello Kate,
APS and Pinnacle...We ran into a problem checking out for the end of the 
month, because a few deals had Pinnacle in the system, but Bloomberg on the 
bro confirm.  We had to ch them to match the broker confirms, because APS 
showed the deals as APS on there side.  They are trying to segregate 
companies little by little.  We have been told by Rhonda, our contract 
administrator that trading under both names are legally correct, both are 
under WSPP.  

DeeDee from Pinnacle said all trades are with Pinnacle unless Bloomberg 
trade; then cp should be APS.  DeeDee said shortly all trades will be under 
Pinnacle, but did not give me a specific date.       

Please let the traders know that all trades should be with Pinnacle West, and 
APS that are transacted with Bloomberg.  No, we will not have problems 
recognizing the old name, Rhonda says they will just be assigned over to 
Pinnacle, but we will not have to revise confirms.  Hope this helps!
Thanks
Stephanie

Regarding the last deal, Mike Driscoll talked to his broker at Bloomberg last 
night and asked him to change their confirm to say Pinnacle West. The broker 
said he'd check on it, but that Bloomberg hadn't switched their contract over 
yet and he didn't know if they could check a deal out under the new name. So 
we left it, under the impression that Bloomberg was actually in the wrong. My 
question is - has APS switched over to Pinnacle West entirely, and when or if 
Bloomberg starts recognizing Pinnacle as the counterparty are we going to 
have problems with deals containing the old counterparty name? I'm just 
trying to clarify, so I can let the traders know what to expect. Thanks for 
your help.

I just spoke to DeeDee of Pinnacle West, we verballed deals and she said all 
deals should be under the Pinnacle West name unless for Bloomberg 
transactions.   Please review the following 

Mark Fischer
563906.01  non brokered > cp name should be Pinnacle West
563907.01  non brokered > cp name should be Pinnacle West

562226.01  Bloomberg, cp name should be Arizona Public Service.  (Evelyn 
inquired about this yesterday)

Hi Bob, I was wondering if you have contacted Constellation about the 6 
trades that are in the system with the Cal Px as the index price.  All of 
these trades start flowing in July of this year.

The deal numbers are as follows:

453152.01
453175.01
453294.01
462109.01
471888.01
471889.01

Let me know if Constellation agrees to change these deals to the Dow Jones so 
I can send a letter for them to sign.

Thanks,
Melissa

Kate,

No we don't need to confirm those deals they are to replace deals entered by 
Real Time incorrectly.

Les -
Here's the latest list of unit contingent deals in need of unit names. I've 
tried referring to your unit name list and entering them myself, but it looks 
like some delivery points correspond to more than one unit. I.E. Navajo can 
originate from LV Cogen OR Saguaro Power. If you could add these unit names 
into the deals, or let me know what they are so I can enter them, it would be 
much appreciated.

Thanks,
Kate

According to Les, we don't need to confirm any of these deals. I guess they 
were deals done by the Real Time desk on behalf of Services, but they were 
entered incorrectly. Thanks for checking, though.

I wanted to check with you on this. All these deals are entered in your book, 
and I know the Services desk typically does their own confirmations with 
counterparties. However, these deals have comments in them that say they 
replace other deals. In that case, would you like them confirmed by Houston? 
Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

563906 - changed to Pinnacle West
563907 - changed to Pinnacle West
562226 - changed to APS

Regarding the last deal, Mike Driscoll talked to his broker at Bloomberg last 
night and asked him to change their confirm to say Pinnacle West. The broker 
said he'd check on it, but that Bloomberg hadn't switched their contract over 
yet and he didn't know if they could check a deal out under the new name. So 
we left it, under the impression that Bloomberg was actually in the wrong. My 
question is - has APS switched over to Pinnacle West entirely, and when or if 
Bloomberg starts recognizing Pinnacle as the counterparty are we going to 
have problems with deals containing the old counterparty name? I'm just 
trying to clarify, so I can let the traders know what to expect. Thanks for 
your help.

The missing Richter trades are all EES sleeves that he neglected to enter 
before leaving for Houston this afternoon. Since Risk is running their calc, 
Chris Mallory said he's enter the deals first thing in the morning. 

The Fischer deals - 563728 and 563729 - have been changed to Constellation, 
per Matt Motley who did the trades.

And the other two deals where the brokers have been changed look fine. Would 
you let me know beforehand next time, just in the offhand chance that the 
trader entered other things in the deal incorrectly? Thanks for your help.

In regards to the e-mail you just sent - this is the most recent information 
I sent you and Brooklyn. Is this what you were missing?

Also, in response to your question about deal 595155 - where we show a buy 
from EES but Brooklyn doesn't show a sale on her side - this deal is shown in 
EnPower as well as my sheet. If you looked in the fixed price column of the 
sheet for 4/28, under SP-15, you'll see a sale for 10 MW hours 6 through 22. 
I'm not sure what it is, but somewhere there's a missing link between us and 
EES, because on my side this deal looks perfectly normal.

I'll also be sending along some revised Real Time sheets per my conversation 
with Brooklyn yesterday - you should receive those shortly. In the meantime, 
look over my sheet and let me know if you see the deal in question on the 
28th.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Re: Latest Information On April EES Items  

At long last, I've sorted through these deals and determined the source of 
most of these problems. I'll be calling you both shortly to go over these and 
make sure we all see the same thing. Here are a few things to note as you go 
over my responses:

566426 - rates have been changed/has this shown up on your CARP report yet?
578856 - deal done by Real Time trader at hour-ahead market price/will not 
correspond directly to the price shown in my spreadsheet
573862 - rate for this deal should not be $107 OR $168.45/it is an off peak 
sale from EPMI to EES, which means we go by the off peak short position price 
- shown in my sheet as $119.76

The newest deals in this variance list are Real Time. I've double-checked the 
deals in EnPower with what I see in the Real Time spreadsheets, and 
everything seems to match up. I'm attaching those sheets so we can ensure 
we're all looking at the same thing. If you have further discrepancies on 
these, the easiest way for me to clear them up would be if you include the 
specific hours you have questions about.

I'm terribly sorry for the delay in getting back to you on this - it's a 
twisted and time-consuming journey trying to find the source of these 
problems, as I'm sure you know! I hope this gets us up to speed, but please 
call me with questions or comments.

Thanks,

Please accept my apologies for this worksheet's absence yesterday. It was 
undergoing cosmetic improvements to more accurately represent the EES-EPMI 
position. Note two new column headings as of 3/27 - ""Transmission"" and ""Other 
EnPower"" deals. Also, a change has been made to the SP-15 volumes in the 3/2 
sheet. This change was made per Daniel Kang at EES and Chris Foster at EPMI. 
And as always, feel free to contact me with questions.

Thanks,

A heads up -

The Forward Obligation report for 3/28 will show Short Term Northwest with a 
50 MWh short position off-peak at NP-15. This is due to an option that Sean 
and Diana decided not to exercise. Thought that might clear up at least one 
of the many discrepancies we may find on that report.....

This was one of a slew of deals that one of our schedulers ran across that 
had the wrong time zone in the strips. According to Duong Luu, there was an 
EOL application error that was incorrectly populating deals that flow over 
4/1/01 - the first of day of Daylight Savings Time. Duong said the error has 
since been fixed. But for the incorrect deals, we had to go in and change all 
the strips back to PPT and re-save the deals so the time zones would populate 
correctly. Hope this doesn't cause too much confusion - but nothing should 
change other than that the MWH will be flowing on the correct hours now. Let 
me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate

We just found that the other two options we entered yesterday were NOT, in 
fact, round-the-clock deals. We've changed 547682.2 to on peak hours only, 
and 426659.2 to off peak hours only. All three deals will be included on our 
deal correction report, but I thought I'd give you a heads up.

Thanks,

I am so sorry I slacked on this - I guess I didn't see you around the office 
and it just got bumped off the mental ""list of things to do."" Don't worry - 
I've transfered it to a hard copy list now. Enjoy!

I've changed it to off-peak only. I was entering forward deals to exercise 
options yesterday, and they were all RTC besides this one - thanks for 
catching that. It should be good now.

Kim - 
I've finished changing the list of deals you faxed over to no confirm. Please 
let me know if you continue to see these deals on your new deal report. I 
still had questions on some of the Short Term and Long Term Northwest deals. 
On those I will defer to Diana Scholtes. I also have questions on the 
following deals:

557772 - why are we not confirming a daily with Pacificorp?
552516 - why are we not confirming a daily with Riverside?

And there were two deals I couldn't for the life of me read on that fax, so 
you may still see deals showing up that don't necessarily need to be 
confirmed.


Diana - 
I know we had decided not to confirm deals done with Portland General 
Electric, but before I change the following deals to ""no confirm"" I want to 
clarify under what conditions we do not confirm with this counterparty.
 1. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is elsewhere (Mid-C, 
Montana System, etc.), do we confirm?
 2. If the counterparty is something other than PGE and the delivery point is 
Portland General System, do we confirm?
 3. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is Portland General 
System, do we confirm? 
I apologize for asking so many questions, but I've got a long list of deals 
in front of me and before I create an irreparable mess I wanted to check that 
I'm doing this right. Please let me know.

I just spoke with Holli Krebs about Grant County this afternoon. She said the 
confirms had already been signed by Tim Belden and gone through one of our 
lawyers, Jan King. Jan told Holli that she had sent the signed confirms down 
to someone in Houston - Holli thought it was you. Apparently Holli got a 
message from both you and me last week while at a WSPP conference, and called 
Jan to tell her to send the confirms out - so Jan sent them AGAIN. So if you 
still haven't seen those confirms come across your desk, then either someone 
else is receiving them or they're going to the wrong fax number. I've left a 
note for Jan King and hopefully we'll talk in the morning so I can find out 
more specifically where she's been sending the confirm letters. Sorry for all 
this confusion. We'll talk tomorrow.

Thanks,
Kate

That's strange - I entered these deals for Matt yesterday, and specifically 
typed 2 p.m. into the expiry date. Somehow it changed over, but I've changed 
it back and re-saved it - so it should read 2 PM.

Sharen Cason in the Confirms group will be expecting your phone call. Her 
number is 703-853-3001.

I talked to her about the difference in energy types, to satisfy my own 
curiosity, and she explained that the CAISO modifier acts as a flag to her 
group that the deal was done in California and therefore should have an NP15, 
SP15, or ZP26 delivery point. If the energy type is CAISO, they need to 
include different language in their confirmation letter to the counterparty. 
While CAISO is still essentially firm energy, it has different stipulations, 
she said. 

I didn't go into detail with her, because the bottom line is that none of our 
real time deals should reach the confirms desk anyway. I'm working with IT in 
Houston and here to have West Hourly deals default to ""no confirm,"" but until 
that gets done your best defense from the constant, nagging onslaught of 
petty deal entry error messages is to have your group check and double-check 
that they've marked their deals ""NO"" under the Confirmation heading. More 
information than you ever wanted on this subject? I thought so.

These deals were entered today under STWH desk - Geir and Mark show as the 
traders on them, but I have a feeling that's incorrect as I haven't seem them 
around this morning. Might let the guys know that when they trade at 
California delivery points - NP15, SP15, ZP26 - the energy firmness should be 
specified as CAISO firm.

Kate

Just wanted to give you an update on my progress so far - I'm changing these 
deals in between each of my other daily tasks, and I'm also having a hard 
time reading some of the deal numbers. I've made it through the first page 
and a bit of the second. I've changed all but four of the deals to ""no 
confirm."" Here are the questions I have on those deals:

1. 552516 - why are we not confirming a City of Riverside deal? Should I ask 
Jeff?

2. 553037 - looks like it's already ""no confirm""

3. 553666/667/668 - are we not confirming any deals where PGE is the 
counterparty? I thought it was just where PGE System was the delivery point?

4. 553926 - this deal is killed. Do we have to change settings on killed 
deals as well?

Also, if you have a slightly bigger copy of the document you faxed over, or 
if you could e-mail it to me, that would save me a lot of guessing time. 
Thanks for your help!

I think that sounds like a great idea. It doesn't really serve a purpose to 
have all the time zones as a choice in Deal Blotter if EnPower is going to 
sort them out anyway. We're just doubling up on the work that the application 
already knows how to do. In the meantime, I'll sort through these deal 
numbers and change time zones that flow over the first week in April. Let me 
know if that sounds good.

Yep, the time zone glitch.  I think he was looking at all deals in the 
system.  I almost think we should deal with this April, and worry about the 
rest when it comes up.   Will and I are also kicking around making the only 
choice in deal entry PPT.  Let Enpower sort out the rest.  We can modify 
stuff on the strip level, but PPT would be the only choice in blotter and at 
the top of regular deal entry.

How does that sound?

I'm unclear as to what Will found in these deals that needs to be looked at. 
The first one (scary!!) has notes in the comments section of each leg that

We don't have any regular on or off-peak deals for Sunday. In regard to 
sending index prices via e-mail, I think it will be a lot more efficient for 
everyone involved to do it this way. I only feel badly I didn't think of it 
before! I will begin e-mailing each morning starting tomorrow, and it's no 
problem for me to add counterparty's names to the spreadsheet - I just have 
to get in the habit of doing it.

Thanks again,

 Hello Kate, thank your so much for everything.  Me and Jennifer both
like email better than fax.  Therefore, you can start emailing to us from
now on.  About counter-party, we prefer to be on the report but if it takes
too much of your time then it is up to you to include it or not.  We need
conter-party's name when we confirm any kind of mismatch problem.  If you
include on the report, it save you from us calling you.  Otherwise, we have
to call you and ask for counter-party's name when we need to confirm any
transactions.  It is your call.
 Again, thank you and feel free to call me if you have any further
questions/concerns.

P.S.  By the way, do you have any regular Firm On and Off Peak for Sunday?

Amy - This is a copy of the job description you sent out to the floor when I 
took the Deal Control position. I've modified it slightly to reflect some of 
my own observations of the position.

There is a position available in Deal Control, reporting to Jeff Richter and 
the Short Term California desk. If you're interested in applying, please 
contact Amy FitzPatrick by (INSERT DATE HERE).

Following is a summary of the responsibilities associated with this position:

To facilitate the entry of West Power deals, including short term and long 
term desks and the services desk, into the trading systems.
Follow-up with Deal Clearing Settlements groups in Houston to verify accuracy 
of trades in the system.  This includes timely follow-up with the traders for 
clarification. 
Ensure that all trades are entered by a daily deadline.
Calculate and report weighted averages of daily price and volume to Dow Jones.
Prepare and distribute daily reports to ensure all books are balanced and 
report discrepancies to management.
Track and report daily and monthly error discrepancies to management and 
deliver reports for possible solutions to rectify errors.
Calculate weighted averages between brokered trades and trades executed 
through Enron OnLine and the Intercontinental Exchange.
Report any technical mishaps to appropriate personnel in Houston and track 
computer problems until demonstrated resolutions.
Test any updated versions of applications requested by programmers and report 
back any adjustments needed.

The most important attributes one must possess to succeed in this position 
are persistance and a positive attitude. Working knowledge of Microsoft Excel 
is essential, as is a general software aptitude.

How does that sound? Let me know if you need more.

Hello Cara,

We have determined that the EOL Bridge in production is currently working and 
handling time zone issue very well.
Back in June 2000, there is a bug, which related to time zone issue and we 
fixed it since then. All deals that you
provided to us had entered before July 2000.

We will run a query to identify if there are any other deals, which have 
similar problem with time zone.

Please let me know if you find more problems with EOL Bridge, we will fix it 
immediately.

Your help is highly appreciated

Regards,
dluu

I ran across a bunch of EOL deals that have not represented the April Time 
zones right. They marked through April 6th as PST. Daylight savings time is 
on April 1.  I don't see any new deals so I am hoping that it was something 
in the programming that was corrected.  Steve, we will let you know if we see 
any new ones, but the latest one looks like it was done a while ago. All of 
these deals are fixed.

I just ran a forward ob for April 2 to check for deals that are in PST when 
they should be PDT. 
 
Do you want to change all of these to PPT deals, or do you have time 
constraints today?  I need these changed today because we are already setting 
up for April.

Here's the latest I've heard from Diana regarding the deals with a PGE 
delivery point. The four you e-mailed me this morning are all daily deals 
with PGE and therefore do not need to be confirmed, so they are entered 
correctly. I believe Kim Hundl and I discussed this before; but let me know 
if you have further questions.

Thanks,

I just heard the same.  I was talking to Tim about the requirements being 
made regarding daily confirmations, and the final decision was not to confirm 
PGE daily deals.  Question though,  when we put deals into the system in 
Blotter, they automatically confirm.  Do we have to go into every deal and 
switch the flag or is there a better way around it?

Anna - You're stoked on the song thing. You'll never guess how cool mine is 
though. It's ""Don't go breakin' my heart"" by Elton John and Kiki Dee! 
Remember the song he sang with Minnie Mouse on that Disney video we used to 
watch all the time? I LOVE that song. Anyway, I had already started a reply 
to your previous e-mail, so I'll just send it along with this one.....

I love you madly and dearly! You're the only one who's managed to say 
anything of worth about this whole incidence. Amber and Molly stared at me 
blankly and said something like, ""Don't be so overly dramatic,"" and then 
rationalized the whole thing saying he was probably tired and needed to hang 
out with his friend who just broke up with his long term girlfriend and blah 
blah blah. It was really disappointing that they didn't understand the 
importance of NEVER being rational when it comes to men. It was so not fun. 
But I was really proud of myself, because I left work fuming, on the verge of 
tears, and by the time I got home I was smiling and joking with Amber and 
Molly about how schnockered they had been the night before. Then Molly and I 
took a big long walk and got awesome Thai food, brought it home, and watched 
the Thursday night line-up. All in all, it was a very successful evening 
WITHOUT runner man, whose name by the way is Dave. (Take one point off for 
that.) And guess what? He ended up calling at about 8:30. Molly was on the 
other line and neglected to answer the call or tell me there might be a 
message, so awhile later when I got a call from Jill, Dave's friend's 
girlfriend who I'm also friends with (this all gets very complicated), I was 
very confused that she asked me to go out for a beer with ""us."" I just 
assumed she was with her boyfriend and Dave, and made up some sweet excuse 
about how I had just eaten and was too full to move, because I was like, no 
way is that guy going to have his lackeys call me and expect me to show up. 
NO WAY! So that was that....or so I thought. At about 10 p.m., runner man 
himself calls, and basically admits that he's psycho for cancelling our date 
and then calling me all night long. Ya think?! Anyway, he tells me he was in 
this enormously bad mood after work and had to sweat it out on a bike ride 
and didn't want me to see him in such a bad state. I still thought it was a 
lame excuse and that once you'd reached the ripe age of 31 you should be 
smart enough to just say something instead of lamely ditch someone. So I told 
him that, and he said he agreed and could he please come over and make me and 
my roommates dinner and finish mowing our lawn (which he had started the 
other night when he was over) to make it up to me. I told him if he did that 
he might bring his balance back to zero instead of being in the read which is 
where he is now. (that's finance lingo) Anyway, the plan is he's going to 
come over and help me make salads and bread and drinks for like 20 people who 
we somewhere along the way invited to our house tonight, although I don't 
remember doing that. Anna, you have to stay with me one night when you're 
home in June because it's a constant riot. I won't go into some of the things 
Amber did the other night right now, but I'll tell you soon so you can swap 
stories when you see her. By the way, she snagged an armload of my clothes, 
actually most of which were yours, to wear at fancy dinners in Denver, so if 
you see anything you want back, just let her know. I think it's just that red 
Laundry shirt and the REALLY short black bcbg skirt. Hey guess what - I have 
to go. I'll call you tonight!

Take care, 
kate

That sucks, Kate.  I bet that isn't the last we'll be seeing of Mr. Running
Man, though.  First of all, who gets scared off by drunk roommates?  If
anything it should be a relief to him that he doesn't need to impress any of
your clan.  Second, it sounds like the classic insecure blow-off to me.  If
you think back, you'll probably remember a couple of instances in which your
demeanor/comments/facial expression may have sent him the message that he is
the stupidest thing on God's green earth.  I know this because I have the
same habit.  So he probably went home, mulled over those few devastating
instances, and came to the conclusion that you're not that into it.  And
being a man (only men and Symes's do this), he cancelled on you before you
had the chance to crush his ego once again.  Am I right?  I think so.

Tentatively planning on going out with Amber and Monica on Saturday night.
I'm mad that I'm hanging out with your roommate before I get to hang out
with you!  Monica and I are thinking of splitting your ticket, since we know
you'll never save the money (like I should talk).  You have to come out
here, though.  It's about 67 degrees right now and it's 9:00 in the morning
on a day in March.  I can't believe how happy this sun makes me!  You would
love it, too.

Okay, feel better, and don't sweat the stupid running guy.  If he thinks
he's not worthy of you, chances are he's not.  A stiff margarita will make
this whole problem a lot more manageable, don't you think?  You should go
have one.  Love you!

Anna

livid right now there's smoke coming out of my ears. I need to go finish

hey poopstain,

What's up?  I am sooooo good.  Dad and my car will be here on Monday, isn't
that great?  I just want to drive for the rest of my life!  So I get three
days off next week, plus I'm leaving for my outward bound course next
friday.  So basically I have like a week vacation!  Things are still going
with the cute waiter (Nathan), but I've discovered a flaw.  It was only a
matter of time, you know.  Actually, it's a non-fatal flaw, it's annoying
at
worst.  Basically, he carries his cell phone everywhere and answers and
talks on it in all types of situations, such as the video store, a taxi
cab,
and while eating dinner with his friends.  I just can't stand those things.
It's one thing to chat on it when you're walking down the street by
yourself
or in your car by yourself, but when you're with other people or in the
checkout line at the video store and there are people waiting for you, I
just think it's so rude.  But I'm going to try to get over it, because
otherwise he's great, and I seem to be the only person on God's green earth
who has not caught onto the whole cell phone craze.  So that's my life,
what's going on in yours?

love, anna

The last two LTNW deals - 349864 and 318870 are changed to correct time 
zones. They gave me the option to choose ""no"" for rerouting of schedules. 
They were both EOL deals.

I just ran a forward ob for April 2 to check for deals that are in PST when 
they should be PDT. 
 
Do you want to change all of these to PPT deals, or do you have time 
constraints today?  I need these changed today because we are already setting 
up for April.

Hi Kate,

Thanks for the email.  Sorry it's taken me a while to respond but it's chaos
here as we prepare to head off for the next part of our trip today.  Glad to
hear the glow of the screen still has you enthralled.  Keep hitting F9 and
all will be well.  The bit when the screen flashes like a disco ball means
your pay is being cut.  I hope all those hideous applications I built that
you were using haven't blown sky high.  But you know I did put little bugs
in all of those things so that they would stop working about 4 months after
I left.  Sorry!  I neede to ensure there would be work for me to do when/if
I come back.

Your plans for a summer escape sound fun.  But what you should really do is
come out to Jackson with Elliot at the beginning of May.  We're planning a
debauched weekend here right after we finish a section of the trip.  Should
be fun.  Just the thing for relieving stress from staring at the screen.  By
the way, have you seen the movie Office Space?  I'd recommend it.

Please check that Elliot is actually working from time to time.  He does
this routine where he'll have a bunch of things up on his screen, but his
eyes are actually closed.  Whenever you see that, just throw something at
him.  Of call his phone and says it's Jeff Skilling.

Hope all is well in sunny Portland.  Keep me posted on any unseemly office
gossip.

Talk to you soon.

Winston

I have made the following adjustment to our EPMI sales to EES on 3/1 at SP-15.

534313 - existing fixed price forward sale - volumes have been reduced by 18 
mw per hour

559314 - new index sale added and backdated (2/28)  to reflect 18 mw off peak 
hours
559316 - new index sale added and backdate (2/28) to reflect 18 mw on peak 
hours

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this change. At the 
end of last month Short Term California handed responsibility of Dow Jones 
index sales over to the Short Term West Services desk; unfortunately the 
exact date of change-over was miscommunicated, and the index sale was not 
entered for 3/1. However, the total MWh of EPMI's sale to EES should not 
change for 3/1. Also, you should see the new volumes reflected in the EES 
daily volumes worksheet which I will send later this afternoon.

Thanks for your patience,
Kate Symes

503107 and 503112 have both been changed to reflect the correct time zones. I 
checked the strips after changing them to PPT and it looks like Deal Entry 
separated them correctly between PST and PDT. I'm working on the rest now.

That's weird, because nothing traded for nearly that low for April today. 
Mike's exact words were, ""there's no way it's $258."" So if anyone from Prebon 
is still there, let them know the trader is sticking with his price.

559066----I just checked with Prebon and for some reason they show price as

559091----Is a good deal with Bloomberg.

Therefore, the only deal in question now is 559066 and Prebon shows $258 as 
price and we show $358.

Please advice.

That's hilarious! My theme song for life is ""Don't go breaking my heart"" by 
Elton John and Kiki Dee, which incidentally has always been one of my 
favorites. I remember first hearing it on a Disney special where Elton did a 
duet with Minnie Mouse. What a kick! Thanks.

550206 - price is in correctly at $187.27 because this deal is a sale from 
EPMI to EES
 (550205 is the deal where EPMI buys from EES - price is therefore $5 less 
than weighted average, making it $177.27)

552990 - price is in at $195 off peak and $295 on peak, which are the prices 
reflected in my worksheet 
 Brooklyn may be looking at a price for a real time deal. If the desk is 
Short Term West Hourly, that means the deal was done in the    hour-ahead, 
not day-ahead market, and the price will be different. Bill Williams at the 
real time desk should be sending out a spreadsheet   outlining the deals 
they've done on EES's behalf. 

Please let me know if this answers your questions. Or call and we can discuss 
it person to person.

Thanks,

Hey! I'm so brain dead this morning I didn't even notice. But I'm sooooo glad 
you had a good experience. I just think he's the nicest guy, so I bombard him 
with people needing haircuts constantly. You know when I first went to him it 
was because I couldn't get in to see my regular lady and he was the only 
stylist who wasn't booked - now he never has a spare second! It makes me feel

Would you mind e-mailing Evelyn your contact information at the APX? And I 
can't recall whether or not we wanted to confirm these trades. Let me know 
when you get a chance, and I'll take care of it with the Confirms group.

I'm sorry, but I can't give you full credit on your answer to the second part 
of my question. The correct answer was the author's use of the word 
""stunning"" to describe the $6.2 billion figure. The word is clearly an 
editorialization on the amount of the refund requested, and is therefore 
journalistically incorrect.  In addition, you failed to extemporize on why a 
journalist for an energy trade magazine would leave such gaping holes in 
his/her story. 

But because I'm feeling lenient this morning, I'll give you the details.

There was no date.

Details in exchange for this - 

I read an article this morning that quoted an ISO market analyst speaking 
about the $6.2 billion the system operator would like to recover in charges 
since last spring: ""We are not saying now that these are overcharges. We are 
telling the FERC that we see these as the amounts that we deem 'excessive.'"" 
The lead of the story was this: ""The California Independent System 
Operator......significantly upped the ante Thursday when it told the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission that 21 generators and suppliers should refund 
the state a stunning $6.2 billion for electricity sold into the state since 
last May."" 

First of all, tell me what the difference is between ""overcharges"" and 
""excessive"" charges. If there isn't one, give me your opinion on why this 
analyst would say such a stupid thing. Second, give me one reason why the 
lead is journalistically incorrect, and one why it is gramatically 
unattractive. 

Then you get details.

Subject: California Energy Crisis

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state. "

After the day's confusion has settled down, I can't quite remember if you're 
the one who called me on this deal. It's a short term west hourly deal and 
there was some indication it should be with PPL Montana and not Montana 
Power. Bill Williams, real time manager, told me they trade with Montana 
Power all the time, so this trade should be good. I've changed the deal to no 
confirm, and we're working with IT to get the deal entry settings to default 
to no confirm for all real time deals (so hopefully this won't happen again). 
Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate"

I just left you a voice-mail, but thought I'd follow up with a text message 
as well. I can send you lists of all the people who work in each of these 
groups, but not all of them use Enron Online. To make this information as 
efficient as possible, I want to be sure of what you're looking for before I 
send you a huge list of names and make it more confusing than it needs to be. 
The other thing I just thought of is that I run an EOL deal count report 
every night which includes the West Desk's EOL and brokered deal counts for 
the day, month-to-date, and sometimes year-to-date. So I may already have 
this information or may be able to get it very easily. For now, I'll send you 
the list of our traders who use EOL. And please let me know what else I can 
do to assist.

West Power Traders
Tim Belden
Matt Motley
Mike Swerzbin
Mike Driscoll
Bob Badeer
Sean Crandall
Diana Scholtes
Tom Alonso
Mark Fischer
Jeff Richter
Chris Mallory
Jeremy Morris
Phil Platter

Again, these are the traders in this office who currently use Enron Online. 
Our other groups - mid-marketing, origination, and fundamentals - do not 
trade online. I believe that development in San Francisco also does not trade 
online.

Thanks,
Kate

Well, to tell you the truth, it sucks right now. Work has been snowballing 
with all kinds of unimaginable computer problems, so many that I've basically 
forgotten what they all are now. And on top of that, runner guy stopped by 
last night and it happened to be the last day of Amber's finals so she and 
Molly had been drinking since 2 p.m. Well, I'm not quite sure if that scared 
him away, but we were supposed to go to a movie tonight - he asked me, I 
accepted, we had a time picked out - now I NEVER make plans as a rule, but 
this was a goddamn plan. So he calls 15 minutes ago and actually CANCELS. Not 
even just that, he doesn't give a REASON. I am so livid right now there's 
smoke coming out of my ears. I need to go finish work so I can get out of 
here and go bomb his car. I'll call you tonight.

hey poopstain,

What's up?  I am sooooo good.  Dad and my car will be here on Monday, isn't
that great?  I just want to drive for the rest of my life!  So I get three
days off next week, plus I'm leaving for my outward bound course next
friday.  So basically I have like a week vacation!  Things are still going
with the cute waiter (Nathan), but I've discovered a flaw.  It was only a
matter of time, you know.  Actually, it's a non-fatal flaw, it's annoying at
worst.  Basically, he carries his cell phone everywhere and answers and
talks on it in all types of situations, such as the video store, a taxi cab,
and while eating dinner with his friends.  I just can't stand those things.
It's one thing to chat on it when you're walking down the street by yourself
or in your car by yourself, but when you're with other people or in the
checkout line at the video store and there are people waiting for you, I
just think it's so rude.  But I'm going to try to get over it, because
otherwise he's great, and I seem to be the only person on God's green earth
who has not caught onto the whole cell phone craze.  So that's my life,
what's going on in yours?

love, anna

I have ran the Forward Obligation report Version 3.0.0.36, and have checked 
it against scheduling.   Everything looks perfect.  Thank you for all your 
hard work.

Great job, Kroum!

It's changed to APS. I'm wondering about the status of APS and Pinnacle - I 
guess the traders here had heard we were now doing our trades with Pinnacle, 
not APS. Is this incorrect? Do you know who might know about that?

Thanks,

Greetings from the land of watery-eyed, flat-assed office workers! How goes 
the burly mountain man thing? I've been hearing second hand from Elliot that 
you're faring extremely well mentally despite some poorly crafted sleeping 
bags and a bad case of frostbite on your toes. (That second part I made up, 
but it sounded appropriate given the sleeping bag situation.) All's well 
here. As you could imagine, and probably often do, the sweeping expanse of 
people staring at computers that is Enron has changed not at all since you 
left. There are still many computers, many of them have changed positions, 
some have gone away, most we are not sad to see go. That's just the nature of 
this cutthroat business. Also on the stagnantly invariable list is the status 
of my life in relation to Enron. I am still here. I still stare at the 
computer. Every once in awhile I meander over to the dark window-less corner 
that enshrouds the IT wizards and ask them silly questions like, ""What does 
it mean when I hit this button and my screen starts flashing at me like a 
disco ball, then makes this awkward shrieking noise and finally goes black?"" 
They are incredibly helpful. I am still pretty much clueless about most 
things, although I've learned to talk about them with a semblance of 
authority, as in, ""No, you twit, the 25 megawatt off peak deal should clearly 
be flowing across SP-15 to NP-15 because of the illiquidity of SP's market 
right now. What kind of idiot wouldn't hedge their position in California at 
a time like this?"" It all sounds very exotic and important to me, which is 
why I'm still here. But I'm infinitely jealous of your wild exploits in the 
great American outdoors. I suspect my forbearance for sitting in an office 
will run out right around the middle of the summer, so I'm planning a trip to 
coincide with that meltdown. I haven't decided between a road trip through 
the western United States or just a direct flight to Paris. Both sound good, 
and way beyond my budget, therefore equally attractive. Well, I've managed to 
say practically nothing for long enough now. I do hope you're having an 
amazing time, rambling on toward the next crazy adventure on the horizon as I 
believe Jack Kerouac once wrote. We're all very proud of you here and 
constantly refer to you as ""my good friend Winston who's skiing across the 
state of Wyoming, which was my idea."" I'd love to hear about your trip direct 
from the source, although I know you're extremely busy out there, skiing and 
killing wild animals for sustenance and whatnot. But please do write 
back....if you can still move your fingers.

Sincerely,
Kate
(the slightly ditsy one who sits in the middle of the room and tries to look 
constantly busy)"

having with the new Full Service Power application, Forward Obligation

Mark - I believe our Real Time group is sending your group a spreadsheet 
outlining all of the trades they do on behalf of EES each day. The first two 
deals - 544537 and 544544 - should be included in that sheet. The only deals 
recorded in the sheet I send are fixed price (and sometimes Dow Jones 
index-forward) day-ahead trades done by the EPMI Short Term California desk.

The third deal - 553219 - is in EnPower at the correct price of $133.23. The 
worksheet price was not updated from the day before, but it's been corrected.

The fourth deal - 553219 - again is a Real Time deal. It looks like it was 
entered on 3/19 for 3/19 HE 1. It's a deal for 25 MW, not 150 MW, at $175.00. 
I'm not quite sure why EES thinks this deal should be in for HE 1-6 on 3/16. 
If you have any more information, please send that along to Bill Williams III 
and me.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have anymore questions.

Thanks,
Kate

you can please take a look and let me know.


1) 3-11-01 Buy 544537.1 not on your schedule

2) 3-11-01 Sell 544544.1 not on your schedule (Kate this one may not be part 
of the schedule)  What all goes on it?

3) 3-15-01 Sell 550208.1 Price $133.23, Per EES the schedule is at $113.07

4) 3-19-01 Buy 553219.1 0-6 150 mwh @ $175.00 ST-Hourly, EES has this as a 
real time deal on 3-16 @ $125

Good morning -

Just wanted to let you know that I've been running the stage version of the 
Forward Obligation report using production data, and I seem to be getting all 
the same numbers as I do with the production version of the report. I will 
continue to compare the two today when I run these reports, just to make 
sure. But in the meantime, all looks well. Thanks for your help.

    Thanks Kate,
  
    We were looking for somebody like you. You can run it with any settings,
   as you run it every day.  Make sure you see version 3.0.0.30.
    

    I think however it is better if you can run  the report against 
production data
    because the test data are not good enough. I think David Poston created
    a shortcut on Cara's and Valarie's computers, you can talk to him to do it
    for you as well.


     The command from the command prompt should be:
      C:\Enpower\stage > FwdObl user_id user_password  pwrprodn_ded
    (ask the IT people if this doesn't mean anything to you, I can phone
       David as well you want me to)

I'd be more than happy to run a test of the new forward obligation report in 
order for you to move it to production. I do use the application everyday 
when determining the West desk positions in relation to each other, so it's a 
report I'm familiar with and also one that may affect me if it's changed. 
Please let me know if you'd like me to run the report and under what terms.

Kate-
    I'm going for a run..uh, walk in the park to unwind from another busy
day.  Did I already RE???  I think I was in process when I was abruptly
booted off my system.  I rarely read too deeply into the metaphysics of
internet territoriality, but let's just say I was a bit freaked out.
    In other news, I was invited, as a resident shoe expert, to come fix the
feet of a certain director on a certain Paramount movie set in town...and do
I feel important??  I'll keep you updated as to whether this particular 15
minutes of fame is actually THE one, or just a facade to a deeper and more
rewarding 15 minutes somewhere down the road.
    On Gatsby - don't have it yet and implicit in this status is my inability
to compete with one so driven to ultimate domination in the category of
intellectual enormity...I am the microscopic parasite to a four-limbed,
crafty predator that disguises itself, like a siren, as a mere passenger on
the food train.
    Miss you in a sort of in-town way. Perhaps we should get together and do
this in person soon?  I am worried about your little heart, my ""playuh""
positioning, and wasting the short two month window that is inevitably the
range of my welcome.
    In the ""get-on-with-it""  realm, I'm out.  Call me.  Home is 224-7243 and
cell is 890-6370 in case you've misplaced the card...or something.  Any
malapropisticism was incidental this time around.

I feel your job-hunting pain, but I am so glad you sent a resume to Amy. And 
as for having to WORK at WORK? Not if they just let you go! If they ask what 
you're doing say, ""I'm surfing the internet for a NEW JOB YOU SON OF A 
BISCUIT."" And as for this weekend, most definitely. On Saturday I'm going to 
see some art and have drinks at the Medicine Hat gallery on Alberta. You 
should join me in my quest for culture - of course that'll last until just 
after I finish the first bottle of wine. Who's playing on Friday? I'll pencil 
it in. And I'll keep you posted on what I hear from Amy - in the meantime, 
hang in there. It all works out in the end. (there's your cheesy piece of 
advice for the day)

I just entered an index deal for one of our traders, and came across 
something I hadn't noticed before. In EnPower, we have several choices for 
the Dow Jones Mid-Columbia index, but none called specifically ""Mid-C Firm 
Peak."" We have non-firm peak, and something called ""Mid-Columbia Index."" 

I'm just wondering how to specify that I want the deal to settle against the 
Dow Jones Mid-C PEAK index. In this case, because I was entering a 
round-the-clock (all hours, all days) deal, I had to enter three different 
deals to specify the three different indices - Mid-C Peak, Mid-C Off Peak, 
and Mid-C Sundays and Holidays. But I don't see a Mid-C Peak choice, so I 
entered the first as Mid-C Index.

Deal numbers are:
597244 - Peak
597245 - Off Peak
597246 - Sundays/Holidays

I just wanted to ask because when you guys plug the index prices in here I 
want to make sure that ""Mid-C Index"" gets the peak price. Could you let me 
know if it doesn't? And if that's the case, then I'll need to have another 
pub code set up for peak price.

Thanks for your help on this. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate

Will - 

I've passed your phone number along to Bill Williams, the Real Time group 
manager here in Portland. He should be contacting you shortly to discuss 
problems with and changes to the Scheduling Activity Report. I've checked 
with other groups on the floor and found that the report is only used by Real 
Time, and less frequently by groups assisting Real Time, so I believe Bill or 
someone in his group could most suitably test the new application. Let me 
know if there's anything else I can do, and thanks for all your help today.

I'm trying to get ahold of Jeff Richter on this, but without the brokers 
around we probably can't get it done tonight. I would just say we have a 
discrepancy with the broker at this point. Let me know if that's okay.

I've changed the deal - we're running into some problems rolling out the new 
Full Service Power application. Apparently it's messed with some details of 
Deal Entry, including the deletion of strips. So you'll see three strips in 
this deal, two of which have no price and no volume. I hope that's okay! Will 
Smith in Houston IT is working on it now. Let me know if you see the right 
term and volume now.

Thanks,
Kate

sorry - we changed the year and just changed each strip - but since it was 
originally entered in deal blotter it had those extra strips and, long story 
short, it should be right now.

Tom Alonso
deal 555159
Bloomberg shows cp as Arizona Public Service....we have Pinnacle West.


From my understanding from Rhonda trades can still be done under APS or 
Pinncale West.  Please tell him to clarify which cp with the broker as the 
trade is being done.

Thanks!!

I've spoken with Rhonda about this, and I'll be letting the traders know to 
be prepared for the change. This deal has been changed to Allegheny.

Kate I spoke with Phil about this deal this morning and I just called but he 
away at lunch.

Per our Rhonda, can you tell him that deal 553645 should be changed Allegheny 
Energy Supply and that we should no longer do any deals under Merrill Lynch.  
Also, can you let the schedulers know about the name change of this deal. 


Thanks!

Subject: ""no confirm"" deals

Hi Kate!
I am beginning to see a familiar pattern beginning in the West (-familiar 
because it's the same problem we have with East traders).  There are A LOT of 
deals that need to be changed to ""no confirm.""  I'd like to fax a list of 
them to you so that you can 1st, change their status in Deal Entry to ""not to 
be confirmed"" and 2nd, bug the traders who enter the deals to remember to 
enter them correctly.  Also, you mentioned working with Will Smith in IT to 
get these deals to automatically be ""no confirm"" when the traders enter 
them.  You may want to use some of these as examples so to help IT figure the 
logic behind which deals are confirmed and which aren't.  Please let me know 
your fax number so that i can send you this report.  
Thanks!
Kim x31647

You are clearly the quintessential malapropist. I won't even try to compete 
in that category. Especially not at the end of a long day. Of staring. At 
this computer screen. And studying tiny little. Numbers. This is the source 
of my insanity. This is no question of my money or my life. It's neither. I 
think it's time to partake in some of the mind-numbing activities that office 
workers regularly use to gain the strenth to face another day (running), or 
forget that another day is coming (drinking). I've got at least half an hour 
to decide.....

Dave, 
Could you possibly help me set a shortcut to test this report today. I 
believe what Kroum is asking is for me to run the STAGE report against 
PRODUCTION data. Does that sound correct? I thought you'd know more. Just 
holler over here whenever you get a chance.

    Thanks Kate,
  
    We were looking for somebody like you. You can run it with any settings,
   as you run it every day.  Make sure you see version 3.0.0.30.
    

    I think however it is better if you can run  the report against 
production data
    because the test data are not good enough. I think David Poston created
    a shortcut on Cara's and Valarie's computers, you can talk to him to do it
    for you as well.


     The command from the command prompt should be:
      C:\Enpower\stage > FwdObl user_id user_password  pwrprodn_ded
    (ask the IT people if this doesn't mean anything to you, I can phone
       David as well you want me to)

I suppose my victory in this, our latest but not last competition, would be 
IMPLIED. Rather, I mean that my triumph could be INFERRED or even TACIT. My 
skill is UNDERSTOOD, my speed INSINUATED, and my nimble pairing of the two is

situation, because I need for you to know that I got the answer first. So for 
the record, it is 8:45 a.m. on Monday. A side note: I also have The Great 
Gatsby in my possession.

It might be worth it to add Long Term California to Greg's trader ID profile 
- if it's not too much trouble. He said it was unlikely he'd use it, but 
there's always the potential. No rush, of course. And thanks again for your 
help.

Long Term Southwest
Long Term Northwest
Long Term California
Long Term West Management

Hello Kate,

I've added Paul Choi to the EnPower System, however, in order for a Trader or 
Mid-Marketer
to have access to a Power Desk, he must be added to the specific desk by the 
GCP Team.

Please supply a specific list of desks in which Paul Choi needs access.

Example Request(s): 

Please add these Power Trader(s) to the following Desks: Paul Choi, Greg Wolfe

CP/ID 66189 (not required, but helpful)     EPMI Short Term West Hourly
CP/ID 56849  ""     EPMI Long Term West Management

Hello Kate,

In order for Power Traders to gain access to Power Desks, my team, 
GCP_Houston, must link their names to each Desk.
(Basically, we need a list of desks that the Traders need access.)

Please provide the following info:

Example(s): 

Add these Power Trader(s) to the following Desks: Paul Choi, Greg Wolfe

CP/ID 66189 (not required, but helpful)    EPMI Short Term West Hourly

At long last, I've sorted through these deals and determined the source of 
most of these problems. I'll be calling you both shortly to go over these and 
make sure we all see the same thing. Here are a few things to note as you go 
over my responses:

566426 - rates have been changed/has this shown up on your CARP report yet?
578856 - deal done by Real Time trader at hour-ahead market price/will not 
correspond directly to the price shown in my spreadsheet
573862 - rate for this deal should not be $107 OR $168.45/it is an off peak 
sale from EPMI to EES, which means we go by the off peak short position price 
- shown in my sheet as $119.76

The newest deals in this variance list are Real Time. I've double-checked the 
deals in EnPower with what I see in the Real Time spreadsheets, and 
everything seems to match up. I'm attaching those sheets so we can ensure 
we're all looking at the same thing. If you have further discrepancies on 
these, the easiest way for me to clear them up would be if you include the 
specific hours you have questions about.

I'm terribly sorry for the delay in getting back to you on this - it's a 
twisted and time-consuming journey trying to find the source of these 
problems, as I'm sure you know! I hope this gets us up to speed, but please 
call me with questions or comments.

Thanks,
Kate

Two things: First. What does the art of motorcycle riding have to do with 
lost literature or George Eliot? Second. Elliot is spelled Eliot. But 
otherwise, thoroughly enjoyable e-mail message, if not a tad smug over the 
whole book-finding issue. Where did you find it, anyway? E-bay? Afghanistan? 
You know, in some circles they would consider procurement of that book akin 
to scoring a pound of pure cocaine. Not that yucky not adulterated stuff. I'm 
rambling and should actually go do some work, being that that is the 
technical term for what I'm doing right now. ""Working,"" that is. But I have 
several spreadsheets strategically placed around my computer screens (I have 
two, that's how important I am), to make it appear that I'm VERY, VERY busy. 
And speaking of importance, I'm curious to know if you're the actual ""owner"" 
of the Portland Running Co., as it states on your card, or if the Portland 
Running Co. is one of those forward-thinking organizations that gives all its 
employees pseudo-ownership in the form of one stock share, or if those are 
just cards you had made to impress people? In any case, I probably owe you 
some retroactive respect for your ingenuity, either for becoming the owner of 
such a shop, or for making people believe you are. Hey, do you know what 
George Eliot's real first name is? If you respond to this e-mail in the next 
twenty minutes, I'll tell you. Otherwise you're on your own. By the way, 
that's a beautifully worded passage you chose. And it rhymes, in case you 
didn't notice that.

""Was never true love loved in vain,
For truest love is highest gain.
No art can make it:  it must spring
Where elements are fostering.
So in heaven's spot and hour
Springs the little native flower,
Downward root and upward eye,
Shapen by the earth and sky.""

Prologue to chapter 47, ""The Dead Hand""
Middlemarch,  George Elliot, 1871

Dave Poston and the other IT guys are working on this problem right now. 
Apparently from 3/9 onward EOL has not been pulling the schedule type into 
its deals, so they're ALL going to have problems saving. Isn't that fun? Dave 
told me that the problem will be solved by tomorrow afternoon at the latest, 
and that it will retroactively populate those schedule types into all EOL 
deals so you'll be able to save them. Sorry for the hassle. I'll keep you 
posted if anything else comes up.

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate, I know you are working on this problem.  This deal will not let me 
save it because it wants the schedule type filled in.  Let me know if there 
is a schedule type I can choose or if I should just wait until the problem is 
fixed.

changed to pinnacle west - and you might mention to apb, if you feel like it, 
that it would save their time during checkout if they told tom the correct 
counterparty when the trade was done - he said apb never seems to know 
whether it's APS or pinnacle, but for his part he doesn't mind which 
counterparty it's with - anyway, just fyi...

Chris Foster has requested that we set up a new broker - the Automated Power 
Exchange, in EnPower. It is the same counterparty we already have in EnPower, 
with the same name and contact information. Melissa, I believe you said we 
could pretty easily add the name in the broker list if it was the same as in

you need anymore information.

whadup! i'm so happy for you re: the love thing. love is sooooo in the air 
lately. molly just fell head over heels for some cowboy dude evan introduced 
her to. they've been attached at the hips, literally, for the last three 
weeks. and amber spends about four quality hours a day on the phone with 
marky, then cries when she has to hang up. seriously. but your romance sounds 
much more interesting - you absolutely have to keep me posted on how it 
unfolds. and what's the guy's name anyway? you know what's weird is that last 
night after my haircut i met up with molly and her man for dinner. we decided 
to check out the brazen bean, this little swanky cigar bar across the street 
from the blue moon on 21st. (we heard they had a martini happy hour, and we 
felt like pretending we were sophisticated.) so we're walking into the place 
when molly suddenly remembers that she knows the people who live upstairs 
(it's in one of those old rambling victorian houses) so she runs upstairs to 
say hi and then comes back down with them. it turns out to be blake and jill, 
this really sweet couple i've met before, friends of friends, you know how it 
goes. anyway, we all end up staying longer than we should and having more 
martinis than we planned on, and then blake remembers his friend dave was 
coming over to watch a movie. so he runs upstairs to meet dave and brings him 
back down. well dave happens to be amazingly cute and have amazingly great 
legs (he had just come from the gym and was amazingly good about sitting in 
this dimly lit velvet-couched candle-lit shi-shi joint in shorts and a 
sweatshirt). so dave, molly tells me as she begins to put the hard sell on 
IMMEDIATELY (i've noticed as i get older and stay single that many of my 
friends feel the need to try vehemently to get me coupled), plays the guitar 
amazingly and has an amazing voice. i find out over the course of the evening 
that he also reads A LOT and is interested in irish literature and quantum 
physics. well, who isn't, y'know. he also likes to sail - and this is really 
quite scary - LASER SAILBOATS. yep. i've officially met my father in a 
younger form. barf. anyway, he and blake and i all had a jolly time talking 
about books and parents and that show blind date. it was all very 
intellectual, i assure you. what was weirder still was that every time i said 
something, dave looked at blake and kind of laughed. and every time i was 
like, stop your laughing or i'll beat you senseless, and he was like, no i'm 
just laughing because we were just talking about that the other day or 
because i've done that or because i'm doing that next week. i said i wanted 
to start a book club - apparently he suggested that to blake two days ago. i 
said i lived in italy and wanted to go back - he's going there in two months. 
oh, and then there's our common love of running. okay, i'm rambling, so i'll 
get to the point, which is that in my single and cynical state i didn't think 
much of the poor guy last night, but today i've noticed i'm increasingly 
interested and, i'll admit, maybe even attracted. so as we were leaving i 
kind of waved goodbye and said see ya around, because you always do in an 
incestuous vat such as portland, and went on my merry way with molly and 
josh, which i'm sure they were happy about since they practically tried to 
push me into dave's car and run away. dave got in his car and drove off, then 
all of a sudden appeared in front of us as we were crossing the street to our 
car. he had driven around the block and was now getting out of his car to 
give me his card, which he handed to me under the pretense that we couldn't 
start a book club without each other's contact information. i already knew he 
worked at a running store, whatever that is, but when i turned the card over 
it had his name on it and the word ""owner"" underneath. do you think that 
means he's the actual owner? or is it one of those places like les schwab 
where they give all the employees stock options and call them ""employee 
owners""? i'm going to look into it. now i'm probably making way too much of 
this because he was probably like, yeah i need some more members for my book 
club but i definitely don't want to talk to this drinking, smoking, lump of 
unmolded flesh for any other reason....why would i, the proprietor of a 
running store and owner of such amazing legs, do a thing like date a girl who 
shudders at the thought of exercise and loses weight only when she ups her 
alcohol consumption to the point where she forgets to eat? that would just be 
silly. okay, i've got to go. get back to me with a detailed account of your 
evening such as the one i just sent you.

Okay so my date was SO amazing!  This guy is SO cute, SO nice, SO smart,
wore pants that fit over his shoes, wore an amazingly cute outfit in
general, knew a lot about wine, took me to the cutest restaurant, took me
out for cocktails afterwards, was a total gentleman, etc.    Mark my words,
Kate - I WILL MARRY THIS MAN.  I kid you not.  He is the most normal guy I
have come across EVER.  He's trying to get a job in graphic design (so cute)
but he loves wine and has thought about working at a vineyard or owning a
restaurant (so cute).  We've read all the same books.  He definitely has
money somehow but he said he has a lot of student debts so at least he can
see where I'm coming from.  He was just interested enough but kind of aloof
which is the only thing that ever keeps me interested.  Kate, this is so
weird.  Oh and he mentioned having a family twice, like as in working at a
restaurant isn't good for having a family.  HOW CUTE IS THAT?  I am in love.
Just thought I'd let you know . . .

love, anna

I think this is an issue with Diana's deal entry, because I just asked Sean 
Crandall and he said you can go ahead and confirm all of these deals. I've 
changed the confirm status, and I'll look into it more later this afternoon 
when the traders are less busy. Also, did you mean to write 549903 twice, or 
is there another deal number?

We came across some deals on the not to be confirmed report that look like 
they should be confirmed.  Can you check and see why these came up not to be 
confirmed.  We thought we had fixed the system so that the daily deals in the 
west would default to be confirmed so I need to know if this was a conscious

Dear Kate,

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to job shadow with you in Deal 
Control.  I loved your metaphor for the wheels of the clock and how all the 
cogs in the wheels need to match up.  I also enjoyed seeing how ""scraps"" are 
used and that there is trading between desks within Enron.  You do such a 
great job at being in the moment and keeping your cool when new tasks come 
your way throughout the day.  Your time and patience in answering my 
questions and helping me understand how it all fits together is much 
appreciated.

With gratitude,
Emily

This is a problem I've been working on with IT. They released a new version 
of deal entry, and for some reason certain EOL trades are automatically 
populating all of the new fields, including Schedule Type. I've got Dave 
Poston working on this, and I'll let you know when we've fixed it so you can 
save your part.

I added the fee - but was wondering why it didn't default to a fee since 
Bloomberg is an online trading service. I know they're gone now, but if you

How crazy would that be if we had three generations of Symes in one 
classroom! If I were one of the other students and I figured out there were 
three siblings in my class, I might actually consider that a little bizarre, 
like a circus family or something. But whatever. I'm definitely into it 
though - that is, if U.O. has decided to forgive my errant freshman year 
behavior that got me booted from those luxurious residance halls and re-admit 
me. They're probably looking over my application right now and just pissing 
themselves, ""Wait a minute - that good-for-nothing druggy thinks she's going 
to GRADUATE SCHOOL...HAHAHAHAHAHA..."" and so on. 

And by the way, I didn't mean to throw you into a fit of Catholic guilt over 
the kitty thing. She's totally fine, and mom actually likes her. I think my 
presence actually upsets the balance. And I think this move might be good for 
her - she'll be going back to her apartment roots. The real martyr in all of 
this is Big Kitty, who still looks completely baffled when Kitty hurtles 
herself at him from behind doorways and such. After she does that, they 
generally both walk away from each other just looking completely dissatisfied 
with the whole thing - Big Kitty because he's old and demented and everything 
confuses him, and Kitty because she's young and demented and everything 
pisses her off. Gotta love it. 

So you look like Jennifer now? Hey, don't underestimate the one-time 
popularity of that haircut. Everything comes back into fashion at some point. 
I will tell Brett you said hi. His wife just had her baby - they are such a 
freaking cute little family it makes me depressed. Even more than I already 
am from having to sit around my house all the time and listen to Amber and 
Molly call their respective boyfriends ""schmoopy"" and swap sex stories. It's 
thoroughly disgusting, and I've told them so. They just throw their heads 
back and laugh with self-satisfied couple-induced mania. And there you have 
my happy little family.....

Have fun on your date tonight! Just go into it like you have nothing to lose, 
which you don't, and like you don't care, which you shouldn't. 'Kay?

Love ya,
Kate

the website is uosummer.uoregon.edu (no www), but unfortunately none of the
info is posted yet because they're all a bunch of lazy pot-smoking
superfreaks over there in Eugene.  Usually you can choose from any general
ed courses - I'm taking polisci because I need it for my major.  They'll
have journalism and stuff like that.  We could crash at John's house and
party till the wee hours with all the wee freshmen!

I feel bad about Kitty, too.  Is she getting more nuts than ever?  I would
love to bring her out here if it wasn't for the obvious obstacles (she could
never go outside, she would rip my face off on the ride over, etc.).  If she
is still doing bad next year when my lease runs out, we could consider
bringing her out here.  I could move into a house.  Anyway, I'm sorry to
hear about the whole thing.  I feel really guilty too.  Hopefully Mom is
available for the five minutes a day that Kitty actually wants contact with
humans.

Well, have fun getting your hair cut and tell Brett I said hi!  I got my
hair cut here and the man confused me with Jennifer Aniston circa 1990.  I
look like a freak, and my hair is oily, and I don't want to go on this date.

Have a good night!
Anna

Hey - what the heck is zero week? I might be interested in signing up for
that - pack in some quick credits for my pre-grad school work. I figured
out I'm going to essentially have to get a second bachelor's degree before
going to grad school. But hey, it's all about the credentials man - as in,
being able to tell people at my 10-year high school reunion that I have two
bachelor's degrees, a master's, and a Rhodes Scholarship to study Italian
wine in a 12th century villa, surrounded by buff, tan, and unusually
good-looking farm workers.Tres important!

So yeah, maybe we'll hold off on the visit for now. I think it's more
important for us both to feel mentally stable about our finances for right
now - then we party! I could maybe make it out there in April, overlap with
mom's trip (I don't think I could handle the whole thing with her...) -
I'll keep it in mind. And yeah, she's giddy about this whole house move
thing. I hope it works out for the best - I really think it will. I'm
starting to feel really bad about leaving Kitty with her, but I'm in a
weird situation with Amber's cat at our house already. Part of me wants to
just bring Kitty over and tell everyone to deal with it because it's my
house too; but the other part of me doesn't want to deal with the bloodshed
that will ensue between her and Amber's outmatched feline. Oh well, I'm
thinking about it.

The most excitement I'll be having this week is my haircut with Brett
tonight. I think I might also be purchasing a bedskirt, a totally
extraneous and disappointing expense that I would never have had if I
hadn't insisted on getting a ""real"" house with a ""real"" bed and all that
other crap that goes along with it and inevitably costs you money that you
could have otherwise spent on beer. And as the sands flow, these are the
days of our lives....

I'm so impressed with your dating maneuvers. I told Amber and Molly about
it last night at dinner, which we ate together around our new dining room
table, and they both said in unison, ""Like sister, like sister."" I guess I
have some kind of reputation for ending up on dates with waiters - go
figure. Anyway, it's time for me to go find something to eat and then come
back to my desk and consume it while it flows directly to my butt. Can't
wait! Write back soon.

I'm so glad to hear everything's better at your house!  I totally want to
come visit, but my last two paycheck deposits have only raised the balance
to $0 so it may be awhile.  I'm definitely coming in June, when I take a
zero week class in Eugene.  Mom's supposedly coming out here in April and
we
might go to Glenwood Springs (hot springs, spa, MASSAGES!).  You should
come, too!  Fun female family bonding time!

I am so excited for Dad to visit, not just because of the car but also
because it will increase my quantity of social engagements by about 100%.
I'm a little worried about the effect it's having on Mom, who asked me when
he was coming so she wouldn't ""run into him"".  Like I would allow that to
happen - how stupid does she think I am?  But it sounds like she's pretty
stoked about this house thing, so I'm excited for her.

I have a date with that waiter guy tonight, but I'm not really that excited
because I am fat, ugly and on the third day of my period.  Did I mention
broke and car-less?  I think I should just put off this whole dating thing
until I increase MY net value (to use Kate-speak), which is just ground
zero
for most people.  I am trying to pay off some debt (Dad took care of most
of
it, but I didn't have the heart to show him my Nordstrom account).  It's
slow-going, though.  And car payments will not make it easy, but seriously
this city is so pedestrian-unfriendly that I feel I have no choice.  I
tried
to go to my tennis lessons the other day and ended up walking along the
shoulder of a highway for twenty minutes.  And every person in Denver feels
the need to own a dog and allow it to bark menacingly at every passerby (I
am SO afraid of dogs after my brush with death in the form of a Doberman).
So I need a car,  and I don't care if it means weekly visits to the plasma
""donation"" center.

I actually met Marky's ex the other night (maybe don't mention to Amber - I
don't know why but the whole thing seems weird and I would rather stay out
of it).  Anyway, she is really cool!  She reminds me of my friend Jen
Sturmer, except less anorexic and depressed.  Speaking of, have you been
going out in Portland a lot?  I miss Veritable Quandary!  I haven't found
anything like that here yet.  Downtown has some cool bars, but you have to
pay $90 plus an appendage to park and cabs are not cheap either.  My
neighborhood has some good dives, like the one on our corner that has a
flickering neon sign outside announcing ""Don's Mixed Drinks"" - not sure,
but
think that's the name of the bar.  I went in once and met Don, the king of
multiple body piercings here in Denver.

Okay, I'm rambling.  Time to get back to work (which is so good lately, by
the way!  I get to start grant-writing this month!).  Hope all's well for
you.  I'll give you the dirt on my date later, if my acne doesn't scare him
away in minute one.  Miss you, love you!!

Love, yo sista

Dearest Anna, my most favorite sister of them all!

I'm sorry I've been so bad about staying in touch while you've been stuck
in those Rocky Mountain highs and lows of life. It sounds like things are
going really well though (Rocky Mountain ""highs"") and that you've made it
through most of the tumult of moving to a new place (Rocky Mountain
""lows""). Amber tells me every time she talks to Marky, her man of the hour,
he mentions how they've got to get together with you when she comes to town
- which will be on next Friday, whoo hoo, party! I'm so mad that she gets
to go and I don't, being that I am not, like her, in my eighth year of
college and therefore do not enjoy such things as ""Spring Break Mania""
anymore. And Monica tells Marky who tells Amber who tells me that she'd
love to hang out with you more often. It sounds like you guys had a ball at
dinner, eh? So you've got options, girlfriend, which is worlds more than I
can say for my life at the mo'. It pretty much consists of working, eating,
and sleeping. I'm definitely looking into that SAD mental disorder thing,
because I think it's got me in its clutches. But the recent abundance of
sunshine has brought me enough renewed energy to start thinking about life
after winter. We're doing lots of gardening, cooking, and decorating at the
house - it's like having three Martha Stewarts all working together, only
slightly less stylish , immensely less efficient, and drunk. Other than
that, I've been trying to organize and simplify my life - taking care of
mounds of paperwork, paying off debts, sorting out all those nagging little
post-it notes that plague me constantly and demand my attention in vain.
I'm actually starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, like maybe
I could buy a car or take a trip in a few months, or even buy a SECOND pair
of shoes, but let's not get wild and crazy just yet. So I heard Dad and
Laura are on their way to your neck of the woods with an automobile. That
is, in the immortal words of the guys in ""Dude, where's my car?"", SWEET...
DUDE! You are stoked. I bet that's a major load off - just make sure to
keep your finances in check and not get in over your head. Take it from one
who knows. I'm seriously looking into buying an old beater car; but then I
start fantasizing about the Audi A4 Quattro, and suddenly $30,000 doesn't
seem like a bad price for becoming ultimately cool. Lately I've been doing
a lot of research into self-improvement measures. I just applied for
post-baccalaureate status at U of O, so I can start taking economics and
poli sci classes online. (I just got my new FREE computer from work!) I'm
also studying for the GRE, and pretty soon here I'm going to get serious
about graduate school. I think I've decided on international studies and/or
economics, depending on how well I like the classes I take. I've found my
dream program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. It's a
two-year Masters of International Studies program that begins in Washington
and ends in.....are you sitting down?.....Bologna, Italy! Holy shit, does
it get more perfect? Apparently it's like the premiere training ground for
government officials, according to my friend Andy who laughed forcefully in
my face when I told him I wanted to get into it. But I figure, I'm not
getting any younger, and I don't want any regrets, so I'm goin' for it,
dude. As for the love life, it's nonexistant, which is why I'm putting so
much energy into the self-improvement area of my life. I figure as long as
I'm having no fun with boys I might as well be beefing up my net value. By
the time they come around again, the eligible pool will have shrunk to 1 in
100 million. Whatever. Anyway, now that I've written you the longest
paragraph of my life, I must retreat to my work duties. Then it's off for a
thrilling tour of Portland via Tri-Met. Molly's making me dinner tonight in
exchange for a finished resume. It's only taken her 3 years to compile the
information for it, so this one should be a doozy. Hey, if you can ever
make it home for a weekend, you should come at the end of May - David Gray
is coming to the Schnitzer, and it's going to be fabulous! I'll buy your
concert ticket if you can convince Dad to get your plane ticket. Call me
soon if you can, or I'll call this weekend. Take care and I miss you!

Love,
Kate

Hey Lady!

What do you think you're doing?  I haven't talked to you in way too long.
You have to update me on the sitch!  I am going on a date with a guy I met
while out with Monica last weekend.  He was our waiter and he looks like
Chandler Bing, only Monica kept calling him Chanandler Bong (did you see
that episode when they had to name who the TV Guide came to?).  She is so
fun!  I was so glad to get out of my apartment/away from my roommate.  And
now I have a date, so I'm excited.  I'm still in contact with Mr.
Colorblind, but we've had the friends talk so it's been really cool.  In
fact, he's nicer to me now than he was before!  Anyway, that's crazy news
about Mom's house!  I guess no more crashing at her house when I go home.
How are your roommates?  Your seattle boyfriend?  Your job?  Write me with
the goods, woman.  I am getting a car in two weeks and I am more excited
than any car-buyer has ever been.  My job is great, although i think I'm
getting scoliosis from bad posture in an uncomfortable chair all day.
Nothing else is happening.  Are you going out for St. Patrick's Day?  I
have
to work, but there's a big outdoor thing downtown that I might go to
afterwards.  Okay, must go work.  Call me though!  I miss you!

Love, Anna

Hey Lady!

What do you think you're doing?  I haven't talked to you in way too long.
You have to update me on the sitch!  I am going on a date with a guy I met
while out with Monica last weekend.  He was our waiter and he looks like
Chandler Bing, only Monica kept calling him Chanandler Bong (did you see
that episode when they had to name who the TV Guide came to?).  She is so
fun!  I was so glad to get out of my apartment/away from my roommate.  And
now I have a date, so I'm excited.  I'm still in contact with Mr.
Colorblind, but we've had the friends talk so it's been really cool.  In
fact, he's nicer to me now than he was before!  Anyway, that's crazy news
about Mom's house!  I guess no more crashing at her house when I go home.
How are your roommates?  Your seattle boyfriend?  Your job?  Write me with
the goods, woman.  I am getting a car in two weeks and I am more excited
than any car-buyer has ever been.  My job is great, although i think I'm
getting scoliosis from bad posture in an uncomfortable chair all day.
Nothing else is happening.  Are you going out for St. Patrick's Day?  I
have
to work, but there's a big outdoor thing downtown that I might go to
afterwards.  Okay, must go work.  Call me though!  I miss you!

Love, Anna

Sean just looked these confirms over, and skimmed our contract with Aquila, 
and he said the language is fine as it is. I guess Unrestricted Mid-C is just 
a reiteration of Mid-C. If this causes a problem with your confirm process, 
though, I would have Bloomberg change it. It doesn't seem like we should have 
to go to the trouble of adding another, redundant delivery point name in our 
system just because that's what they call it. I know that sounds mean - but 
I'm so slammed today I can't help it!

Thanks for your help,
Kate

Yes this is the first time I've seen unrestricted Mid-C on any of their 
confirmations.  Normally they have into Mid-C on the confirmations which I 
know should be Mid-C excluding the into part.  Anyway, I will wait to clear 
this two deals.  Keep me informed.
Below is the two confirms they sent me.

595511 - buy Idaho, May, Mid-C, 330

And on the Bloomberg confirms re: Mid-C - I'm pulling up the contract through 
Livelink, because Sean wants to make sure the language does not allow for 
curtailment at Mid-C if another unit in the path goes down. He says our Mid-C 
is unrestricted anyway, so we shouldn't need another name in Enpower. Is this 
the first time you've seen this delivery point name in a confirmation? Hold 
off on this confirm for just a minute while I go over this with Sean.

Also, Bloomberg sent over some confirmations for deal 595472 and 595473 and 
the location is for unrestricted Mid-C.  Should we have this deal in enpower 
as unrestricted Mid-C because if so it's not a selection currently.   Just 
wondering!!

Our IT group was able to solve the problem on this deal. It wouldn't save 
because the schedule type field was not populating correctly; which was a 
little disturbing because this is an EOL deal, and all fields should populate 
automatically. Dave Poston thinks he's fixed the problem, so you shouldn't 
run into anymore deals that won't save due to blank deal entry fields. If you 
do, though, please let Dave or me know and we'll look into it further. You 
should now be able to add to the deal clearing tab and save the deal.

Prebon, but forgot to change the strip in the deal. It's fixed now to reflect 
a term of 3/15 to 3/31.

Sean Crandall said the price on this is correct (241), but he thought the 
deal was supposed to run through the end of the month. He was just walking 
into a meeting with Tim Belden while I was trying to figure this out with 
him, and he asked that I not change anything until he gets out and can look 
at it more closely. A price of $141 is awfully low for a peak deal flowing at 
Mid-C tomorrow - actually lower than the off-peak prices - so it sounds a 
little suspicious. I'll let you know when he gets out of the meeting.

Kate

Dearest Anna, my most favorite sister of them all!

I'm sorry I've been so bad about staying in touch while you've been stuck in 
those Rocky Mountain highs and lows of life. It sounds like things are going 
really well though (Rocky Mountain ""highs"") and that you've made it through 
most of the tumult of moving to a new place (Rocky Mountain ""lows""). Amber 
tells me every time she talks to Marky, her man of the hour, he mentions how 
they've got to get together with you when she comes to town - which will be 
on next Friday, whoo hoo, party! I'm so mad that she gets to go and I don't, 
being that I am not, like her, in my eighth year of college and therefore do 
not enjoy such things as ""Spring Break Mania"" anymore. And Monica tells Marky 
who tells Amber who tells me that she'd love to hang out with you more often. 
It sounds like you guys had a ball at dinner, eh? So you've got options, 
girlfriend, which is worlds more than I can say for my life at the mo'. It 
pretty much consists of working, eating, and sleeping. I'm definitely looking 
into that SAD mental disorder thing, because I think it's got me in its 
clutches. But the recent abundance of sunshine has brought me enough renewed 
energy to start thinking about life after winter. We're doing lots of 
gardening, cooking, and decorating at the house - it's like having three 
Martha Stewarts all working together, only slightly less stylish , immensely 
less efficient, and drunk. Other than that, I've been trying to organize and 
simplify my life - taking care of mounds of paperwork, paying off debts, 
sorting out all those nagging little post-it notes that plague me constantly 
and demand my attention in vain. I'm actually starting to see the light at 
the end of the tunnel, like maybe I could buy a car or take a trip in a few 
months, or even buy a SECOND pair of shoes, but let's not get wild and crazy 
just yet. So I heard Dad and Laura are on their way to your neck of the woods 
with an automobile. That is, in the immortal words of the guys in ""Dude, 
where's my car?"", SWEET... DUDE! You are stoked. I bet that's a major load 
off - just make sure to keep your finances in check and not get in over your 
head. Take it from one who knows. I'm seriously looking into buying an old 
beater car; but then I start fantasizing about the Audi A4 Quattro, and 
suddenly $30,000 doesn't seem like a bad price for becoming ultimately cool. 
Lately I've been doing a lot of research into self-improvement measures. I 
just applied for post-baccalaureate status at U of O, so I can start taking 
economics and poli sci classes online. (I just got my new FREE computer from 
work!) I'm also studying for the GRE, and pretty soon here I'm going to get 
serious about graduate school. I think I've decided on international studies 
and/or economics, depending on how well I like the classes I take. I've found 
my dream program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. It's a 
two-year Masters of International Studies program that begins in Washington 
and ends in.....are you sitting down?.....Bologna, Italy! Holy shit, does it 
get more perfect? Apparently it's like the premiere training ground for 
government officials, according to my friend Andy who laughed forcefully in 
my face when I told him I wanted to get into it. But I figure, I'm not 
getting any younger, and I don't want any regrets, so I'm goin' for it, dude. 
As for the love life, it's nonexistant, which is why I'm putting so much 
energy into the self-improvement area of my life. I figure as long as I'm 
having no fun with boys I might as well be beefing up my net value. By the 
time they come around again, the eligible pool will have shrunk to 1 in 100 
million. Whatever. Anyway, now that I've written you the longest paragraph of 
my life, I must retreat to my work duties. Then it's off for a thrilling tour 
of Portland via Tri-Met. Molly's making me dinner tonight in exchange for a 
finished resume. It's only taken her 3 years to compile the information for 
it, so this one should be a doozy. Hey, if you can ever make it home for a 
weekend, you should come at the end of May - David Gray is coming to the 
Schnitzer, and it's going to be fabulous! I'll buy your concert ticket if you 
can convince Dad to get your plane ticket. Call me soon if you can, or I'll

Kate

We've changed this to a BOM deal (term 3/15 to 3/31), but Sean still 
recognizes this as an on-peak deal with a price of 241.00. Let me know if 
Prebon still disputes.

Thanks,
Kate

yes- so this is what prebon is saying on this deal 549052:
Enron buys from Pacificorp 25 mw of peak BOM Mid-C at $141.00

Thanks!!

Sean Crandall said the price on this is correct (241), but he thought the 
deal was supposed to run through the end of the month. He was just walking 
into a meeting with Tim Belden while I was trying to figure this out with 
him, and he asked that I not change anything until he gets out and can look 
at it more closely. A price of $141 is awfully low for a peak deal flowing at 
Mid-C tomorrow - actually lower than the off-peak prices - so it sounds a 
little suspicious. I'll let you know when he gets out of the meeting.

Thanks,
Kate

595511 - buy Idaho, May, Mid-C, 330

And on the Bloomberg confirms re: Mid-C - I'm pulling up the contract through 
Livelink, because Sean wants to make sure the language does not allow for 
curtailment at Mid-C if another unit in the path goes down. He says our Mid-C 
is unrestricted anyway, so we shouldn't need another name in Enpower. Is this 
the first time you've seen this delivery point name in a confirmation? Hold 
off on this confirm for just a minute while I go over this with Sean.

Tracy just told me this counterparty (PPL Montana) is still pending credit. 
Mike Swerzbin said he would prefer to wait this out, because he stands to 
make money on the deal. So in the meantime, I've been told by credit that we 
can't enter the deal in the system and calc it. I'm not sure how this works 
in your case with the Prebon check-out, but basically it's a pending credit 
deal that will potentially show up in our system once EPMI and PPL Montana 
reach an agreement. Does that help? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

I've been keeping track of this with Tracy Ngo, our credit gal, and the last 
thing I heard on it this morning was that it's still pending credit. Tracy is 
in a meeting right now, but I'll grab her as soon as she gets out (she sits 
next to me) and find out what the status is. Unfortunately, Tracy said when a 
deal is ""pending credit approval"" it's a little vague as to when the decision 
will be made. Mike Swerzbin told her last night that he wasn't concerned 
about whether or not the deal was approved, so without the trader on credit's 
case, I think sometimes deals get lost in the shuffle. But I'll keep on top 
of it and let you know this afternoon.

Thanks,
Kate

Yes, that's fine if you bring the discrepancies by later. Or I can swing by 
your desk to get them. I think I know why Mark is confused about the price. 
At the beginning of this month we started running into situations where we 
had to purchase from EES in addition to selling to them - which is all we had 
been doing to cover their load before. We determined, however, that when EPMI 
buys from EES, the price should be $5 less than our fixed price average for 
the day. (When EPMI sells to EES, the price is $5 more than the fixed price 
average.) In this way, we're still making our profit from the coverage of 
their load. Either the correct price is not reflected in the spreadsheet we 
sent them, or we purchased at the wrong price - we were working the kinks out 
right at the beginning of March, so it makes sense that they'd have questions 
regarding that time frame.

Also, I've already talked with Daniel Kang at EES to work out some 
discrepancies with him. He asked about volumes at the beginning of March, but 
didn't seem to have a question about price, so I'm wondering if everyone over 
there is communicating with each other. Please let me know what I can do to 
resolve this - and feel free to send Mark my way when he has questions. 

Kate

Virginia, please take a look at DMS #'s  7365 & 7367.  These are the start of 
the EES differences for March.  Both of these have to do with the ST-Whourly 
desk where we are lower by $5.00 then what EES has.  I spoke with Thresa and 
she suggested we have Bill Williams look at these in case their is a trend 
started for the month and we can catch it now.

Bob -
Val was looking into this deal, but now that she's gone I wonder if you could 
help me with it. It's a swap that was done on 10/18/99 between LTWM and EES. 
It's an off-peak deal for 0.2 mw at a price of $23.00 and settlement index of 
PX SP-15. There are five legs that each run for one year - Cal'05 through 
Cal'09. 

I understand you've been working on making the switch from PX to Dow Jones 
indices. Do you know anything about this deal and whether or not its index 
needs to be changed? Please let Melissa or me know.

We think the broker's right - can't read Mark's handwriting - but I can't

To re-cap:
I will talk to Will Smith in Houston IT about adding a function in Deal 
Blotter to choose confirm or no confirm. In the meantime, Houston Confirms 
group would greatly appreciate us changing these deals to no confirm. They 
will assume that all daily deals done with PGE are no confirm, but the deals 
will still show up on their report (and cause confirm group crankiness) if 
they are marked to be confirmed. Thanks for your help.

I just heard the same.  I was talking to Tim about the requirements being

PGE daily deals.  Question though,  when we put deals into the system in 
Blotter, they automatically confirm.  Do we have to go into every deal and 
switch the flag or is there a better way around it?

I just spoke with Kim Hundl in the Confirms group. She's been told by PGE 
that they do not want confirmation letters sent for daily deals. Apparently 
there are a bunch of these in the system under your desk that are noted to be 
confirmed. The confirms group can change all of these deals to ""no confirm,"" 
but they wanted to double-check with you guys first. Do you agree with PGE, 
or would you like these deals confirmed? Let me know.

Thanks,

We are researching this deal and need your help.

Could you take a look at this deal?  I've pulled the audit viewer and the 
deal tickets.  My real question is - what deal do we actually have 
confirmed?  Leg 3 was the deal we carried on our books that had the expiry in 
March.  Since Modesto did not exercise, we realized a rather small fortune 
and want to make sure it was a real deal.  

I think we do not want to contact our counterparty but we do want to pull the 
deal records for confirm.  Can you help?

Questions about this deal - 

1. Should energy type be CAISO? 
2. Should trade date be 3/7?
3. Should confirmation status be ""NO""?

I believe the answer to all of these is yes, but I wanted to check before 
changing anything. The confirms group is getting extra sensitive about deals 
marked for confirmation, since they are now confirming all daily deals. Just 
a reminder to double-check your default settings and your deals for the 
confirmation status.

It looks like only leg 4 had firm energy - I changed that to CAISO. Legs 2 
and 3 already had CAISO energy, and leg 1 is killed. Is that okay?

These two legs are entered with NP-15 delivery points with firm energy.  Let 
me know if this is correct.

Thanks!

Testing was done in the test database; however, once they released the new 
version of deal entry into production, they tested one more time to make sure 
that the new fields were pulling into our scheduling reports. It was a 
precautionary measure taken so that we wouldn't enter deals all day long only 
to find out that they wouldn't show up in the Enpower to CAPS report at the 
end of the day. Sorry for the confusion.

Hi Kate, 

Can you please let Phil know that he should be testing deals in the enpower 
test database not the actual system.

This was just a practice deal entered by Phil yesterday to test our new 
version of deal entry. He zeroed out the volume, but neglected to kill the 
deal or at least change it to no confirm. So this is NOT a good deal - I'm 
killing it now.

Melissa Murphy would like us to begin adding a note in the comments section 
of all the deals we change. I know most of you already do this when you make 
big changes to deals, but she'd like to see more comments more often. Of 
course this mostly applies to me, but I thought I'd pass it along just in 
case. See the attached e-mail, and let me know if you have questions.

Hi, I was wondering if it would too time consuming for you to add a note in 
the comments box inside deal entry when you change a deal.  We always try to 
put a note in the comments box so it is easier to research what has changed 
on a trade in the future.  If you could add notes it would help us out when 
we are researching past deals.  Let me know what you think.

Dear Kate,

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to job shadow with you in Deal 
Control.  I loved your metaphor for the wheels of the clock and how all the 
cogs in the wheels need to match up.  I also enjoyed seeing how ""scraps"" are 
used and that there is trading between desks within Enron.  You do such a 
great job at being in the moment and keeping your cool when new tasks come 
your way throughout the day.  Your time and patience in answering my 
questions and helping me understand how it all fits together is much 
appreciated.

With gratitude,
Emily

I'm sorry - I haven't been keeping up with the Dow Jones data storage. I can 
put the data in the sheet - I just need to take a look at how you've set it 
up and determine what I should be entering where. I'm running to grab some 
lunch right now, but when I get back let's talk about how to compare the Dow 
Jones volumes with our daily volumes. I can either send you my data sheet 
each afternoon, or add a Dow Jones volume table to the sheet myself - however 
you'd like. We'll talk.

Are you going to put the data in the sheet, or are you not able to do that.  
If not, just send the sheet to the file, and I will do it.

Also, I want to get with you about your daily deal data, because I want to 
run a Dow volume vs our volume data set daily.

Thanks!

I know - it's amazing that in this age of technological wizardry we are 
forced to resort to some of the cheesiest hijinks known to man. Of course, if 
I was one of those technological wizards, I'd just come up with my own e-mail 
birthday greeting, and it would KICK ASS! Anyway, just to take even more of 
the fun out of your birthday, I thought I'd just go ahead and let you know 
what I'm getting you: money. Of course. I'm actually paying you back the $200 
I still owe you, and kicking in an extra $50. How's that sound? It should 
reach you by next Thursday (when I get paid), so you can plan you're life 
around it's arrival accordingly. Would it be easier for you to cash a check 
or a money order? I think cash in the mail is a little too risky. I can also 
use that money to buy you something, get you a Safeway gift certificate, 
c.d.'s, etc., if you'd rather. Let me know what you're preference is - this 
bank is willing to work with any customer requests. Hope your birthday rocks. 
I'm sorry I couldn't be there to celebrate (read: get insanely inebriated) 
with you, and that I couldn't contribute to the birthday fund sooner. 

Love,
Kate"

Hi Kate, Lindy Conrad a trader from Seattle City Light called me today.  She 
thinks the price for deal # 537565.01 should be $360.00 instead of $350.00.  
She said that Sean Crandall was our trader.  

Let me know what you find out.
Thanks,

I will be attending an Energy Math training session today from 9 a.m. to 5 
p.m. PST. Please direct all correspondence to traders whose deals are in 
question. I'm sorry for the inconvenience - but hopefully I'll be smarter 
when I come back! 

I'll check in and wrap things up at 5:00, so if you have any questions you'd 
like to save for me, I'll be at my desk then.

Just to keep you up to date on this -
I was told to call Larry Joe Hunter today for our counterparty matchups on 
the May futures contracts. I left him two messages, but never got a call 
back. I wonder if he's out of the office? Anyway, I'll definitely get a hold 
of someone tomorrow - if I can't I'll just go straight to the broker - and 
we'll get this deal out of the New CTPY status.

Thanks,
Kate

Re: Deal discrepancies for the month of February. Following are the problems 
that have been brought to my attention and the solutions we've reached. 
Please call me with questions. 

This spreadsheet includes a missing purchase for total of 55 mw @ 195.00 on 
2/25. Sorry for the confusion - per Bill Williams III.


This spreadsheet includes modified volumes in the fixed price sale at ZP-26 
on 2/6. 



In addition, deal 525625.2 has been corrected in scheduling (there was one 
strip duplicating HE 8) and autoscheduled.  Deal 529314.1 has also been 
autoscheduled, which should remedy the discrepancy on 2/24, HE 7-17. Please 
let me know if the new CARP report does not reflect this.

Thanks,
Kate Symes

I've got one more deal that Houston says they haven't received a signed 
confirm letter for - 420529. Stephanie Piwetz says she spoke to Grant County 
and they said they already sent out that one and 432854, but haven't received 
them back from us......???? Do you know where they are?

Kate


(From 2/26/01)
Just something to keep in mind - 
The confirms group in Houston is waiting on signed confirm letters from Grant 
County for the following three deals -

432854
420554
420563

I've let Stephanie Piwetz and Sharen Cason know that you'll forward the 
letters on to them once you receive them. Or you can give them to me and I'll 
fax them over. Keep me posted on the progress.

Thanks,
Kate

Mike said to just enter a new deal with these terms - deal is 539032, and 
I've backdated the trade date to 3/1. He's going to double-check the EES 
spreadsheet to make sure he didn't miss something. In the meantime, the deal 
is in there now.

Thanks,
Kate

Our contact at EES is looking for a deal between Mike and Jubran at NP15 for 
$124.00  She thinks the deal date should be 3/1 and we are buying calendar 
year 2002.  I don't see anything in the system that looks like this. Can you 
check with Mike.

I've changed both of these. Thanks a lot for the info - you know, I went 
through all of this before, even to the point of looking up the contract with 
Christian Yoder - but the traders need it beaten into their heads! I'll 
remind them, and we'll see what happens......

These two deals are in as the wrong counterparty.  I am asking Rhonda to 
inactivate this name so he won't keep using it.  I think it is a real long, 
involved name starting with ""the"" rather than city of Oakland.  Go figure how 
someone alphabetizes!  Can you check into this.

Yes, deal should have zero volume. Looks like Jeremy just didn't have time to 
kill it so he zeroed it out. I'll kill it, but in the meantime, it's not a 
real deal and doesn't need to be confirmed.

Thanks,
Kate

I've left a message for Stewart Rosman, the mid-marketer who did this deal, 
to find out whether or not he wants this confirmed. Diana Scholtes said she 
thought he did, in which case I need to determine with him what kind of deal 
this should be, and we'd need to confirm the first leg. I'll let you know as 
soon as I hear back from him.

Thanks,
Kate

There is a leg 2 for this deal that has come up on the list to be confirmed.  
We did not confirm leg 1 of this deal and I don't think we confirm 
buy/resales as they are like transmission.  Could check into this and let me 
know.

Tom says this deal was firm energy, but it is transmission contingent. When 
Tom did the deal with FPL, he said he wouldn't buy it unless the energy was 
firm. The power has already been delivered, however, so Tom said it shouldn't 
matter what kind of energy the confirm has, so for the sake of getting it 
done, he said just to agree with what they have in their confirmation. Does 
that make any sense? And the same goes for deal 516506.

He is still disputing the price (where Enron shows $90 and FPL shows $95 in 
deal 517520), and he's expecting a call back from Jeff Wallace on that.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, could you ask Tom if this transaction is suppose to be Firm in Enpower. 
Their confirmation says Non-Firm, Transmission Contingent. Could you ask him

Kate, I am checking out EES February deals with Brocklyn Couch and problems 
were noted on two deals 512775.1 on the 5th & 527967.1 on the 22nd.

EES was not agreeing to what we (Enron Power) has in Enpower.  Per Phil 
Platter our numbers are correct and the worksheet needs to be updated to 
reflect Enpower.

EES stated they will adjust their numbers once they get an updated sheet. 
Thanks,

When you guys do loss return deals like this one with PGE, could you include 
a note in the comments section regarding the zero price and ""no confirm"" 
status? The Confirms group in Houston has requested some kind of comment in 
these deals so they don't try to track down a price or confirm the deal.

At the suggestion of Tim B. we are going to implement a procedure for Middle 
Market Transcation Deal Entry and Confirmation.  I will be writing this 
procedure.  There have been some confirms sent out recently that were 
inaccurate and some other EnPower entry issues.  More importantly, however, 
Tim simply wants to tighten procedures as a risk control mechanism.  He also 
will be writing procedures for other things various folks in his group do. 
These procedures will be put into a West Trading Procedure Book that is being 
created.  To get this process started (prior to my writing it up), please 
immediately start doing the following:

1.  On every future trade you do, tell the trader taking the position (i.e LT 
NW, ST CA, etc.) that you should be identified as the trader.  By doing this, 
you will be responsible for making sure the deal is confirmed properly.  
Otherwise, they are responsible for the accuracy of the Confirm.  
2.  I will be sent a copy of all MM group confirms from Houston and will be 
putting them into a Master MM Confirms notebook.  When received, I will 
indicate to you that it is here and you will be responsible for checking it 
and making sure it is accurate.  An accurate confirm generally means the deal 
was entered correctly into EnPower.
3.  For all existing deals that you think should be included in this notebook 
because they are a little hairy and you want to make sure your hands are 
clean with respect to an accurate confirm, please make sure I get a copy as 
soon as possible.

Thanks

Chris

I'm not exactly sure where the spreadsheet on our site comes from. Our 
preference is to keep everything in our SQL Server database, and many of the 
people that you mentioned have read access to that. When Julie Sarnowski gets 
back from vacation next week, let's talk about uploading these data to the 
server and providing a central facility for the floor.

Subject: Dow Jones Index Prices - Database Access

I'd like to inquire about the Dow Jones index price database currently being 
maintained by the Fundamentals group. It's come to my attention - by virtue 
of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several 
people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests 
from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put 
the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the 
index prices in order to run one of her reports.

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your 
spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow 
Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the 
other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile 
the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you. 
(I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)

Thanks,
Kate

FRIENDHSIP WEEK

If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same, it
would look something like the following: there would be:

57 asians
21 europeans
14 from the western hemisphere, both north and south
8  africans

52 would be female
48 would be male

70 would be non-white
30 would be white
70 would be non-christian
30 would be christian
89 would be heterosexual
11 would be homosexual
6  people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth and all 6 be
from  the United States.
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
1  would be near death
1  would be near birth
1  (yes, only 1) would have a college education
1  would own a computer

When one considers our world from such a compressed perspective, the
need for acceptance, understanding and education becomes glaringly
apparent.

The following is also something to ponder...

If you woke up this morning with more health than illness...you are
more blessed than the million who will not survive this week. If you have
never experienced the danger of battle, the loneliness of imprisonment, the
agony of torture, or the pangs of starvation you are ahead of 500 million
people in the world.

If you can attend a church meeting without fear of harassment,
arrest, torture, or death...you are more blessed than three billion people
in
the world.

If you have food in the refrigerator, clothes on your back, a roof
overhead and a place to sleep...you are richer than 75% of this
world.

If you have money in the bank, in your wallet, and spare change in a
dish someplace ... you are among the top 8% of the world's wealthy.

If your parents are still alive and still married ... you are very
rare.

If you can read this message, you just received a double blessing in
that someone was thinking of you, and furthermore, you are more blessed
than over two billion people in the world that cannot read at all.

Someone once said:  what goes around comes around.

Work  like you don't need the money.
Love  like you've never been hurt.
Dance like nobody's watching.
Sing  like nobody's listening.
Live  like it's heaven on earth.

It's national friendship week. Send this to everyone you consider a
friend. Pass this on, and brighten someone's day. Nothing will happen
if you do not decide to pass it along. the only thing that will happen,
if you do pass it on, is that someone might smile because of you.

Thanks and yes, we will need copies of the letters.  If she could send us the 
same copy she sends to the counterparty, then we can put it into our files 
and we won't have to call her repeatedly when we are trying to get a signed 
copy from the counterparty for the files.

thanks!

There are four deals on the no report that look like they sould be 
confirmed.  Can you take a look at them and check to see why they are coded 
not to be confirmed?

#533919
#533931

I guess you have seen the email that shows what your computer looks like when

Will you be sending confirm letters on these Modesto deals, or just verbally 
confirming them? Could you let Sharen or myself know so we can get something 
on record with the Confirms group in Houston?

Thanks,

It looks like your Deal Blotter settings may be defaulting to PST time zone. 
But these April deals need to flow during the PDT time zone. Could you check 
your settings and make sure the time zone defaults to PPT (that way the 
strips will choose PST or PDT accordingly)?

Two additional deals were changed to the correct time zone:
534074
534072
534071
534053

Thanks,
Kate

Kate,

these are the following deals I have amended the time zones to PPT instead of 
PST and amended the strips to reflect the change:
534066
534473
534077
534078
534064
534058

Also, these are only the brokered deals between Tom and Mark.  There may be 
some non-brokered deals in enpower with a flow of April and the time zone 
needs to be changed to PPT and the strips amended as well.  Can you please 
run a query and check the other deals to make sure the time zone is correct 
because if not they will not be scheduled correctly for April. 

If you have any question please call me.  


Thanks!!

Can you change the time zone to PPT so that the strips accurately splits the 
zime change for April.


The first strip should be   4/1 - 4/1    M-S    PDT   07-22
The next strip should be  4/2 - 4/30  M-S   PDT   07-22

Kate,

Thanks again for the info.  It just occurred to me that we should probably 
get this on the first or second workday of the month to get the last days of 
the previous months' prices (we have to send an end of month report to 
customers), or as soon as all of the prices are available.  Is that doable?

Caroline

Subject: Joke of the Day



For anyone who didn't see David Letterman the other night, this is a true 
story. A little long, but not dirty (for those who might be offended) and 
totally worth the read: 

On a recent weekend in Atlantic City, a woman won a bucketful of quarters at 
a slot machine. She took a break from the slots for dinner with her husband 
in the hotel dining room. But first she wanted to stash 
the quarters in her room. ""I'll be right back and we'll go to eat,""she told 
her husband and carried the coin-laden bucket to the elevator. 

As she was about to walk into the elevator she noticed two men already 
aboard. Both were black. One of them was tall...very tall...an intimidating 
figure. The woman froze. Her first thought was: These two are going to rob 
me. Her next thought as: Don't be a bigot, they look like perfectly nice 
gentlemen. But racial stereotypes are powerful, and fear immobilized her. She 
stood and stared at the two men. She felt anxious, flustered and ashamed. She 
hoped they didn't read her mind but Gosh, they had to know what she was 
thinking!!! Her hesitation about joining them in the elevator was all too 
obvious now. Her face was flushed. She couldn't just stand there, so with a 
mighty effort of will she picked up one foot and stepped forward and followed 
with the other foot and was on the elevator. Avoiding eye contact, she turned 
around stiffly and faced the elevator doors as they closed. A second passed, 
and the another second, and then another. Her fear increased! The elevator 
didn't move. Panic consumed her. My God, she thought, I'm trapped and about 
to be robbed! Her heart plummeted. Perspiration poured from every pore. 

Then one of the men said, ""Hit the floor."" Instinct told her to do what they 
told her. The bucket of quarters flew upwards as she threw out her arms and 
collapsed on the elevator floor. A shower of coins rained down on her. Take 
my money and spare me, she prayed. More seconds passed. 

She heard one of the men say politely, ""Ma'am, if you'll just tell us that 
floor you're going to, we'll push the button."" The one who said it had a 
little trouble getting the words out. He was trying mightily to hold in a 
belly laugh. The woman lifted her head and looked up at the two men. 

They reached down to help her up. Confused, she struggled to her feet. ""When 
I told my friend here to hit the floor,"" said the average sized one, ""I meant 
that he should hit the elevator button for our floor. I didn't mean for you 
to hit the floor, ma'am."" He spoke genially. He bit his lip. It was obvious 
he was having a hard time not laughing. 

The woman thought: ""My God, what a spectacle I've made of myself"". She was 
humiliated to speak. She wanted to blurt out an apology, but words failed 
her. How do you apologize to two perfectly respectable gentlemen for behaving 
as though they were going to rob you? She didn't know what to say. The three 
of them gathered up the strewn quarters and refilled her bucket. 

When the elevator arrived at her floor they then insisted on walking her to 
her room. She seemed a little unsteady on her feet, and they were afraid she 
might not make it down the corridor. At her door they bid her a good evening. 
As she slipped into her room she could hear them roaring with laughter as 
they walked back to the elevator. The woman brushed herself off. She pulled 
herself together and went downstairs for dinner with her husband. 

The next morning flowers were delivered to her room - a dozen roses. Attached 
to EACH rose was a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The card said: ""Thanks for 
the best laugh we've had in years."" It was signed; 

Eddie Murphy & Michael Jordan

Yeah, Seattle actually had a 7.0 earthquake at about 11a.m. our time. I made 
it out from under our building with only a broken leg and shattered.....no 
just kidding. What's funny is that I was on my way to lunch when the 
earthquake hit Portland, and for whatever reason - my conspicuous 
absentmindedness or the cold medicine I'm high on - I didn't feel a thing. I 
walked out into the streets of downtown to ambulances screaming all around 
and ladies freaking out and running out of buildings. I went to the little 
soup stand I always go to, and the soup guy asked if I had felt the 
earthquake, and I said, you know it's funny but I DIDN'T. And he said, well 
that IS funny because I didn't either. But I think we're the only two who 
didn't notice it. Weird, huh!

Thanks for checking though.

Kate

Carla - you entered this deal on 2/23/01. Should it be back-dated to match 
trade date on confirmation letter?

Here's the latest info. regarding Bloomberg's ability to accept deals with 
Pinnacle West (formerly Arizona Public Service Co.). From now on, we'll enter 
ALL deals with Pinnacle, despite Bloomberg's slow response to the 
counterparty name change. If you never knew that Bloomberg wasn't accepting 
confirms with the name Pinnacle on them, then disregard this message and 
continue as you were.

Thanks,

Rhonda Denton has just informed me that all deals according to Michele 
Chalmers with Pinnacle West  should be traded with the counterparty as 
Pinnacle West not Arizona Public Service.  No deals should be under Arizona 
Public just because Bloomberg is having problems or what ever re-doing the 
contract.   

From this day forward please tell all our guys to please choose Pinnacle West 
not Arizona regardless of what Bloomberg says.  If they have any questions 
please have them contact Rhonda Denton at 853-5871 or Michele 
Chalmers(Pinnacle West) at 602-250-3824.

I guess TFS originally had Palo on their confirm - which was wrong - then the 
deal got changed to Mid-C. So Enpower is right, and Mike just let his broker 
know to change the delivery point on the confirm.

confirming the daily deals in the west.  Please remind the guys that we will 
need the counterparty contact filled in to prepare the confirmations.  If 
they absolutely do not have a contact, they may use the Documentation

spoken with a few people here and discerned that the deal wasn't in because 
the counterparty wasn't in the system yet. I took a look and found that Port

Hi Kate,

I spoke with Jeff Richter this morning and the index sleeve he did on 
yesterday with EES (deal 533084) and Sempra(deal 533085) is incorrect in 
Enpower.  He said he would change the publication code to reflect Dow Jones 
SP-15 Peak instead of Dow Jones NP-15 Peak on both of these deals.

Can you please check with Jeff to see what the status is on these changes. 
The EES deal has been changed. The Sempra deal has not been changed.

Thanks!!

Thanks so much for getting back to me on this! I actually found the deal 
number (after suffering a small heart attack) and the signed confirmation in 
Livelink. It ended up being an Avista error that circled back to us. It's 
cleared up with all involved parties now, but it was a little scary for a 
minute there. Anyway, no need to do anything more, but thanks again for your 
response - and I hope you feel better soon.

I got your voice mail this morning (I was out sick yesterday).  I did a 
search based on the info you left in your vmail and got deal #531742.  Is 
this the deal you were looking for?  If so, this confirmation letter has been 
executed by Avista Energy, Inc.  Would you like a faxed copy of this confirm?

I'm feeling pretty under the weather today, so I'm going to sneak out of here 
early - but I haven't yet received the Dow Jones data for today. Instead, I'm 
sending yesterday's information. If you need today as well, let me know and 
I'll send it first thing in the morning.



Thanks,

I'm so sorry, gals, but I feel awful and I'm going home to nurse myself to 
health. If you could direct your e-mails for the remainder of the day to the 
respective traders, I would really appreciate it. And if anything can wait 
until tomorrow, just e-mail it to me and I'll take care of it in the morning. 
I'm going to sleep for the next 15 hours and see if that rids me of this cold 
once and for all!

Thanks,

I just spoke with Justin Rostant, who reported that ICE will begin sending 
him data tomorrow morning. So you can expect the ICE volumes to be included 
on tomorrow's EOL report. Let me know if you have any other specifications 
for the report.

Thanks,

I am sure you expected me to comment on EOL at some point - but just in case 
you don't see the attached reporting.  Essentially in power we are now doing 
the same volume as the Intercontinental Exchange.  If you want reports like 
this, Justin Rostant can produce whatever you wish.

Yesterday:
ICE   1,892,800 MWhs
EnronOnline 1,843,874 MWhs (plus 124,850 MWhs financial)

See attached.

 New Energy Secretary Guesses He Ought To Read Up On Energy

WASHINGTON, DC-- Spencer Abraham, the newly installed U.S. Energy Secretary, 
admitted Monday that he probably ought to read up on energy. ""I know energy 
is really important, and that there was a big crisis back in the '70s, but 
other than that, I'm in the dark,"" Abraham said. ""I was hoping to be 
appointed Secretary of Transportation, which I know a lot more about, but 
that one was already taken."" The former Michigan senator said he plans to go 
to the library Thursday to look up ""Energy"" in The World Book Encyclopedia."

The third deal - 531910 - I'm checking on with Les right now. Sharen Cason 
asked me this morning who the contact was, and typically with services deals 
the traders like to confirm the deals themselves - so I'm not sure if it 
should be confirmed.

The other two contain contact names - are they not valid in GCP? Do you need 
new names and phone numbers or just numbers to go along with those names?

Kate

Thanks - I've changed it. With deals like those, it's fine if you need to 
change the counterparty name in the interest of time or efficiency. Could 
just send me a quick e-mail, and copy Bill Williams III (real time manager), 
when you change deals under the Short Term West Hourly desk? That way we can 
both keep on top of common mistakes. And if it's at all possible for you to 
wait on making those changes until you've e-mailed me, that would be great. 
If I don't respond right away - if I'm out of the office or at lunch - then 
feel free to change away!

Thanks,
Kate

Deal should be no confirm. It was done by Stan Cocke in Services, and those 
guys deal directly with their counterparty contacts. He thought he marked 
this no confirm, but must have defaulted to confirm anyway. I'll change deal 
as soon as risk is done with their calc.

The Confirms group in Houston has asked me to obtain a copy of the 
confirmation letter you come up with for this deal. This group is responsible 
for keeping records of all confirmation letters, whether or not they execute 
them. So this includes term deals that are marked ""no confirm."" Please let me 
know if this is okay with you.

So I watched the news last night and discovered to my utter dismay that the 
whole damn city of Seattle began rioting over my pointed absence this 
weekend. Some people just don't know how to control those emotions, I guess.

How was dinner, anyway? I was actually hoping to come, but I seem to have 
misplaced Michael's phone number and so had no way of contacting you guys. 
Also, I wasn't quite confident in my ability to find your house through 
""alternative"" methods such as hanging out at the train station or wandering 
through Microsoft millionaire-type neighborhoods. And to top it all off, I 
lost my voice Friday night - for no apparent reason other than the usual 
deficit of sleep and surplus of cigarettes - and wouldn't you know it would 
have to turn into a full blown cold by this morning. 

As can be expected, we're experiencing the most insanely gorgeous weather 
I've seen in all my Februarys in Portland, which is making my acceptance of 
actually being sick even more difficult. Whatever happened with your fever? 
I'd feel much better if I knew others were sharing my pain. In fact, I 
promptly gave my cold to Amber on Saturday, so I'd have a partner in my time 
of homebound misery. She took it a step further, in true drama queen fashion. 
Case in point - I'm at work, she's rounding out her 39th consecutive hour in 
bed. 

Anyway, I'm going to skip out of here a whopping half an hour EARLY today 
because people are starting to look visibly pained when I try to talk. But I 
thought I'd check on the success of the dinner party and apologize for not 
making it. And if you get a chance, tell Michael that I have a very 
legitimate reason for losing his phone number. Or at least, I'll have one by 
the time he calls.

Yes - I finally reached someone at Avista who had been working on the problem 
as well. She filled me in on a few things, and I straightened out the story 
with our broker. It turned out to be Avista's fault - they failed to report 
to their broker that we paid them for a futures contract, and that triggered 
a domino effect of payment inquiries. We did pay, and the record shows that.

Thanks for following up!

Kate

You're right - thanks for checking up on us. This deal was actually done this

She doesn't have the signed confirm back yet. Sharen asked me about it a few 
weeks ago, and Holli told me she'd send it to the confirms group as soon as 
she got it. She's talking to her contact there right now to find out what's 
going on. I guess she's getting a little fed up of beating around the bush 
with these guys - so hopefully she'll get some concrete answers from them 
today. I'll let you know whatever we find out this afternoon.

I must know why your roommates are so scary! Mine - well, that's just 
obvious. Oh, and since we last e-mailed, Molly has gone out and landed 
herself a full-fledged boyfriend. Anything to avoid getting a job. He's a 
""natural healer"" and he's also had ""an experience with Jesus,"" so this one 
should be REALLY interesting. Amber and I had a few drinks last night and 
basically pretended like nothing happened - it's easier that way. We both 
know there's no real friendship to salvage, so keeping it strictly in the 
bars is the smartest thing to do. And Anna, don't think for a minute that my 
description of life in Portland is exciting or cultured or romantic, cause 
it's pretty much the polar opposite of all those things. I've been so tired 
this week that I've been spouting out sentences like ""The red computer needs 
to climb my shoelaces and the people riding the dinosaurs are wrong."" It's 
definitely been interesting. I'm on my way to sushi with a few people right 
now, but of course I can see my reflection in my forehead and my hair looks 
like a sad, sad, small animal. Super! Maybe I'll meet the man of my dreams. 
I'll tell you, Anna - I know you've got scary clashing dresser man, but 
sometimes from the single person's point of view, that doesn't look so bad. 
Hang in there - and call me soon!

Love,
Kate

Hey buttface!

Wow - it actually sounds like your roommate problems may be comparable to
mine (except that you probably don't fear for your life quite as much).  Who
is paying for Amber to come to Denver?  It sounds like she might be a little
out of her mind right now, but at least she's not going back to Chris just
yet.  So are you going to Seattle this weekend?  That sounds so fun!  I am
so jealous - parties, dinners, wine, men.  You and I are NOT living the same
life right now.  I am in the process of trying to break things off with the
ugly dresser, which was proving to be difficult until last night, when I
made the mistake of letting him come to a movie with Michelle and I.  Kate,
I was scared.  It was dark and I was surrounded by the two most psycho
people I know.  Josh talked through the whole thing and laughed at
inappropriate moments and tried to hold my hand at one point.  It was
excruciating!  It made Michelle look almost normal.

Not much else going on.  I'll call you this weekend, okay?  We need to dish.

Luego,
Anna

Subject: Re: Rockin in the Rockies, bro



So didya hear the Blazers creamed the Nuggets last night? I always knew the
Pacific Northwest would dominate in sports - they're not battling with that
ol' Rocky Mountain High if ya know what I mean.

Well I'm sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday - work was hectic and I
knew that if I started an e-mail to you it would either be half-assed or
I'd never finish it. Well, I'm going for the former now, because I realized
there would never be a good time to divulge the full and sordid details of
what's happening around here, and all the while I wait, more and more
important nuggets (get it!) of gossip are accumulating.

So it's quite appropriate that you wrote yesterday with roommate issues -
mine could not be worse. Amber took off for the ""library"" on Thursday night
and came home.....four days later. After Molly and I had a mild freak-out
session on Friday - which included calling everybody she's every known,
including Chris and the police - we heard through the grapevine that Marky
McCulloch, of Neidermeyer cousin fame, was in town from none other than
Denver and the two were having a secret and James-Bond-like rendezvous at
the beach. Well that was all well and fine, other than the fact that she
DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and we had been planning a housewarming
party this weekend for the past month and she DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS
LEAVING and she moved kitty into the house but still hasn't told our
landlords or paid the $500 deposit, oh, and also, SHE DIDN'T TELL US SHE
WAS LEAVING. So many things were wrong and bizarre about that, but none
more than her attitude when she walked in the door Monday afternoon. Let's
just say I spared no lung muscles in telling her exactly what I thought
about her selfish, childish, idiotic, and most importantly, psychotically
self-important behavior. She had the gall to defensively scream back that
she didn't tell us BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LIE. Hmmmm. Not only did she
not want to lie - how sweet - but she couldn't have told us because Molly
and I have suddenly developed an insatiable urge to spread fervent and
widespread rumors about Amber's love trysts. Now, I KNOW there's nothing
I'd rather be doing.

Anyway, enough of that. She and I have reached an understanding that just
because we're roommates does not mean we have to be friends. We've never
been good at that anyhow. In other news, we had an amazing housewarming
party. I really wish you could have been there. Molly and I didn't know 90
percent of the people there, which is a good thing because it meant they
were all interesting, successful, gracious and cute. I think there were
about four girls there - you could tell who planned the party. Sadly, no
love connections were made that evening, but I've decided that's my new
M.O. - keep 'em guessing. My friend Michael from Maui who now lives in
Seattle came down with his friend Jordan who happens to be hot and writing
an article for Food & Wine magazine. Very interesting guy, but potentially
in the closet, so I'm keeping my distance. But they invited me up to
Seattle next weekend for a five-course meal and $100 bottles of wine at
some Microsoft dude's mansion. Definitely sounds like my crowd. Should I
wear my dirty jeans or my clean jeans?

I've got my eye on flights to Denver, but right now it's looking like the
end of March before I can scrape up that kind of cash. Amber on the other
hand will be there five times before that because some psycho over there
keeps buying her tickets. That's fair for ya.

Okay, that's all I can do for now, but call me tonight and we'll do the
rumor mill justice. Take care and hang in there - we'll be booting a
roommate soon if you feel like coming back to Portland.

I just spoke with Justin about collaborating on the ICE and EOL volume 
reports. He doesn't actually have access to ICE data right now, but has 
requested it from staff at the exchange. He's not sure of the exact day he 
might begin receiving this report, but told me it would be sometime next 
week. I'll let you know when I find out. 

Also, do you want this report simply added to the end of the EOL Summary, or 
would you like the information integrated into the tables that show our 
volumes? Let me know when you have a moment.

Thanks,
Kate

I am sure you expected me to comment on EOL at some point - but just in case 
you don't see the attached reporting.  Essentially in power we are now doing 
the same volume as the Intercontinental Exchange.  If you want reports like 
this, Justin Rostant can produce whatever you wish.

Yesterday:
ICE   1,892,800 MWhs
EnronOnline 1,843,874 MWhs (plus 124,850 MWhs financial)

See attached.

Deal should be no confirm. It was done by Stan Cocke in Services, and those 
guys deal directly with their counterparty contacts. He thought he marked 
this no confirm, but must have defaulted to confirm anyway. I'll change deal 
as soon as risk is done with their calc.

This deal is a placeholder for our futures position that rolled off 
yesterday. We're awaiting our counterparty match-ups, which I asked Jason 
Fischer about yesterday. He said the broker wouldn't have those until today. 
I'll let you know once we've changed the deal accordingly.

Here are details of the problem we're having with the Tagg IQ Reports:

Three Mid-Columbia futures trades were executed by Matt Motley, Long Term 
Southwest Desk, on 2/5, 2/6, and 2/7.
Trades pulled into Tagg IQ Reports -
 All three pull into Future Daily Transaction Report (RSX0245F.IQR) 
 Only two pull into Future Net Position Summary (RXSNSUMF.IQR)
 All three pull into Tagg Exchange Capture search - transaction IDs are 
980362/983837/987050
 All three pulled into Tagg Metacalc (Meta ID 77771 - Post ID 1035917 - Post 
ID 77880 - Post ID 1037269) until 2/9 - NOW GONE

Because today is the Nymex Electricity Futures exercise date, we need to know 
as soon as possible for our calculations whether or not these deals are in 
the system, and if not, where they went. My confusion lies in the fact that I 
can find these deals when I do a search in Tagg for any futures deals traded 
at the Mid-C settlement index, and yet the Risk group can no longer see 
anything for Mid-C in their calculation. Please let me know what you find.

Thank you,
Kate

We'd like to create a daily and monthly trade volume report, similar to the 
EOL Report we currently use to track both online and brokered trades done in 
the Portland office each day. The EOL JF tab seems to track the same data we 
need for a daily volume report; however, it does not display the data in the 
form we need. 

Under the ""Sort By"" heading at the bottom of the report, there are two 
choices - ""Deal #"" and ""Desk."" As I run it now, the report displays megawatt 
volumes and total deals according to desk. We now need to display the data 
according to delivery point. 

Please call Cara Semperger or myself when you get a moment, and we can fill 
you in on all the parameters she's looking for in this report. From there I 
think it should be a pretty simple modification of the query.

Thanks in advance for your help on this.

Subject: Dow Jones Index Prices - Database Access

I'd like to inquire about the Dow Jones index price database currently being 
maintained by the Fundamentals group. It's come to my attention - by virtue 
of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several 
people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests 
from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put 
the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the 
index prices in order to run one of her reports.

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your 
spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow 
Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the 
other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile 
the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you. 
(I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)

Thanks,
Kate

I just spoke with Nicolay, who helped me develop the EOL Report, and he said 
he'd check the code in both that and the Sales Volume Report to see if they 
are in fact pulling in different data. I'll let you know what he finds.

Here's what's wierd:  I ran a Sales Volume Report for 2/21 only, and got a 
total of  596,284.

On your report for the same day,  I get a total of 1,468,175.  That doesn't 
include anything done by about 4 books that are supposed to be on mine!

I wonder what's up with that??  I just wrote to Duong luu to ask him about 
the sales volume report.

After a little more digging, I've found that the deal NYMEX was referring to 
is the same one we dealt with a month ago. I spoke with Tracy Green, one of 
our contacts at Avista, and she had been dealing with the same issue all day. 
Apparently, when Avista first incorrectly reported that we hadn't made a 
payment, it set off a domino effect of doubts that seems to still be falling. 
So NYMEX called EDF Mann, our futures clearing broker, today to assure that 
payment would be made today.

Tracy had been speaking with her broker at ABN-AMRO; I had been speaking with 
ours at Mann; and NYMEX had been communicating through both of these entities 
to us. I've left a message with John Croddock at NYMEX to discuss this 
directly with him. His number, if you'd like it for your own purposes, is 
(212) 299-2146.

Other contacts are Tracy Green, Avista, at (509) 495-8535, and Gary (?), ABN, 
at (212) 859-1212.

As far as Avista, ABN, ED&F Mann, and EPMI are considered, the March Palo 
Verde futures contract has been paid, and paid on time. I'd like to speak 
with John at NYMEX to tie up any possible loose ends on this. Please let me 
know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Thanks for your help,
Kate"

Well I'm sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday - work was hectic and I 
knew that if I started an e-mail to you it would either be half-assed or I'd 
never finish it. Well, I'm going for the former now, because I realized there 
would never be a good time to divulge the full and sordid details of what's 
happening around here, and all the while I wait, more and more important 
nuggets (get it!) of gossip are accumulating.

So it's quite appropriate that you wrote yesterday with roommate issues - 
mine could not be worse. Amber took off for the ""library"" on Thursday night 
and came home.....four days later. After Molly and I had a mild freak-out 
session on Friday - which included calling everybody she's every known, 
including Chris and the police - we heard through the grapevine that Marky 
McCulloch, of Neidermeyer cousin fame, was in town from none other than 
Denver and the two were having a secret and James-Bond-like rendezvous at the 
beach. Well that was all well and fine, other than the fact that she DIDN'T 
TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and we had been planning a housewarming party this 
weekend for the past month and she DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and she 
moved kitty into the house but still hasn't told our landlords or paid the 
$500 deposit, oh, and also, SHE DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING. So many 
things were wrong and bizarre about that, but none more than her attitude 
when she walked in the door Monday afternoon. Let's just say I spared no lung 
muscles in telling her exactly what I thought about her selfish, childish, 
idiotic, and most importantly, psychotically self-important behavior. She had 
the gall to defensively scream back that she didn't tell us BECAUSE SHE 
DIDN'T WANT TO LIE. Hmmmm. Not only did she not want to lie - how sweet - but 
she couldn't have told us because Molly and I have suddenly developed an 
insatiable urge to spread fervent and widespread rumors about Amber's love 
trysts. Now, I KNOW there's nothing I'd rather be doing.

Anyway, enough of that. She and I have reached an understanding that just 
because we're roommates does not mean we have to be friends. We've never been 
good at that anyhow. In other news, we had an amazing housewarming party. I 
really wish you could have been there. Molly and I didn't know 90 percent of 
the people there, which is a good thing because it meant they were all 
interesting, successful, gracious and cute. I think there were about four 
girls there - you could tell who planned the party. Sadly, no love 
connections were made that evening, but I've decided that's my new M.O. - 
keep 'em guessing. My friend Michael from Maui who now lives in Seattle came 
down with his friend Jordan who happens to be hot and writing an article for 
Food & Wine magazine. Very interesting guy, but potentially in the closet, so 
I'm keeping my distance. But they invited me up to Seattle next weekend for a 
five-course meal and $100 bottles of wine at some Microsoft dude's mansion. 
Definitely sounds like my crowd. Should I wear my dirty jeans or my clean 
jeans?

I've got my eye on flights to Denver, but right now it's looking like the end 
of March before I can scrape up that kind of cash. Amber on the other hand 
will be there five times before that because some psycho over there keeps 
buying her tickets. That's fair for ya.

Okay, that's all I can do for now, but call me tonight and we'll do the rumor 
mill justice. Take care and hang in there - we'll be booting a roommate soon 
if you feel like coming back to Portland.

Here you are, ladies. As per our prior discussion, these are the Dow Jones 
index price reports I promised to send you. Let me know how this works for 
you. If there are no questions, comments, or concerns, I'll forward the 
e-mails to you each week on Tuesday afternoon as soon as I receive them.

And thanks for encouraging Willie Harrell to automate the pub-posting system. 
Sounds pretty logical to me!

Subject: RE:


What up dude!

I haven't heard from you in awhile, so I thought I would remind you that you
have a sister and she lives in Colorado and she has no friends and no life
and one psycho roommate and is therefore desperately in need of sane
conversation/gossip through which she can live vicariously.  How's it going?
Are you feeling better?  Is the roommate situation improving?  Mine is SO
not.  And to add to the drama, lonesomeness has once again driven me into
the arms of a man with whom I undoubtedly have no future.  He launched a
surprise attack on Valentine's Day - when my guard was obviously down.  Yes,
it's still the colorblind starbucks guy.  We were just going to go out for A
drink, but 9 vanilla stoli and cokes later we were making out like teenagers
in a prom limo.  Even his baby poop green blazer-style leather jacket had
started to look like an acceptable outerwear addition to his camel-colored
wide-whale corduroy and pumpkin orange sweater ensemble.  It was madness.
So anyway, I shacked, and unfortunately now a precedent has been set, so now
I pretty much spend most of my day coming up with various believable reasons
for not spending the night at his house.    It's been almost a week so I
think he's starting to suspect something.  Little does he know that by the
time this whole debacle is over, he will wish he had never heard the name
""Anna Symes"".  He's great and fun and everything, and yet I feel that
familiar desire to kill this relationship - and not just kill it, but shoot
at it and kick it in the head even after it's dead.  Think I have issues?

Other than that, not a lot happening over here.  I like my new job, although
right now it's really dead and I find myself wondering what I'm supposed to
be doing a lot of the time.  I have been playing phone tag with Monica, but
I think I might start stalking her a little more intensely as I am in
desperate need of some friends.  Actually, starbucks guy and I had an
interesting conversation about this last night.  I have been feeling so down
lately, and I finally realized that this move was a million times harder
than London or Argentina were because I am literally starting from scratch
in the social department.  Michelle is scary and therefore does not count as
a source of moral support or even pleasant conversation.  I'm trying to see
this as a positive thing, like a challenge to see if I can be happy without
the network of people I have always had around me.  I know it's not the
Peace Corps or anything, but it's still kind of scary.  Anyway, that's my
deep thought for the week.  I'm sure soon enough I'll be crying yet once
again about how I want to come home, but for now I'm great (I think!).

By the way, have you heard Ben Lee (singer)?  He Claire Danes' boyfriend, so
you may have heard of him before.  Anyway, you have to check him out - he's
awesome!  The cd I like the best has the word hurricanes or volcanoes or
something in the title (sorry, I can't remember exactly).  It's a good
feel-good cd.  So let me know how it's going out there in P-town, and when
are you coming to visit?  Okay, love you, miss you, etc.!

Besos,
Anna

Hey there - I'm so sorry I haven't responded until now. I've been swamped
with work, moving, and now the flu. Whoo, hoo! So, as far as gossip is
concerned, I'm all dried up for now. I was going to go on a company ski
trip this weekend, but I feel so crappy I can't even imagine being outside,
let alone surrounded by snow and wind at the same time. I imagine you're
totally used to that by now, but keep in mind your weather is accompanied
by sun and not eternal grayness.

Our house is coming along nicely. Molly and I already want to boot Amber
out, but that's okay. We deal with it by laughing about her antics whenever
possible - behind her back or in front of her face. It really helps us out,
and I think it does wonders for her ego too. Work is work. The weather is
foul! Men are too. I don't even have one prospect at this point. Of course
there's always the innocent, fleeting crushes from a distance; but I've got
to admit I hardly even have the energy for those anymore.

I hope you can make it home for a visit soon, because you are going to LOVE
our house. I will definitely keep my eyes peeled for cheap tickets to
Denver, or maybe I'll just do the train and take a long weekend. Either
way, I'll definitely make it there by springtime. Tell me about your jobs,
friends (or not?), and life in general. I'm going to get back to work and
hustle so I can get out of here early and suffer peacefully at home. I'll
give you a call from my sick bed, 'kay?

Take care,
Kate

Hey there stranger!

Thanks for the pictures - they've definitely been the highlight of my day. 
It's funny that you sent those now, because over the weekend Molly and I had 
our big housewarming blowout party, and - speaking of strangers - Michael (of 
sushi fame) and his friend came down from Seattle for it! Weird, huh. I don't 
see or hear from the guy in half a year, and then in the same three days he 
not only comes to my house but shows up in my e-mail. 

I can't chat right now - things are just coming to a rolling boil here at 
work. But I'll give you a call this evening. Are you packed for Spain yet? 
Are you ready to leave the laid back island like to which you've grown 
accustomed? Is everyone there still as crazy as when I left them? Write back, 
or give me a call. I'd love to hear the update.

Take care,
Kate"

my brokers.  I am sending this to ensure a quality checkout to minimize any 
risks associated with our transactions.  Even if I don't have any errors I 
will still send a summary everyday of my checkouts for the west deals.  We 
have had several deals pop up from the brokers that we didn't know about and 
did not verbal the day of the trade and this will serve as proof of the 
previous days checkout.

Bend like a reed in the wind? It's funny you should say that, since I've been 
reading a lot about Buddhist philosophy lately. I stayed with a couple in 
London who practice Buddhist meditation pretty regularly. Ever since then 
I've thought something like that would do a world of good for my mental 
health, being that I've always been more of a giant steel piling than a reed 
when the wind kicks up. I did let her have it, don't worry; but my Catholic 
guilt always gets the best of me, and I assure you I'll be extending all 
kinds of undeserved compassion by this evening.

As far as the sick thing goes - screw that. That's one occasion you cannot 
take lying down, or bending like a reed as it were. You sabotage that thing 
with vitamin C and some uber-multi-vitamin and echinacea and hot water with 
lemon and honey and 14 hours of sleep a night UNTIL IT RUNS SCREAMING FROM 
YOUR BODY. I hate being sick...almost as much as I hate bending like a reed. 

Speaking of Woody Allen - I saw his new one, ""Small Time Crooks,"" last night. 
I'd give it an unenthusiastic ""mediocre."" Rent it if you've exhausted all 
other options. Tonight I think we're going to check out ""Traffic"" - I've 
heard rave reviews. Or otherwise it's ""Cinema Paradiso"" for the 
sixty-thousandth time, but this time on the big screen. The deciding factor 
will be money, and beer. ""Traffic"" will cost twice as much as ""Cinema,"" but 
the theater showing ""Cinema"" has comfy couches and serves beer, so I'll end 
up spending twice as much as I would at ""Traffic."" Do you see the moral 
dilemma here? 

I'm sorry to ramble, but today happens to be alarmingly devoid of surprises. 
Having said that, I'm practically positive some catastrophe will occur in the 
next 30 seconds, so I'm going to go now.

I can't believe that bitch would just wander into the house full of ire and 
phasers set to kill. I hope you let her have it. Some friend! She was just 
trying to get your goat. Knows to how to press your buttons and will continue 
to until she grows up. If I were you I'd follow the Buddhist path--extend 
compassion to her, don't let your state of mind be controlled by what she 
does, bend like a reed in the wind, etc. Anyhoo . . .

I started to get a little sick last night. Think I might have been running a 
fever, so I came home and went to bed early. But I don't always sleep so 
well. The bed I'm?using gives me the distinct impression that I'm sleeping on 
a grade, that I'm slipping into a pit or a valley. My dreams?are always about 
climbing out of things. And then Hector the dachshund sleeps on the bed with 
me and even though he's only about a foot and a half long, it always seems 
like he takes up all the room. Oh, I'm just complaining. Cross your fingers 
that I don't get sick.

""Croupier "" I've always wanted to see. Glad you give it the thumbs up. I 
think I'm going to head downstairs and watch a movie myself. Perhaps Woody 
Allen's ""Manhattan,"" an old fave I haven't seen in years.

Talk to you soon. Oh yes, and about the weekend. Of course I give you the 
""flaky""?time allowance you need. I would demand the same for myself. If you 
decide to come down, you don't even have to tell us until Friday or Saturday. 
You don't even have to tell us at all. You could just come and not see us and 
head back Sunday if you want. We are that tolerant of flakiness here. No, 
seriously, if you feel like coming it would be wonderful to see you. If not, 
another time will come.

It was great - we ended up having a really eclectic mix of people. You should 
have stopped by! No worries, though, I'm sure we'll have many more. Thanks 
for the info for Molly - I'll pass it along, for whatever it's worth. Also, I 
noticed you hadn't deposited the check yet - if you'd like, I can bring you 
cash at about 11:30 this morning. Just thought maybe that would be easier for 
you. Let me know.

Thanks for thinking of me during your consolidated e-mail spree. It's always 
nice to arrive at work Monday (or in this case Tuesday) morning and receive 
something other than urgent, faceless messages demanding my immediate 
attention. I received those as well this morning, of course, but being who I 
am decided to respond urgently to the frivolous ones and frivolously to the 
urgent ones.

Your Sunday sounds incredibly more productive than mine - pity. After a quick 
survey of the very little mess left after you two left (THANK YOU!), Molly 
and I decided to bag any further cleaning and instead go for a drive through 
some of the nicer Portland neighborhoods, admiring gardens here and paint 
colors there. Everyone was out enjoying the crisp sunshine and inhaling our 
exhaust fumes. But watching from our comfortable car seats was about all we 
could muster after the weekend's debaucheries. Then we returned home for a 
movie marathon that did not, you correctly assumed, include the Philadelphia 
story. We did watch two fabulous films - ""The Virgin Suicides"" and 
""Croupier,"" both of which I highly recommend. We built a gigantic bed out of 
couch cushions and drank chamomile tea until we passed out. 

Amber the mysteriously absent roommate turned up Monday afternoon, and I was 
amazingly more angry than I had previously thought, mostly because she walked 
into the house smacking of defensiveness, ready to fight. So rather than 
disappoint her expectations, I gave her what she wanted, only with more 
volume. If the neighbors didn't hear us Saturday night, they can be sure 
somebody lives there now.

I've got a call in to my friend Scott to locate Mr. Down Under Wine guy. In 
my slightly more sober state, I'm starting to feel like he may own a winery 
in Australia, not New Zealand. We'll find out for sure later today. And I'll 
let you know when I hear from him.

Thanks again for making the trip DOWN to Portland - you guys were great 
company. I'd love to come to Seattle this weekend; however, I never make 
plans more than one day in advance. I've found myself to be much too flaky 
for that. Let me know if you need notice sooner than that. 

Take care,
Kate

I know you won't get this until Tuesday, I just thought I'd write for the 
purposes of consolidation. It was great meeting you and thanks for your 
hospitality and easy-going ways. I wonder if you watched the Philadelphia 
story. Probably not, but it's not going anywhere. It's a bright sunny day 
here in Seattle and, over a couple?of cups of coffee, I wrote all morning. At 
some point I'm going to go outside and do something today. A walk around the 
lake perhaps or a hike through the woods. 
?
Anyway, I don't have a lot to say. Thanks in advance for your help in getting 
me in touch with the New Zealand dude and do think seriously about coming 
down for dinner next weekend. Stay in touch,

Hey Dad -
Thanks for your update on the status of the sailing club's opening day. For 
my purposes, April 22 works better simply because I probably won't be coming 
anyway..... Just joking. Looks like I mistakenly made it onto your sailing 
club e-mail list. Unless I'm really invited to opening day?

Subject: Proposed date change for WSC Opening Day



After some discussion about WSC Opening Day date,  Marilyn and I would like 
to propose moving it from Apr. 1 to Apr. 22. Our  reasoning is as follows:
?
1. Apr. 1 is last day of spring break which will be  a conflict for many WSC 
families. It's also just a week after the board chili  feed on Mar. 25.
?
2. Apr. 22 is the last Sunday of series sailing  before we go to evenings. 
It's the week after Easter, chances for good weather  are marginally better, 
and there are no conflicts that we are aware  of.
?
If you have any suggestions pro or con, please let  me know by Wednesday (we 
need to publish date in Mar. Telltales). If not, we'll  go with Apr. 22. 
Thanks,
?
Bill

How did you know Steve Smith would be my first choice for a Blazer date? 
Maybe I'm not as original as I thought I was.

Anyway, I think you've got it straight. Mollie is the administrative 
assistant in charge of ordering and paying for season tickets for the 
Origination group. I'm a trader's assistant  who once worked for Mollie and 
stole the Blazer responsibility out from under her nose. We still cross paths 
every now and then, so anything that comes to me will get to her. 

Thanks for taking such good care of our sporting needs. And you have a great 
weekend too. Don't forget to take a moment of silence for our past Presidents 
on Monday.

Thanks for the update, Ryan. I've forwarded the e-mail along, and hopefully 
you'll continue to get a good response from all the Blazer fans here. I had a 
chance to catch last night's game - if you could call it that - against the 
Kings. Now all we have to do is pull a Tonya Harding on Chris Webber and 
we've got a chance at the championship! 

I also thought I'd mention that I'm no longer in the same position with 
Enron. I moved into commodity trading a few months ago, so TECHNICALLY I'm 
not the point of reference for Blazer matters - Mollie Gustafson is. I've 
retained the title only because I happen to be the most outspoken fan on the 
floor; so I love receiving all the latest news. But if you ever have a more 
urgent matter, or, for example, when it comes time to renew our season 
tickets, you'll want to call Mollie. She's the woman with the checkbook, so 
to speak. 

In the meantime, feel free to contact me with news about deals, discounts, 
free tickets, a date with the team, etc. (ha,ha)

This deal is the same as all the others Carla Hoffman entered yesterday - in 
the interest of time, she entered all deals with a Saturday-Sunday mask in 
Deal Blotter. If the deals were on peak, she said it shouldn't matter that 
they were marked to flow both days, because Sunday is all off-peak hours. I 
explained this in a couple e-mails yesterday - I guess I got confused about 
who I told. Carla said she's done this before and it shouldn't be a problem. 
Please let me know if you agree with this. In my opinion, just taking the 
time to explain the discrepancy in the 10 or 12 deals that were entered this 
way actually took more time than it saved. What do you think?

Issue 1 - Mike Swerzbin
Missing deal = 524266 (Enron buys EES - 25 mw - off peak - Mid C - Q3'01 - 
price is $285.95)
 Mike Driscoll just spoke with Amerex broker, who confirmed he wanted the 
five-cent fee on a different deal (524247), not this one. Our price is right.

Issue 2 - Mike Swerzbin
Mike agreed to 50 mw, but if we change this deal we have to change the other 
side - therefore, 524267 and 524266 will both be changed to 50 mw.

Issue 3 - Diana Scholtes
This is the first I think I've heard about 523984 - I'm sorry if I overlooked 
it. Diana says it's $345 - it's been changed.

Let me know if this resolves everything.

Let's start over: 


ISSUE 1-Mike Swerzbin
deal 524248 and deal 524266
This two deals checkout with Amerex fine.  Amerex has one deal at 50 mw and 
we have two identical deals at 25 mw.

deal 524247
This deal checks out with Amerex fine.

The deal that I am missing is Enron buys from EES 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for 
Q3'01 at $285.95.


ISSUE 2- Mike Swerzbin
deal 524267
 Amerex has 50 mw and we have 25 mw.

ISSUE 3- Dianna Scholtes
deal 523984
Amerex has price as $345 and we have price as $335.


This has been a terrible ordeal and I will be so glad when everthing is 
resolved!!!

Matt just talked to his broker and verified the price at $260. If the back 
office doesn't recognize this in the next couple minutes, tell them to TALK 
to Rodney Drake, the Prebon broker who seemed to be quite sure that our price 
was right. I'm sorry this is causing chaos on your end - but sometimes I 
wonder if the brokers are communicating with people in their own office....?

These deals have been changed - just thought I'd let you guys know, for 
future reference, that deals scheduled to flow during on peak hours only 
should not be booked through Sunday. Even though the system won't recognize 
any Sunday hours, apparently it messes with Houston's reports.

Kate,

I understand that the deals are not actually flowing on Sunday but for 
auditing/reporting purposes per Melissa Murphy, these deals need to display 
the correct term of 2/17 only instead of 2/17-2/18.

The deals are:  523881, 523882, 523877, 523875, 523876, 523879, 523880, 
523883, and 523884

1. Because 2/18 is a Sunday and this is an off-peak deal, no hours will be 
counted for 2/18. If you need me to change the term anyway, I can. Let me 
know.
2. The rest of these deals traded on Bloomberg after Jeff Richter and Chris 
Mallory left for a power marketing conference. This caused many problems, as 
you can see. Following are the added or corrected deals: 

  1) 523831 - changed from Dynegy to Reliant - corrected
  2) 524481 - buy Duke/March-01/NP/265.00] - added
  3) 524482 - same terms - added

Let me know if you have any further discrepancies with these deals.

We show peak both in Enpower and in Mike's trade log. I'll check with Mike in 
the morning - but in his log he has off-peak circled - that could either mean 
he was questioning it or he was absolutely sure about it - we'll find out 
though!

Thanks,

Kate this trade is from yesterday.

Prebon sent over a confirm for off-peak hours and then sent a revision to 
peak hours.  Which one is it?

Jeff Richter - all deals are on peak - do not recognize Sunday off-peak hours

Chris Mallory - 523831 changed to Bloomberg deal

Matt Motley - 524308 in trade log as buy Aquila/May-01/25 mw/Prebon at 
$260.00 - Matt is tied up in conference right now, but judging from the other 
May deals in his blotter and from his curves, this price is correct. $160 is 
about $100 less than anything else trading at that time. Ask Prebon where 
they got that from...

Thanks,
Kate

sleeve is 25 MW

deal 524310
Per Amerex the term should be March not April - term should be April

I am missing the following deal:
Enron buys from EES 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for Q3'01 at $285.95. - 524248 - 
part of a spread sleeve done with EES and El Paso - only one broker fee 
agreed upon - fee included on deal 524247 NOT 524248

Jeff Richter
deal 523881
Per Amerex the term should be 2/17 only not 2/17-2/18 - on peak deal - does 
not calculate any volume for 2/18 because it is a Sunday (all off peak hours)

deal 523882
Per Amerex the term should be 2/17 only not 2/17-2/18 - same as above

The above trades were entered in Jeff's deal blotter with a Saturday/Sunday 
mask; I guess Carla has done this before and said it shouldn't make a 
difference because Sunday is an off-peak day and these are on-peak deals. If 
it does make a difference in reference to your group, please let me know and 
I'll be happy to pass the message on to the traders and anyone else who 
enters deals. I can also change those deals if necessary.

1. Because 2/18 is a Sunday and this is an off-peak deal, no hours will be 
counted for 2/18. If you need me to change the term anyway, I can. Let me 
know.
2. The rest of these deals traded on Bloomberg after Jeff Richter and Chris 
Mallory left for a power marketing conference. This caused many problems, as 
you can see. Following are the added or corrected deals: 

  1) 523831 - changed from Dynegy to Reliant - corrected
  2) 524481 - buy Duke/March-01/NP/265.00] - added
  3) 524482 - same terms - added

Let me know if you have any further discrepancies with these deals.

Looks like a real time guy put this deal in - along with three others - for 
El Paso. Real Time isn't used to marking confirms on their deals, since 
they're usually just trading hour-ahead. Let me know how you'd like these to 
be changed (i.e. ""yes-agreement"" or ""yes-counterparty to send confirm""), and 
I'll do that right away.

Okay - I won't be able to get out of here before 5 p.m., so 6 p.m. might be 
better. Also, I am car-free these days, and I completely forgot you wanted to 
meet east of the river. Would it be too much trouble to meet in NE - that's 
where I live, and there aren't any buses directly from SE to NE, 
unfortunately. Let me know if this works for you. Sorry for the hassle!

You're right - 458802 is a deal with Constellation, but it's part of a sleeve 
Mike Swerzbin did for EES. Thanks for the spreadsheet, and for getting me on 
the mailing list.

I spoke with Kim Hundle and deal # 458802 is not with EES I wasn't sure if I 
had wrote the number down wrong or not.  Sorry.    I also spoke with Neil 
Bresnan after we had spoke and he had said it should be no problem getting 
you on the list.  I will check again and I apologize for the delay.
Thanks

517518 and 517520 have been changed to FPL Energy Power Marketing; and Tom's 
sticking by his price on 517518. Would you mind sending me Jeff Wallace's 
phone number if you have it? These guys are still busy trading, so I'd like 
to take care of it myself if I can.

Thanks,

Kate, same thing on this trade. I think it should be FPL Energy Power 
Marketing b/c I received a confirm on it. Secondly on the confirm it states 
that hour 0100-0600 is priced at $95.00 and then again at hours 2300-2400. 
7-22 is priced at $140. However I do not show in the system 1-6 and 23-24 at 
$95. Did he forget to put in the off peak or is FPL incorrect.

I spoke with Mark Fischer about this - Tom Alonso stepped out of the office 
for a minute - and he said Tom would probably want to talk to his contact 
with FPL. So I'm going to wait before changing these counterparty names. I'll 
also check with him on the off peak hours for 517518, and get back to you in 
just a minute.

The Dow Jones report is compiled of data sent from many different 
counterparties. The lovely people at Dow Jones painstakingly analyze the data 
to ensure its accuracy. Averaged together, these prices become the Dow Jones 
daily index price. And that's the long and short of it. 

The process, as you've guessed by now, is a little more complicated than 
that. For one thing, Dow Jones looks at each counterparty's sales to reach an 
average of all the prices. It would be redundant for each counterparty to 
ALSO report their purchases from each other. Therefore, when calculating the 
Dow Jones data, we only include purchases from counterparties who ARE NOT 
participants in the Dow Jones survey. Following is a simple example:

Participant List  NP-15 Purchases  NP-15 Sales  Reported NP-15 Purchases 
Reported NP-15 Sales
Sempra  Sempra - $250   Sempra - $250  Avista - $270   Sempra - $250
Duke   Duke - $260   Duke - $260      Duke - $260
Enron   Avista - $270   Avista - $270      Avista - $270

Now that's simple!

Following is the participant list for Dow Jones' survey of trading at NP-15 
and SP-15 delivery points. Deals with these counterparty names need to be 
excluded from the calculation of PURCHASES at NP-15 and SP-15 delivery points.

American Electric Power - Amerelecpo
Avista Energy - Avistaene
Duke Energy Trading and Marketing - Dukeenetra
El Paso Merchant Energy
Enron Power Marketing, Inc. - EPMI
Idaho Power Company - Idacorpene
PacifiCorp - PACE
Pacific Gas & Electric Company - PG&E
Powerex Corp. - PWX
Puget Sound Energy, Inc. - PSPL
Mirant Americas Energy Marketing (formerly Southern Company Energy Marketing) 
- SCEM
TransAlta Energy Marketing (US) Inc. - Transalt

So I've probably succeeded in confusing you even more, but please feel free 
to come bug me with questions. Good luck!

Hello, we have a fully executed termination letter for deal # 508797.01.  
Holli Krebs is aware that this BPA deal was going to be terminated.  Are you 
all going to kill this deal?

Thanks,

Mike Driscoll just checked with the broker - it should be SP-15 - he's having 
the back office change it.

Thanks,

Per your request for year-to-date numbers: here's an example of what I could 
include in the daily EOL summary. Let me know if this is helpful for you, and 
if you'd like it included on the graph sheet. I think it might be too tight 
to fit on the page as it is, but there's no reason why we can't generate a 
two-page report. As long as we're going in that direction, is ther any other 
data you'd like to see in graph form?

Great - that all sounds about like what I'd expected. Thanks for the

Subject: Re: Desk-to-Desk v. Cross-Portfolio  

I just sent Kroum a little missive on our familiarity with the ""killed"" 
feature, as well as why we often zero out deals (Transmission in particular) 
in scheduling only. If I have to teach a course on scheduling for him to 
understand how to build this report I will do it, but I am not really dying 
to do that.

As far as our situation here, If you can properly kill a deal, you should do 
that instead of just zeroing the volume. I quite often have great success 
having many terminal server sessions open at once, and doing the slow stuff 
through a few different channels of TS.  Even as we speak, I am running one 
report for 6 different months, 1 in each of the 5 terminal severs, and one 
locally.  I learned that trick in our old winframe system, and it has served 
me well.

I have torn my hair out over this cross-portfolio vs cross-desk thing.  I 
have explained it to both Kroum, Duong Luu, and Will each at least 3 times.  
How hard is it to get the concept that anything we sell to ourselves is not a 
physical deal?

I would say just keep sending them to me, so we don't all have to pull our 
collective hairs out. The deal you reference below is kind of like a life 
preserver thing. When the market makes a sudden move, it is sometimes faster 
to 'hit' the deal through EOL then pull it on the traders side.  It's not the 
best way to go, but better than losing a bunch of money.

Subject: Desk-to-Desk v. Cross-Portfolio

I'm not quite sure how this exchange began, but it sounds like Kroum is 
referring to several different issues here. First of all, our forward 
obligation report does not reflect cross-portfolio deals, an application 
issue that Will Smith, and it looks like Kroum as well, has been working on 
for the past few weeks. 

Also, deal 498488 is a forward deal done on EOL between STSW and their own 
desk. I haven't seen a trade WITHIN a desk before, but I'm sure anything is 
possible. At any rate, this doesn't look like a cross-portfolio deal at all. 
Am I missing something?

As for the zeroed out deals, I'm pretty sure everyone here knows how to 
properly kill deals in Enpower; however, it takes so long that sometimes we 
simply zero out the volume in the interest of time. I've often wondered if 
this litters the system and makes it more confusing for other people to do 
their jobs - do you know anything about that?

I just thought I'd ask these questions while the subject was being raised. 
Please let me know if I can help facilitate these changes or improvements in 
any way.

Thanks,
Kate

             Cara,

      I think the report should work that way even now.

     I think I found a deal like that 498488 between EPMI Southwest and EPMI 
Southeast,
     Region R7, please take a look at that when you test the report.

       
       I saw lots of deals on the report with volume 0 and price 0, they were 
entered that way
       in Portland. There might be another reason, but I think someone wanted 
to kill the deals.
       There is an option in Deal Entry to do that, if one opens a deal and 
right click with the
       mouse on the status (Done), one can kill a deal.

The ""two sides of a cross-portfolio deal"" language is a bit vague and 
misleading. A cross-portfolio deal is kind of like a desk to desk deal. 
Another Enron book has traded with one of ours.

Two important things need to happen with cross-portfolio deals.
 1. They need to only show on the forward obligation report when ""Desk to 
Desk"" is selected.
 2. They are only financial in nature, no physical delivery is ever done 
cross portfolio.

I don't think ""both sides"" is correct. We need to only see our buy or our 
sale when we query for our point.  When the other portfolio queries their 
stuff, they should see their side.

Trades with TransAlta go through their energy marketing subsidiary, called 
TransAlta Energy Marketing (US) Inc. These deals were in under the parent 
company, TransAlta Energy Marketing Corp. I know this is petty, but it makes 
people like Rhonda cranky. For some reason she feels it is an offense 
punishable by reaming. I don't. This is just a  reminder.

All of these have been changed, and the real time desk has been alerted. I

We don't have fees on the BUY side of an EES sleeve - this particular deal is 
the sale side. Unfortunately, Matt had scribbled something next to this deal 
that looked like ""no bro"" which usually indicates no fee, but it was actually 
"".015 bro."" Anyway, that's probably more information than you 
needed.....sorry!

These ARE a kind of desk-to-desk deal, but officially they are 
cross-portfolio deals, because they cross from the ENAEXEC to WEST portfolio. 
I'm not familiar with Unity, but let me check around here and see if anyone 
knows where these deals should be settled. Also let me know if the fact that 
they are cross-portfolio deals helps you at all. That's all I know right now.

Do the deals booked here need to go to Unify to be settled?  Are they desk to 
desk?  Sorry to bug you but I'm assigning contract numbers.

I just got out of a meeting and read your e-mails. I have no idea why she 
would have used this counterparty name, but looks like it's all taken care

I'm sorry about that! It looks like the NW traders were adding to their sheet 
while I was transferring data from it, so I didn't have the most updated 
version this morning. This should look better!

Mike still has not returned my calls, and is not at work today. I checked 
with Mike Driscoll, Swerzbin's assistant, and he confirmed that 517876 should 
be $300. It's an EES spread, and the other side (deal #517877)  is $313 - is

the delivery point should be SP-15. It's been changed.

I've left a message for Mike Swerzbin, the trader on these deals. They're 
both in Enpower the way they're in his trade log, so I don't want to change 
anything until I talk to him. I'm also going to call Judy Dyer at EES for 
confirmation on the 517876 price. I'll let you know.

508957 - changed offset from -1.5 to -1 on 2/6 per Stephanie Piwetz (verbal

All the rest of the deals I entered for Mike Swerzbin yesterday in my deal 
blotter, which defaults to Short Term California. I noticed immediately after 
saving the deals that they were under the wrong desk, and changed them to 
Long Term Northwest in deal entry. Are there other problems with the deals? 
The only change should be the desk. Please let me know.

It looks like you made quite a few changes to some deals and I don't see 
anything in the comment section.  Can you just take a quick look and see if 
you know what you changed on any of these.  If not, I can look it up in the 
audit viewer, but it makes things go a lot quicker if we don't have to go 
into the audit viewer for each deal.

Thanks!

517384 - price has been changed to $260
517891 - mike's book shows Palo delivery - desk was wrong - has been changed 
to LTNW
517884 - price has been changed to $300
517876/877 - missing Amerex deals were under wrong desk (STCA) - have been 
changed to LTNW

Also, I entered many of Mike's deals today, but in my rush forgot to re-set 
my Deal Blotter defaults - so the deals went in under Short Term California 
instead of Long Term Northwest. I've changed them all to the correct desk, 
which should clear up the missing deals, and hopefully will make more sense 
for your checkouts. Sorry about the confusion - entering deals for three 
different desks at once gets a little hectic!

Let me know if you have questions.

These deals have a contact name - Don Imamura - in them now. I asked Tracy 
Ngo, our credit person, about NCPA's credit status, and she said that since 
they've been done, it's now a matter of risk management or damage control - 
if it should even come to that. At any rate, the deals are good and now have 
contact info.

Finally! After a slight uphill battle, we've successfully entered the first 
three futures deals under the Mid-Columbia NYMEX settlement price. Because 
all of you were involved in this process in one way or another, I thought I'd 
let you know that it was successful in the end, and forward the deal numbers 
along for reference. They are as follows:

TAGG Futures Deals - QQ0362 (J-01)
               QQ3837 (K-01)
                  QQ7050 (M-01)

Don't worry about it! I got home and had to shower the day off of me, and by 
the time I got out Dave was (randomly) walking through the front door. Then 
he and my new roommate Chase and I all had tuna fish sandwiches and 
milkshakes for dinner. It was sooooooo good. And I am soooooo easily pleased. 
It's gorgeously sunny and warm here today, so I might have to go for a bike 
ride after work. Then I've got to ream Amber for being the most pathetic, 
loser roommate on the face of the earth (more on that later.) So we 
DEFINITELY need to talk. I'll call you tonight.

I spoke with Sean Crandall, who told me that from his standpoint the deals 
ARE separate; however, John Malowney is the mid-marketer who works with 
Conoco, and he told me that this special language is fine to include in the 
confirmations for these deals. Turns out I was just asking the wrong person. 

Let me know if you need comments added in these deals.

Kate, please ask Sean Crandell if the following deals need the ""special 
phrase"" ..The Parties agree and acknowledge that this Transaction is 
connected with the transaction referenced in Deal No. 347356.1 entered into 
between the Parties on May 31, 2001.

Jack Wells of Conoco called and said that the phrase should be included in 
confirmations: 506549.01..506550.01..506551.01 and 507417.01 and 507430.01.  
Please ask trader if deals are related to the 347356.01.  Sharen has inquired 
once before and we were under the impression that the deals were separate and 
not included.  Please let us know.

Jack Wells is the contact for both - I've added his name to deal #507417. 
According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal 
was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just 
buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only 
connection. Let me know if you need more of an explanation from the traders, 
but our take is that these deals are separate.

Are these two deals part of the original Conoco deal # 347356 that they are 
extending or something different?  We need to know because we have to add 
something in the confirmation if they are extensions of the original deal.  
Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?

I just spoke with Jesse Bryson in Real Time, and he said this should actually 
be 2 buy-resales - one from Four Corners to ZP-26, and one from ZP-26 to 
NP-15. Let me know how that sounds to you, and I'll enter the deals.

For deal 515363 traded yesterday, Matt has the cp as Sierra Pacific however, 
Prebon has Nevada Power Company.
Can you check with Matt for the correct cp name.

This deal was entered as New Counterparty which is fine for a short period of 
time.  However, within a few days someone needs to make sure to change the 
deal to the correct counterparty name.  Can you look into this and let me

Just for everyone's information - I've entered two buys from Seattle City 
Light to negate an earlier sale of power to the company (Deal 317868). The 
deals are as follows:

515404
STCA buys SCL
2/8/01-2/28/01
SP-15
Off Peak
$115.00

515420
LTCA buys SCL
3/1/01-3/31/01
SP-15
Off Peak
$115.00

I'm giving you this disclaimer either because you asked me to enter the deal, 
the deal is in your book, or the deal will affect your calc. The volume is 
shaped between 1 and 2 MW. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate"

hey - how's your sexy body? don't have much time right now, but thought i'd 
drop a line to tell you that i'm so broke i'm considering picking up some 
unmentionable weekend job and therefore cannot make it down there for 
prezzy's day weekend. i'm so pissed! but it will happen soon - and anytime 
you're up here you need to stay with me - we have a guest bedroom for gosh 
sakes. also, i met malia at a party the other weekend - talk about a freakin' 
small world! she was so sweet, but then i'm not surprised - she'd have to be 
to put up with you. (ha, ha) anyway, take care, call me soon, and toast my 
absence with a bottle of wine tonight.

I just spoke with Holli, and she reported that the confirmation has been 
awaiting a signature at Grant County for the past week. She said she plans to 
send it to Kim Theriot as soon as she gets it back. Let me know if that 
sounds good; otherwise, I can ask her about sending you an unsigned copy.

Thanks,

I saw that there was a note on this deal that Legal prepared the confirmation 
and Holli Krebs sent it to the counterparty herself.  Can you obtain a copy 
of what they sent for our files.  There is nothing in Livelink and if we 
would ever need to reproduce the document we would have nothing.  Also, it 
shows that it has not been singned unless Portland has a signed copy.

Willie -
Per our conversation - the West Power desk needs three new settlement indices 
for entering swaps deals in EnPower. The indices are as follows:

Last day settle for MIDC NYMEX contract
Last 5-day average for PALO VERDE NYMEX contract
Last 5-day average for COB NYMEX contract

Please let me know if you have any questions. The first index is a little 
more pressing than the other two - one of our traders did a futures deal a 
week ago which we have yet to swap from his book to the one it belongs in. We 
can't execute the swap until we have a MIDC settlement index. 

Thank you so much for your help.

It contains most of the same deals that are found in your spreadsheet, and a 
few that aren't. Also, Bob Badeer has become the leader-by-default of this

I'm sending a copy of the error message I received when I tried to enter our 
futures deals today. The application saved one deal, but 
would not accept the other two. The only difference between the three deals 
is the delivery month. Is there any way we can get this fixed soon?

Les -
Here's the latest list of unit contingent deals in need of unit names. I've 
tried referring to your unit name list and entering them myself, but it looks 
like some delivery points correspond to more than one unit. I.E. Navajo can 
originate from LV Cogen OR Saguaro Power. If you could add these unit names 
into the deals, or let me know what they are so I can enter them, it would be 
much appreciated.

These two deals do not have contacts but are coded to be confirmed.  Can you 
check and see if she does want them to be confirmed and if so, please add 
contacts.

We are still planning on confirming the daily deals in the west, but we have 
run into system problems so we have pushed the start date back a little.  
I'll let you know when we have a definite date.

Thanks!

A suggestion:

One of the most interesting books I've read recently is called ""The River 
Why,"" by David James Duncan. I believe he's from the Pacific Northwest. It's 
about fishing and religion. Check it out.....if your gigantic FINANCE brain 
can fit it in.

The Prebon broker was pulling his tapes this morning when I asked Chris about 
it - he said he'd let me know as soon as they worked it out. I just checked 
with Chris again, and apparently the broker pulled tapes from the wrong day. 
But we should know soon. I'll e-mail you right away.

Hey there - I'm so sorry I haven't responded until now. I've been swamped 
with work, moving, and now the flu. Whoo, hoo! So, as far as gossip is 
concerned, I'm all dried up for now. I was going to go on a company ski trip 
this weekend, but I feel so crappy I can't even imagine being outside, let 
alone surrounded by snow and wind at the same time. I imagine you're totally 
used to that by now, but keep in mind your weather is accompanied by sun and 
not eternal grayness. 

Our house is coming along nicely. Molly and I already want to boot Amber out, 
but that's okay. We deal with it by laughing about her antics whenever 
possible - behind her back or in front of her face. It really helps us out, 
and I think it does wonders for her ego too. Work is work. The weather is 
foul! Men are too. I don't even have one prospect at this point. Of course 
there's always the innocent, fleeting crushes from a distance; but I've got 
to admit I hardly even have the energy for those anymore. 

I hope you can make it home for a visit soon, because you are going to LOVE 
our house. I will definitely keep my eyes peeled for cheap tickets to Denver, 
or maybe I'll just do the train and take a long weekend. Either way, I'll 
definitely make it there by springtime. Tell me about your jobs, friends (or 
not?), and life in general. I'm going to get back to work and hustle so I can 
get out of here early and suffer peacefully at home. I'll give you a call 
from my sick bed, 'kay?

Take care,
Kate"

""California Department of Water Resources - CDWR"" to ""California Energy 
Resource Schedulers - State of California."" The following deal numbers are 
those that have been changed. If you come across other daily deals, most

I've added two new swaps to reflect the change from the California PX to the 
Dow Jones index after 1/31/01. The following deal numbers cover the whole 
term of the deal.

404980 - 9/1/00 through 1/31/01 @ PX NP15 Index
512726 - 2/1/01 through 8/31/03 @ DJ NP15 Peak Index
512743 - 2/1/01 through 8/31/01 @ DJ NP15 Off-Peak Index

Both new deals have comments that link them back to the original deal. Let me 
know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate

I checked with Diana Scholtes, the trader on this deal, and she said the 
counterparty was supposed to be CERS - California Energy Resource Schedulers. 
I've changed the name, but let me know if your records still show California 
Dept. of Water Resources.

Thanks,
Kate

I've changed it to be confirmed. Chris Mallory usually does mostly daily 
deals, so his deal blotter probably defaults to no confirm.

I just heard that you've been trying to reach me today with no success. I'm 
actually sitting at a new desk and periodically checking my old voicemail

Here's the long and short of the contact name list. It sounds like now that 
the confirmation group is taking the time to look at all daily deals, they 
might pay attention to daily traders' needs as well. Let's hope.

If you could possibly write down contact names that still aren't in the 
system, I'll send it on to the IT group in Houston and we should be able to 
get them in the system shortly.

Thanks,
Kate

This probably happened because he is a daily or hourly trader and in the past 
we have not seen these deals to see the notes to add the contacts.  With the 
change in the criteria for confirmation, we will now view these deals and add 
the contacts as they come across.  If anyone has a list of contacts they want 
added, please send the names and the company name and we will put them into 
the system.

I forwarded this e-mail on to all our traders to give them a heads up about 
the new process. I did receive feedback from one trader, Mark Fischer, who 
said that when he began with Enron he was always told that if a contact name 
was not in the system that he was supposed to enter it into the comments 
section. He did this diligently under the pretense that eventually these 
names would be added to the system, but they apparently never were. He wanted 
to let me know of this, especially because when the traders are hurriedly 
entering deals, they probably won't always take the time to type in the 
contact name in the comments section.

Let's see if we can update this list somehow. Let me know who I can contact 
for this or how we can set this up.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: contacts

Currently, we do not confirm west deals that flow 6 days or less so we have 
not had to be real difficult about contact names in deal entry.  However, 
starting February 1, we are going to confirm all next day deals in the west 
using the same criteria we do in the east - that is - deals 3 days or less 
are sent on a confirmation that does not require a signature and everthing 
else on a letter requiring a signature.  Hourly deals will not be confirmed.  
So it is very important that the traders fill in a contact name when they are 
entering deals.  The confirmation letter cannot be prepared without a contact 
name.  It stops the whole process.  We are not going to be able to put names 
in every time they do not.  

If they do not see the contact they want in the drop down list,  put the 
correctly spelled first and last name in the comment section in deal entry 
and we will add this contact to the list and it should appear the next day.

If you can help us out with this, maybe we won't have to keep asking you for 
contacts.

Thanks!

I'm not sure if someone else got to this before I did, but I see the same end

Hi Kate,
Please have a look at the term on this deal.  There is a discrepancy between 
the end date at the top of the screen in Deal Entry and the one listed in the 
strips at the bottom.  Is the correct end date 6/30 or 6/1? 
Thanks!

No, this was incorrect. I'll tell you something - Real Time is having

I've received some feedback from the Real Time group regarding these 
counterparty discrepancies. Apparently, they were never given notice of the 
correct counterparty names, and chose what seemed to be the most logical 
name. Can we come up with a system or master list of usable counterparty 
names for these guys to refer to when faced with an array of choices? (i.e. 
There are five different names under Transalta.) 

The concern lies with our daily correction report, which I generate and which 
includes all deals that have been changed and the name of the person who made 
the ""error."" This report can weigh unfairly against a trader who may be 
unaware of the difference between ""Dynegy Marketing & Trade"" and ""Dynegy 
Power Marketing."" I feel like there has to be a more efficient way to avoid 
these errors than publishing them in a report that gets sent throughout the 
company.

If you could help me compile this master list, or direct me to someone who 
can, I would greatly appreciate it. 

Thanks,
Kate

Okay - third time's the charm. After cuts were made by the Cal-ISO last 
night, I sent you a revised volume schedule of our sales to EES for 1/31; 
however, I failed to change the total load at SP-15 to reflect cuts. Now 
you'll see the CORRECT revisions made at all delivery points. Let me know if 
you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate

These deals were entered to flatten out the traders' positions in the PX. You 
shouldn't see the index being used on any deals past tomorrow (the exchange 
closes effective Feb. 1), but Bob Badeer and Matt Motley both had positions 
they needed to back out of. They turned around and bought the same amount at 
the Dow Jones index. Hope this helps!

Thought this might be useful for you to have as well. I highlighted the deal 
numbers that concern your desk in red. I know these are really nitpicky 
errors, but it might be worth reminding these guys of the correct

No, that's fine. But because of the new global standards, we're required to 
produce and report all corrections made on west power deals each day. So I 
was looking into these deals to get trader names, terms, etc., but 3 of them 
wouldn't pull up. 507901, 506767, and 507900 don't seem to be in the system. 
Are these the correct deal numbers? Let me know when you get a chance.

Kate

I've changed these deals to FPL Energy Power Marketing. Chris wasn't aware of 
the difference.  I'm trying to come up with a summary list or some other kind 
of reminder to send out to the traders today. I.E. is FPL part of Florida 
Power & Light? What's a quick and easy way to determine which counterparty 
you're trading with? 

We've just been bombarded with reports of incorrect counterparty names in our 
deals, and more often than not the traders are unaware of or indifferent to 
the difference. For your sake (and ultimately theirs, since these errors will 
start adding up in the daily correction report), I want to develop a more 
efficient system of checks and balances. If you have any suggestions (other 
than asking the traders to wake up and pay attention!) please let me know 
when you get a chance. I'll just be brainstorming today....in between 
changing incorrect counterparty names!

Thanks,
Kate

Enpower. Currently they are in as Florida Power & Light. I received 
confirmations from FPL Energy Power Marketing. Could you please talk to

You're definitely not being difficult - it's good for us to know these 
things. I'm going to check with Mike Swerzbin on this - he's the trader on 
347356 - after the morning trading dies down a bit. Just wanted to let you

Sorry, I didn't see these deals when I sent the first email.  Kimberly Hundl 
had sent you a note about the contact.  Are these deals like the other two 
deals, and should be confirmed totally separately from the deal #347356.  
Sorry to be so difficult, but we get into trouble everytime we confirm a 
Conoco deal because of the special language that needs to be included on 
deals that are part of #347356, and we never get any notes that tell us 
whether or not it is part of the extension of the original deal.

Thanks!

Sorry for the slow reaction time - this is the contact information Greg Wolfe 
gave me, and he Sean Crandall confirmed that (he was in the midst of putting 
a Conoco deal in the system). As for why it was taken out of the GCP system, 
I have no idea. If you know of anyone around here who would have called for 
that to be de-activated, let me know. Otherwise, our traders still know Jack 
Wells as the contact. Hope that helps.

I can certainly send you this file each day - I hope it can be of some help. 
All the deals it lists are with EPMI Short Term California, which is myself 
or Jeff Richter; so I'm not sure how helpful it will be in determining which 
desk or counterparty you have discrepancies with. While we're on the subject 
of sharing files, though, I had spoken with the confirmation group in Houston 
about the deal file you send them each day. They suggested I ask to be added 
to the list so I can better assist their group in finding discrepancies in 
EPMI-EES deals. If that's okay with you, I would appreciate receiving it.

In the meantime, I'll copy you on the EES sale prices starting tomorrow.

Thanks,
Kate

Broker is right - deal has been changed.

By the way, I checked out audit viewer on deal 505066, and it showed that I 
had changed the deal from Amerex to APB yesterday afternoon. It didn't show 
any other changed after that - so I've put a call into Duong Luu to figure 
out why the change didn't save, or why it defaulted back. Just FYI.

Thanks for your concern - that's so sweet of you. I think it's a combination 
of too many hours staring at a computer and too few hours sleeping - mixed in 
with a good dose of mid-winter blues. I'm sure a day on the slopes will do me 
good.

This sequence of e-mails is a little confusing, so I highlighted the parts 
you probably want to focus on in red. Like I said, I've been staring at these 
deals for too many hours now to see clearly what went wrong. As far as I can 
tell, either APB or Jeff Richter was checking out wrong. Now I just want to 
get to the bottom of it! Aaaaaaaa!

I just want to clarify something, because we were here until about 9 p.m. 
last night trying to flatten our position, and just figured out this morning 
that we were off due to the Williams deal that I changed yesterday evening. 
Apparently Jeff Richter didn't do any deals with Williams for 50 MW through 
APB, but he did do one for 50 MW with Prebon. So I'm wondering why APB was 
checking out like this? If possible, I'd like to avoid this in the future. 
Let me know if you can find anything out from APB.

Pinnacle West is still working on moving all its operations from Arizona 
Public Service Co. to Pinnacle. In the meantime, all TRANSMISSION deals 
should still be made using the counterparty name ""Arizona Public Service 
Company."" All other deals are made with ""Pinnacle"" itself. This should change 
sometime in the next month, according to the confirmation group in Houston.

That sounds fine - in fact, I think in this case that Sean Crandall just hit 
the wrong counterparty name. Since this looks like it might be a problem for 
you guys in creating confirms, I'll let the traders know to be sure of which 
NCPA shortname they're choosing.

If it doesn't make any difference, I will change these to the other CP name.  
This one is not attached to templates and would need some database changes to

I checked with Heather, and it turns out this second NCPA counterparty 
shortname was set up to distinguish between two different SC numbers. But 
it's only for internal use - both counterparty names have the same billing 
information, etc. So Heather said the deals are fine as they are. I'm going 
to find out more about this after the afternoon rush dies down - just so 
we'll know for the future when to use which shortname.

These two deals are entered with a special counterparty name that looks like 
it may have been set up for some special deal.  There is another counterparty 
name out there that looks just the same only without the very last series of 
letters.  I will check here and see if anyone knows the difference.  There is 
a note in the Global System that says Heather Dunton had this CP set up.  If 
you could check with her and see if it should be used for these deals or if 
the other CP should be used.

Thanks!

I checked in Jeff's trade log - he just stepped into a meeting - and 504970 
had been crossed out to show 50 MW. But 505118 only has 25 MW. Does this 
sound correct? I'm a little confused about what you're asking - should the 
deals match at 50 MW on peak? Or is one 25 and one 50?

505118 & missing deal are Jeff Richter's - he's on a conference call and will

I checked with Heather, and it turns out this second NCPA counterparty 
shortname was set up to distinguish between two different SC numbers. But 
it's only for internal use - both counterparty names have the same billing 
information, etc. So Heather said the deals are fine as they are. I'm going 
to find out more about this after the afternoon rush dies down - just so 
we'll know for the future when to use which shortname.

These two deals are entered with a special counterparty name that looks like 
it may have been set up for some special deal.  There is another counterparty 
name out there that looks just the same only without the very last series of 
letters.  I will check here and see if anyone knows the difference.  There is 
a note in the Global System that says Heather Dunton had this CP set up.  If 
you could check with her and see if it should be used for these deals or if 
the other CP should be used.

Thanks!

Hey, I'm right there with ya, sister. As far as feeling out of place in a new 
city, it's totally normal. That's how I felt about Maui the entire time I was 
there. I kept thinking I was just picky, weird, anti-social or otherwise 
mentally unstable because I just didn't feel right there. I kept ""sticking it 
out another month"" because I thought, eventually, the majestic wonders and 
buff tanned men would win me over and I would spend the rest of my days 
frolicking along the white sand, swinging from jungle branches and blissfully 
speaking pidgin. But it just never clicked. I don't really know why; all I 
can surmise is that the lure of familiarity and home is much stronger than we 
know, or would like to know.

It's definitely good to get out of your comfort zone and experience something 
new every once in awhile (Lord knows that's my modus operandus), but I think 
you'll know if Denver is really ""your kind of town."" In the meantime, just 
take it for what it is - a fun place to be a young, swingin' single. It'll 
take more than a month to adjust and meet people; and even then you might not 
meet the kind of people you're ultimately looking for. Sorry to sound so 
pessimistic - I'm really not - maybe I'll just employ my favorite analogy to 
explain: when you walk into Mimi & Lena, or Fred Segal, or even Nordstrom, 
and you start perusing the racks, how long does it take you to decide whether 
or not you like a shirt or a pair of boots or something? A minute. Seconds, 
maybe. But you don't have to camp out in the store for several hours or days, 
just hanging out with your skirt of choice, to decide if you want to take it 
home with you. Granted, this is a mere item of clothing as compared with a 
habitat, but you get the picture.

Which leads me to my next point - men. Same goes for them. If there are 
characteristics about this guy you find make your skin crawl, it doesn't 
matter if he's Tom Cruise with the mind of Einstein and the social graces 
of....well...some guy with social graces, IT WILL NOT WORK! Run - don't walk 
- away from a situation like this. I have just one word to describe to you 
what can happen with guys like this - BRIAN. He was sooo sweet, soooo smart, 
soooo in love with me, and even tolerable to look at. But soon the walls came 
crumbling down and the level of his cheesiness, which was mild to begin with, 
escalated as he felt me pulling away. It all ended in that debacle we know as 
""Brian's Trip to Portland."" It was hauntingly uncomfortable, and all I can 
tell you is, nobody could have warned me. I was blinded by something akin to 
love, but much more akin to an ego-trip, which was what I was on everyday 
with him because he pretty much thought I was God's gift and made sure I knew 
it.....constantly. 

Listen, I have to go, and I've said my piece for the day. I'll try and give 
you a call tonight and we can theorize further on the subject. When you 
really get down to it, you're doing great - exactly what anyone and everyone 
at your age, and mine, is doing - which is basically wondering what the hell 
to do with the rest of our lives. And meanwhile ""the rest of our lives"" are 
slipping past unnoticed. Just remember the John Lennonn quote, ""Life is what 
happens when you're busy making other plans."" Now THERE's a real man. Whoa.

Love,
Kate"

Here's what I threw together this afternoon. Let me know if there are any 
other people in particular you'd like added to the list. Also let me know if 
you try any of these extensions and they happen to be wrong (we have a hard 
time keeping up with changing numbers too!). Forward this on to anyone you 
feel it might be useful to; but please let them know to call me first and 
foremost, since I'll probably be the most receptive on the phone. 

Hope you had a safe trip back home. Again, it was great to meet you and Kim.

Talk to you soon,

I'm working on a phone list for some of the people I work with in the Houston

information on the floor card has changed since the last printing. Debra said 
I should forward the information on to you for use in the next floor card. 
Here it is:

Ext. 7486
Cell phone 819-2181

And actually, my home phone will change too at the end of this week. I'll 
send that along when I get it. I know this isn't pressing information, but I

Oh wow - don't tell me you're a NUGGETS fan now! That is so wrong. I can't 
write for long just now because the ever-flourishing energy crisis is keeping 
us all very busy here at The Big Ron, as I so affectionately call it. Right 
now I'm on the cusp of either becoming a raging workaholic or cashing in my 
chips to become a professional beach bum. I know I already tried that and 
thought it wasn't for me, but trust me, one more month of this crap Portland 
weather and I'll ship myself right over to the Caribbean. And yes, I'm 
definitely coming to visit. It won't be for a couple months because this 
house move is going to set me back a bit. Let's just say I'm hoping I'll be 
so poor I'll be forced to lose weight in February. But I'm really excited - 
we move in on Friday - and the house is so cute. You have to at least come 
home to visit sometime so you can see it. I might even bring Kitty over, but 
Molly vehemently opposed the idea, and you know how Kitty doesn't like to be 
unsettled once she's staked her territory. (Big Kitty lives in daily fear.) 
Anyway, call me soon - you can call collect, or call and yelp into the phone 
and hang up - I'll know it's you and call back.

I'm stoked you're liking Denver - I really have to experience this ""Rocky 
Mountain High"" for myself. Please don't turn into a stoner ski bum and lose 
all fashion sense to the point of mistaking Patagonia and Tevas for catwalk 
wear. Hey, and you need to tell me more about this ""normal"" guy. You've got 
to watch out for those, you know - that's how the truly psycho ones disguise 
themselves. No, don't listen to me - I'll be bitter and single till I'm so 
old I have to get cats and live out my life like the crazy woman that I am. 
And this obsession with candles? You know you could head that off by setting 
up hundreds and hundreds of smoke alarms all over the house, or tell her that 
you just saw a special on 20/20 about houses burning down via over-decoration 
with candles. 

Hey - do you have a freaking job there? That's the only thing I haven't heard 
about. You must like it or you wouldn't have applied to stay, but I need 
DETAILS, I need DIRT. Call me soon, we'll dish.

Love,
Kate

Hey dork!

Just wondering how it's going over there in P-town.  I am doing well.  I
applied for a job here at Outward Bound, so I may be staying here for
awhile.  I met a super-cute guy who I will have to tell you all about - I
think this may actually become a normal relationship or something of the
like.  Michelle and I are doing well, although her decorating style bothers
me a little.  First of all, she's obsessed with candles.  Our living room
looks like the parlor at a whorehouse.  Are you still coming to visit?  I
hope so!

Also, can you send me Monica's phone number if you think of it?  I feel
settled in enough now to call her.  Tell me what's up with you!  Any big guy
stories?  Moved yet?  Let's chat.  Love, Anna

Chris looked these over and we agreed to just re-send the original 
confirmation letter, because the ISO may make cuts again - in fact, the 
revised confirm is no longer correct. I put a comment in the deal instructing 
no revised confirms to be sent, per Chris Foster.

Also, Chris noticed that the counterparty contact name in the letters was 
incorrect. The new contact at ARCO is Alicia Izarraraz. Her number is (562) 
499-3234. I hope this helps.

Thanks,
Kate

This is the original confirmation letter we sent out.



Unfortunately, before I found out anything about all this, I sent out a 
revised confirmation when the deal was changed and went into a pending 
status.  This is the revised confirmation letter that went out.



These are the only two that have been sent to the counterparty.  I have put a 
note into the TAGG system that should let us know not to send another revised 
confirmation.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks for the phone list.  Kimberly Hundl is soooo jealous!

Could you fax over the original confirm so Chris can look it over and make 
sure we won't need additional language or confirms sent? I just want to make 
sure he's aware of everything that's going on and backs up my comment in the 
deal.

Sorry for the delay - it's taken me a while to track down the answer to this, 
because Chris Foster, the trader on this deal, is still unclear as to the 
answer. Basically, the deal keeps getting cut by the Cal-ISO, which is why 
Carla goes in and changes the volumes sometimes. But Chris thinks that in the 
end we might not be cutting the deal financially, just physically on a 
day-by-day basis. Given that, we only need the first, original confirm sent 
out - if revised confirms have been sent, let's go ahead and send them the 
original one and leave it at that. 

Chris Foster said he would get back with me this afternoon - he's meeting 
with Real Time and Schedulers right now to sort out this issue.  I apologize 
that this wasn't more clear before. Should I add a note in the comments 
section of this deal to clarify? Or should I just check the deal back to ""no 
confirm""? Let me know.

Joaner Boner -
Well, in my usual slacker fashion, I haven't bought my plane ticket yet - so 
I totally think you should go to Sunriver. I might come visit you there if 
there's room. But an S.F. visit is imminent, I swear. I'll call you soon to 
discuss the alcoholism of your co-worker/boyfriend, as well as the techniques 
for acquiring this sexy body for the new year. Work is consuming my life and 
eating me whole - very chaotic what with hiding all the power from you guys 
and whatnot. Imagine the pressure. Another reason it might not be the best 
time for me to come is that I'm moving on Friday. Amber and Molly and I found 
a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's kickass. But it's sucked 
away all of my money and will probably take over every free moment for the 
next month just to get it set up. If you want, you should stop by for a sleep 
over on your way to Bend. We'll throw a party. And what's up with the wrist 
disease? Are you not taking your calcium or something? I'm convinced that 
these wacky desk jobs are aging us youthful beauties prematurely. At least 
that's the excuse I like to give when I come in to work looking like I just 
bathed in a life-sized ashtray. Call me soon - I'm really curious to find out 
why Brooks is doing the chicken dance EVER let alone in your room in the 
middle of the night. Wheeew!

Happy Sexy Body New Year,
Kate

Subject: Sexy Body for the New Year!!!


Hey Kate -
My subject line is a duplicate of an email I received this morning from some
beauty .com site.  Steve Cross puts me on all of these stupid mailing lists,
so I thought I'd be retarded and put that in my subject line because it's a
stupid subject!

Anyway, how are you doing these days?  I wanted to write and see if you
really got your ticket to come visit over President's Day weekend!  I
totally want you to come down!!!  I'd be so excited.  If you don't, though,
I think I'm going to look into going up to Bend for the weekend to chill in
SunRiver and snowboard a little!  Maybe you could meet me there and stay w/
me at my parents house?  Ash is going up for sure.  If you're coming down
here, that's GREAT!  I'd be SOOO excited.

I'm on complete crack today, if you can't tell.  I have carpal tunnell, too.
Last night I woke up at 2am to Brooks coming home from a drunken night out
and he started doing the chicken dance in my room and almost knocked over my
entire shelf, tv, etc.  Then he started babbling about nothing, passed
straight out and started totally snoring.  So I didn't get back to sleep
until like 4:30 and had to wake up at 6.  I was livid this morning.  I'm
such a bitch, but I need my sleep!  Dammit.

Anyway, write soon!   I miss you!

Sorry I didn't get back to you on this sooner - Mike Swerzbin talked with his 
SCEM trader that day, and they agreed to both of these deals. Just to 
clarify, there are still two EOL trades that net out these direct trades. All 
four are good. Direct trade deal numbers are:

493989
Sell SCEM
Jun-01
198.00
Mid-C

493988
Sell SCEM
Jun-01
195.00
Mid-C

Let me know if SCEM back office still has no record of these. Otherwise, 
they're good to go.

I'm really sorry about the confusion - I actually just got filled in myself. 
I entered these deals for Mike Swerzbin yesterday, but he gave me an 
incorrect delivery point (mid-columbia instead of montana system border). 
Then Cara Semperger, in Scheduling, went in to change the delivery point and 
felt that the deal should be combined into one with three legs instead of 
three separate deals. 

So, in the end, she killed 597244 and 597245, and added two legs to 597246. 
I'm not sure she talked to John Malowney about any of this, otherwise he 
probably would have told her that he already approved the confirm letter.

Please let me know if you'd like comments added to this deal, and I'll do it 
right away.

Thanks for your help on this,
Kate

Subject: Montana power

Help, I'm confused!  Yesterday I prepared a confirmation for three Montana 
Power deals, # 5467244, 597245, 597246.  I sent it to John Malowney and he 
approved it and I faxed it out. Today I noticed two of the deals have been 
killed and two legs added to the other deal.  I think it is the same deal, 
but can someone put notes into the deals saying what they did and why?

Thanks!

Following are the deal numbers for interdesk swaps between STCA and STWBom 
for Monday and Tuesday. I'm sorry again for forgetting on Friday.

587941
STCA sells 25 to STWBom
4/23/01
$231.23
PGE3

589743
STCA sells 25 to STWBom
4/24/01
$266.00
NP-15

Let me know if you have questions on these. I presume Phil talked to you 
about why he put the deal in at PGE3 for Monday and NP15 for Tuesday. 
Apparently it doesn't have any relevance until FSP is up and running, but it 
may affect you guys differently. Just let us know if it's a problem.

We will be short in Real Time Position Manager both at NP-15 and SP-15 for 
1/18/01 until Friday morning. It seems that four deals were entered by EES 
under the wrong desk, affecting our position instead of theirs. Following are 
the details of where, when, why and by how much we're out. Read this 
carefully....

SP-15 - Short 1950.64 MW
 Deal #500492 - 67.89 MW short off peak
 Deal #500493 - 87.97 MW short on peak

NP-15 - Short 2883.08 MW
 Deal #500494 - 102.61 MW short off peak
 Deal #500495 - 128.89 MW short on peak

If any one of you has better luck than I have at accessing EES deals in deal 
entry, by all means get rid of these. Or if you happen to speak with Suneet 
Sharma, our good friend who entered the deals in question, by all means tell 
him to do the same.

Kate, I have a couple of confirms I received from BPA with the following

Enpower they have Northwest Delivered. Could you please check into:

#492613.01, 492612.01, 492611.01, 488524.01, 488523.01 These all say NW in 
the system but BPA has Mid C on confirm

#491609.01 This trade has a trade date of 1/8/01. But on BPA's confirm they 
have a trade date of 1/5/01. Could you ask Mike who did the trade which is 
correct?

Re: the BPA deals - Sean Crandall said for pricing purposes it doesn't matter 
whether the delivery point is in as Mid-C or NW delivered. The only reason he 
entered NW delivered is because there was transmission involved. For your 
purposes, Sean said it's fine to change the delivery point to Mid-C (NW 
Delivered) in the confirms, but he didn't want to have it changed in EnPower 
because that would mess with the routing.

Does that make any sense? Let me know if you need it changed in EnPower, and 
I'll talk to Sean.

Thanks,
Kate

I've run across what seems to be a glitch in Deal Blotter; although it may be 
caused by the default settings in a specific trader's blotter. A few times 
over the last several weeks, our traders at the Short Term Southwest desk 
have entered off peak deals by choosing the ""off"" selection under the ""Hours"" 
heading. But the mask doesn't change to include Sundays and Holidays, and the 
traders then enter another deal to compensate for this. What we've found then 
is that the original deal did in fact include a strip for Sundays and 
Holidays, round-the-clock hours.

My question is - when you enter an off-peak deal in Deal Blotter, does it 
automatically read that as Mon. through Sat. off-peak hours AND Sundays and 
Holidays round-the-clock? Even though the mask does not change to show 
Sundays and Holidays? I'm just wondering if there is an easier way to assure 
that we've entered off-peak deals correctly other than double-checking them 
in Deal Entry.

Please call or e-mail when you get a chance. Again, this could be just a 
matter of incorrect settings in someone's blotter; but I'd like to make sure 
either way.

Thanks for your time,
Kate"

Just spoke with Sean Crandall - he killed deal #499391. This has happened

deals. I'll talk with IT about it; but thanks for catching this in the

Hi Kate,

For Ref 499391 I don't think this is a good deal because Prebon only shows

Who's ready to rhumba? Crystal Ballroom holds salsa classes on the first 
Tuesday of every month. The hour-long class begins at 7p.m., with live music 
and dancing afterward. Cost is $8 for the whole evening. The other Tuesdays 
of the month have live music and dancing, and sometimes classes too. Anyway, 
I'm sure it won't take us more than an hour to become master Latin dancers on 
par with Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera.

Do you want to try it out? Next class is Jan. 23. And there is actually a 
salsa event going on at the Crystal this Friday night with bands and dancing 
and all kinds of mayhem - it's $12 and doors open at 7 p.m. Mark your 
calendars and tell all your coordinated (and/or good-looking) friends to come 
along.

Who's ready to rhumba? Crystal Ballroom holds salsa classes on the first 
Tuesday of every month. The hour-long class begins at 7p.m., with live music 
and dancing afterward. Cost is $8 for the whole evening. The other Tuesdays 
of the month have live music and dancing, no class unfortunately. Anyway, I'm 
sure it won't take us more than an hour to become master Latin dancers on par 
with Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera.

Do you want to try it out? Next class is Feb. 6. Mark your calendars and tell 
all your coordinated (and/or good-looking) friends to come along.

I'm so sorry it's taken me this long to get back to you. It's been truly 
chaotic around here with the California situation, and the lawyers are 
obviously preoccupied, so Christian hasn't gotten back to me yet. I finally 
went back to Chris Mallory, and we determined that the language in this 
confirm is fine as long as it matches the confirm language for the original 
deal - 459996. This was the sale to Constellation at index + $1, but now that 
we're trying to clear all our positions with the California Power Exchange, 
we had to buy it back at index + $3. Does that make any sense, or am I just 
rambling? It's been a long day. Check the confirm for 459996, and make sure 
485446 matches up. Otherwise, call me.

Thanks for your patience,
Kate

Thanks! I handed off the fax to Christian, who said he was extremely busy 
today but would try to get to it this afternoon. In the meantime, I've been 
told by Chris Mallory that the most important issue is that all 
index-forwards get uniform confirmation language. As far as what that 
language is, I'm not sure. Is this different than the confirm letters you've 
received in the past? Let me know if you need me to expedite the process and 
get someone else's opinion.

Thanks,

Kate,
I received and index trade into NP15 that Chris Mallory did. For Price the 
confirmations states: 

The average day ahead, post congestion price for the Constrained Price as 
published by the California Power Exchange for the on in the period of 
delivery stated herein plus 3.00.

Is this language o.k. to accept on the confirmation.

Thanks,

499013 was changed to a price of 180. Mike is having the broker pull their

498837 has been changed to Natsource.

499013 - Mike Swerzbin disputes this checkout - has 190.00 price in trade log 
and checked out at that price with his broker at APB. Now they're having APB

You're right - bankruptcy is a likely move for PG&E. But this deal was 
entered in place of an existing position we had with PG&E in the California 
Power Exchange, and it's been approved by our legal and credit departments.

Let me know if you have further questions.

Thanks,

How goes it, girlfriend? I just got your message - sorry I haven't been in 
touch yet, and I can give you all the excuses in the book about how I've been 
swamped with work, play, life in general, but we both know I'm just flaky, so 
there's no point in explaining it.

Anyway, I'm so excited to hear you're doing well in your new Rocky Mountain 
dwelling, but you left me here with no good pissing and moaning (and getting 
""pissed"") buddies. So I checked out airfares to Denver, and found one for 
$118 roundtrip! Can you freakin' believe it? Anyway, you have to purchase and 
use the ticket by the end of March, so I was thinking a little spring break 
action was called for. Do you think you'd be settled enough by the end of 
March to accomodate a portly older sister for a few days? Let me know, and 
I'll do the deal.

Got to go - business abounds at Enron as usual. I'll try to drop you a line 
tonight when I have more time to write. Do you have a phone number? Amber was 
in Denver over the weekend, and she and Monica called me trying to get ahold 
of you, but I had no idea where to look. (Except somewhere in Denver, but 
from what I've heard it's a fairly big place.)

Write back soon, or call - I want to know how the internship is. But more 
importantly, how's the unlimited Starbucks coffee?

Love,
Kate"

TFS broker checked out wrong. We just spoke with him and he said he had

So I don't need to do anything in order to be a part of the ""cash balance 
plan""? When I pull up my account information from the ""Savings Plan"" website, 
it says my investments and balances are zero, so I assume I need to enroll in 
this myself if I want to be a part of it. The plan I'm referring to allows 
you to invest up to 15% of your before-tax income in either Enron Corp stock 
or a variety of mutual funds. In this plan, up to 6% of your contributions 
are matched by Enron, beginning one month after your hire date. I guess my 
question is - What is this plan called? And if I enroll in it myself online, 
will I be doubling up on something Enron has already done for me? If this is 
not the retirement plan, what is?

I'm sorry to ask so many trivial questions. I just want to make sure I've 
taken advantage of all the programs and not neglected opportunities because I 
thought they were automatically given to me.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate - 

401K and the cash balance retirement plan are 2 separate plans.  You are 
automatically enrolled in the cash balance plan - you would be eligible to 
participate for the year 2000.  Going forward, at the end of each year, Enron 
will set aside 5% of your salary into an account (Enron directs these 
funds).  This account has a 5 year vesting period meaning that you must stay 
with the company for 5 years to be eligible to receive these funds when you 
leave. 

Does this help?

Amy

I'd like to enroll in the Enron Savings Plan program; however, when I was 
navigating through the savings plan website, I started wondering if the 
retirement plan and the self-directed brokerage account are the same thing. I 
think you probably have some information regarding these plans. Could I 
borrow that later this afternoon, or even better, sit down with you for a 
minute to clarify which plans I am eligible to enroll in and when? Thanks in

My oh my - it's a rare occasion when I am greeted by such entertaining 
e-mails in the morning. Thanks for dropping the note, even if it was just a 
covert ploy to get me to deprive your enemies of their electricity. And by 
the way, if I could do that, you can bet we would have already had rolling 
black-outs in strategically placed Portland neighborhoods.

Yes, I did finish the book. It was very interesting, although it did lose me 
for awhile in the middle. It's a super-fast read, so I'm going to send 
another book along with it called ""Liar's Poker."" I just heard about it and 
it's supposed to be hilarious - an account of the boom and doom of Wall 
Street in the 1980s. I know, I know - Corporate America has taken its 
stranglehold on me, and pretty soon I'll be reading the stock market quotes 
for FUN! But just give it a chance; it's something a little different.

No, Anna did not give me the fair chance I deserved to get ""Heartbreaking 
Work..."" She is clearly a tramp. I will be procuring that book for myself 
later today, as I do not see any time in the near future when Anna will come 
to her senses and quit being evil.

Anyway, I've got to go control the world's electricity supply now. (This 
statement should be followed by a Dr. Evil type cackle; you know, the one 
that comes after ""One Meeeelllion Dollars...."") But study up and make us all 
proud. Tell all your roomies I said hi, and study....or pay the price later.

Kate

Kate Symes
Student No. 569430668

1. The invention of the french fry would result in an increased demand for 
potatoes - that is, the demand curve for potatoes would shift outward. This 
would result in an increase in price, and a corresponding increase in supply. 
As the supply curve comes up to meet the new, higher demand curve, we would 
actually see an increase in overall demand, supply, AND price. The statement 
is wrong in assuming that increased supply equals a lower price.

2. a. The value of one bottle of beer to me between points A and B is 8 
bottles of soda.
b. I am therefore indifferent between bundles A and B, because they both 
allow me the same frequency of use and same level of satisfaction.
c. Bundle E must include about 216 bottles of soda in order to make me 
indifferent between it and bundle D. This follows from the logic that, when I 
have 100 bottles of soda, it would take about 8 more to make me give up one 
bottle of beer in the bundle. Here I have 200 bottles of soda - I would need 
AT LEAST 8 bottles of soda to make me give up one more beer in another bundle 
with the same frequency of use.

3. Firstly, this legislation produces a disincentive for parents to travel 
with children on an airplane because it increases the already high costs 
associated with flying. Add to this the somewhat more relaxed rules of the 
highway, and you might find more families taking road trips on their next 
vacation. This is a potential secondary effect of the legislation which could 
actually increase injuries and fatalities - secondary because it would not be 
directly associated with injuries caused in airplane crashes, but because it 
would incent people to find other, possibly more dangerous, modes of 
transportation.

4. Auto safety legislation puts constraints on auto makers to make cars as 
safe as possible while still maintaining a profit. It also narrows consumers' 
choice sets when buying a new car. A person buying a car in a country with no 
auto safety legislation might make auto safety a priority in their decision. 
In a country indoctrinated by Nader's book, the choice between whether to buy 
a safe or unsafe car is taken away - all cars are made equally safe. Because 
of this, car-buyers have less incentive to drive safely and more leeway to 
choose their car for other reasons. Soon, safety in a car becomes a moot 
point and the car buyer is only concerned with a good price or other 
incentives. Auto accidents increase because there is no longer an incentive 
to drive safely - legislation has made cars, in consumers' minds, 
indestructible. If cars are indestructible, so then are the people in them.

5. a. My demand curve shows that I would purchase 1 gallon of soda at a price 
just under $10. So when I purchase 5 gallons at $5 a gallon, I am better of 
by $12.50.
b. I can purchase 3 more gallons of Diet Coke when it is priced at $3 a 
gallon than when it's priced at $5. Therefore, I'm better off by $2.50 - a 
gain of 3 gallons times a decrease of $2 divided by 2. 
c. If Diet Coke was free, I'd consume up to 10 gallons of it before it 
wouldn't be worth it for me to consume anymore. My consumer surplus is $50.

6. a. A will sell chairs to B. A can make 5 chairs in the time it takes him 
to build 1 table, while B can only build 3 in the time it takes him to build 
a table. (A's chair-to-table time ratio is greater than B's - 1/2 to 1/3.)
b. A will buy tables from C. C can make a table in only twice the amount of 
time it takes him to build a chair, while A takes five times as long to build 
a table than a chair. (A's table-to-chair time ratio is greater than C's - 5 
to 2.)
c. B will do neither. Since B can make chairs faster (rate of 1/3 for B to 
1/2 for C), B won't buy chairs from C. And because C can make tables faster 
(rate of 2 for C to 3 for B), B can't sell tables to C.

7. a. The equilibrium price is $3.96. 
 -10 + 50P = 200 - 3P
 53P = 210
 P = 210/53
 $3.96

The quantity is 188 textbooks.
 -10 + (50)(3.96) = 188
 200 - (3)(3.96) = 188
 188

b. The sticker price becomes $6.79.
 -10 + 50(P-3) = 200 - 3P
 -10 + 50P -150 = 200 - 3P
 360 = 53P
 P = 360/53
 $6.79

The market quantity stays at 188 textbooks.

c. The sticker price becomes $3.79.
 -10 + 50P = 200 - 3(P+3)
 -10 + 50P = 200 - 3P - 9
 201 = 53P
 $3.79

Market quantity decreases marginally to 179 textbooks.
 
d. If the seller pays $3 per book in taxes, the seller charges $6.79 and 
receives $3.79 per book. If the buyer pays $3 per book in sales tax, the 
buyer pays $3.79 per book. The costs are equal despite which party is paying 
the tax.

e. The government collects $564 ($3 tax times 188 books) in tax revenues for 
this set of terms.


8. a. The equilibrium price is $42.
 -10 + 5P = 200
 5P = 210
 P = 42

The market quantity is 200.

b. The sticker price becomes $210 - t.
 -10 + 5(P-t) = 200
 -10 + 5P + 5t = 200
 P = 210 - t

c. The government takes in a tax revenue of 200t. There are deadweight costs 
associated with this tax because the supply is more elastic than the demand 
for insulin. Therefore, consumers will bear more of the burden of the tax.

9. a. Affects supply; supply curve will increase; price and quantity 
exchanged will increase
b. Affects demand; demand curve will decrease; price and quantity exchanged 
will decrease
c. Affects supply: supply curve will decrease: price will and quantity 
exchanged will decrease
d. Affects supply: supply curve will increase; price will decrease, quantity 
exchanged will decrease
e. Affects supply: supply curve will increase; price will decrease, quantity 
exchanged will decrease
f. Affects demand: demand curve will increase; price and quantity exchanged 
will increase
g. Affects demand; demand curve will decrease; price and quantity exchanged 
will increase
h. Affects supply: supply curve will increase; price will decrease, quantity 
exchanged will increase

Portland West Desk lawyers have completed the application to become a 
participant in the Dow Jones survey at NP-15 and SP-15 delivery points. As 
soon as possible, we would like to begin executing deals against these 
indices. In order to do this, we will need to access to them through EnPower, 
in both Deal Blotter and Deal Entry.

If you could facilitate the addition of these two indices into EnPower, we 
would appreciate having access to them by Tuesday. Please let me know what 
steps we need to take at the West Desk to help complete this process. To the 
best of my knowledge, we simply need the ability to choose the Dow Jones 
NP-15 or SP-15 index in the PubCode list in Deal Blotter and Deal Entry. We 
also need to be assured that when these deals are settled, the correct data 
will be pulled into EnPower from Dow Jones. 

Thank you for your help and cooperation. I will be in touch on Monday.

Okay, it's taken me a while to track down the answer on this, but here it is. 
Apparently Greg Wolfe and Tim Belden just signed off on this confirm letter 
and faxed it down to you guys. Greg wasn't sure whose attention it had been 
put to, but hopefully the word got back to you that the confirm language was 
fine and the deal was signed off on. If you need another copy of the 
agreement, let me know.

Hey Kate! I received a BPA trade that Mike/Greg did and under Special 
Provisions on their confirmation it reads:

This is a remarket of Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Company power. KAC's 
point-to-point transmission agreement will be utilized. KAC's scheduling 
agent may request changes to the delivery point(s) under alternate point of

Is this language o.k. ?

It looks great, Nadine. I entered a couple different deals and played around 
with them a bit, and I don't see any changes. So from my end you can go ahead

Hi Everyone,

There is a new version of Deal Entry (Ver. 2.6.6.58)  in stage that needs to 
be User Acceptance Tested.

The changes were actually for Australia (wrong date/time showing, problem 
with EOL) and London (fix to default settings).
These changes should actually be invisible to Houston so you should see no 
difference between the way it was working before and now.

Please test the application (as you would normally use it) and let me know 
(by way of email or phone call) if Deal Entry is working well, and can be 
migrated to Production.  We are hoping to release it to Prod by this evening, 
(January 12, 2001).


Thanks,

Okay, I know for a fact that Natsource has been yelled at by our traders at 
least once today. NONE of these deals should have broker fees on them. Here's 
the deal....

488121 - no fee
488122 - other side of spread - FEE

495306 - no fee GUARANTEED, says Tom Alonso

495206 - no fee
495207 - other side of spread - FEE

Amerex checked out incorrectly - Mike Driscoll just talked to the broker, who 
was aware of that and said they would re-check out. Let me know if he 
communicates this to his back office.

Thanks,

I received a message today from one of the brokers at ED&F Mann, who said he 
was waiting on our payment for a Palo Verde futures contract for April. I 
remember something like this happening last month, and I remember you two 
coming to the rescue, which is why I'm asking for your assistance. If either 
of you get a chance on Monday, let's get together and figure out why this 
hasn't been paid, or maybe why it HAS been paid and not received.

I believe the deal in question is 531782 - Long Term Southwest buys from 
Avista for the month of April, price $196, trade date 2/26. Doesn't this seem 
eerily reminiscent of the last contract that ED&F Mann didn't receive payment 
on? Was it Avista that time too?

The contact at ED&F Mann is Martin, and his number is (212) 566-9329. Just 
let me know when you have a moment to talk.

Thanks,
Kate"

This has been changed. And regarding the EES acquisition from the end of last 
year, I spoke with Kim Hundl briefly about it yesterday. I was a little 
unclear about the question in your e-mail to Carla, which was forwarded to 
me. Please give me a call or shoot me an e-mail, and we'll figure this out. 
Tracy Ngo, our Portland credit person, knows all about it, so between us we

I've had a request from Matt Motley to begin receiving this table on a daily 
basis. Carla Hoffman said Bob Badeer had asked for it before, and for 
whatever reason she held off distributing it to all the traders.

I'd like to know if there is some reason why we don't send the EOL table to 
all the traders on a daily basis. If not, may I copy them on this in the

These deals are all parts of sleeves we did for EES, and we only include a 
broker fee on the sale side of the sleeve. I ended up changing just two 
deals; they're highlighted in red:

459812 - no change (buy side of EES sleeve)
459813 - added .0075 broker fee (sale side of EES sleeve)

457489 - no change (buy side of EES sleeve)
457490 - no change (sale side already contained .0075 broker fee)

468444 - added .0075 broker fee (sale side)
468440 - no change (buy side)

And as a disclaimer - I'm getting my information from our traders, so if any 
of this sounds incorrect, or if Natsource still disputes, please let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

Wait - do you mean 287238 and 287289? Or are we really talking about 487238 
and 487239? I can't find 287289 in the system; but I want to make sure before 
making any moves that I'm looking at the right deals.

Sharen,

This price is 29.9 for 287238,  The corresponding deal is 287289 and that 
price has been changed to 29.95 to reflect the .05 cents we are charging EES 
to do this exchange.

As for 487052, I have down here on my list that 487050 is the corresponding 
deal.   I gave the list we had to Kate Symes,  It seems that Bob had 
decreased a few of the buy prices by .05 cents and increased the sell side to 
the original deal price to collect the .05 cent for epmi. 

Please contact Kate with further inquiries.  She will check into this.

According to the audit viewer, you entered this deal.  It is part of the PGET 
acquisition.  The documentation we have on this deal indicates the price 
should be 29.90.  

Also, we have documentation that indicates there should be another deal that 
matches the terms of #487052, but I thought it should be with PGET.  Number 
487052 is with EES.

Can you check into these and let me know.

Thanks!

Thanks! I handed off the fax to Christian, who said he was extremely busy 
today but would try to get to it this afternoon. In the meantime, I've been 
told by Chris Mallory that the most important issue is that all 
index-forwards get uniform confirmation language. As far as what that 
language is, I'm not sure. Is this different than the confirm letters you've 
received in the past? Let me know if you need me to expedite the process and 
get someone else's opinion.

Thanks,
Kate

Can you check with the trader on this deal.  We have had to change several 
deals input with this CP name.  I believe it should be FPL Energy Power Mktg. 
not  Florida Power & Light Company.  I think one is a utility which would be 
local and one is a marketer, who can trade anywhere.

Thanks!

Amber and I actually had a successful house-hunting weekend. Molly decided to 
get in on the bargain at the last minute, and as it turns out, finding a 
3-bedroom house is a lot easier and cheaper than a 2-bedroom. We found three 
places in NE that look great, so mark your calendar for the house-warming 
party in a couple weeks.

As far as Vietnam vacations go, I don't see one in my near future. First of 
all, I find it difficult to take either one of you seriously - your favorite 
phrases are ""baby"" and ""poppa"" for god's sake. Secondly, I have about 10 
countries on my list of places to go that precede Vietnam. And finally, it 
sounds a little precarious to fly halfway across the world to visit someone I 
hardly know who seems to be in serious denial about his status as a man with 
a significant other.

Other than that, you can tell Chris I'll see what I can do.

Kate,

I'll lay off the ""Date with Destiny"" stuff...I was becoming bored with it as
well.  How was your weekend?  Did you and Amber go house hunting?  I had a
great time at the beach with the boys.  Chris asked me to tell you that he
wants you to come to Vietnam.

Take care,

""Pretty tired"" is the understatement of the century. What a way to kick off
my New Year's Resolution of staying home on weeknights. And things promise
to only get worse - I think Amber and I are getting a place together. I'm
not sure I'll survive another month of this kind of social life.

You know, ""date with destiny"" is getting a little old. Can you come up with
something more original?

They are good deals, but we don't have deal numbers because Mike is out of 
the office right now and said he wanted to check with the broker personally 
before verifying the price. He's aware that the deals will have to go in late 
and be backdated, and that they will not be in his calculation for the day. 
Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Left message for Bob - I don't see these deals in his trade log, so I can't 
be sure whether or not they're good. Again, we'll have to wait for the trader 
and broker to verify this.

I just got a hold of Mike, who is aware of these deals but isn't positive on 
the prices. He's going to have to check with the broker on Monday to get it 
right. So as of right now these deals aren't in the system. I'm sorry about 
that.

Thanks,
Kate

You're probably right, Sharen, since the counterparty continues to send 
confirmation letters with FPL Energy Power Marketing instead of Florida Power 
& Light. Unfortunately, the marketer who contacts our trader to transact 
identifies himself as being with Florida Power & Light, which is where I 
believe the confusion is coming from. I'll let the traders know of the 
correct counterparty name, though. 

Thanks for the heads up,
Kate

Can you check with the trader on this deal.  We have had to change several 
deals input with this CP name.  I believe it should be FPL Energy Power Mktg. 
not  Florida Power & Light Company.  I think one is a utility which would be 
local and one is a marketer, who can trade anywhere.

Thanks!

""Pretty tired"" is the understatement of the century. What a way to kick off 
my New Year's Resolution of staying home on weeknights. And things promise to 
only get worse - I think Amber and I are getting a place together. I'm not 
sure I'll survive another month of this kind of social life.

You know, ""date with destiny"" is getting a little old. Can you come up with

Thanks! You guys are adorable. When I become technologically advanced enough 
to get a picture of myself onto the computer, I promise to send it over. In 
the meatime, just picture me as a Cindy Crawford type, only thinner. :-)

And on the subject of the BPA deal - I just spoke with Val Sabo, who's 
working with Greg Wolfe and Tim Belden to get this deal done. Apparently it's 
a good deal; it was put into the system and calculated, then taken out and is 
currently being re-negotiated. When Greg and Tim come to an agreement with 
BPA, they will most likely send you a revised confirmation. So in the 
meantime, Val says to hold off doing anything. We'll keep you posted.

Thanks for checking up on this.

Kate

Matt Motley and Mike Swerzbin both said this trade should be desk-to-desk and 
has nothing to do with Bonneville. Could you send me a copy of the confirm 
letter? They'd like to look at it to try and figure out what trade BPA is 
referring to. If it's a hard copy, you can fax it to 503-464-3740. Thanks a 
lot.

Hey Kate! I have a trade that Motley did and it shows as a desk to desk

desk to desk or should the counterparty actually be BPA?

That is actually the report I'm having problems with. The old EOL JF report 
on your desktop has somehow been replaced by the new stage version. It's 
trying to pull information from the C drive, which does not exist on terminal 
server. Nicolay is working with me to try to figure out why, but most likely 
they'll have to put the stage version into production in order for me to run 
this report again. 

Thanks for the suggestion,
Kate

I'm continuing to work with IT in Houston in an attempt to restore the EOL 
Report to its former glory. They are making several changes to the report 
which seem to result exponentially in glitches. As of right now the 
application will not create any kind of file with any kind of data; hence the 
absence of any kind of report. I will keep you informed of our progress.

Thanks for your patience,

The STCA desk will be short 75 MW on peak at NP-15 on 1/4. This is due to two

Subject: Visit to Portland

I am planning to come to the Portland Office on Mon., Jan. 22 and Tues., Jan. 
23.  I am planning to bring Melissa Murphy with me so that she can meet 
everyone in the office.  Melissa is taking over as Lead for me on Power since 
my responsibilities have grown the past few months.  I will still be directly 
responsible for Power Confirmations but am now also responsible for 
management of Physical/Financial Gas Confirmations, Contracts and Financial 
Settlements.  

I was thinking of also bringing someone to do some training on Livelink (the 
document imaging system).  I know that a few of you have been encountering 
problems when using the application.  I would like for this person to see 
they types of problems that you are having so that we can get them fixed.  As 
well, I know that there are a few more advanced features of Livelink that may 
be of interest (i.e. project sharing, etc.).

Let me know you thoughts on this or if you think that it would be beneficial 
to you and others in the office for a Livelink rep. to come with me.  Thanks!

Kate, 
I received a call from Tricia Allen of Tacoma, and she was inquiring about 
two deals that happened yesterday:  Deal 491893.01, she agrees with
Deal 491916.01 she does not agree with  
I left her a message that they showed as good deals in our system and she 
called back and said she does not agree with Deal 491916.01.   Can you check 
with Sean Crandall and have the two traders talk. 
Thanks

It looks like 491916 duplicated a strip contained in 491893. I spoke with 
Diana Scholtes, and she wanted to keep both deals, but she deleted the extra 
strip in 491893. Let me know if this works with Tacoma.

Thanks,

I received a call from Tricia Allen of Tacoma, and she was inquiring about 
two deals that happened yesterday:  Deal 491893.01, she agrees with
Deal 491916.01 she does not agree with  
I left her a message that they showed as good deals in our system and she 
called back and said she does not agree with Deal 491916.01.   Can you check 
with Sean Crandall and have the two traders talk. 
Thanks
Stephanie

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an

of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

MANAGING BILLING. The complex requirements for managing billing and

Thanks! I handed off the fax to Christian, who said he was extremely busy 
today but would try to get to it this afternoon. In the meantime, I've been 
told by Chris Mallory that the most important issue is that all 
index-forwards get uniform confirmation language. As far as what that 
language is, I'm not sure. Is this different than the confirm letters you've 
received in the past? Let me know if you need me to expedite the process and 
get someone else's opinion.

Sharen,

This price is 29.9 for 287238,  The corresponding deal is 287289 and that 
price has been changed to 29.95 to reflect the .05 cents we are charging EES 
to do this exchange.

As for 487052, I have down here on my list that 487050 is the corresponding 
deal.   I gave the list we had to Kate Symes,  It seems that Bob had 
decreased a few of the buy prices by .05 cents and increased the sell side to 
the original deal price to collect the .05 cent for epmi. 

Please contact Kate with further inquiries.  She will check into this.

Subject: Deal # 487238

According to the audit viewer, you entered this deal.  It is part of the PGET 
acquisition.  The documentation we have on this deal indicates the price 
should be 29.90.  

Also, we have documentation that indicates there should be another deal that 
matches the terms of #487052, but I thought it should be with PGET.  Number 
487052 is with EES.

Can you check into these and let me know.

Thanks!

Wait - do you mean 287238 and 287289? Or are we really talking about 487238 
and 487239? I can't find 287289 in the system; but I want to make sure before 
making any moves that I'm looking at the right deals.

Thanks,

Sharen,

This price is 29.9 for 287238,  The corresponding deal is 287289 and that 
price has been changed to 29.95 to reflect the .05 cents we are charging EES 
to do this exchange.

As for 487052, I have down here on my list that 487050 is the corresponding 
deal.   I gave the list we had to Kate Symes,  It seems that Bob had 
decreased a few of the buy prices by .05 cents and increased the sell side to 
the original deal price to collect the .05 cent for epmi. 

Please contact Kate with further inquiries.  She will check into this.

According to the audit viewer, you entered this deal.  It is part of the PGET 
acquisition.  The documentation we have on this deal indicates the price 
should be 29.90.  

Also, we have documentation that indicates there should be another deal that 
matches the terms of #487052, but I thought it should be with PGET.  Number 
487052 is with EES.

Can you check into these and let me know.

Thanks!

All,

As requested, I have schedulled 10 minutes downtime for PWRPROD1 tonight from 
10:00pm until 10:10pm.

The purpose is to increase the maximum number of processes from 500 into 800.

In the last 1 week, the max number of processes was exceeded twice, so we 
need to resolve this problem as soon as possible.

Please forward this information to anyone who should be notified.

Thank you.

Tantra.

It is with mixed emotions that I announce my plans to retire from Enron 
effective 1 February 2001.  On the one hand, I will look forward to the 
adventures that retirement offers; but on the other, I will miss working with 
those of you whom I have come to know over the years.  I thoroughly enjoyed 
my ten years with Enron, and it has been a privilege to lead EECC.  I wish 
all of you and Enron the very best and continued success."

These deals are all parts of sleeves we did for EES, and we only include a 
broker fee on the sale side of the sleeve. I ended up changing just two 
deals; they're highlighted in red:

459812 - no change (buy side of EES sleeve)
459813 - added .0075 broker fee (sale side of EES sleeve)

457489 - no change (buy side of EES sleeve)
457490 - no change (sale side already contained .0075 broker fee)

468444 - added .0075 broker fee (sale side)
468440 - no change (buy side)

And as a disclaimer - I'm getting my information from our traders, so if any 
of this sounds incorrect, or if Natsource still disputes, please let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

I've had a request from Matt Motley to begin receiving this table on a daily 
basis. Carla Hoffman said Bob Badeer had asked for it before, and for 
whatever reason she held off distributing it to all the traders.

I'd like to know if there is some reason why we don't send the EOL table to 
all the traders on a daily basis. If not, may I copy them on this in the 
future?

Thanks,

This has been changed. And regarding the EES acquisition from the end of last 
year, I spoke with Kim Hundl briefly about it yesterday. I was a little 
unclear about the question in your e-mail to Carla, which was forwarded to 
me. Please give me a call or shoot me an e-mail, and we'll figure this out. 
Tracy Ngo, our Portland credit person, knows all about it, so between us we 
should be able to clarify this.

Thanks,
Kate

 I just received the e-mail regarding your visit to Portland (Monica Lande 
forwarded it to me). Regarding that, I would definitely be interested in 
gaining access to Livelink. Monica explained that Livelink is a system that 
allows one to view confirms, in which case it would greatly benefit my 
position to have access to it. I look forward to your visit, and to working 
with you in the future.

Subject: Overview of NERC's Reliability Assessment 2000-2009


An overview of NERC's Reliability Assessment 2000-2009
      ,Copyright 2000 EEI. All rights reserved.

EEI's State Restructuring Service is proud to present an Internet E-Forum 
providing an overview of the North American Electric Reliability Council's 
(NERC) recently released Reliability Assessment 2000-2009, the reliability of 
bulk electric systems in North America.

The reliability of the electric generation and transmission systems serving 
North America has come under increased federal government, state regulator, 
and customer scrutiny. Generation capacity margins have decreased and the 
bulk electric systems are subjected to flows in magnitudes and directions not 
contemplated when they were designed or for which there is minimal operating 
experience.

Each year, the Reliability Assessment Subcommittee (RAS) of the North 
American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) reviews the overall reliability 
of existing and planned electric generation and transmission systems in North 
America. This year's Reliability Assessment 2000-2009 report presents:

*An assessment of electric generation and transmission reliability through 
2009

*An assessment of the generation resource adequacy of each Interconnection in 
North America

*A discussion of key issues affecting reliability of future electric supply

*Regional assessments of electric supply reliability, including issues of 
specific Regional concern

Presenting an overview of this year's Reliability Assessment is Frank J. 
Koza, Jr., Chairman, Reliability Assessment Subcommittee, and General 
Manager, Ventures, PECO Energy Company.

Our guest moderator is Tim Gallagher, Mgr Technical Services, NERC

To provide questions and commentary we have Jolly Hayden, Vice President of 
Transmission, Dynegy

A copy of the Reliability Assessment 2000-2009 is available from the NERC web 
site at http://www.nerc.com/~pc/syscond.html.

November 21, 2000 1 p.m. ET
Note: Please block a 2-hour time slot for the E-Forum. We expect the program 
to take about one hour. Q&A at the conclusion of the E-Forum could take up to 
an additional hour.

Kate, 
Pwx called this mroning to verbal a deal that  was sleeved with EES.  I do 
not see it in system, although I see the deal on EES spreadsheet that I 
receive daily.
the deal is Enron Buys Pwx   Q4 2001 25mws   255.00  done direct  trade date 
1/8/01  Matt Motley trader
then Enron Sell EES  Q4 2001  25mws   $255.05

Should this be in the system and if so do you have deal numbers on the 
above.  I believe we sleeved the deal for EES and Pwx.  
Contact at EES, Judy (backoffice 7138535490)  Jubran Whalen is EES trader.

Thanks

Matt doesn't have any trade like this for 1/8. I spoke with Judy at EES, and 
she's going to have Jubran call Matt to duke it out over whether or not this 
is a good trade. I'll let you know what those guys decide.

Hey Mom!
Just wanted to give you my new email address!  Job is going well, I'll tell
you all about it when I have more time.  Also, new address is 515 Clarkson
#207, Denver 80218.  I'll let you know when I get my phone.  Apartment is
funky but big, good price, neat location.  Can you give me Kate's email
address?  Can't seem to find it.  Anyway, let me know when you get this so I
know it's working.  Hope all's well in Portland.  It has been gorgeously
sunny everyday here - snow on saturday!!  Also, I have a couple interviews
(one with Starbucks - whatever, it pays the bills!).  But if you can
possibly contribute to the something-for-me-to-sleep-on fund I would
appreciate it so much, as I am moving into my apartment on Monday and will
be bedless until my first paycheck.  Okay, tell everyone I said hi and that
I wish you were all here!  Love, Anna"

When you are scheduling the two Wheelabrator units, please use the following 
counterparties in CAPS:

MARTEL_2_AMFOR:  Wheelabrat
WSENGY_1_Unit 4:  WheelSHAST

We account for these separately and thus they need to be scheduled as two 
separate entities.  

In Enpower there are two counterparties set up as well:

MARTEL_2_AMFOR:  WHEELABRMA
WSENGY_1_Unit 4:  WHEELABRSH

Thanks and let me know if you have any questions,

Kourtney

Both Mike Swerzbin deals were in incorrectly. We've changed them, and added 
the last deal for Matt Motley. 

495106
Off Peak

495175
50 MW

Matt's deal should show up any minute.

Looks like Amerex has this in as a peak deal. Bob shows off-peak, says Amerex 
is incorrect. Please let me know if they dispute.

Hey Kate! I received a BPA trade that Mike/Greg did and under Special 
Provisions on their confirmation it reads:

This is a remarket of Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Company power. KAC's 
point-to-point transmission agreement will be utilized. KAC's scheduling 
agent may request changes to the delivery point(s) under alternate point of 
delivery capabilities associated with KAC's transmission agreement. BPA shall 
accommodate the scheduling of such changes.

Is this language o.k. ?

Amerex checked out incorrectly - Mike Driscoll just talked to the broker, who 
was aware of that and said they would re-check out. Let me know if he 
communicates this to his back office.

Thanks,
Kate

Okay, I know for a fact that Natsource has been yelled at by our traders at 
least once today. NONE of these deals should have broker fees on them. Here's 
the deal....

488121 - no fee
488122 - other side of spread - FEE

495306 - no fee GUARANTEED, says Tom Alonso

495206 - no fee
495207 - other side of spread - FEE

If they still dispute, let me know and I'll sick the traders on them. Sorry 
for the hassle.

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Everyone,

There is a new version of Deal Entry (Ver. 2.6.6.58)  in stage that needs to 
be User Acceptance Tested.

The changes were actually for Australia (wrong date/time showing, problem 
with EOL) and London (fix to default settings).
These changes should actually be invisible to Houston so you should see no 
difference between the way it was working before and now.

Please test the application (as you would normally use it) and let me know 
(by way of email or phone call) if Deal Entry is working well, and can be 
migrated to Production.  We are hoping to release it to Prod by this evening, 
(January 12, 2001).


Thanks, 
Nadine Costanzo (713)853-9863.

It looks great, Nadine. I entered a couple different deals and played around 
with them a bit, and I don't see any changes. So from my end you can go ahead 
and move this version to production.

Thanks for all the hard work.

Kate

Possibly. And just for your information, I think that request was actually 
three sentences crammed into one, with a misspelling thrown in for good 
measure. Nice.

Okay, it's taken me a while to track down the answer on this, but here it is. 
Apparently Greg Wolfe and Tim Belden just signed off on this confirm letter 
and faxed it down to you guys. Greg wasn't sure whose attention it had been 
put to, but hopefully the word got back to you that the confirm language was 
fine and the deal was signed off on. If you need another copy of the 
agreement, let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

Portland West Desk lawyers have completed the application to become a 
participant in the Dow Jones survey at NP-15 and SP-15 delivery points. As 
soon as possible, we would like to begin executing deals against these 
indices. In order to do this, we will need to access to them through EnPower, 
in both Deal Blotter and Deal Entry.

If you could facilitate the addition of these two indices into EnPower, we 
would appreciate having access to them by Tuesday. Please let me know what 
steps we need to take at the West Desk to help complete this process. To the 
best of my knowledge, we simply need the ability to choose the Dow Jones 
NP-15 or SP-15 index in the PubCode list in Deal Blotter and Deal Entry. We 
also need to be assured that when these deals are settled, the correct data 
will be pulled into EnPower from Dow Jones. 

Thank you for your help and cooperation. I will be in touch on Monday.

My oh my - it's a rare occasion when I am greeted by such entertaining 
e-mails in the morning. Thanks for dropping the note, even if it was just a 
covert ploy to get me to deprive your enemies of their electricity. And by 
the way, if I could do that, you can bet we would have already had rolling 
black-outs in strategically placed Portland neighborhoods.

Yes, I did finish the book. It was very interesting, although it did lose me 
for awhile in the middle. It's a super-fast read, so I'm going to send 
another book along with it called ""Liar's Poker."" I just heard about it and 
it's supposed to be hilarious - an account of the boom and doom of Wall 
Street in the 1980s. I know, I know - Corporate America has taken its 
stranglehold on me, and pretty soon I'll be reading the stock market quotes 
for FUN! But just give it a chance; it's something a little different.

No, Anna did not give me the fair chance I deserved to get ""Heartbreaking 
Work..."" She is clearly a tramp. I will be procuring that book for myself 
later today, as I do not see any time in the near future when Anna will come 
to her senses and quit being evil.

Anyway, I've got to go control the world's electricity supply now. (This 
statement should be followed by a Dr. Evil type cackle; you know, the one 
that comes after ""One Meeeelllion Dollars...."") But study up and make us all 
proud. Tell all your roomies I said hi, and study....or pay the price later.

Kate

P.S. What the heck is your address anyway?"

I'd like to enroll in the Enron Savings Plan program; however, when I was 
navigating through the savings plan website, I started wondering if the 
retirement plan and the self-directed brokerage account are the same thing. I 
think you probably have some information regarding these plans. Could I 
borrow that later this afternoon, or even better, sit down with you for a 
minute to clarify which plans I am eligible to enroll in and when? Thanks in 
advance for your time.

Kate - 

401K and the cash balance retirement plan are 2 separate plans.  You are 
automatically enrolled in the cash balance plan - you would be eligible to 
participate for the year 2000.  Going forward, at the end of each year, Enron 
will set aside 5% of your salary into an account (Enron directs these 
funds).  This account has a 5 year vesting period meaning that you must stay 
with the company for 5 years to be eligible to receive these funds when you 
leave. 

Does this help?

Amy

So I don't need to do anything in order to be a part of the ""cash balance 
plan""? When I pull up my account information from the ""Savings Plan"" website, 
it says my investments and balances are zero, so I assume I need to enroll in 
this myself if I want to be a part of it. The plan I'm referring to allows 
you to invest up to 15% of your before-tax income in either Enron Corp stock 
or a variety of mutual funds. In this plan, up to 6% of your contributions 
are matched by Enron, beginning one month after your hire date. I guess my 
question is - What is this plan called? And if I enroll in it myself online, 
will I be doubling up on something Enron has already done for me? If this is 
not the retirement plan, what is?

I'm sorry to ask so many trivial questions. I just want to make sure I've 
taken advantage of all the programs and not neglected opportunities because I 
thought they were automatically given to me.

Thanks,
Kate

Please find attached the Name Change/Merger Notification Report for January.  
To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select Enable Macros 
and Read Only.
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Feb 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.  "

TFS broker checked out wrong. We just spoke with him and he said he had 
corrected it with the back office. Should be cleared up now.

How goes it, girlfriend? I just got your message - sorry I haven't been in 
touch yet, and I can give you all the excuses in the book about how I've been 
swamped with work, play, life in general, but we both know I'm just flaky, so 
there's no point in explaining it.

Anyway, I'm so excited to hear you're doing well in your new Rocky Mountain 
dwelling, but you left me here with no good pissing and moaning (and getting 
""pissed"") buddies. So I checked out airfares to Denver, and found one for 
$118 roundtrip! Can you freakin' believe it? Anyway, you have to purchase and 
use the ticket by the end of March, so I was thinking a little spring break 
action was called for. Do you think you'd be settled enough by the end of 
March to accomodate a portly older sister for a few days? Let me know, and 
I'll do the deal.

Got to go - business abounds at Enron as usual. I'll try to drop you a line 
tonight when I have more time to write. Do you have a phone number? Amber was 
in Denver over the weekend, and she and Monica called me trying to get ahold 
of you, but I had no idea where to look. (Except somewhere in Denver, but 
from what I've heard it's a fairly big place.)

Write back soon, or call - I want to know how the internship is. But more 
importantly, how's the unlimited Starbucks coffee?

Love,
Kate"

Just wanted to let you know I haven't forgotten you. All our traders and 
schedulers have been in a meeting this afternoon, and as soon as they got out 
the frenzy of trading and scheduling began again. I'm going to give things a 
minute to settle down, and then ask around as to how people would like their 
Livelink training.

I'll get back to you soon.

Yo sista,

Sorry I've been so MIA.  You know how it is: move to a new city, lack the
money to buy groceries or put roof over head let alone purchase a calling
card.  I am enjoying my internship and even starbucks (it's kind of fun!),
but I am DEAD broke and trying to figure out how to pay rent this month.  So
I guess nothing's new . . .

Outward Bound is nice.  The ""office"" is an old renovated house about six
blocks from my apartment, which is a godsend when it snows (which it did
today, a lot).  The people here are generally really mellow - I'm sure you
can imagine.  Lots of ""bro!"", ""dude!"" and ""no worries!"" like we're
Australian surfers or something.  I actually heard somebody call some slides
(as in picture slides) the ""slidey-slides"" the other day.  But they're all
super nice, and I have my own desk and phone and voice mail, so I feel
important.  Starbucks is pretty fucking funny (again, use your imagination).
Everyone I work with is tall, skinny, male, goateed, and painfully in the
closet.  And you should hear the crap that people order - they actually have
a CODE for ""half-caf"" now.  Idiots - do you even know what actual coffee
tastes like?

So I heard you're moving in with Molly and Amber.  That should be fun.
Honestly, Kate, I love it here, but I think I'll be back sooner than I
thought.  I'm starting to think I could be really happy in Portland.  But
you can't beat the weather in Denver - it's sunny practically everyday!  And
the guys here know how to buy pants that fit properly over their shoes.  You
have to visit!  Our apartment is big and we could go out with Monica and it
would be really fun!  My phone number, by the way, is (303) 777-7132.  So
call me if you ever get those free long distance thingies that cell phones
tend to get.  Okay, let me know the gossip in p-town.  Love, anna

Welcome to the Official PGE PARK NEWSLETTER.  This newsletter has been
created by Portland Family Entertainment (PFE) to give you an insider's
view on PGE PARK, the home of the Triple A Baseball Portland Beavers and
A-League Soccer Portland Timbers.

For more information, please visit our web site at www.pgepark.com, or
call the Ticket Hotline at (503) 553-5555.

PGE PARK CONSTRUCTION OVERVIEW
When PGE Park is completed next spring, event patrons may be surprised
to see the magnitude of this exciting renovation.  In partnership with
the City of Portland, PFE will manage a $38.5 million renovation of the
former Civic Stadium to enhance fan enjoyment standards, meet modern
design codes and honor the historic character of this 1926 landmark.

Soon to be the premier outdoor event venue in the region, PGE Park will
feature:

*  New convertible playing surface, adaptable to all events.

*  New baseball dugouts and bullpens.

*  Major League Baseball field dimensions.

*  Vintage style wrought-iron fence along 18th Ave. allowing passerby a
view of all PGE Park events.

*  New seats and wider concourses.

*  New restrooms and baby-changing stations.

*  New concession stands and kiosks with improved menu options.

*  Fred Meyer Family Deck featuring an old-fashioned soda fountain.

*  Yet-to-be-named Widmer field level bar and grill, featuring grills
and full beverage service.

*  Affordable Pavilion Boxes, Field Boxes and Club Seats for
high-quality corporate entertainment.

*  State-of-the-art sound system and new theatre organ.

*  Americans with Disabilities (ADA) Compliance.

*  Current seismic code compliance.

*  ... and much more!

PGE PARK CONSTRUCTION UPDATE
Virtually every area of the construction site is currently under
construction.  From elevator pits and structural elements to field boxes
and underground utilities, it's all coming together for our Spring 2001
opening.

The main concourse along 20th Avenue (the first base side), demolished
during the Portland Rockies' season last summer, is re-emerging as a
wider, lowered concourse.  Steel beams and metal decking are being
placed for a major concrete pour in the near future.  This will be the
most visible reconstruction element to date in the project.

Concrete has already been poured at the field level in the area of the
new soon-to-be-named Widmer Bar and Grill.  This field-level area will
have both an open air patio and a space built under the seating bowl for
a true early 1920's bar feel.  Selecting your favorite bar stool for a
view of the game is only a few months away!

We will soon be adding a Construction Update Photo Gallery to
www.pgepark.com.  We will keep you posted on when this exciting feature
is added.  If you would like to receive photos as an attachment, please
email us at info@pgepark.com.


PFE NAMES TRIPLE-A AND SINGLE-A BASEBALL TEAMS
After an outpouring of fan feedback, Portland Family Entertainment went
with tradition when they announced that the Triple-A Baseball Pacific
Coast League club will be called the Portland Beavers.

""Baseball is a game deeply rooted in tradition,"" said Mike Higgins, PFE
vice president and Beavers general manager, who made the announcement.
""The name and logo will also integrate well with the nostalgic look and
feel that PGE Park will have when it opens next spring.""

Portland Family Entertainment also announced that it has named its
Northwest League Single-A Baseball Team the Tri-City Dust Devils.
Formerly the Portland Rockies, the Dust Devils will begin play in the
Tri-Cities Stadium in Pasco beginning summer 2001.

PFE partnered with the Marathon Media Group of Tri-Cities to conduct a
poll and contest of their radio listeners to select the team name.
Respondents were able to vote on the Marathon Media web site.
Richland's Rosalie Swanson was selected at random, from the many Dust
Devil entries, as the grand prizewinner of two club-level season tickets
for the team's inaugural season.

For information on Beavers Club Seats and Season Tickets, call
503.553.5555 or fill out our online questionnaire at
http://www.pgepark.com/old_site/infoform.html.


VANCOUVER'S RICK SWEET NAMED BEAVERS MANAGER
The San Diego Padres didn't have to search far to find the right guy for
the job as today Vancouver, Washington resident, Rick Sweet, was named
manager of the Pacific Coast League's Portland Beavers.  The Padres also
announced other additions to the Beavers staff including Darrel
Akerfelds as pitching coach; Roy Howell as coach, and John Maxwell as
the club's trainer.

""We felt it was important to hire a manager that had significant
managerial experience,"" said Tye Waller, Padres' director, player
development.  ""It was also important for us to hire someone who had ties
to the local community.  That's not always an easy combination to come
up with, but we clearly achieved that in hiring Rick.  Rick, Darrel and
Roy have all played in the big leagues and that experience will be a
tremendous asset in the development of our younger players.  In John we
have a first class trainer and will do a terrific job in looking after
our guys.""

Sweet has 12 seasons of experience as a minor league manager and was
named Pacific Coast League manager of the year in 1994, while managing
the Tucson Toros as they defeated the Portland Beavers for the PCL
championship.  He joins the Portland's new Triple-A team from the
Montreal Expos where he served as their minor league field coordinator
for the past two years.  During the 1998 season, Sweet managed the
Double-A Harrisburg Senators to the Eastern League title.

Sweet also reached the majors as a switch-hitting catcher with the Mets,
Seattle Mariners and Padres.  He made his major league debut on April 8,
1978 with the Padres.  Sweet homered in his first Kingdome at-bat after
joining Seattle in 1982.


CONWAY NAMED TIMBERS ASSISTANT COACH
The Portland Timbers have named former player, captain, and coach, Jimmy
Conway, as assistant coach for Portland's new A-League soccer club.
Through an agreement between the Timbers and Oregon Youth Soccer
Association (OYSA), Conway will continue to serve in his current role as
OYSA's director of coaching, a position he has held since 1982.

""Jimmy was my first choice for the position of assistant coach and I am
delighted that he was available to join our staff,"" said Timbers head
coach, Bobby Howe.  ""Not only is he an outstanding member of US Soccer's
National Coaching Staff, but he also has a first class international
playing background.  I also want to recognize and thank OYSA for their
spirit of cooperation in allowing us to 'share' with them Jimmy's
knowledge and experience.  I think it will be a great benefit for our
professional players and Oregon's youth soccer players.""

Prior to coaching, Conway had an outstanding playing career making 20
caps for the Republic of Ireland from 1966-1977.  As a midfielder,
Conway made over 300 appearances for Fulham in England's First Division,
where he scored 66 goals for the Cottagers.  In 1976, he transferred to
Manchester City of the English Premier League before joining the Timbers
in 1978.  He was named captain of the Timbers in 1979 and was promoted
to the position of player-coach in 1980 by then head coach, Don Megson.
He retired from playing professionally in 1982.


TIMBERS ADD SECOND TRYOUT DATE TO MEET DEMAND
The Portland Timbers announced today that they have reached capacity for
their first public tryout scheduled for Saturday, November 11 at Tigard

purchasing full and half-boxes save even more, with PFE paying the City
of Portland's 10% user fee.

even include a VCR so parents can keep young ones entertained with their

reassign the tickets to another guest of your choice; tickets will be
waiting for them when they arrive at PGE Park.

This is to summarize our previous discussion:

EPMI took an assignment of ALL EEMC's (an affiliate of EES) deals with PG&E 
Energy Trading  - Power, L.P. (PGET) whereby EPMI is now buying all of the 
power from PGET.
EPMI then acts as ""sleeve"" for EES and sells the power to EES with a $.05 
sleeve fee
With respect to the specific EEMC deal # ACW672, EEMC originally was buying 
75MW from PGET at a price of $29.90.
After taking over EEMC's portfolio, EPMI, PGET and Avista Energy entered into 
a 3-party assignment, assumption and settlement agreement whereby EPMI and 
AvistaEnergy ""took out"" PGET of the picture for 50MW of the 75MW piece.
By doing so, EPMI thus is buying 50MW from Avista Energy and the remaining 
25MW still from PGET
The new 50MW piece from Avista Energy results in a purchase price of $29.80 
and a sale price of $29.85 to EES.  [the reason for the price decrease is 
because when we entered into the 3-party agreement, in order to ""take out"" 
PGET we had to pay them their profit in that deal stream ie monetizing their 
spread of $.10 per MW]
The remaining 25MW piece from PGET kept the SAME PRICING of $29.90 since we 
left that 25MW block alone.

If you have any additional questions, please call me.

Thanks. Mike's looking it over. Says it's not okay until he talks with 
Cominco, so it probably won't get faxed back right away, since these guys are 
in the middle of a busy trading morning. But I'll call or e-mail as soon as 
they've worked out a revised confirmation.

Here's the latest I've heard from Willie Harrell, the Global Management staff 
member in charge of this job. I spoke with him briefly, and he said he 
expected to have the indices available in Enpower this afternoon. 

Jeff Richter is currently consumed with sorting out EES discrepancies for 
today, but we'll work on the new spreadsheets this afternoon.

I'll keep you posted.

Thanks,
Kate

Thanks! I handed off the fax to Christian, who said he was extremely busy 
today but would try to get to it this afternoon. In the meantime, I've been 
told by Chris Mallory that the most important issue is that all 
index-forwards get uniform confirmation language. As far as what that 
language is, I'm not sure. Is this different than the confirm letters you've 
received in the past? Let me know if you need me to expedite the process and 
get someone else's opinion.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate,
I received and index trade into NP15 that Chris Mallory did. For Price the 
confirmations states: 

The average day ahead, post congestion price for the Constrained Price as 
published by the California Power Exchange for the on in the period of 
delivery stated herein plus 3.00.

Is this language o.k. to accept on the confirmation.

You're right - bankruptcy is a likely move for PG&E. But this deal was 
entered in place of an existing position we had with PG&E in the California 
Power Exchange, and it's been approved by our legal and credit departments.

Let me know if you have further questions.

Thanks,
Kate

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=

498837 has been changed to Natsource.

499013 - Mike Swerzbin disputes this checkout - has 190.00 price in trade log 
and checked out at that price with his broker at APB. Now they're having APB 
look into it. I'll let you know when they resolve the price.

499013 was changed to a price of 180. Mike is having the broker pull their 
tapes for today, but we won't get that information until tomorrow. In the 
meantime, we're giving them the benefit of the doubt. I'll let you know if

I'm so sorry it's taken me this long to get back to you. It's been truly 
chaotic around here with the California situation, and the lawyers are 
obviously preoccupied, so Christian hasn't gotten back to me yet. I finally 
went back to Chris Mallory, and we determined that the language in this 
confirm is fine as long as it matches the confirm language for the original 
deal - 459996. This was the sale to Constellation at index + $1, but now that 
we're trying to clear all our positions with the California Power Exchange, 
we had to buy it back at index + $3. Does that make any sense, or am I just 
rambling? It's been a long day. Check the confirm for 459996, and make sure 
485446 matches up. Otherwise, call me.

Thanks for your patience,
Kate

Thanks! I handed off the fax to Christian, who said he was extremely busy 
today but would try to get to it this afternoon. In the meantime, I've been 
told by Chris Mallory that the most important issue is that all 
index-forwards get uniform confirmation language. As far as what that 
language is, I'm not sure. Is this different than the confirm letters you've 
received in the past? Let me know if you need me to expedite the process and 
get someone else's opinion.

Thanks,

Kate,
I received and index trade into NP15 that Chris Mallory did. For Price the 
confirmations states: 

The average day ahead, post congestion price for the Constrained Price as 
published by the California Power Exchange for the on in the period of 
delivery stated herein plus 3.00.

Is this language o.k. to accept on the confirmation.

Who's ready to rhumba? Crystal Ballroom holds salsa classes on the first 
Tuesday of every month. The hour-long class begins at 7p.m., with live music 
and dancing afterward. Cost is $8 for the whole evening. The other Tuesdays 
of the month have live music and dancing, no class unfortunately. Anyway, I'm 
sure it won't take us more than an hour to become master Latin dancers on par 
with Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera.

Do you want to try it out? Next class is Feb. 6. Mark your calendars and tell

I think you're right, but the trader just took off for lunch. I'll check with 
him and kill the duplicate deal if necessary, then let you know when it's 
done.

Just spoke with Sean Crandall - he killed deal #499391. This has happened 
before, and seems to be a glitch in Deal Blotter when traders enter off peak 
deals. I'll talk with IT about it; but thanks for catching this in the 
meantime.

I've run across what seems to be a glitch in Deal Blotter; although it may be 
caused by the default settings in a specific trader's blotter. A few times 
over the last several weeks, our traders at the Short Term Southwest desk 
have entered off peak deals by choosing the ""off"" selection under the ""Hours"" 
heading. But the mask doesn't change to include Sundays and Holidays, and the 
traders then enter another deal to compensate for this. What we've found then 
is that the original deal did in fact include a strip for Sundays and 
Holidays, round-the-clock hours.

My question is - when you enter an off-peak deal in Deal Blotter, does it 
automatically read that as Mon. through Sat. off-peak hours AND Sundays and 
Holidays round-the-clock? Even though the mask does not change to show 
Sundays and Holidays? I'm just wondering if there is an easier way to assure 
that we've entered off-peak deals correctly other than double-checking them 
in Deal Entry.

Please call or e-mail when you get a chance. Again, this could be just a 
matter of incorrect settings in someone's blotter; but I'd like to make sure 
either way.

Thanks for your time,
Kate"

Mike Swerzbin is going to contact the trader at SCEM - these are good deals. 
They were originally done on EOL, then changed to direct trades. Once they 
talk, I'll get back to you and let you know if they decided to keep or kill 
the deals.

Thanks,
Kate

thinking? How long have you worked here? Can you say, ""wrong counterparty

Kate, I have a couple of confirms I received from BPA with the following 
info. I spoke with BPA and they said that their trader had talked to Sean 
Crandall and agreed to Mid Columbia as the Delivery point, however in the 
Enpower they have Northwest Delivered. Could you please check into:

#492613.01, 492612.01, 492611.01, 488524.01, 488523.01 These all say NW in 
the system but BPA has Mid C on confirm

#491609.01 This trade has a trade date of 1/8/01. But on BPA's confirm they 
have a trade date of 1/5/01. Could you ask Mike who did the trade which is 
correct?

Thanks,

It's Matt Motley's deal, but all the traders just got out of a meeting, so 
they're still entering deals. It should show up any minute.

Re: the BPA deals - Sean Crandall said for pricing purposes it doesn't matter 
whether the delivery point is in as Mid-C or NW delivered. The only reason he 
entered NW delivered is because there was transmission involved. For your 
purposes, Sean said it's fine to change the delivery point to Mid-C (NW 
Delivered) in the confirms, but he didn't want to have it changed in EnPower 
because that would mess with the routing.

Does that make any sense? Let me know if you need it changed in EnPower, and 
I'll talk to Sean.

Thanks,
Kate

#491609.01 This trade has a trade date of 1/8/01. But on BPA's confirm they 
have a trade date of 1/5/01. Could you ask Mike who did the trade which is 
correct?

Thanks,

Kimberly

We will be short in Real Time Position Manager both at NP-15 and SP-15 for 
1/18/01 until Friday morning. It seems that four deals were entered by EES 
under the wrong desk, affecting our position instead of theirs. Following are 
the details of where, when, why and by how much we're out. Read this 
carefully....

SP-15 - Short 1950.64 MW
 Deal #500492 - 67.89 MW short off peak
 Deal #500493 - 87.97 MW short on peak

NP-15 - Short 2883.08 MW
 Deal #500494 - 102.61 MW short off peak
 Deal #500495 - 128.89 MW short on peak

If any one of you has better luck than I have at accessing EES deals in deal 
entry, by all means get rid of these. Or if you happen to speak with Suneet 
Sharma, our good friend who entered the deals in question, by all means tell 
him to do the same.

Thanks,
Kate"

On Saturday, January 13, 2001, an earthquake shook Central America.  The 
earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.6, was centered off of El Salvador's 
central coast.  The death toll is currently at 700, and the damage has been 
estimated at nearly $1 billion, nearly half of the country's annual budget.  

Enron employees are encouraged to donate to relief efforts and to take 
advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your 
donation.  Enron will match, dollar for dollar, every donation that you make, 
up to $15,000 annually per employee.  Listed below are a multitude of 
organizations that are offering aid to the victims of this earthquake.  To 
print a Matching Gift form, please click here and then click on gifts, grants 
and giving.  Please fill out the form and send it with your check to 
3AC-1409.  We will send the money collected, along with a check from Enron 
for the same amount, to each of the organizations.  Please make sure to write 
""El Salvador"" on your check.  

If you have any questions, please contact Misha Siegel via email.  
Thank you, in advance, for your support!

		 Subject: Deal Blotter question

I've run across what seems to be a glitch in Deal Blotter; although it may be 
caused by the default settings in a specific trader's blotter. A few times 
over the last several weeks, our traders at the Short Term Southwest desk 
have entered off peak deals by choosing the ""off"" selection under the ""Hours"" 
heading. But the mask doesn't change to include Sundays and Holidays, and the 
traders then enter another deal to compensate for this. What we've found then 
is that the original deal did in fact include a strip for Sundays and 
Holidays, round-the-clock hours.

My question is - when you enter an off-peak deal in Deal Blotter, does it 
automatically read that as Mon. through Sat. off-peak hours AND Sundays and 
Holidays round-the-clock? Even though the mask does not change to show 
Sundays and Holidays? I'm just wondering if there is an easier way to assure 
that we've entered off-peak deals correctly other than double-checking them 
in Deal Entry.

Please call or e-mail when you get a chance. Again, this could be just a 
matter of incorrect settings in someone's blotter; but I'd like to make sure 
either way.

Thanks for your time,
Kate

There are two deals that do not have contact names.  Can you check with the 
trader and get him to enter names.  The confirmation has to have a contact 
name or it cannot be prepared.

Thanks!

I thought this was important information for you to have. 


RAPE   -   Self Protection 


Hi, girls!  I just finished taking the most amazing self-defense class, 
sponsored by Shandwick, and I wanted to share some really valuable info with 
you before it goes out of my head. 

The guy who taught the class has a female friend who was attacked last year 
in the parking garage at Westport Plaza in St. Louis one night after work 
and taken to an abandoned house and raped.  He started a women's group and 
began teaching these classes soon after.  This guy is a black belt in karate 
and trains twice a year with Steven Segall.  He and the others in this group 
interviewed a bunch of rapists and date rapists in prison on what they look 
for and here's some interesting facts: 

The #1 thing men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle.  They are most 
likely to go after a woman with a ponytail, bun, braid or other hairstyle 
that can easily be grabbed.  They are also likely to go after a woman with 
long hair.  Women with short hair are not common targets. 

The second thing men look for is clothing.  They will look for a woman who's 
clothing is easy to remove quickly.  The #1 outfit they look for is overalls 
because many of them carry scissors around to cut clothing and on overalls 
the straps can be easily cut. 

They also look for women on their cell phone, searching through their purse 
or doing other activities while walking because they are off guard and can 
be easily overpowered. 

The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape a woman is in the 
early morning, between 5 and 8:30 a.m. 

The number one place women are abducted from/attacked at is grocery store 
parking lots.  Number two is office parking lots/garages. 
Number three is public restrooms. 

The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a woman and 
quickly move her to a second location where they don't have to worry about 
getting caught.  Only 2% said they carried weapons because rape carries a 
3-5 year sentence but rape with a weapon is 15-20 years. 

If you put up any kind of a fight at all, they get discouraged because it 
only takes a minute or two for them to realize that going after you isn't 
worth it because it will be time-consuming.  These men said they will not 
pick on women who have umbrellas, or other similar objects that can be used 
from a distance, in their hands.  Keys are not a deterrent because you have 
to get really close to the attacker to use them as a weapon. 

So, the idea is to convince these guys you're not worth it.  Several defense 
mechanisms he taught us are: 

? If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage or 
with you in an  elevator or stairwell, look them in the face and ask them a 
question,  like what time is it, or make general small talk, I can't believe 
it is  so cold out here, we're in for a bad winter. Now you've seen their 
face and could identify them in a lineup, you lose appeal as a target. 

? If someone is coming toward you, hold out your hands in front of you 
and yell Stop or Stay back!  Most of the rapists this man talked to said 
they'd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed that she would not be 
afraid to fight back.  Again, they are looking for an EASY target. 

? If you carry pepper spray (this instructor was a huge advocate of it 
and carries it with him wherever he goes), yelling I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY and 
holding it out will be a deterrent. 

? If someone grabs you, you can't beat him with strength but you can 
by outsmarting him.  If they grab your wrist, pull your wrist back so your 
hand is in waving position (palm facing forward) and twist it toward 
yourself and pull your arm away.  It is hard to hold onto wrist bones that 
are moving in that way.  They stumble toward you and you stumble back, so 
you can use that momentum to bring the same out and backhand them with your 
knuckles in the forehead, nose or teeth. 

? If you are grabbed around the waist from behind, pinch the attacker 
either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or in the upper inner 
thigh.  HARD.  One woman in a class this guy taught told him she used the 
underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her and was so upset she 
broke through the skin and tore out muscle strands - the guy needed 
stitches.  Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand 
it.  It hurts. 

? After the initial hit, always go for the groin.  I know from a 
particularly unfortunate experience that if you slap a guy's   balls (sorry 
to be graphic) it is extremely painful.  You might think that you'll piss 
the guy off and make him want to hurt you more, but the thing these rapists 
told our instructor is that they want a woman who will not cause a lot of 
trouble.  Start causing trouble and he's out of there. 

? When the guy puts his hands up to you, grab his first two fingers 
and bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing down on 
them as possible.   The instructor did it to me without using much pressure 
and I ended up on my knees and both knuckles cracked audibly. 


Of course, the things we always hear still apply.  Always be aware of your 
surroundings, take someone with you if you can and if you see any odd 
behavior, don't dismiss it, go with your instincts.  You may feel a little 
silly at the time, but you'd feel much worse if the guy really was trouble. 

Please forward this to any woman you know, it's simple stuff that could save 
her life.

>> > If you carry pepper spray (this instructor was a huge advocate of it

Carla just changed this deal - must have defaulted to no confirm. We do want 
it to be confirmed, and the deal has been changed to reflect that in Enpower.

Thanks,

I see that both of these deals have counterparty contact names in them now - 
did this get taken care of by somebody else? I'm sorry for the late response 
- I was out sick on Friday. Let me know if there's something else I can do on 
these deals.

There are two deals that do not have contact names.  Can you check with the 
trader and get him to enter names.  The confirmation has to have a contact 
name or it cannot be prepared.

Thanks!

Deals #500465 and #500467

Can you verify with Mark that there were two identical trades done on Jan 8, 
2001

Enron Sells Southern California Edison
100 mws
sp-15
165.00
jan 10-31, 2001

We received an executed confirmation letter from the cp but the deal number 
is not avaliable (the fax machine cut off the deal number)  {just collecting 
all the confirms for the California situation.}

the deal numbers I have located are 492137.01, 492152.01
Just making sure  one is not a duplicate.

Mike Swerzbin is going to contact the trader at SCEM - these are good deals. 
They were originally done on EOL, then changed to direct trades. Once they 
talk, I'll get back to you and let you know if they decided to keep or kill 
the deals.

Sorry I didn't get back to you on this sooner - Mike Swerzbin talked with his 
SCEM trader that day, and they agreed to both of these deals. Just to 
clarify, there are still two EOL trades that net out these direct trades. All 
four are good. Direct trade deal numbers are:

493989
Sell SCEM
Jun-01
198.00
Mid-C

493988
Sell SCEM
Jun-01
195.00
Mid-C

Let me know if SCEM back office still has no record of these. Otherwise, 
they're good to go.

Thanks,
Kate

Joaner Boner -
Well, in my usual slacker fashion, I haven't bought my plane ticket yet - so 
I totally think you should go to Sunriver. I might come visit you there if 
there's room. But an S.F. visit is imminent, I swear. I'll call you soon to 
discuss the alcoholism of your co-worker/boyfriend, as well as the techniques 
for acquiring this sexy body for the new year. Work is consuming my life and 
eating me whole - very chaotic what with hiding all the power from you guys 
and whatnot. Imagine the pressure. Another reason it might not be the best 
time for me to come is that I'm moving on Friday. Amber and Molly and I found 
a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's kickass. But it's sucked 
away all of my money and will probably take over every free moment for the 
next month just to get it set up. If you want, you should stop by for a sleep 
over on your way to Bend. We'll throw a party. And what's up with the wrist 
disease? Are you not taking your calcium or something? I'm convinced that 
these wacky desk jobs are aging us youthful beauties prematurely. At least 
that's the excuse I like to give when I come in to work looking like I just 
bathed in a life-sized ashtray. Call me soon - I'm really curious to find out 
why Brooks is doing the chicken dance EVER let alone in your room in the 
middle of the night. Wheeew!

Happy Sexy Body New Year,
Kate

Subject: Sexy Body for the New Year!!!


Hey Kate -
My subject line is a duplicate of an email I received this morning from some
beauty .com site.  Steve Cross puts me on all of these stupid mailing lists,
so I thought I'd be retarded and put that in my subject line because it's a
stupid subject!

Anyway, how are you doing these days?  I wanted to write and see if you
really got your ticket to come visit over President's Day weekend!  I
totally want you to come down!!!  I'd be so excited.  If you don't, though,
I think I'm going to look into going up to Bend for the weekend to chill in
SunRiver and snowboard a little!  Maybe you could meet me there and stay w/
me at my parents house?  Ash is going up for sure.  If you're coming down
here, that's GREAT!  I'd be SOOO excited.

I'm on complete crack today, if you can't tell.  I have carpal tunnell, too.
Last night I woke up at 2am to Brooks coming home from a drunken night out
and he started doing the chicken dance in my room and almost knocked over my
entire shelf, tv, etc.  Then he started babbling about nothing, passed
straight out and started totally snoring.  So I didn't get back to sleep
until like 4:30 and had to wake up at 6.  I was livid this morning.  I'm
such a bitch, but I need my sleep!  Dammit.

Anyway, write soon!   I miss you!
joan

Please find attached the FINAL Name Change/Merger Notification Report for 
January.  To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select 
""Enable Macros"" and ""Read Only"".   The Jan 01 Changes tab summarizes 
additions to the report since Jan. 15.  
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Feb 1

For more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.

This is the deal that was originally in as not to be confirmed and was 
changed to be confirmed.  Well, I have confirmed twice because it keeps going 
into pending status.   The auditor indictes that carla is going into the deal 
and changing something that causes it to go into pending.  Can you check into 
this and find out what she is changing, if we need to keep sending revised 
confirmations, wha'sssss uuup with this deal?

Thanks! "

Hey again!
Thanks for the quick response!  Damn!  Anyway, I'm bummed that you don't
have your ticket down here for that weekend, but there are PLENTY of other
weekends to come visit.  I'll be here for a while.  We'll plan something
soon.  I think that weekend I may ask for a couple days off and drive up to
Bend.  I wonder if it's cheaper to drive than to fly?  I'll let you know
what I'm doing and maybe you can come down and visit...or I'll be up in
Portland soon anyway.

Sooooo - Your house sounds SO awesome!  That's such a cool neighborhood,
too!  I can't believe you're moving on Friday.  I know what you mean about
things like that sucking all of your money away.  kate, I'm sooo sick of my
job these days.  I'm seriously going to spend my weekend looking for fun
things to do with my life.  I really want to be a massage therapist!  How
fun would that be.  I just want to do something that I like doing and not
something that i have to do because i need money.  I guess I need money
anyway, but it's brutal!

We are too young for this I swear.  If you're ever ready to move somewhere
exotic, let me know.  I'm down to go whenever!  It's funny that you said you
look like a real-life ash tray...I seriously got out of my car this morning
on my way to work and caught a glimpse of myself in the window reflection
and had to stop and drop my jaw.  I seriously look like a puffy-eyed old
hag!  Its highly disturbing.  I'm calling my hairdresser NOW to make an
appointment for a cut and color.  :)  don't i sound so cheesy?  I love it!

So write me soon!  How's amber doing?  Still with that new guy, malcom?  :)
Hows your boy life?  Any prospects?

Write more soon!  I'm bored.

Love ya!
Joan

Joaner Boner -
Well, in my usual slacker fashion, I haven't bought my plane ticket yet -
so I totally think you should go to Sunriver. I might come visit you there
if there's room. But an S.F. visit is imminent, I swear. I'll call you soon
to discuss the alcoholism of your co-worker/boyfriend, as well as the
techniques for acquiring this sexy body for the new year. Work is consuming
my life and eating me whole - very chaotic what with hiding all the power
from you guys and whatnot. Imagine the pressure. Another reason it might
not be the best time for me to come is that I'm moving on Friday. Amber and
Molly and I found a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's
kickass. But it's sucked away all of my money and will probably take over
every free moment for the next month just to get it set up. If you want,
you should stop by for a sleep over on your way to Bend. We'll throw a
party. And what's up with the wrist disease? Are you not taking your
calcium or something? I'm convinced that these wacky desk jobs are aging us
youthful beauties prematurely. At least that's the excuse I like to give
when I come in to work looking like I just bathed in a life-sized ashtray.
Call me soon - I'm really curious to find out why Brooks is doing the
chicken dance EVER let alone in your room in the middle of the night.
Wheeew!

Happy Sexy Body New Year,
Kate

Subject:  Sexy Body for the New Year!!!


Hey Kate -
My subject line is a duplicate of an email I received this morning from
some
beauty .com site.  Steve Cross puts me on all of these stupid mailing
lists,
so I thought I'd be retarded and put that in my subject line because it's a
stupid subject!

Anyway, how are you doing these days?  I wanted to write and see if you
really got your ticket to come visit over President's Day weekend!  I
totally want you to come down!!!  I'd be so excited.  If you don't, though,
I think I'm going to look into going up to Bend for the weekend to chill in
SunRiver and snowboard a little!  Maybe you could meet me there and stay w/
me at my parents house?  Ash is going up for sure.  If you're coming down
here, that's GREAT!  I'd be SOOO excited.

I'm on complete crack today, if you can't tell.  I have carpal tunnell,
too.
Last night I woke up at 2am to Brooks coming home from a drunken night out
and he started doing the chicken dance in my room and almost knocked over
my
entire shelf, tv, etc.  Then he started babbling about nothing, passed
straight out and started totally snoring.  So I didn't get back to sleep
until like 4:30 and had to wake up at 6.  I was livid this morning.  I'm
such a bitch, but I need my sleep!  Dammit.

Anyway, write soon!   I miss you!
joan

Following are the prices for fixed sales between EPMI Short Term California 
and EES for 1/25. Chris Mallory has turned this task over to me, and I'm 
working from my own spreadsheet, which I inadvertently deleted this morning. 
Please let me know if you'd like a copy of the spreadsheet as well as the 
prices each morning, or if the prices are sufficient. 

NP-15
 On Peak - $273.50
 Off Peak - $204.43

SP-15
 On Peak - $216.53
 Off Peak - $189.35

Thanks,

Sorry for the delay - it's taken me a while to track down the answer to this, 
because Chris Foster, the trader on this deal, is still unclear as to the 
answer. Basically, the deal keeps getting cut by the Cal-ISO, which is why 
Carla goes in and changes the volumes sometimes. But Chris thinks that in the 
end we might not be cutting the deal financially, just physically on a 
day-by-day basis. Given that, we only need the first, original confirm sent 
out - if revised confirms have been sent, let's go ahead and send them the 
original one and leave it at that. 

Chris Foster said he would get back with me this afternoon - he's meeting 
with Real Time and Schedulers right now to sort out this issue.  I apologize 
that this wasn't more clear before. Should I add a note in the comments 
section of this deal to clarify? Or should I just check the deal back to ""no 
confirm""? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

This is the deal that was originally in as not to be confirmed and was 
changed to be confirmed.  Well, I have confirmed twice because it keeps going 
into pending status.   The auditor indictes that carla is going into the deal 
and changing something that causes it to go into pending.  Can you check into 
this and find out what she is changing, if we need to keep sending revised 
confirmations, wha'sssss uuup with this deal?

Could you fax over the original confirm so Chris can look it over and make 
sure we won't need additional language or confirms sent? I just want to make 
sure he's aware of everything that's going on and backs up my comment in the 
deal.

This is the original confirmation letter we sent out.



Unfortunately, before I found out anything about all this, I sent out a 
revised confirmation when the deal was changed and went into a pending 
status.  This is the revised confirmation letter that went out.



These are the only two that have been sent to the counterparty.  I have put a

Chris looked these over and we agreed to just re-send the original 
confirmation letter, because the ISO may make cuts again - in fact, the 
revised confirm is no longer correct. I put a comment in the deal instructing 
no revised confirms to be sent, per Chris Foster.

Also, Chris noticed that the counterparty contact name in the letters was 
incorrect. The new contact at ARCO is Alicia Izarraraz. Her number is (562) 
499-3234. I hope this helps.

Thanks,
Kate

Hey dork!

Just wondering how it's going over there in P-town.  I am doing well.  I
applied for a job here at Outward Bound, so I may be staying here for
awhile.  I met a super-cute guy who I will have to tell you all about - I
think this may actually become a normal relationship or something of the
like.  Michelle and I are doing well, although her decorating style bothers
me a little.  First of all, she's obsessed with candles.  Our living room
looks like the parlor at a whorehouse.  Are you still coming to visit?  I
hope so!

Also, can you send me Monica's phone number if you think of it?  I feel
settled in enough now to call her.  Tell me what's up with you!  Any big guy
stories?  Moved yet?  Let's chat.  Love, Anna"

Oh wow - don't tell me you're a NUGGETS fan now! That is so wrong. I can't 
write for long just now because the ever-flourishing energy crisis is keeping 
us all very busy here at The Big Ron, as I so affectionately call it. Right 
now I'm on the cusp of either becoming a raging workaholic or cashing in my 
chips to become a professional beach bum. I know I already tried that and 
thought it wasn't for me, but trust me, one more month of this crap Portland 
weather and I'll ship myself right over to the Caribbean. And yes, I'm 
definitely coming to visit. It won't be for a couple months because this 
house move is going to set me back a bit. Let's just say I'm hoping I'll be 
so poor I'll be forced to lose weight in February. But I'm really excited - 
we move in on Friday - and the house is so cute. You have to at least come 
home to visit sometime so you can see it. I might even bring Kitty over, but 
Molly vehemently opposed the idea, and you know how Kitty doesn't like to be 
unsettled once she's staked her territory. (Big Kitty lives in daily fear.) 
Anyway, call me soon - you can call collect, or call and yelp into the phone 
and hang up - I'll know it's you and call back.

I'm stoked you're liking Denver - I really have to experience this ""Rocky 
Mountain High"" for myself. Please don't turn into a stoner ski bum and lose 
all fashion sense to the point of mistaking Patagonia and Tevas for catwalk 
wear. Hey, and you need to tell me more about this ""normal"" guy. You've got 
to watch out for those, you know - that's how the truly psycho ones disguise 
themselves. No, don't listen to me - I'll be bitter and single till I'm so 
old I have to get cats and live out my life like the crazy woman that I am. 
And this obsession with candles? You know you could head that off by setting 
up hundreds and hundreds of smoke alarms all over the house, or tell her that 
you just saw a special on 20/20 about houses burning down via over-decoration 
with candles. 

Hey - do you have a freaking job there? That's the only thing I haven't heard 
about. You must like it or you wouldn't have applied to stay, but I need 
DETAILS, I need DIRT. Call me soon, we'll dish.

Love,
Kate

I'm working on a phone list for some of the people I work with in the Houston 
office - kind of a modified version of ours. But I just noticed that my 
information on the floor card has changed since the last printing. Debra said 
I should forward the information on to you for use in the next floor card. 
Here it is:

Ext. 7486
Cell phone 819-2181

And actually, my home phone will change too at the end of this week. I'll 
send that along when I get it. I know this isn't pressing information, but I 
figured I'd let you know before I forgot.

Thanks,

She's excited to hear from you.

Here's what I threw together this afternoon. Let me know if there are any 
other people in particular you'd like added to the list. Also let me know if 
you try any of these extensions and they happen to be wrong (we have a hard 
time keeping up with changing numbers too!). Forward this on to anyone you 
feel it might be useful to; but please let them know to call me first and 
foremost, since I'll probably be the most receptive on the phone. 

Hope you had a safe trip back home. Again, it was great to meet you and Kim.

Talk to you soon,
Kate

There were quite a few changes made yesterday.  Please see the attached 
notification report for the summary and detail.

IT TAGG - Please note that short name changes will come from the Jan 2001 
report AND Feb 2001 report.  I will begin making the changes tomorrow at 10:a 
as usual.

The font and page size for this report has been reduced but feel free to 
change the page set up as needed.  The reason the report is set up on A4 
paper is that A4 prints automatically anywhere in the world.  Legal paper 
isn't readily available everywhere, so this format is the best compromise.

Kate,

If you would you, please start to draft a letter to the vendors for the 
solicitation of the raffle gifts?  We will probably need two letters, one to 
thank the vendor for their participation last year (I have the list of 
donated items) and another for new vendors that we will be soliciting.  

Here are a few points we need to make:

Thanks for particpating last year
Name the charity(s), a worthy cause type thing
State they are a current vendor in our system
The vendor name will be announced at the party, good advertising
Attach the article from last year

There may be more, but that is what comes to mind right now.  Since we will 
be using the merge feature we can insert the name of the vendor in the body 
of the letter.

Thanks!

Mollie"

Ernest - I was just wondering if I'll start getting e-mails reporting the 
NP-15 and SP-15 indices. Are these reports generated? If so, who should I 
contact to get them? Thanks for all your help in this matter.

These two deals are entered with a special counterparty name that looks like 
it may have been set up for some special deal.  There is another counterparty 
name out there that looks just the same only without the very last series of 
letters.  I will check here and see if anyone knows the difference.  There is 
a note in the Global System that says Heather Dunton had this CP set up.  If 
you could check with her and see if it should be used for these deals or if 
the other CP should be used.

Thanks!"

Hey, I'm right there with ya, sister. As far as feeling out of place in a new 
city, it's totally normal. That's how I felt about Maui the entire time I was 
there. I kept thinking I was just picky, weird, anti-social or otherwise 
mentally unstable because I just didn't feel right there. I kept ""sticking it 
out another month"" because I thought, eventually, the majestic wonders and 
buff tanned men would win me over and I would spend the rest of my days 
frolicking along the white sand, swinging from jungle branches and blissfully 
speaking pidgin. But it just never clicked. I don't really know why; all I 
can surmise is that the lure of familiarity and home is much stronger than we 
know, or would like to know.

It's definitely good to get out of your comfort zone and experience something 
new every once in awhile (Lord knows that's my modus operandus), but I think 
you'll know if Denver is really ""your kind of town."" In the meantime, just 
take it for what it is - a fun place to be a young, swingin' single. It'll 
take more than a month to adjust and meet people; and even then you might not 
meet the kind of people you're ultimately looking for. Sorry to sound so 
pessimistic - I'm really not - maybe I'll just employ my favorite analogy to 
explain: when you walk into Mimi & Lena, or Fred Segal, or even Nordstrom, 
and you start perusing the racks, how long does it take you to decide whether 
or not you like a shirt or a pair of boots or something? A minute. Seconds, 
maybe. But you don't have to camp out in the store for several hours or days, 
just hanging out with your skirt of choice, to decide if you want to take it 
home with you. Granted, this is a mere item of clothing as compared with a 
habitat, but you get the picture.

Which leads me to my next point - men. Same goes for them. If there are 
characteristics about this guy you find make your skin crawl, it doesn't 
matter if he's Tom Cruise with the mind of Einstein and the social graces 
of....well...some guy with social graces, IT WILL NOT WORK! Run - don't walk 
- away from a situation like this. I have just one word to describe to you 
what can happen with guys like this - BRIAN. He was sooo sweet, soooo smart, 
soooo in love with me, and even tolerable to look at. But soon the walls came 
crumbling down and the level of his cheesiness, which was mild to begin with, 
escalated as he felt me pulling away. It all ended in that debacle we know as 
""Brian's Trip to Portland."" It was hauntingly uncomfortable, and all I can 
tell you is, nobody could have warned me. I was blinded by something akin to 
love, but much more akin to an ego-trip, which was what I was on everyday 
with him because he pretty much thought I was God's gift and made sure I knew 
it.....constantly. 

Listen, I have to go, and I've said my piece for the day. I'll try and give 
you a call tonight and we can theorize further on the subject. When you 
really get down to it, you're doing great - exactly what anyone and everyone 
at your age, and mine, is doing - which is basically wondering what the hell 
to do with the rest of our lives. And meanwhile ""the rest of our lives"" are 
slipping past unnoticed. Just remember the John Lennonn quote, ""Life is what 
happens when you're busy making other plans."" Now THERE's a real man. Whoa.

Love,
Kate"

I checked with Heather, and it turns out this second NCPA counterparty 
shortname was set up to distinguish between two different SC numbers. But 
it's only for internal use - both counterparty names have the same billing 
information, etc. So Heather said the deals are fine as they are. I'm going 
to find out more about this after the afternoon rush dies down - just so 
we'll know for the future when to use which shortname.

These two deals are entered with a special counterparty name that looks like 
it may have been set up for some special deal.  There is another counterparty

a note in the Global System that says Heather Dunton had this CP set up.  If 
you could check with her and see if it should be used for these deals or if 
the other CP should be used.

See attached summary for some excellent FERC decisions thanks to regulatory 
affairs in Houston and D.C.  Given that FERC appears to be applying some of 
these decisions to all utilities in these regions, I would assume we could 
argue that the FERC requirements should apply in the West too.

Subject: FERC Staff Investigations on Midwest and Southeast Bulk Power Systems


On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power 
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a 
Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff 
(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of 
information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed 
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller 
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no 
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically 
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, 
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the 
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement 
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by 
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other 
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to 
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of 
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff 
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of 
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro 
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply 
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and 
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions 
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports 
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well 
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such 
standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that 
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that 
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could 
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics 
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a 
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the 
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a 
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the 
commodity and services.  

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, 
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission 
Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such, 
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service 
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff 
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information 
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated 
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack 
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants 
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an 
""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with 
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were 
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and 
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even 
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The 
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are 
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose 
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission 
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open 
Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to 
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission 
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, 
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market 
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an 
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In 
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased 
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one 
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for 
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe 
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction 
increased in the Midwest.  

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information 
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for 
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission 
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and 
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and 
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, 
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs 
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market 
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully 
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, 
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that 
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed 
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the 
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching 
the Rules for Fun and Profit."")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, 
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided 
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper 
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all 
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and 
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO 
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security 
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region 
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The 
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit 
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is 
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of 
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially 
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas 
of non-compliance.  

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, 
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow 
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information 
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under 
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a 
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption 
and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could 
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the 
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, 
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits 
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have 
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have 
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide 
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the 
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the 
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on ""passively"" 
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory 
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, 
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.


Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (""VIU"") model has 
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the 
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs 
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due 
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, 
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and 
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the 
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development 
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and 
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted 
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the 
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have 
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to 
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform 
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant 
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this 
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than 
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were 
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better 
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased 
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to 
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to 
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE 
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence 
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be 
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence 
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes 
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how 
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns 
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation 
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In 
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff 
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of 
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access 
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack 
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In 
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission 
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to 
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied 
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the 
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting 
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a 
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without 
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication 
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises 
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive 
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by 
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC 
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do 
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs 
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In 
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated 
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the 
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, 
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same 
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision 
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a 
""problem area"" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission 
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law 
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of 
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong 
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In 
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists 
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the 
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park 
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the 
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including 
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange 
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to 
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an 
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not 
displayed in error.  It is ""up to individual Managers discretion.""  ((FRCC 
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine 
competition.

I checked in Jeff's trade log - he just stepped into a meeting - and 504970 
had been crossed out to show 50 MW. But 505118 only has 25 MW. Does this 
sound correct? I'm a little confused about what you're asking - should the 
deals match at 50 MW on peak? Or is one 25 and one 50?

If it doesn't make any difference, I will change these to the other CP name.  
This one is not attached to templates and would need some database changes to 
prepare a confirmation under this name.  If this is not ok, let me know.

I checked with Heather, and it turns out this second NCPA counterparty 
shortname was set up to distinguish between two different SC numbers. But 
it's only for internal use - both counterparty names have the same billing 
information, etc. So Heather said the deals are fine as they are. I'm going 
to find out more about this after the afternoon rush dies down - just so 
we'll know for the future when to use which shortname.

These two deals are entered with a special counterparty name that looks like 
it may have been set up for some special deal.  There is another counterparty 
name out there that looks just the same only without the very last series of 
letters.  I will check here and see if anyone knows the difference.  There is 
a note in the Global System that says Heather Dunton had this CP set up.  If 
you could check with her and see if it should be used for these deals or if 
the other CP should be used.

Thanks!

That sounds fine - in fact, I think in this case that Sean Crandall just hit 
the wrong counterparty name. Since this looks like it might be a problem for 
you guys in creating confirms, I'll let the traders know to be sure of which 
NCPA shortname they're choosing.

I just want to clarify something, because we were here until about 9 p.m. 
last night trying to flatten our position, and just figured out this morning 
that we were off due to the Williams deal that I changed yesterday evening. 
Apparently Jeff Richter didn't do any deals with Williams for 50 MW through 
APB, but he did do one for 50 MW with Prebon. So I'm wondering why APB was 
checking out like this? If possible, I'd like to avoid this in the future. 
Let me know if you can find anything out from APB.

Thanks,
Kate

Pinnacle West is still working on moving all its operations from Arizona 
Public Service Co. to Pinnacle. In the meantime, all TRANSMISSION deals 
should still be made using the counterparty name ""Arizona Public Service 
Company."" All other deals are made with ""Pinnacle"" itself. This should change 
sometime in the next month, according to the confirmation group in Houston. 
Let me know if you have any questions.

I have changed the Index Multiplier for all of the days in January.  The days 
that were not at a mulitplier of 1.05 have been changed to that amount. Also, 
there was no deal in for 1/9, and 2 identical deals for 1/10.  I modified one 
of the 1/10 days to the 1/9 amount.

I will begin autoscheduling these shortly so the price will show.

Happy Monday - or whenever it is that you are blessed with the receipt of 
this message. A funny thing happened to me on my way to upload the PX deals 
on Friday. I went to process the data and was rudely stopped by an error 
message stating the following:

Error establishing lock on Trader ID and Trader Date: Trader Already Locked 
(_InboxAC11AC92.913Aoc376A1622250.4) 

Interesting, isn't it? So I entered the PX deals manually and went along my

This sequence of e-mails is a little confusing, so I highlighted the parts 
you probably want to focus on in red. Like I said, I've been staring at these 
deals for too many hours now to see clearly what went wrong. As far as I can 
tell, either APB or Jeff Richter was checking out wrong. Now I just want to 
get to the bottom of it! Aaaaaaaa!

Subject: Re: apb checkout  

I just want to clarify something, because we were here until about 9 p.m. 
last night trying to flatten our position, and just figured out this morning 
that we were off due to the Williams deal that I changed yesterday evening. 
Apparently Jeff Richter didn't do any deals with Williams for 50 MW through 
APB, but he did do one for 50 MW with Prebon. So I'm wondering why APB was 
checking out like this? If possible, I'd like to avoid this in the future. 
Let me know if you can find anything out from APB.

Thanks,
Kate

Thanks for your concern - that's so sweet of you. I think it's a combination 
of too many hours staring at a computer and too few hours sleeping - mixed in 
with a good dose of mid-winter blues. I'm sure a day on the slopes will do me 
good.

Thanks,

Judy at EES has different totals for these two deals.  For #498865 at NP15, 
she has total volume of 13,319.  For #497869 at SP15 she has a total volume 
of 8516.6.  Do you know of any reason that these total volumes would be 
different than what EES is showing?

Thanks!"

Broker is right - deal has been changed.

By the way, I checked out audit viewer on deal 505066, and it showed that I 
had changed the deal from Amerex to APB yesterday afternoon. It didn't show 
any other changed after that - so I've put a call into Duong Luu to figure 
out why the change didn't save, or why it defaulted back. Just FYI.

Dear PMA Reader:

We've arranged with the publisher of the weekly newsletter, The Desk, to 
redistribute a copy of it's current Special Topic Issue, free to PMA 
subscribers. This week, The Desk goes beyond the realm of weather-based or 
other exotic derivatives and digs deep into the possibility of a market for 
solar (or space) weather derivatives. And more specifically, how they might 
be used in the power business. It's a fascinating topic and one that should 
be on everybody's radar screen. Enjoy the free issue.


Regards,
The Staff of the PMA

          POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY

                March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas

http://www.pmaconference.com/0103Agenda.pdf

EVERY CRISIS HOLDS OPPORTUNITIES:

Power shortages boost merchant power, distributed generation, peak shaving, 
real-time pricing and energy management. Some states are delaying their 
retail choice programs, but others are moving ahead, confident that they have 
benefited from the lessons learned by the pioneering jurisdictions. Electric 
price volatility drives growth in the risk management business.

Credit and cash flow are squeezed, but financial products provide solutions. 
Gas price volatility is a reminder-- coal was and remains the great source of 
energy for our country. Dot-coms seem to have been exposed as just ordinary 
businesses-- but online trading in energy is the single most robust area for 
transactions on the net. The IPO market hasn?t been kind to technology 
stocks-- but it likes energy issues. Broadband trading has been slow to take 
off, but powerline telecom may solve the real problem-- access to ""the last 
mile"".

Please join us at the Power Marketing Association?s annual spring meeting, 
""POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY"" March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas, for 
presentations on these topics and more!

Warmest Regards,

I guess Paul Choi spoke with Melissa Murphy when she was up here and told her 
the language looked fine on this confirmation. He reiterated that, and I'll 
fax the initialed copy back to you.

I know this is way before your time, but ------
Our contact at EES is calling and asking for a copy of the confirmation for 
this deal.  We never prepared one because it was coded not to be confimed.  
Can you check with the trader and see if anyone up there remembers if this 
was confirmed as part of something else or why it was marked not to be 
confirmed or anything else about it.

Thanks!"

Kate,
I am in the confirmation group with EES and try to tie out our confirmtions 
with the EPMI list I receive from Kim Hundle (EPMI), on a weekly basis.  This 
file would be great help with this process.  Is there any way you could send 
this to me as well? This would help me determine who the problem is with.  I 
would appreciate it.

I can certainly send you this file each day - I hope it can be of some help. 
All the deals it lists are with EPMI Short Term California, which is myself 
or Jeff Richter; so I'm not sure how helpful it will be in determining which 
desk or counterparty you have discrepancies with. While we're on the subject 
of sharing files, though, I had spoken with the confirmation group in Houston 
about the deal file you send them each day. They suggested I ask to be added 
to the list so I can better assist their group in finding discrepancies in 
EPMI-EES deals. If that's okay with you, I would appreciate receiving it.

In the meantime, I'll copy you on the EES sale prices starting tomorrow.

Thanks,
Kate

Sorry for the slow reaction time - this is the contact information Greg Wolfe 
gave me, and he Sean Crandall confirmed that (he was in the midst of putting 
a Conoco deal in the system). As for why it was taken out of the GCP system, 
I have no idea. If you know of anyone around here who would have called for 
that to be de-activated, let me know. Otherwise, our traders still know Jack 
Wells as the contact. Hope that helps.

hi kate,
these sean crandall deals need contacts.  can you please get a good contact 
name (and phone #) and i will put in a gcp request to have it added to the 
drop down list in deal entry.
i'm too lazy to press the shift key lately, sorry -no caps.
thanks for your help!

Are these two deals part of the original Conoco deal # 347356 that they are 
extending or something different?  We need to know because we have to add 
something in the confirmation if they are extensions of the original deal.  
Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?

Jack Wells is the contact for both - I've added his name to deal #507417. 
According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal 
was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just 
buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only 
connection. Let me know if you need more of an explanation from the traders, 
but our take is that these deals are separate.

Thanks,
Kate

          POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY

                March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas

http://www.pmaconference.com/0103Agenda.pdf

EVERY CRISIS HOLDS OPPORTUNITIES:

Power shortages boost merchant power, distributed generation, peak shaving, 
real-time pricing and energy management. Some states are delaying their 
retail choice programs, but others are moving ahead, confident that they have 
benefited from the lessons learned by the pioneering jurisdictions. Electric 
price volatility drives growth in the risk management business.

Credit and cash flow are squeezed, but financial products provide solutions. 
Gas price volatility is a reminder-- coal was and remains the great source of 
energy for our country. Dot-coms seem to have been exposed as just ordinary 
businesses-- but online trading in energy is the single most robust area for 
transactions on the net. The IPO market hasn?t been kind to technology 
stocks-- but it likes energy issues. Broadband trading has been slow to take 
off, but powerline telecom may solve the real problem-- access to ""the last 
mile"".

Please join us at the Power Marketing Association?s annual spring meeting, 
""POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY"" March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas, for 
presentations on these topics and more!

Warmest Regards,

Sorry, I didn't see these deals when I sent the first email.  Kimberly Hundl 
had sent you a note about the contact.  Are these deals like the other two 
deals, and should be confirmed totally separately from the deal #347356.  
Sorry to be so difficult, but we get into trouble everytime we confirm a 
Conoco deal because of the special language that needs to be included on 
deals that are part of #347356, and we never get any notes that tell us 
whether or not it is part of the extension of the original deal.

Thanks!

Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?

Thanks!

Greater Yellowstone Ski Traverse

Update for Leg 1: South Pass to Cora

By Win Goodbody

The weather gods must have been in a good mood.  Maybe they had a good New
Year=01,s party.  On previous trips to the Wind River Range I had grown
accustomed to spending large blocks of time in the tent, waiting for storm
after storm to subside.  If one of every two days was suitable for venturin=
g
outside, I considered it a bit of luck.  But this time was different.  In
the middle of January we enjoyed an amazing 18 consecutive days of good
weather for our 130 mile ski traverse of the Wind River Range.

The drive south toward Lander, WY revealed an alarming lack of snow, both i=
n
the mountains and lower down where we hoped to start.  This has not been a
good winter so far in the Yellowstone region, and we wondered what
conditions would be like in the Wind Rivers.  Luckily, with the final gain
in elevation as we neared the Continental Divide and South Pass, enough
coverage materialized for us to ski away from the car.  We had day packs an=
d
70 pound sleds.

Starting out with an approach of several days across lowlands was an
interesting way to ease into the trip.  Instead of driving right up to the
base of the mountains, we had to work a little bit to get there.  Even
though we were on open range with scattered trees, this was some of the
trickiest route finding we would encounter anywhere on the route.
Steep-sided drainages and mini-gorges suddenly appeared in the otherwise
mildly rolling terrain, requiring detours and delays.

For a few days we thrashed across the prairie landscape, moving toward
distant peaks that didn=01,t seem to be getting much closer.  The 10 or 12
inches of snow on the ground were completely rotten, and our movement was
half skiing, half snowshoeing.  Each step sank to the ground, and ski tips
snagged in exposed sage brush.  When we came upon a perfectly groomed but
empty Continental Divide Snowmobile trail, we took advantage of it to
quickly reach the Little Sandy drainage, our entrance to the mountains.

We were by now settling into our routines: relearning winter camping skills=
,
dividing repetitive tasks, and adjusting to the cold.  With only about 11
hours of daylight, our schedule was remarkably busy.  It was a struggle to
get moving by 10 each morning even though we got up at 7.  Lunchtime arrive=
d
immediately.  Just as quickly the sun dipped behind a peak and it was time
to make camp.  After eating dinner we scurried into our down bags for a 12
hour sleep.  The days flew by, and we focused on putting miles beneath the
sleds while the good weather lasted, not knowing it would last indefinitely=
.
  We were comfortable, but every waking moment was occupied and there was n=
o
time for relaxing.  We seemed to be always on the move.

The price to be paid for clear sunny days is clear cold nights, and about a
week into the range, when we were up above 10,000 feet nearly all the time,
we had our first taste of real cold.  It was the night we camped in the
Cirque of the Towers, and we were in our floorless cook tent.  We had
excavated a basement a few feet down to the ice of Lonesome Lake.  Except
for the entranceway, all the sides of the tent were flush with the snow
surface, and with both stoves going it was pleasantly warm inside.

After dinner as we sat reading I sensed some sort of change.  Then I knew
what it was.  Searing cold air was draining into the tent and spilling
across the floor like a poisonous gas.  You could feel it cool your face,
try to get inside your clothes, turn your water bottle into a frozen brick.
I imagined my candle snuffing out, refusing to burn at such an obscene
temperature.  I went outside to check my key chain thermometer under a sky
of blazing stars.  The cheap gadget was maxed out.  It was at least =01)25 =
F.
The cold was like a deafening air raid siren.  There was no escaping it.

That same cold was to stay with us most nights and mornings for the next 8
or 9 days.  In the evening before going to bed I would check the
thermometer.  All the red fluid was huddled in the ball at the bottom, too
scared to try for a run up toward the numbers.  It was the same each
morning.  The daily temperature swings were tremendous.  We would go from
=01)25 F (or lower) to 20 F in a matter of hours in the morning.  The warm
midday sun was always a relief, but it didn=01,t last.  Our joy at being ab=
le
to ski along in just a shirt was tempered by the knowledge we would soon be
wearing every layer of clothing we possessed.  In the evenings, as soon as
the sun went down the temperature headed south with merciless speed.

Deep cold is to the sense of touch what the Grand Teton or Old Faithful or =
a
radiant sunrise are to the sense of sight.  It is truly an amazing natural
phenomenon to be reckoned with.  We marveled at it again and again, this
thing you cannot see or hear or smell.  It is both beautiful and horrifying=
,
an undeniably authentic experience that leaves an imprint on your memory,
but with luck not on your toes or fingers.  It might be hard to explain why
it is a fascinating spectacle to behold, but there is no denying that it is=
.
  As the days went by, we became students of this strange, invisible force.
But of course we still got cold every day.

Our good weather continued, and we knocked off high pass after high pass on
our voyage north.  Some days we even crossed two passes and multiple
drainages.  For mid winter, we were really moving fast.  With so little sno=
w
on the ground, at least we were not delayed by having to worry about
avalanches.  Without consciously deciding to do so, we were in fact
traveling harder during the day, stopping later each night, and spending
less time readying a good camp.  More and more we were going flat out all
day and then just collapsing at night to wake the next morning and do it
again.

Our traverse was imperceptibly developing all the classic symptoms of what =
I
have come to know as a death march.  Though a death march typically occurs
at the end of a tour when the desire to exit is so strong it can make you g=
o
all day or all night without thinking of the consequences, a death march ca=
n
also occur at any time during a trip.  For example, if you discover you
haven=01,t brought enough food you might need to go full bore for days on e=
nd.
Or maybe you hear a storm is coming and decide to turn on the after burner
to reach a safe haven.  Probably the defining characteristic of a death
march is that you never intend to get into one to begin with.  But there
comes a point when, like an investigator, you step back for a minute,
examine the evidence of your daily life, and it suddenly dawns on you that =
a
death march is in full swing and you are powerless to stop it.  The horror!
The horror!

At the outset of the leg, we were putting in good days because we wanted to
get up into the high peaks where the real trip would begin.  Once we were
there, we wanted to put in some good days while the weather lasted, to make
some progress before the inevitable endless blizzard that would surely
descend.  After we had been going about 10 days and did some math based on
the miles we had covered and what still lay ahead, we realized that we woul=
d
not have time to exit as we had originally planned.  In fact even after
cutting off some substantial passes and distance, it was still going to be
all we could do to make it out in the time allotted.  So we decided to put
in more good days.   We always had a reason for not resting, for going hard
day after day.  One night while thawing my foot out over the stove, I
realized we were not going to have a single rest day.  We were going for it=
.
  We had gotten sucked in.  We were on a death march.

The long days alone would have been manageable, but we had a growing proble=
m
that was interfering with our ability to recover and rest each night.  Our
sleeping bags were filling with ice, which impaired their ability to loft
and hence insulate us.  This is a common problem in extreme cold.  As you
sleep, you radiate moisture and heat.  The moisture passes through your
sleeping bag and escapes into the air.

When it is very cold, however, the temperature difference between the air
inside your bag and the air outside is too great for moisture to pass
through the bag=01,s outer skin.  As moisture goes to move that last millim=
eter
from the comfortable 70 F temperature inside the bag to the outside air, it
gets walloped with a 100 degree temperature difference (let=01,s say it=01,=
s =01)30 F
out).  Instead of escaping, the moisture freezes on the inside of the bag=
=01,s
outer shell.  This problem seems to be worse with high tech laminate
materials designed to impede the flow of moisture (usually rain) into the
bag from the outside.

This is a cumulative condition and gets worse each day as another night=01,=
s
moisture is added to what is already frozen in the bag.  Unless the bag is
thawed out and dried, there is no solution, and you will reach a point wher=
e
all insulating qualities have been lost and you are better of just sleeping
on your insulated pad in your clothes.  We had already taken to wearing mos=
t
of our clothes inside our sleeping bags, and this just barely worked.
Still, more and more of each night was spent tossing and desperately
huddling into some new contorted position in an attempt to avoid feeling th=
e
hideous cold of yet another clear night.

As light at the end of the tunnel appeared, our daytime efforts reached a
fever pitch.  Day 12, 8.5 miles.  Day 13, 9 miles.  Day 14, 7 miles.  Day
15, 9.5 miles.  And these were by no means easy flat miles.  They were
trailbreaking miles up and down passes, all above 10,000 feet.  Reaching th=
e
entrance to Titcomb Basin, we veered northwest toward the origin of the
Green River at Peak Lake.  Originally we had planned to go north from
Titcomb past Gannett Peak as far as Downs Mountain, the last peak above
13,000 feet in the Winds, before falling off to the west down Roaring Fork,
eventually reaching the Green River drainage.  But because of time, low
snow, and a desire to live we had altered our course to head directly down
the Green.

Going over the top at Cube Rock Pass, we caught a glimpse thousands of feet
down the Green River drainage.  The end was near but we were still looking
at another two days to get to Green River Lakes campground, where we hoped
to solicit a snowmobile ride for the remaining 20 miles to our car in Cora.
The view down the upper Green as it plummets from near Peak Lake is
shocking.  We silently gazed 10 miles down a classic, deeply carved, thickl=
y
forested valley wedged between impassable rocks walls.  Toward their
northern end the Winds turn into a series of high, broad plateaus above
11,000 feet, and the chief difficulty exiting is finding some way down.
Many of the drainages that cut this plateau are gorges, sheer cliffs, or
other features unfriendly to ski tourers with sleds.  As we had changed our
exit route, we had not gone all the way north to the real plateaus.  But
even here getting down was going to take some doing.

Day 16 was the first time we allowed that most cruel of thoughts to enter
our minds: perhaps this was the day we would get out.  Eating pizza in
Jackson tonight?  Sleeping indoors, not encased in an ice tomb?  No more
holding frozen body parts over an open flame?  Perhaps.  We slowly suffered
up Vista Pass, where the summer trail leaves the Green River for about 8
miles and descends a neighboring creek.  I had got into the habit over the
last few days of proclaiming that some feature or other was =01&really goin=
g to
be the last uphill=018.  Usually as soon as this sentence hit the air we wo=
uld
round a corner to glimpse another uphill ahead.  But I was undeterred by
past failed prophecies and once again suggested to Joe that =01&this is it=
=018.
He said nothing.

Whereas early in the trip I felt strong and had been happy to break trail
for hours at a time, the death march and lack of sleep had taken their toll
and the wheels were coming off.  I had no enthusiasm for leading.  I felt
like the walking dead and just wanted to follow, my eyes locked on a track
in front of me, legs trudging on automatic pilot.  But as I grew weaker, Jo=
e
became unstoppable.  He was increasingly pulling the boat over the final
days, and I was happy to let him. Especially going downhill though tricky,
steep sections he raced far ahead.  Perhaps it was a desire to escape my
singing that drove him forward.  I sang many pop songs, past and present,
but refused to sing Neil Diamond, Joe=01,s favorite artiste.  As this dispu=
ted
issue festered, Joe seemed eager to put more and more distance between the
two of us.

As it turns out, Vista Pass really was the last uphill, and now it was time
to go down.  After a few hours of easy traversing, we lost the trail and
decided to descend a steeply falling stream choked with enormous boulders.
Seemed like a good idea at the time I guess.  Joe was in front, skiing
straight downstream and stopping only for the most absurd drops.  He was
soon out of sight.  Following his track was a bit of an eye opener.  It fel=
t
like the cartoon where you come upon a set of ski tracks that split around =
a
tree.  In leather boots and telemark bindings with a large sled, Joe was
sticking 4 and 5 foot drops.  I stared in disbelief at the smooth sled trac=
k
that went over the top of a boulder, then straight down for a few feet, the=
n
continued on.  I had more solid AT gear, but there was no way I was doing
that.  I was sure I=01,d break a ski.

Later, Joe confided that the way he=01,d been able to descend these boulder=
s
was to surf down sloughs of snow.  As he went over the tops of rocks, snow
would slide off and cushion his descent and landing.  But as the second guy
down the course, I enjoyed none of this extra padding.  It was all gone.
Instead of using the Hartney straightline method, I tried side stepping dow=
n
from the top of the boulder, turning my skis perpendicular to the fall line
that my sled wanted so desperately to follow at great speed.

It didn=01,t work too well.  Shorn of most of their snow, the boulders, it
turned out, were covered with glare ice.  Again and again I would be just
about to take the final step down when my skis would slip.  I fell over my
skis downhill, face-planting in the stream bed.  The sled then crashed on
top of me.  I struggled to release skis and waist belts.  Once I had to get
out my shovel and dig to find a pole that went astray in a particularly
juicy fall.  To make matters worse, I was getting wet from these repeated
snow baths.

Some time during this carefree afternoon I looked down and noticed that
where the solid metal tow bars of my sled connected to the plastic hull
there was a grave problem.  The connection points were tearing away from th=
e=20
body and threatened to come off altogether.  When and if that happened, I
would be reduced to fashioning a rope and stick contraption to bind the sle=
d
to my body.  I shuddered to think what such a caveman era contraption might
do to our progress and tried to face plant less often on the rest of my
stream run.

At last the track I was following left the creek, and I thrashed down into
dense woods where I found Joe looking at the map and having a snack.  It
looked like he=01,d been there for quite a while.  I waited for some sign f=
rom
him that maybe the creek had been kind of tough.  Nothing.  I acted
nonchalant:  =01&That was fun.=018  =01&Yeah,=018 Joe said.  =01&I broke my=
 sled it looks
like,=018 I countered.  =01&Oh really?=018  Finally, I had to ask.  =01&Did=
 you fall at
all back there?=018  =01&What?=018  He was looking at the map.  =01&Oh, no.=
  I did have
to slow down at one point though.=018  Here I=01,d spent the last hour egg
beatering down the creek like someone just introduced to skis.  And Joe had
to slow down once.  The poor kid.

Needless to say, we didn=01,t make it out that day.  But we did make it to =
the
valley floor.  Flat ground at last!  Now I could claim that there would be
no more uphill or downhill.  But all was not yet goodness and light, and we
soon found ourselves wallowing in some of the worst snow imaginable.  Deepe=
r
than the snow we had battled through at South Pass, it exhibited the same
general characteristics.  Deeply rotten and unsupportable, yet dense and
heavy, it was nearly impossible to move through.  We were snowshoeing again=
,
pulling our ski tips out of the snow at each step and stepping on the
surface, only to sink down a foot.  Pure hell.  Too spice up what promised
to be hours, and possibly days, of fun battling our way out, I decided to
make a quick sight seeing trip to the other side of the Green River.  After
plunging through the ice and almost losing a ski in the swift flowing
current, I reluctantly came back across and started sloshing down the trail
like a good boy.  My skins were now coated with ice which removed any
possibility of sliding on them.  Oh well.  That night we made a fire and fe=
d
it with prehistoric glee, which somewhat warmed our outlook and dried my
boots.  But we still weren=01,t out.

Day 17.  Joe and I don=01,t need to verbalize this, but it=01,s just sort o=
f
understood that there is absolutely no way we are not making it out today.
No chance of not getting out today.  Nope.  I mean zero chance.  We even ge=
t
up in the dark for an early start to ensure that no matter what the day may
throw at us (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, meteors, etc.) we are still
making it out.  As I flee the ice bag, I notice it=01,s only =01)10 F down =
here in
the sultry valley.

Even though he broke trail most of yesterday, Joe is out in front again.
The snow is worse than ever.  Somehow even with a trail to follow I can=01,=
t
really keep up.  I occupy myself with bitter, frivolous =01&Well, at least
we=01,re not getting attacked by a moose=018 kind of thoughts.  I look arou=
nd for
some small forest creature to curse at.  Anything to divert attention from
the pain in my feet and legs.  Damn pikas.  Bloody chipmunks.  But there=01=
,s
nothing about.  Staggering along, I feel almost like a third party to our
plight, like I=01,m watching it on tv.  Tra la la.  This is pretty fun, I l=
ie
to myself.

But our suffering pays off.  We come upon a lake.  Could this be Green Rive=
r
Lakes?  We consult the map.  Surely there must be some mistake.  I wait for
Joe to inform me that we=01,ve made a wrong turn and are actually in northe=
rn
British Columbia, hundreds of miles from the nearest road.  But no.  As if =
a
ramp of light had descended from parted clouds to our feet, the lake lies
there like a highway.  Trumpets are sounding.  Angels are fluttering above
motioning us forward.  Not only will trail breaking be easier, we now have
certifiable proof that we are only 4 miles from Green River Lakes
campground, a snowmobiling mecca.  It=01,s only about 1 pm and clear and su=
nny.
  Surely there will be hundreds of people out on a day like this, even if i=
t
is a Tuesday.  We have visions of having to fight back hordes of attractive
female snowmachiners, all clamoring to be the ones who will give us a ride
back to Cora, 20 miles distant.  We=01,ll probably need flak jackets.

We pick up the pace.  Or rather Joe picks up the pace.  Apparently he think=
s
he may still have a good chance of competing in some nordic events in the
2002 Olympics in Salt Lake, because he=01,s going down the lake like a rock=
et.
He=01,s not even going in a straight line.  He=01,s swerving all over the p=
lace,
going like a madman for the finish line.  He doesn=01,t care because WE ARE
GETTING OUT TODAY!  One thing I do have going for me is that I can plot a
straight course for the point where we will exit the first lake, so I regai=
n
some time.  We cross the first lake.  There are ski tracks in the snow.
Humans!  At the second lake, where the wilderness boundary ends, I am about
as happy as I have ever been to see snowmobile tracks all over the place.
But strangely, ominously, no machines.

At 3 pm we are at the campground.  Snowmobile tracks everywhere.  It=01,s j=
ust
a matter of time, I tell myself.  They=01,ll be here.  We reach the far end=
 of
the campground where the road heads off for Cora and do some gear
rearranging, readying ourselves for that magic ride.  We scatter things all
over the road, effectively blockading it.  Nobody is getting by here withou=
t
picking us up.  The sun is still shining and it=01,s downright warm.  As a
little joke, I take my sleeping bag out and set it on a tarp to begin the
drying process which, I imagine, will really kick into gear in about three
hours when we=01,re back in Joe=01,s living room in Jackson and have turned=
 up the
thermostat to about 85 F.  Just a bit of fun putting the bag out like this.
I mean, it=01,s not like we=01,re going to need the thing tonight.

Total silence.  Wonder where they are, these =01+bilers?  Must be a local
tradition to stop at this time each afternoon for a moment of silence or
something.  We start getting a little upset.  Almost indignant.  Don=01,t t=
hese
people know how to have fun?  Where are they?  A day this beautiful and
noone=01,s out on their machines?  Where is everyone, off cross country ski=
ing
or something?  Sun=01,s going down now.  For god=01,s sake WHERE ARE THEY?!

And then, just as faint as the sound of a mosquito, we hear it.  A little
buzz.  Was that the wind?  No, I still hear it.  Could it be a =01( plane?
Buzz.  Buzz.  Buzzzzzzz.  No sound could be more soothing, more friendly,
more welcome at that moment than this: the sound of not one but several two
stroke engines heading our way.

We finally crack.  Screams, high fives, arms raised.  Hysteria, release.  W=
e
knew it!  We knew we=01,d make it out tonight!  Victory is ours!  We are go=
ing
to live!  After a minute or two I realize that maybe if I stop shouting and
set about repacking the crap I=01,ve strewn all over the road we=01,ll look=
 a
little more appealing.  A little more like someone these gracious, heroic,
good-natured =01+bilers will want to pick up.  I lower my arms, wipe the te=
ars
off my face, and start jamming the ice bag back into its stuff sack.

We start cleaning up.  In an instant we are already mentally back in
Jackson.  Back in town.  Back indoors.  As if transported by a futuristic
machine, we are no longer at a remote trailhead 20 miles away from a town o=
f
maybe 200 people in the middle of nowhere in Wyoming.  We are home.  We are
warm.  We are about to have dinner.  Joe=01,s in the shower.  I=01,m checki=
ng my
email.  Beam me up, Scotty.

For some reason the =01+bilers (there are 4 of them) have stopped almost a =
mile
short of our little shanty town and have turned off their machines.  Now
that doesn=01,t look good.  The sun has just gone behind a peak, and in abo=
ut
15 minutes the temperature will go into freefall.  We can=01,t imagine why
anyone would come the 20 miles out here and not go all the way to the lake,
which is on the other side of us.  They=01,re probably playing a game of
rock-paper-scissors to decide who will be the lucky two to host us on the
ride back, but we are sure not taking any chances.  Maybe they just haven=
=01,t
seen us.  Before I can suggest that he=01,d probably enjoy some brisk skiin=
g
after such a slack 17 days, Joe has stripped off his skins and is skating
down the road toward our motorized friends to make sure all is well with,
uh, you know, the pickup and the ride back and everything.

I get out my telephoto lens to watch and maybe document this historic
meeting.  I=01,m sure that as soon as he gets the aok I=01,ll be hearing a =
lot of
noise from Joe.  I imagine the bilers=01, responses:  =01&You skied 130 mil=
es from
where?  Good lord, son, you get on the back of this machine and we=01,re go=
ing
back to my place for a full blown steak dinner right now.  Here, I=01,ll ju=
st
call ahead and get that in the works.=018  =01&Now wait just a minute there=
, Bill.
  Who said we=01,re going to your place?  We=01,re having it at my house.=
=018
=01&Jimmy, over my dead body.  We=01,re going to my house and we=01,re havi=
ng a
dinner and dance, and then we=01,re taking them to Vegas for a week.  And i=

anyone else tries to contribute one penny to the expense, there=01,s going =
to
be a fight.  It=01,s all on me.=018  =01&Sorry, Bobby, but it=01,s just not=
 going to be
like that at all.  We=01,re going to my place, we=01,re eating for two days=
, and
then I=01,m taking them to meet the Governor before we head to Acapulco for=
 a
week.  And I=01,ll be damned if my two daughters aren=01,t coming with us.=
=018  I
start to get a warm fuzzy feeling.  These are my people!  I=01,m determined=
 to
try snowmobiling as soon as possible.  Maybe even convert.  Screw this
skiing stuff.  I want horsepower!  I start singing as I pack up my sled.

The first sign of trouble is when the four riders start their machines and
set off headed toward me.  But Joe remains standing in place like a fence
post.  He=01,s not moving at all.  I figure he=01,s just so bowled over by =
all the
outlandish offers of hospitality we=01,ve received that he=01,s wondering h=
ow
we=01,re going to be able to make it out of Cora in less than a week.  What
with all the parades, barbecues, snowmobiling with the mayor, square dances=
,
and motivational talks at the high school, we may have to push back the nex=
t
leg of our Yellowstone traverse by at least a few days.  Here come the
=01+bilers.  Joe is still doing his frozen in place routine.  This does not
look good.

I reluctantly clear a path to let the four riders through our barricade.
Well, they may be getting to the lake, I think, but they can=01,t get out. =
 The
most worrisome thing is that they do not stop to talk to me, and only one
even waves.  No eye contact at all.  That=01,s alright, I think.  Out of
consideration for us they=01,re hurrying as fast as they can to get a glimp=
se
of the lake and then they=01,re going to zip back and get us.  We=01,ll tal=
k back
at their place.  They just don=01,t want us to spend a single additional mi=
nute
outside.  How kind of them.  That=01,s why they didn=01,t stop.

Then it hits me.  The music stops, the needle goes screeching across the
record.  We=01,re in trouble here.  Something is terribly, terribly wrong.
This is just not how people who are about to bring us home to feast with
their extended family should be acting.  Joe is moving now at least.  He ha=
s
taken his skis off and is walking back toward me at a very slow speed.  I
shout to him, =01&Well?=018  No response.  =01&Joe?=018  =01&JOE!=018  I re=
peatedly shout at
him as he approaches within 100 yards.  He=01,s not answering.  God this lo=
oks
bad!  I instantly readjust my internal fun meter from being back in Jackson
watching tv to Defcon 5.  I=01,ve been yanked out of the shower and I=01,m =
at the
North Pole having just been given the news that the pickup flight is not
coming and we have to make the 1400 mile trek home by dogsled.  And we don=
=01,t
have any sled dogs so we=01,ll be using marmots instead.  It=01,s pretty cl=
ear we
are not getting a ride back with the boys.

Joe confirms this with very few words when he arrives.  The party consisted
of a Wyoming guide and three clients from Michigan.  The guide mumbled some
bologna about how he could lose his license if anyone saw him giving us a
ride.  Joe kind of tried to laugh this one off at first but then realized
the guy was serious.  He did not want to help us, who knows why.  This
outcome was so unexpected and so incomprehensible to us that we just sat
there at first.  It was like a truck coming across someone in the Sahara
Desert.  =01&Sorry, I=01,d love to pick you up, but you might put your feet=
 on the
dash and smudge the leather.=018  Would any skier coming across a broken do=
wn
snowmobiler 20 miles from the road refuse to help, refuse to lend a hand in
any way?  We couldn=01,t fathom this.  Where was the back country fellowshi=
p,
the shared camaraderie of a couple of hearty souls out in Wyoming=01,s
wildness?  Sorry.  It wasn=01,t there this time.  We were crushed.

The previously valiant ambassadors of world peace and brotherhood, now
hateful, bubble-headed practitioners of an idiotic, environmentally damagin=
g
sport, came roaring back from the lake on their gas pigs.  I stared at them
menacingly.  They did not stop.  Good thing for them.  We spent 20 minutes
on tirades and diatribes best not recalled in print, and then we got out ou=
r
pathetic list of options.  We had already gone about 10 miles that day.  I
don=01,t know about Joe, but after 17 straight days of going for it, I was =
a
mess.  It was 4:00 pm.  Another 20 miles separated us from the car and
salvation.  We could either camp and continue in the morning, or keep going
a little further until dark.  Or, of course, we could commit to the grand
finale death march.

We decided on the death march.  We would eat dinner, pack it up, and go
until we got to the car.  Just another 20 miles.  It wouldn=01,t be so bad.=
  A
rational person might have pointed out that we were looking at a 30 mile da=
y
(and night), but our thinking was not exactly sharp as a laser.  From step
1, I knew it was a mistake for me, but Joe definitely had the fire for
getting out.  We set off at nearly full speed with evening coming on and
rich alpenglow coating all peaks in sight.  Every step hurt.  Every minute =
I
wanted to stop.  I lasted about an hour before seriously considering
stopping for the night.  Another key characteristic of the death march is
that one person wants to do it and the other really doesn=01,t but just goe=
s
along with it.  It was clear who was in which role.  This was sort of a new
experience for me, for I usually played the guy trying to get the other to
keep going.  Not this time.  I knew Joe was not going to be happy when he
heard I wanted to stop.

For a seeming eternity I heard myself mouthing the words, =01&I think we sh=
ould
stop.=018  But I held on.  Just another step.  Take another step and see ho=
w it
felt.  It felt bad.  My feet were on fire.  My legs were slightly numb down
the sides.  I was hobbling.  I felt about as comfortable on skis as Woody=
=20
Allen.  But the worst thing was that we had no way to measure our progress.
We did not recognize the route, could not assess how much farther, had no
landmarks.  It could be another hour or another 10.  I had myself convinced
we could ski four miles an hour.  By that math, we should be able to reach
Cora in time for last call.  Or at least in time to round up an angry mob o=
f
torch-bearing villagers to go hunt down the four =01+bilers who were guilty=
 of
crimes against humanity and must pay!

Darkness.  Temperature down to a cheery =01)10 F.  Real heat wave here in t=
he
shadow of the Wind River Range.  It=01,s another clear, windless night on t=
he
range as we slowly, painfully make our way out of the mountains.  The ice
hard road crunches under our skis.  Dead silence otherwise.  At last, the
pyschological brutality of simply not knowing how much longer breaks me, an=
d
2=20
 hours into the death march, even though I have convinced myself we must
be half way, I mouth the words.  I=01,m not asking, I=01,m telling.  As sel=
fish as
that may be, I can=01,t go on.  I know Joe is severely displeased, but he
agrees silently, and we stop to set up the tent.  In 10 minutes we are
huddling in the ice bags, praying for warmth.

Looking back, I am amazed we survived as long as we did on the trip with ou=
r
sleeping bags considering the state they were in.  Usually the bag is a saf=
e
house, a place to go when all else goes wrong, a place to retreat to.  But
in our case it was the opposite.  Because the weather was so perfect, the
days were our sanctuary, the place we could recover from our torment in the
bags and get warm again.  Had it not been for the perfect weather, we could
not have lasted.  But we managed to just barely hang on and tolerate our
sleeping bags as they became of less and less use each day.

Until they were of no use whatsoever.  Inside the tent, we are both
thrashing around in our bags fully clothed.  I put on my down jacket inside
the bag for the first time.  Luckily we both have down pants which we have
been wearing to sleep for more than a week.  The bags are doing more harm
than good at this point, but we don=01,t really get that.  The thought does=
n=01,t
occur to us to try sleeping without the bags.  It=01,s obvious that neither=
 one
of us is asleep or headed anywhere remotely near sleep.  For the first time
on the trip I am not satisfactorily warm at night.  I can survive, but it i=
s
not going to be comfortable.  Maybe we=01,d be better off going for the car=
.  I
can=01,t face that unknown quantity.  Another 2=20
 hours?  More?  I realize we
are looking at a sleepless night: 9 hours of waiting for the sun to come
back around.

After an hour Joe announces he can=01,t sleep and wants to keep going.  He=
=01,s
wet and cold and getting worse in the ice bag.  We talk about it and decide
he will go for the car and I will stay the night, continuing at first light=
.
  The thought of getting out of the bag, cold as it is, putting on frozen
boots, hitching up the sled and continuing almost makes me want to get
physically ill, but Joe still has something left.  He departs at 9 pm, back
out into the cold, clear Wyoming night.

I drift in and out of sleep.  I actually do attain some warmth, but somehow
I am also getting wet.  Must have slipped off my pad.  Don=01,t care.  I am
cramped and crippled, a few limbs need blood, but rolling over acts like a
huge vacuum that takes away any heat I have, so I lie still.  My watch says
3 am when I check it.  Only another few hours and I'll be on my way.  I eve=
n
consider getting up right then and continuing but don=01,t.  I think of Joe=
 and
the brutal death march he must have faced, or might still be facing.  Hope
he makes it.  I drift off again.

4:30 am.  I hear a noise.  Sounds like an engine.  It=01,s not a snowmobile=
.
Not high-pitched enough.  Sounds like=01( a car!  In the space of one minut=
e I
go from sleeping to wide awake and out of the ice bag.  I know exactly
what=01,s happened, and I am ecstatic.  It=01,s Joe!  He has driven the car=
 back
down the snowmobile trail to get me!  Bugles are sounding and the cavalry i=
s
thundering over the hill, flags all around.  No time is spent wondering
exactly how Joe got the car here.  Before he has it turned around I am out
of the tent and furiously packing my sled.

We have the tent down and my gear in the car in under five minutes.  I slip
under skis and sled poles into the passenger seat and want to cry when I
feel the heat blast from inside.  Joe=01,s had the heater on high for hours=
.
We head off with music playing and Joe hands me a glazed donut.  The
contrast is too stark.  It can=01,t be real.  I keep waiting to wake up in
northern Iceland with the tent blown to shreds and our bags frozen hard as
coffins.  But I am awake, and we are homeward bound at last.

Joe happily relates his tale like he=01,s telling me who won the Super Bowl=
,
and I look for a bullet to bite down on to stop my screams.  He left the
tent to resume the death march at 9 pm.  We figured we were half way, so he
was looking at another two or three hours at most.  More than five hours
after leaving the tent, close to 2:30 am, Joe reached the car.  It started.
Just the thought of going that long, not knowing whether it might have been
another five hours, is too much for me to consider.  Suddenly all my past
death march experiences were transformed into happy jaunts in the country
with birds chirping in comparison with Joe=01,s saga.

After starting the car, Joe made for a local convenience store and stocking
up on junk food and coffee, then returned to the trailhead.  At Green River
Lakes we had joked how the snowmobile trail was hard enough to drive on.
Noticing there was no gate between the parking lot and trail, Joe eased his
Ford Escort up onto the trail.  The car didn=01,t sink in at all.  He kept
going and was soon whizzing down the trail.  =01&So how far was it from the
tent to the car?  Did you measure?=018 I asked.  =01&12 miles.=018

With the heater on full and early morning of our 18th day starting to show
itself in the rosy eastern sky, we point the car toward a breakfast of eggs=
,
bacon, and pancakes.  We had gotten away with murder and we knew it.  Never
in our wildest dreams could we have hoped for such good weather.  We had
done nothing to deserve it.  But with this unprecedented window thrown open
to us, we had breached the Wind River Range=01,s defenses and squeaked thro=
ugh.
  In January.

Joe pops in a Neil Diamond tape and starts singing along.  I=01,ve got some
things to learn from this guy.

You're definitely not being difficult - it's good for us to know these 
things. I'm going to check with Mike Swerzbin on this - he's the trader on 
347356 - after the morning trading dies down a bit. Just wanted to let you 
know I'm not ignoring you.

Thanks,

Sorry, I didn't see these deals when I sent the first email.  Kimberly Hundl 
had sent you a note about the contact.  Are these deals like the other two 
deals, and should be confirmed totally separately from the deal #347356.  
Sorry to be so difficult, but we get into trouble everytime we confirm a 
Conoco deal because of the special language that needs to be included on 
deals that are part of #347356, and we never get any notes that tell us 
whether or not it is part of the extension of the original deal.

Thanks!

Jack Wells is the contact for both - I've added his name to deal #507417. 
According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal 
was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just 
buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only 
connection. Let me know if you need more of an explanation from the traders, 
but our take is that these deals are separate.

Thanks,

Are these two deals part of the original Conoco deal # 347356 that they are

something in the confirmation if they are extensions of the original deal.  
Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?

I've changed these deals to FPL Energy Power Marketing. Chris wasn't aware of 
the difference.  I'm trying to come up with a summary list or some other kind 
of reminder to send out to the traders today. I.E. is FPL part of Florida 
Power & Light? What's a quick and easy way to determine which counterparty 
you're trading with? 

We've just been bombarded with reports of incorrect counterparty names in our 
deals, and more often than not the traders are unaware of or indifferent to 
the difference. For your sake (and ultimately theirs, since these errors will 
start adding up in the daily correction report), I want to develop a more 
efficient system of checks and balances. If you have any suggestions (other 
than asking the traders to wake up and pay attention!) please let me know 
when you get a chance. I'll just be brainstorming today....in between 
changing incorrect counterparty names!

Thanks,
Kate

No, that's fine. But because of the new global standards, we're required to 
produce and report all corrections made on west power deals each day. So I 
was looking into these deals to get trader names, terms, etc., but 3 of them 
wouldn't pull up. 507901, 506767, and 507900 don't seem to be in the system. 
Are these the correct deal numbers? Let me know when you get a chance.

Kate

Thought this might be useful for you to have as well. I highlighted the deal 
numbers that concern your desk in red. I know these are really nitpicky 
errors, but it might be worth reminding these guys of the correct

Those are east trades and you probably don't have access to them.  I just 
bundled west and east so you can ignore them.

No, that's fine. But because of the new global standards, we're required to 
produce and report all corrections made on west power deals each day. So I 
was looking into these deals to get trader names, terms, etc., but 3 of them 
wouldn't pull up. 507901, 506767, and 507900 don't seem to be in the system. 
Are these the correct deal numbers? Let me know when you get a chance.

These deals were entered to flatten out the traders' positions in the PX. You 
shouldn't see the index being used on any deals past tomorrow (the exchange 
closes effective Feb. 1), but Bob Badeer and Matt Motley both had positions 
they needed to back out of. They turned around and bought the same amount at 
the Dow Jones index. Hope this helps!

          POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY

                March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas

http://www.pmaconference.com/0103Agenda.pdf

EVERY CRISIS HOLDS OPPORTUNITIES:

Power shortages boost merchant power, distributed generation, peak shaving, 
real-time pricing and energy management. Some states are delaying their 
retail choice programs, but others are moving ahead, confident that they have 
benefited from the lessons learned by the pioneering jurisdictions. Electric 
price volatility drives growth in the risk management business.

Credit and cash flow are squeezed, but financial products provide solutions. 
Gas price volatility is a reminder-- coal was and remains the great source of 
energy for our country. Dot-coms seem to have been exposed as just ordinary 
businesses-- but online trading in energy is the single most robust area for 
transactions on the net. The IPO market hasn?t been kind to technology 
stocks-- but it likes energy issues. Broadband trading has been slow to take 
off, but powerline telecom may solve the real problem-- access to ""the last 
mile"".

Please join us at the Power Marketing Association?s annual spring meeting, 
""POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY"" March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas, for 
presentations on these topics and more!

Warmest Regards,
Glenn Lovin

Currently, we do not confirm west deals that flow 6 days or less so we have 
not had to be real difficult about contact names in deal entry.  However, 
starting February 1, we are going to confirm all next day deals in the west 
using the same criteria we do in the east - that is - deals 3 days or less 
are sent on a confirmation that does not require a signature and everthing 
else on a letter requiring a signature.  Hourly deals will not be confirmed.  
So it is very important that the traders fill in a contact name when they are 
entering deals.  The confirmation letter cannot be prepared without a contact 
name.  It stops the whole process.  We are not going to be able to put names 
in every time they do not.  

If they do not see the contact they want in the drop down list,  put the 
correctly spelled first and last name in the comment section in deal entry 
and we will add this contact to the list and it should appear the next day.

If you can help us out with this, maybe we won't have to keep asking you for 
contacts.

Thanks!"

Hi Kate,
Please have a look at the term on this deal.  There is a discrepancy between 
the end date at the top of the screen in Deal Entry and the one listed in the 
strips at the bottom.  Is the correct end date 6/30 or 6/1? 
Thanks!

Okay - third time's the charm. After cuts were made by the Cal-ISO last 
night, I sent you a revised volume schedule of our sales to EES for 1/31; 
however, I failed to change the total load at SP-15 to reflect cuts. Now 
you'll see the CORRECT revisions made at all delivery points. Let me know if 
you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate

I just spoke with Sean Crandall, the trader on these deals, and he said the 
counterparty could be either Conoco Pipeline Co. or Conoco Power Marketing. 
If credit has specified the latter, I'll change these deals. Just let me know.

I've received some feedback from the Real Time group regarding these 
counterparty discrepancies. Apparently, they were never given notice of the 
correct counterparty names, and chose what seemed to be the most logical 
name. Can we come up with a system or master list of usable counterparty 
names for these guys to refer to when faced with an array of choices? (i.e. 
There are five different names under Transalta.) 

The concern lies with our daily correction report, which I generate and which 
includes all deals that have been changed and the name of the person who made 
the ""error."" This report can weigh unfairly against a trader who may be 
unaware of the difference between ""Dynegy Marketing & Trade"" and ""Dynegy 
Power Marketing."" I feel like there has to be a more efficient way to avoid 
these errors than publishing them in a report that gets sent throughout the 
company.

If you could help me compile this master list, or direct me to someone who 
can, I would greatly appreciate it. 

Thanks,
Kate

I talked to Bill Williams and told him a quick (but not always perfect) way 
to see if it is the correct CP is to select the CP and then click on the Deal 
Clearing tab.  If there is a contract there or if you click on the arrow and 
a number is there, we have a K with that entity and it is the correct CP.  If 
it is blank under Global Contracts even after you click on the arrow, we do 
not have a contract with that entity and you have probably chosen the wrong 
CP.  I will also send him a list of entities we have Ks with, but he did not 
want them to have to look at a list.  Its probably a learning curve but at 
least this is a step in the right direction.  Let me know if you can think of 
other ways to help them.

I forwarded this e-mail on to all our traders to give them a heads up about 
the new process. I did receive feedback from one trader, Mark Fischer, who 
said that when he began with Enron he was always told that if a contact name 
was not in the system that he was supposed to enter it into the comments 
section. He did this diligently under the pretense that eventually these 
names would be added to the system, but they apparently never were. He wanted 
to let me know of this, especially because when the traders are hurriedly 
entering deals, they probably won't always take the time to type in the 
contact name in the comments section.

Let's see if we can update this list somehow. Let me know who I can contact

This probably happened because he is a daily or hourly trader and in the past 
we have not seen these deals to see the notes to add the contacts.  With the 
change in the criteria for confirmation, we will now view these deals and add 
the contacts as they come across.  If anyone has a list of contacts they want 
added, please send the names and the company name and we will put them into 
the system.

So it is very important that the traders fill in a contact name when they are 
entering deals.  The confirmation letter cannot be prepared without a contact 
name.  It stops the whole process.  We are not going to be able to put names 
in every time they do not.  

If they do not see the contact they want in the drop down list,  put the 
correctly spelled first and last name in the comment section in deal entry 
and we will add this contact to the list and it should appear the next day.

If you can help us out with this, maybe we won't have to keep asking you for 
contacts.

Thanks!

No, this was incorrect. I'll tell you something - Real Time is having 
problems figuring out who they do and do not trade with. We're going to have 
a conversation about this in a minute when I come up for air from this whole 
California mess. In the meantime, I've changed this to Enron Energy Services,

I checked with Sean, who said he's finished entering his deals. Mike is just 
finishing up with his. Jeff Richter, however, still has about 8 deals to 
enter. This should be done within the next few minutes.

Here's the long and short of the contact name list. It sounds like now that 
the confirmation group is taking the time to look at all daily deals, they 
might pay attention to daily traders' needs as well. Let's hope.

If you could possibly write down contact names that still aren't in the 
system, I'll send it on to the IT group in Houston and we should be able to 
get them in the system shortly.

Thanks,
Kate

This probably happened because he is a daily or hourly trader and in the past 
we have not seen these deals to see the notes to add the contacts.  With the 
change in the criteria for confirmation, we will now view these deals and add 
the contacts as they come across.  If anyone has a list of contacts they want 
added, please send the names and the company name and we will put them into 
the system.

Subject: Re: contacts  

I forwarded this e-mail on to all our traders to give them a heads up about 
the new process. I did receive feedback from one trader, Mark Fischer, who 
said that when he began with Enron he was always told that if a contact name 
was not in the system that he was supposed to enter it into the comments 
section. He did this diligently under the pretense that eventually these 
names would be added to the system, but they apparently never were. He wanted 
to let me know of this, especially because when the traders are hurriedly 
entering deals, they probably won't always take the time to type in the 
contact name in the comments section.

Let's see if we can update this list somehow. Let me know who I can contact 
for this or how we can set this up.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: contacts

Currently, we do not confirm west deals that flow 6 days or less so we have 
not had to be real difficult about contact names in deal entry.  However, 
starting February 1, we are going to confirm all next day deals in the west 
using the same criteria we do in the east - that is - deals 3 days or less 
are sent on a confirmation that does not require a signature and everthing 
else on a letter requiring a signature.  Hourly deals will not be confirmed.  
So it is very important that the traders fill in a contact name when they are

          POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY

                March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas

http://www.pmaconference.com/0103Agenda.pdf

EVERY CRISIS HOLDS OPPORTUNITIES:

Power shortages boost merchant power, distributed generation, peak shaving, 
real-time pricing and energy management. Some states are delaying their 
retail choice programs, but others are moving ahead, confident that they have 
benefited from the lessons learned by the pioneering jurisdictions. Electric 
price volatility drives growth in the risk management business.

Credit and cash flow are squeezed, but financial products provide solutions. 
Gas price volatility is a reminder-- coal was and remains the great source of 
energy for our country. Dot-coms seem to have been exposed as just ordinary 
businesses-- but online trading in energy is the single most robust area for 
transactions on the net. The IPO market hasn?t been kind to technology 
stocks-- but it likes energy issues. Broadband trading has been slow to take 
off, but powerline telecom may solve the real problem-- access to ""the last 
mile"".

Please join us at the Power Marketing Association?s annual spring meeting, 
""POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY"" March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas, for 
presentations on these topics and more!

Thanks a bunch.  I know this is frustrating for you and I will send the list 
of contracts to you so the real time people can get their act together.

No, this was incorrect. I'll tell you something - Real Time is having 
problems figuring out who they do and do not trade with. We're going to have 
a conversation about this in a minute when I come up for air from this whole 
California mess. In the meantime, I've changed this to Enron Energy Services, 
Inc.

Thanks,

509402.  Can you see if this is the correct CP.  We don't have a contract 
with them.  If it is correct, that's fine, just let me know.

Kate, that would be me. I need to see if the New Counterparty is the State of 
California Dept. of Water Resources or if the counterparty name in Enpower is 
correct: California Dept. of Water Resources. If it is the second one then we 
can choose the CP in Enpower. If it is the first one then we need to set them 
up in Global. This is Kerri Thompsons broker. I am also copying her so she is 
kept in the loop. Please let me know.

Thanks,

Kimberly

In all the excitement of the day, I completely forgot to check on this deal. 
I know I got a call from one of you guys about the ""New Counterparty"" Diana 
Scholtes put in here; but I'm not sure now what I was supposed to check on.

Give me a call in the morning and let me know. Sorry!

I'm not sure if someone else got to this before I did, but I see the same end 
date at the top and bottom of this deal - 6/30/01. Let me know if this needs 
to be changed, or if it's not showing up correctly for you.

Hi Kate,
Please have a look at the term on this deal.  There is a discrepancy between 
the end date at the top of the screen in Deal Entry and the one listed in the 
strips at the bottom.  Is the correct end date 6/30 or 6/1? 
Thanks!

          POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY

                March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas

http://www.pmaconference.com/0103Agenda.pdf

EVERY CRISIS HOLDS OPPORTUNITIES:

Power shortages boost merchant power, distributed generation, peak shaving, 
real-time pricing and energy management. Some states are delaying their 
retail choice programs, but others are moving ahead, confident that they have 
benefited from the lessons learned by the pioneering jurisdictions. Electric 
price volatility drives growth in the risk management business.

Credit and cash flow are squeezed, but financial products provide solutions. 
Gas price volatility is a reminder-- coal was and remains the great source of 
energy for our country. Dot-coms seem to have been exposed as just ordinary 
businesses-- but online trading in energy is the single most robust area for 
transactions on the net. The IPO market hasn?t been kind to technology 
stocks-- but it likes energy issues. Broadband trading has been slow to take 
off, but powerline telecom may solve the real problem-- access to ""the last 
mile"".

Please join us at the Power Marketing Association?s annual spring meeting, 
""POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY"" March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas, for 
presentations on these topics and more!

Warmest Regards,

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an

of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office,

is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

I believe Melissa had talked to you about checking once again to see if these 
deals should be against the PX index.  It is our understanding that we are 
going to have to move everything that is against that index to another index 
at some point.

Thanks!

These deals were entered to flatten out the traders' positions in the PX. You 
shouldn't see the index being used on any deals past tomorrow (the exchange 
closes effective Feb. 1), but Bob Badeer and Matt Motley both had positions 
they needed to back out of. They turned around and bought the same amount at 
the Dow Jones index. Hope this helps!

Kate

correct index?

I've changed it to be confirmed. Chris Mallory usually does mostly daily 
deals, so his deal blotter probably defaults to no confirm.

I checked with Diana Scholtes, the trader on this deal, and she said the 
counterparty was supposed to be CERS - California Energy Resource Schedulers. 
I've changed the name, but let me know if your records still show California 
Dept. of Water Resources.

I've added two new swaps to reflect the change from the California PX to the 
Dow Jones index after 1/31/01. The following deal numbers cover the whole 
term of the deal.

404980 - 9/1/00 through 1/31/01 @ PX NP15 Index
512726 - 2/1/01 through 8/31/03 @ DJ NP15 Peak Index
512743 - 2/1/01 through 8/31/01 @ DJ NP15 Off-Peak Index

Both new deals have comments that link them back to the original deal. Let me 
know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate

I've changed all the deals I could find that contained the counterparty name 
""California Department of Water Resources - CDWR"" to ""California Energy 
Resource Schedulers - State of California."" The following deal numbers are 
those that have been changed. If you come across other daily deals, most 
likely done by EPMI Short Term California or Short Term Northwest, let me 
know and I'll change those counterparty names too.

Hey there - I'm so sorry I haven't responded until now. I've been swamped 
with work, moving, and now the flu. Whoo, hoo! So, as far as gossip is 
concerned, I'm all dried up for now. I was going to go on a company ski trip 
this weekend, but I feel so crappy I can't even imagine being outside, let 
alone surrounded by snow and wind at the same time. I imagine you're totally 
used to that by now, but keep in mind your weather is accompanied by sun and 
not eternal grayness. 

Our house is coming along nicely. Molly and I already want to boot Amber out, 
but that's okay. We deal with it by laughing about her antics whenever 
possible - behind her back or in front of her face. It really helps us out, 
and I think it does wonders for her ego too. Work is work. The weather is 
foul! Men are too. I don't even have one prospect at this point. Of course 
there's always the innocent, fleeting crushes from a distance; but I've got 
to admit I hardly even have the energy for those anymore. 

I hope you can make it home for a visit soon, because you are going to LOVE 
our house. I will definitely keep my eyes peeled for cheap tickets to Denver, 
or maybe I'll just do the train and take a long weekend. Either way, I'll 
definitely make it there by springtime. Tell me about your jobs, friends (or 
not?), and life in general. I'm going to get back to work and hustle so I can 
get out of here early and suffer peacefully at home. I'll give you a call 
from my sick bed, 'kay?

Take care,
Kate"

I think I found what you're looking for:

www.ferc.fed.us

Once you get to the home page, click on the ""gas"" icon. From there, hit the 
link to the ""FERC Gas Tariffs Page."" Then it gives you a choice of viewing 
the tariffs in HTML or saving them to a different file. 

I wasn't quite sure how you wanted to review this information. The website is 
updated every 30 days, or so it said, so you may just want to keep it 
bookmarked and check it out whenever you need the information.

If I totally missed the mark, please let me know and I'll keep looking."

I don't see any deals with any of these terms in Tom's trade log for today. 
He's left the office, and I've left him a message on his cell phone - but 
until then, I can't really say if this is good or not. Could it be a Mark 
Fischer deal?

unprecedented crisis.? Blackouts, credit crunch, electric and gas price 
volatility, low hydro levels--? and we're not even near the summer.?? What 
are we facing??

arise.?? Join us at the Power Marketing Association's Seventh Annual Spring

Salt Lake City, confident the power will be there for you when your business 
needs it.

INVESTMENT BANKS POWER UP THEIR ENERGY PRACTICES
Wall Street is hungry for the latest hot sector, now? that deals from 
Internet and telecommunications companies have slowed.... Large investment 
banks? such as Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith 
Barney Inc.--as well as? second-tier players like ING Barings and 
Rothschild--have been adding talent with expertise in? utilities and power 
companies. 

TIGHT WATER SUPPLY SEEN AS CALIFORNIA COPES WITH POWER CRISIS
They are predicting low Sierra Nevada snowpack levels throughout the summer 
in California, which depends heavily on runoff to power hydroelectric plants.
 
DUKE, WILLIAMS GAS PIPE? DEAL WILL FUEL 10,000 MW IN FL?
The $1.6 billion pipeline will bring natural gas for 10,000 megawatts of new 
power generation in Florida by 2007.

 WASHINGTON-OREGON CORRIDOR SEES 10,000 MW PLANNED?

We are still planning on confirming the daily deals in the west, but we have

I don't see any deals with any of these terms in Tom's trade log for today. 
He's left the office, and I've left him a message on his cell phone - but 
until then, I can't really say if this is good or not. Could it be a Mark

The Prebon broker was pulling his tapes this morning when I asked Chris about 
it - he said he'd let me know as soon as they worked it out. I just checked 
with Chris again, and apparently the broker pulled tapes from the wrong day. 
But we should know soon. I'll e-mail you right away.

Thanks. I just checked Peoplefinder and all the new information is in there. 
One thing I couldn't change, however, was my department and supervisor. This 
may have to be changed by HR or my new supervisor; but at any rate, I now 
work in West Power Trading and report to Jeff Richter and Tim Belden.

Thanks for your help.

Looks like Tom forgot this deal on Friday - I've just entered it. Deal # is 
514006. One thing I didn't check on was whether it was off-peak or on-peak. 
Does this deal check out with APB? Let me know.

Thanks,
kate

I don't see any deals with any of these terms in Tom's trade log for today. 
He's left the office, and I've left him a message on his cell phone - but 
until then, I can't really say if this is good or not. Could it be a Mark 
Fischer deal?

I'm sending a copy of the error message I received when I tried to enter our 
futures deals today. The application saved one deal, but 
would not accept the other two. The only difference between the three deals 
is the delivery month. Is there any way we can get this fixed soon? 
The clearing broker has had a record of these deals since Jan. 31, and the 
trader is getting a little antsy to have them recorded in our 
system. Thanks so much for your help....

ORA-20500: Unable to translate deal QQ0938.0 into ERMS system.

Kate:

As we've discussed, the switch from PX to DJ index still seems problematic 
for deal # 404980 (the original deal).  Please double check the deal entry in 
the new deals you've created (#512726.1 and #512743.1) to substitute the 
original one, and let us know how things are going asap so we can correct our 
distorted P&L report.

Thanks,

I think that there may be a slight misunderstanding here.

Here are the major differences between Cross-Desk and Cross-Portfolio deals...

Cross-Desk deals are:
? Flagged as desk-to-desk
? NOT scheduled

Cross-Portfolio deals are:
? Flagged as NON-desk-to-desk
? scheduled depending on the deal type (e.g. Forwards are scheduled, 
Emissions are not)

The new deals in question are entered into the system as Cross-Portfolio 
deals because of the WEST - ENAEXEC portfolio relationship.  Because these 
deals were scheduled, they were showing up in Real Time.  By the way, I think 
I was talking to Carla (not Cara) about Real Time.  I apologize about the 
error.  I cannot explain why the deals are not showing up in Forward 
Obligation.

As you said, perhaps Duong Luu can resolve the issue later this week.

Thanks,
Will

Will,

I talked to Cara, and she does not agree with what you have stated below.  
She said that cross-desk deals should never show up in real-time position 
manager.  Stacey is also correct,  we have always been able to see 
cross-desks in Forward Obligations - this is not a new development.   Duong 
Luu will be in the Portland office Thursday and Friday,  perhaps we can 
resolve this issue at that time.

Thanks,

I do not understand why they would not show up in forward obligation.  
Currently, forward obs reads from Deal Entry and if they choose the region / 
delivery point that these deals are entered under they should automatically 
show up.  Maybe the forward obs is not recognizing the new portfolio.

Subject: RE: 487392 showing up as Phys when it is a cross-desk

Since I am not sure we have resolved this issue yet...

If EnPower is not recognizing the change from WEST-EAST to WEST-WEST... 
EnPower needs to be fixed.  We can manually fix any deals that are still in 
error.

Recently there has been the addition of ENAEXEC.  And some WEST-ENAEXEC deals 
have been created.  
? Should these deals appear in scheduling (according to Cara, they should at 
least show up in Real Time)?  
? Should these deals show up in Forward Obligations?  This is something that 
Portland has hinted at wanting.

Please let me know how we should start handling these new deals.

Thanks,
Will

Subject: Re: 487392 showing up as Phys when it is a cross-desk

Stacey,

I think what happened was that originally this deal was entered into with 
ST-NW as the desk and LT-MGMT as the counterparty.  Since LT-MGMT is either 
in the East or Financial Portfolio (I'm not sure - is that Lavorato's book?), 
and ST-NW is in the West Portfolio, it originally showed up as an outside 
counterparty in scheduling.  When the desk got changed to LT-WMGMT (West 
Portfolio), it should have flipped to an interdesk, which does not show up in 
scheduling.  Evidently, it didn't.  

If Enpower won't automatically recognize the change in counterparty 
correctly, I guess we will have to kill the deals and rebook them, rather 
than change the desk.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Monica

Sent email to Stacey asking her to explain the difference between cross-desk 
and cross-portfolio deals.

Yes, this is coming up as a consistent problem, these cross-portfolio deals 
are throwing us off balance.  Why are they marked physical? There is no 
delivery.

I don't think these should be marked physical.

I noticed that this deal was since changed from cross-portfolio to

FYI, all cross-portfolio deals are entered with the scheduled flag set to 
""yes"".

please Check that Deal_Schedule_yn flag to no on this.  

We need to fix the underlying bug when we get a chance.  I think it is more 
related to the cross desk deals done with EPMI LT WMGMT instead of EOL

To all:

I ran a minibook valuing the Merced correction (as of yesterday's curves), 
and confirmed that the LTNW book will lose approximately $6.8MM in value 
after the calc today.  This reverses the $7MM gain that was incorrectly shown 
in the LTNW book on yesterday's DPR.  Please let me know if there are any 
questions.

wussup wichu, brutha? just wanted to let you know i'm done with your book. it 
was a superior work of literature, by the way. i highly recommend it. if you 
want it back, send a self-addressed stamped box to 2505 NE 32nd Pl., 
Portland, OR 97212. just kidding....gosh! that's the address of my 
super-sweet house, by the way. next time you're in town you have to come over 
and have a civilized dinner in our DINING ROOM. that's right - we have one. 
and many other rooms too. it's an all-around great place to be, let me tell 
you. gotta go control your energy now. write back.

Monica Lande also came up with a list of our outstanding deals with the PX. 
It contains most of the same deals that are found in your spreadsheet, and a 
few that aren't. Also, Bob Badeer has become the leader-by-default of this 
""project."" Let me know if you'd like me to talk with him about our progress 
or have him call you. I'm not sure how involved you are, or how involved 
you'd like me to be, but I thought I'd keep you up to date on the happenings 
over here. Again, please let me know how I can help.

Thanks,
Kate

Sharen,
I saw that there was a note on this deal that Legal prepared the confirmation 
and Holli Krebs sent it to the counterparty herself.  Can you obtain a copy 
of what they sent for our files.  There is nothing in Livelink and if we 
would ever need to reproduce the document we would have nothing.  Also, it 
shows that it has not been singned unless Portland has a signed copy.

Willie -
Per our conversation - the West Power desk needs three new settlement indices 
for entering swaps deals in EnPower. The indices are as follows:

Last day settle for MIDC NYMEX contract
Last 5-day average for PALO VERDE NYMEX contract
Last 5-day average for COB NYMEX contract

Please let me know if you have any questions. The first index is a little 
more pressing than the other two - one of our traders did a futures deal a 
week ago which we have yet to swap from his book to the one it belongs in. We 
can't execute the swap until we have a MIDC settlement index. 

Thank you so much for your help.

I just spoke with Holli, and she reported that the confirmation has been 
awaiting a signature at Grant County for the past week. She said she plans to 
send it to Kim Theriot as soon as she gets it back. Let me know if that 
sounds good; otherwise, I can ask her about sending you an unsigned copy.

Thanks,
Kate

hey - how's your sexy body? don't have much time right now, but thought i'd 
drop a line to tell you that i'm so broke i'm considering picking up some 
unmentionable weekend job and therefore cannot make it down there for 
prezzy's day weekend. i'm so pissed! but it will happen soon - and anytime 
you're up here you need to stay with me - we have a guest bedroom for gosh 
sakes. also, i met malia at a party the other weekend - talk about a freakin' 
small world! she was so sweet, but then i'm not surprised - she'd have to be 
to put up with you. (ha, ha) anyway, take care, call me soon, and toast my 
absence with a bottle of wine tonight.

We've done it again, everyone.   Enron has been named the ""Most Innovative 
Company in America"" for the sixth consecutive year by Fortune.  That's right 
-- six years in a row.   We continue to be recognized by our industry peers 
and other corporate executives and securities analysts as the company that 
sets the standard for doing business in the new economy.  Congratulations to 
all of you for making it happen.

Enron placed No. 18 overall on Fortune's list of the nation's 535 ""Most 
Admired Companies,"" up from No. 36 last year.  We also were ranked among the 
top five in ""Quality of Management,"" ""Quality of Products/Services"" and 
""Employee Talent.""  

This issue of Fortune is now available in airports and will be on newsstands 
Monday, Feb. 12.  For more information, go to www.fortune.com."

Just FYI -
The tie point and Cal PX deals we uploaded this morning did in fact load as 
Enron Online deals. Oh joy!

I talked to Will Smith, who said he thought he'd heard this complaint before 
and very cordially agreed to take a look at it. I just thought I'd keep you 
informed of the latest episode in what I'm sure will be an award-winning 
series. (How about ""The Good, the Bad, and the Cal PX Bridge""?)

Here are all of the deal numbers that correspond with today's tie point, Cal 
PX, and Cal Imbalance deals. I erased the EOL transaction numbers on the 
first four, but I believe they were going in a sequence beginning at 627.

Just for everyone's information - I've entered two buys from Seattle City 
Light to negate an earlier sale of power to the company (Deal 317868). The 
deals are as follows:

515404
STCA buys SCL
2/8/01-2/28/01
SP-15
Off Peak
$115.00

515420
LTCA buys SCL
3/1/01-3/31/01
SP-15
Off Peak
$115.00

I'm giving you this disclaimer either because you asked me to enter the deal, 
the deal is in your book, or the deal will affect your calc. The volume is 
shaped between 1 and 2 MW. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate"

This deal was entered as New Counterparty which is fine for a short period of 
time.  However, within a few days someone needs to make sure to change the 
deal to the correct counterparty name.  Can you look into this and let me 
know?

Dear Daily Power Report Readers:

Attached to this message you'll find ""Restructuring Today's Top CEO 
Interviews of Year 2000,"" a 28-page compilation of exclusive interviews of 
leaders of the new converging energy and communications industries.

The book is filled with insights into what CEOs forging the new industry 
expect and how they are planning for the unexpected:

Kenneth Lay, Enron, dean of the energy industry, spent 45 minutes telling 
veteran editor George Spencer about Enron's huge success on the web, his 
formula for success and how Enron is looking at ""every industry in the 
world."" May 5, 2000

David Sokol of MidAmerican Energy told about their key role in federal 
legislation. October 31, 2000

David Freeman, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, told how they make 
big money from southern California turmoil. July 6, 2000

Glen McCullough of TVA was a member of the three person board when 
interviewed but is expected to be named chairman and CEO soon. July 21 & 24, 
2000

Wayne Brunetti, Xcel, although not widely known as yet, heads one of 
America's largest utilities operating from the Ontario border to the 
Arizona-Mexico border. October 4, 2000

Steve Baum of San Diego Gas and gave shocking news of underscheduling. 
October 8 & 9, 2000

Robert Best at Atmos Energy collects LDCs from his office in Dallas. April 21 
& 24, 2000

Paul Lewis, the former IBM web expert brought in to run Essential.com, talked 
about life on the internet. September 13 & 14, 2000

John Kean Jr may be the most innovative gas industry executive. He was not 
satisfied running a group of LDCs he got from his father.

Judi Johansen, when interviewed was at the helm of the federal agency that 
dominates Pacific Northwest pricing and transmission policy. May 24 &26, 2000

Harvey Padewar is CEO of Duke's unregulated family of companies and told of 
the firm's aggressive growth plans. June 8, 2000

Eugene Lockhart CEO of the leading firm in our business. December 8 & 11, 2000

John Rowe EEI Chairman and Exelon co-CEO. December 29, 2000

These interviews are just a click away -- simply open the attached PDF file

feel free to pass it along to anyone you think might benefit from the 
insights within. We simply ask that you not change the document or send an 
excerpt.

We hope you and your colleagues find Restructuring Today's Top CEO Interviews 
of Year 2000 very useful and entertaining.

This was entered before we had the option in EnPower to enter deals under 
California Energy Resource Schedulers - CERS. It's been changed.

Did you find out anything about this deal?  We really need to get this out of 
the NEW Counterparty status.

Thanks!

This deal was entered as New Counterparty which is fine for a short period of 
time.  However, within a few days someone needs to make sure to change the 
deal to the correct counterparty name.  Can you look into this and let me 
know?

Thanks!

Willie -
Per our conversation - the West Power desk needs three new settlement indices 
for entering swaps deals in EnPower. The indices are as follows:

Last day settle for MIDC NYMEX contract
Last 5-day average for PALO VERDE NYMEX contract
Last 5-day average for COB NYMEX contract

Please let me know if you have any questions. The first index is a little 
more pressing than the other two - one of our traders did a futures deal a 
week ago which we have yet to swap from his book to the one it belongs in. We 
can't execute the swap until we have a MIDC settlement index. 

Thank you so much for your help.

Nancy,

I have attached a draft Confidentiality Agreement for your review. If it is 
acceptable, please sign and fax a copy to me at 503-464-3740. We should be 
able to begin work with a faxed document in place.  

As we discussed, we need to analyze two sources of water for the project; 
city water and the port's well water. Please overnight the containers for 
collection of the water to me at: 

Enron North America
121 SW Salmon, 3WTC 0306
Portland, OR 97204
(Tel.: 503-464-3830)

Ed Clark and I will collect the water samples Friday morning and overnight 
them to you (Saturday delivery) to make sure that they are there first thing 
Monday morning. 

I was able to find a Well and Water Right Evaluation that was performed by 
Robinson and Noble, Inc. If you could send your fax number to me and to Kate 
Symes (ksymes@enron.com), we will fax you a copy for your review. I will also 
work on getting you a conceptual design of the project for analysis of the 
waste water flow.

Thank you in advance for your assistance and speedy response. I realize that 
we are targeting an aggressive date (the morning of October 23) for the work 
to be completed. 

Sincerely,
Laura Wente
503-464-3830

Enron is forming a new organization - - the Enron Xcelerator - - to drive the 
formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John 
has been an essential part of Enron's energy trading success over the years 
and is a key part of Enron Wholesale Services' continuing success story.  
Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of Enron 
NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated Enron's outstanding growth with the 
deployment of EnronOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of Enron 
Americas.

Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks will take 
over as President and CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership, 
Enron has become a technology leader and the leading e-commerce company.  
Joining Philippe as Chief Operating Officer is Greg Piper, currently Managing 
Director of Enron NetWorks.  Greg currently leads Enron NetWork's origination 
activity and was responsible for the creation and deployment of ClickPaper, 
Enron's successful online pulp and paper marketplace.

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their 
achievements and their new responsibilities.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

East Power Group
The East Power Group is off to another strong start in 2001.  The realignme=
nt=20
of the group into regional business units with joint trading, mid-marketing=
,=20
and origination operations has proven to be a catalyst for deal flow,=20
producing both a high volume of transactions and high value.  More=20
transactions were executed in January than any month last year, including o=
ne=20
deal that will bring tremendous strategic value to Enron as well.

Executed in January, was the purchase of two 35 MW coal-fired cogeneration=
=20
facilities located in southeastern North Carolina.  ENA will supply steam t=
o=20
the industrial host, Alamac Knit Fabrics, and will sell power into the=20
merchant market.  The plants are inside Carolina Power & Light's service=20
territory, which is connected to AEP, Virginia Power, Duke, SCEG and SCPSA.=
 =20
These plants are the first purely merchant facilities in North Carolina. =
=20
This deal exemplifies how Enron leverages its talent in that originators fr=
om=20
the East Power Group and Industrial Markets Group joined forces to bring th=
is=20
deal to execution.  They also leveraged the Global Markets group to manage=
=20
the coal supply and emissions issues.

Prospects going forward look promising as a number of high value transactio=
ns=20
are in the pipeline.  Of particular note is The Sandhill Power Project, a 1=
80=20
MW peaking facility currently under construction in Austin.  The facility i=
s=20
scheduled to come online in June, in time for the advent of deregulation in=
=20
Texas. The joint venture, between EPMI and Austin Energy, will provide both=
=20
trading groups with a highly flexible asset, enabling them to access=20
real-time volatility while hedging existing obligations.

Additionally, the Fort Pierce (Florida) City Council voted 5 to 0 in favor =
of=20
Enron's proposal to repower the Ft. Pierce Utilities Authority's (FPUA)=20
existing power plant in that city.  Our proposed 180 MW facility will be us=
ed=20
to produce steam to power the H.D. King facility at approximately 20 percen=
t=20
less cost than FPUA can produce it.  According to FPUA officials, this=20
reduction in cost may lead to reduced rates for their ratepayers.  The=20
planned in-service date is summer of 2002.

Industrial Markets
EIM Fundamental Analysis Group grows again!  The Fundamental Analysis Group=
=20
continues to expand its staff and capabilities.  They will be introducing y=
ou=20
to specific activities in the weeks to come, but would like to introduce yo=
u=20
to the new staff members who have joined in the past month. =20

On the paper/pulp/lumber side, Bin Wang is responsible for supporting the=
=20
lumber group; Adnan Patel will be assisting with newsprint and structured=
=20
transactions. =20

For the steel group, Doug Parsons and Yana Kristal are providing market=20
analysis and econometric/price forecasting support.  Our latest recruit,=20
David Maxwell, is assisting with the evaluation of a customer management=20
system and developing analytical databases for all product lines. A visible=
=20
enhancement to the group=01,s operations has been the Intranet web site, wh=
ich=20
has been in development for the past three months.  The site will be=20
transferred to a production server by the end of February.  The site contai=
ns=20
all types of industry, market, regulatory, analytical, and financial=20
information for deal analysis. =20

Another major development is the adoption of a customer information=20
management system.  EIM is currently evaluating Siebel Systems, a software=
=20
provider that has developed this type of information tool for EES.


IN THE NEWS

Enron has been named the ""Most Innovative Company in America"" for the sixth=
=20
consecutive year by Fortune.  That's right -- six years in a row.   We=20
continue to be recognized by our industry peers and other corporate=20

Monica Lande also came up with a list of our outstanding deals with the PX. 
It contains most of the same deals that are found in your spreadsheet, and a 
few that aren't. Also, Bob Badeer has become the leader-by-default of this 
""project."" Let me know if you'd like me to talk with him about our progress 
or have him call you. I'm not sure how involved you are, or how involved 
you'd like me to be, but I thought I'd keep you up to date on the happenings 
over here. Again, please let me know how I can help.

Thanks,

Kate, please ask Sean Crandell if the following deals need the ""special 
phrase"" ..The Parties agree and acknowledge that this Transaction is 
connected with the transaction referenced in Deal No. 347356.1 entered into 
between the Parties on May 31, 2001.

Jack Wells of Conoco called and said that the phrase should be included in 
confirmations: 506549.01..506550.01..506551.01 and 507417.01 and 507430.01.  
Please ask trader if deals are related to the 347356.01.  Sharen has inquired 
once before and we were under the impression that the deals were separate and 
not included.  Please let us know.

Jack Wells is the contact for both - I've added his name to deal #507417. 
According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal 
was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just 
buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only 
connection. Let me know if you need more of an explanation from the traders, 
but our take is that these deals are separate.

Are these two deals part of the original Conoco deal # 347356 that they are 
extending or something different?  We need to know because we have to add 
something in the confirmation if they are extensions of the original deal.  
Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?

Thanks!

I spoke with Sean Crandall, who told me that from his standpoint the deals 
ARE separate; however, John Malowney is the mid-marketer who works with 
Conoco, and he told me that this special language is fine to include in the 
confirmations for these deals. Turns out I was just asking the wrong person. 

Let me know if you need comments added in these deals.

Subject: Deal 507430 and 507417

Are these two deals part of the original Conoco deal # 347356 that they are 
extending or something different?  We need to know because we have to add 
something in the confirmation if they are extensions of the original deal.  
Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?

Thanks!

Kate, I have done extensive research to obtain the Nymex prices that you have 
requested, and I have concluded the following.
Nymex website does not show a code for Nymex MIDC contract
Nymex Palo Verde (KV), and Nymex COB (MW) do not show settlement prices for 
these power contracts.
Finally, are you sure these are Nymex contracts.
I have checked the Nymex website at: http://www.nymex.com, under Markets, 
Commodity Codes, Futures and Options Data, 
Nymex Divisions Futures Contracts, MIDC, PV, and COB Electricity, Settlement  
Data without results. Stacey White (Enpower Pub Posting), 
Kimat Singla (Risks), and Jeremy Wong (IT), have no idea on the locations of 
the prices  in Nymex.  Can you possibly get
with the trader that made the deal to fill us in on the location to these 
prices, or if he will supply us with the prices that he wants posted?

Thanks, wlh"

Hi Kate,

I think Mike traded  deal 516618 late because I did not confirm this deal 
with Prebon yesterday.
Prebon shows 16mw and Enpower has 10mw.

FYI

DJ FERC Affirms It Lacks Jurisdiction In Pwr Facility Sales
Copyright , 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.



WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
Wednesday reaffirmed its policy finding that it lacks jurisdiction over 
generation facility transfers.

     The Federal Power Act requires the commission to approve jurisdictional 
asset transfers greater than $50,000 in value. But FERC doesn't view 
generation assets as jurisdictional.

     FERC often rules on generation asset transfers, but only in the context 
of associated transmission assets and power sales connected with the 
generation assets. FERC regulates electricity sales, but not the plants that 
produce the power.

     With divestiture of generation assets becoming increasingly common in 
the $215 billion U.S. electricity sector, this policy has increasingly been 
questioned by consumer interests and others.

     Most recently, the American Public Power Association and Citizen Power 
Inc., a utility watchdog group, petitioned the commission to reconsider its 
view that generation asset transfers, absent associated transmission 
facilities and power sales agreements, don't fall under FERC jurisdiction.

     At issue were generation asset sales by Duquesne Light Co. (DQZ), and 
FirstEnergy Corp.'s (FE) transfer of power plant ownership from its utility 
operating units to FirstEnergy's competitive services unit.

     The commission was unpersuaded by arguments of APPA and Citizens Power 
that state regulation is inadequate to protect the public interest and 
promote competition in the restructuring electric utility industry.

     ""There is no necessary nexus between the interstate transmission or sale 
of electric energy, on the one hand, (the triggering events giving rise to 
our jurisdiction) and the disposition of a generation facility by itself,"" 
FERC said.

     ""Not only does the statutory text support our interpretation, but there 
is no precedent, legislative history, or case law which would support a 
contrary conclusion,"" FERC said, denying the petition.

     FERC cited section 203(a) of the Federal Power Act as conferring 
authority to regulate the disposition of ""facilities subject to the 
jurisdiction of the commission."" FERC has never asserted jurisdiction over 
generation assets, and has traditionally left that to state utility 
regulators.

The ""two sides of a cross-portfolio deal"" language is a bit vague and 
misleading. A cross-portfolio deal is kind of like a desk to desk deal. 
Another Enron book has traded with one of ours.

Two important things need to happen with cross-portfolio deals.
 1. They need to only show on the forward obligation report when ""Desk to 
Desk"" is selected.
 2. They are only financial in nature, no physical delivery is ever done 
cross portfolio.

I don't think ""both sides"" is correct. We need to only see our buy or our 
sale when we query for our point.  When the other portfolio queries their 
stuff, they should see their side.

     If you find a deal No like that, I think it will make my job easier.

Finally! After a slight uphill battle, we've successfully entered the first 
three futures deals under the Mid-Columbia NYMEX settlement price. Because 
all of you were involved in this process in one way or another, I thought I'd 
let you know that it was successful in the end, and forward the deal numbers 
along for reference. They are as follows:

TAGG Futures Deals - QQ0362 (J-01)
               QQ3837 (K-01)
                  QQ7050 (M-01)

ENPOWER Swap Deals - 517925 (J-01)

These deals have a contact name - Don Imamura - in them now. I asked Tracy 
Ngo, our credit person, about NCPA's credit status, and she said that since 
they've been done, it's now a matter of risk management or damage control - 
if it should even come to that. At any rate, the deals are good and now have 
contact info.

Thanks,
kate

There are 4 deals for Northern CA Power Agency and they have wonderful notes 
about confirming them together.  However, I need a contact name, and isn't 
NCPA on the credit watch list?

Thanks!

This is an automated function of Deal Blotter. I have called Will Smith to 
let him know it's malfunctioning; but all deals not using NP15, SP15, or ZP26 
should default to Firm Energy. I've also changed the energy to Firm in Deal 
#458255. If you could let me know the other deal numbers that need to be 
changed, I'll follow up with those too.

Thanks,
Kate

Hello-
Looks like alot of Mark Fischer's west deals are coming over as CAISO firm 
energy, for example deal 458255.01.  Please change, needs to be Frim Energy, 
we will need to revise the Confirmation Letter.  CAISO energy on NP 15, SP 
15, and Zp 26 delivery points only.

Thank you
Stephanie

517384 - price has been changed to $260
517891 - mike's book shows Palo delivery - desk was wrong - has been changed 
to LTNW
517884 - price has been changed to $300
517876/877 - missing Amerex deals were under wrong desk (STCA) - have been 
changed to LTNW

Also, I entered many of Mike's deals today, but in my rush forgot to re-set 
my Deal Blotter defaults - so the deals went in under Short Term California 
instead of Long Term Northwest. I've changed them all to the correct desk, 
which should clear up the missing deals, and hopefully will make more sense 
for your checkouts. Sorry about the confusion - entering deals for three 
different desks at once gets a little hectic!

Let me know if you have questions.

Kate

It looks like you made quite a few changes to some deals and I don't see 
anything in the comment section.  Can you just take a quick look and see if 
you know what you changed on any of these.  If not, I can look it up in the 
audit viewer, but it makes things go a lot quicker if we don't have to go 
into the audit viewer for each deal.

Thanks!

With Teri's departure, Grace Rodriguez will begin to assist me and Rick 
Johnson on HR related matters.  She will also continue to support the 
Technical Analysis group until a suitable replacement has been identified.  
In the meantime, Grace will be supported by Elizabeth Squires to assist with 
ad hoc duties.

Please join me in congratulating Grace on her new responsibilities.

508957 - changed offset from -1.5 to -1 on 2/6 per Stephanie Piwetz (verbal 
Mirant checkout)

All the rest of the deals I entered for Mike Swerzbin yesterday in my deal 
blotter, which defaults to Short Term California. I noticed immediately after 
saving the deals that they were under the wrong desk, and changed them to 
Long Term Northwest in deal entry. Are there other problems with the deals? 
The only change should be the desk. Please let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

Due to the larger than normal volume of activity, the report is being 
distributed earlier this month.  The goal here is to give everyone more time 
to move deals and contracts on those records scheduled for inactivation on 
03/01/01.    You have received notification on the name changes as they have 
occurred.  

Please find attached the Name Change/Merger Notification Report for February 
15.  To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select Enable 
Macros and Read Only.
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Mar 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.  

As always, please contact me at x33103 with any questions or concerns."

Due to the larger than normal volume of activity, the report is being 
distributed earlier this month.  The goal here is to give everyone more time 
to move deals and contracts on those records scheduled for inactivation on 
03/01/01.    You have received notification on the name changes as they have 
occurred.  

Please find attached the Name Change/Merger Notification Report for February 
15.  To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select Enable 
Macros and Read Only.
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Mar 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.  

As always, please contact me at x33103 with any questions or concerns.

I've left a message for Mike Swerzbin, the trader on these deals. They're 
both in Enpower the way they're in his trade log, so I don't want to change 
anything until I talk to him. I'm also going to call Judy Dyer at EES for 
confirmation on the 517876 price. I'll let you know.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: West new futures deals

Jeremy:

Thanks for your help yesterday as we finally got the three new futures deals 
calc-ed.  However, we had a problem with the Mid Price that TAGG system 
pulled for evaluation of these deals.  

Specifically, from the Fowards Detail Report for post id 1035917, we found 
that TAGG was using $3.75 as Mid Price for these three new deals (#QQ0362.0, 
#QQ3837.0, #QQ7050.0).  However, the curve prices for mid-columbia as of 
yesterday (2/8) for these three deals should be $290, $280, and $330, 
repectively.  

So, 
1. We are wondering where the $3.75 came from?
2. Would you please let us know the ""Org. Region"" and ""Commodity Code"" that 
TAGG is using for these three new deals?  I need to communicate these codes 
to Enpower Support so they can translate these codes to what they should be 
in Enpower in order for Enpower to recognize these deals.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran

 CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY: POWER MARKETS 2001

February 12, 2001:
Crisis and Opportunity Update

If you're like the tens of thousand of others who read the Power Marketing 
Association's Daily Power Report, you know that our industry faces 
unprecedented crisis.? Blackouts, credit crunch, electric and gas price 
volatility, low hydro levels--? and we're not even near the summer.?? What 
are we facing??

Now is the time to think, to plan, to solve tomorrow's problems before they 
arise.?? Join us at the Power Marketing Association's Seventh Annual Spring 
Meeting: Power Markets 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY:? MARCH 14-16, 2001, 
Aladdin Hotel, Las Vegas, NV. 

Crisis grabs the attention, but the opportunities are almost palpable.? Just 
click on the headline for the full story at powermarketers.com:
 
SENATE PANEL PROBES EMERGENCY NATURAL GAS ORDER?
A Senate committee on Friday sharply questioned the way a Cold War-era law 
has been used to keep California's natural gas flowing.???Use of the 1950 
Defense Production Act to compel suppliers to sell to financially strapped 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., California's largest utility, was a legal 
stretch that could theoretically leave taxpayers holding the bag, said Sen. 
Phil Gramm, R-Texas.

CRAIG HYDROELECTRIC POWER BILL TO STREAMLINE LICENSING PROCESS
With an energy crisis that is quickly seeping out from California to Idaho 
and other western states, the Senate is considering legislation that would 
streamline the licensing of hydroelectric power plants.?? The bill would 
place FERC back at the helm of the licensing process, reinstating its 
authority to balance environmental and corporate interests under the Federal 
Power Act. 

WESTERN LEADERS TALK ENERGY GOVERNORS SEEK TO SPEED POWER PLANT CONSTRUCTION
Facing an energy crisis expected to worsen by summer, 10 Western governors on 
Friday asked the Bush administration to streamline environmental regulations 
in an effort to speed construction of new power plants.? The request came as 
Western leaders meeting in Portland predicted California-style blackouts 
could plague the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest this summer unless the 
federal government intervenes immediately.

 CAPSTONE LAUNCHING GENERATOR SALES PUSH POWER SHORTAGE CREATES MARKET
Moving to capitalize on California's energy crisis, Capstone Turbine Corp. 
said Wednesday it is launching a subsidiary to serve that market while 
boosting the staff that sells its innovative power generators.

 NEW POWER PLANTS NEEDED QUICKLY
Hoping to stave off summer blackouts, California will dramatically speed up 
the approval process for new power plants in hopes of adding electricity for 
5 million homes by July, Gov. Gray Davis said Thursday.?? Under an executive 
order, Davis said the state will cut red tape and give bonuses to small power 
plants that operate only during peak hours of the day, provided those 
facilities can be up and running by summer.

517884 - price has been changed to $300

Also, I entered many of Mike's deals today, but in my rush forgot to re-set 
my Deal Blotter defaults - so the deals went in under Short Term California 
instead of Long Term Northwest. I've changed them all to the correct desk, 
which should clear up the missing deals, and hopefully will make more sense 
for your checkouts. Sorry about the confusion - entering deals for three 
different desks at once gets a little hectic!

Let me know if you have questions.

Hi,

Here is my update from our second leg.  Not quite as thorough as the first
one I'm afraid, but we're going to be saving our better writing for venues
other than the web site.  Pictures should go up on the site soon.

Greater Yellowstone Ski Traverse

Update for Leg 2: Cora to Jackson

The Unbearable Lightness of Skiing

By Win Goodbody

Joe and I were in good spirits after the first leg.  It was a perfect opene=
r
to our winter in Greater Yellowstone.  Despite the brutal cold and a
marathon exit day, it was, on the whole, an enjoyable time.  Perhaps too
enjoyable.  After almost 5 days back in town mending gear, mind, and body,
we departed for our second leg in the Gros Ventre Range with a cavalier
attitude.  Though we had budgeted 10 or 12 days for this traverse, we now
thought it might take only a week.  But we were wrong.  Instead of a walk i=
n
the park, the Gros Ventres were a lesson in how slow and difficult progress
can be when the weather turns bad.   We were sternly reminded that in
adverse conditions, the mountains hold all the cards.

We traded sleds for packs on this 60 mile trip from Cora to Jackson.  It ha=
d
been a long time since I carried a full pack, and somehow I forgot there is
a world of difference between pulling and carrying weight.  Joe wisely
trimmed down as he set out what he was bringing.  Imagining more stellar
sunrises and sunsets ahead, I was determined to tote the same 20 pounds of
camera gear I had with me on the first leg.  Big mistake.

As we hefted our loads and pulled away from the car, I knew I was in
trouble.  My pack towered over Joe=01,s.  I could just barely lift it off t=
he
ground.  It looked like I was setting off for months.  In addition to
filling every cubic inch of interior space, I had so many items lashed to
the outside I felt like a backpacker=01,s version of the Joad family, who f=
led
the dustbowl with all worldly possessions hanging off their battered truck
in =01&The Grapes of Wrath=018.  I was to fare about as well on this trip a=
s the
poor Joads did in Steinbeck=01,s bitter novel.

Good weather persisted as we made our way up Rock Creek to the high crest
that runs continuously from just east of Bondurant all the way northwest
past Jackson to Slide Lake and the Gros Ventre River.  We had hard-packed
snow machine tracks to follow for the first two days.  On day 4, approachin=
g
the first pass by Hodges Peak, we got a taste of world class wind.  It is
not for no reason that Wyoming is a prime site for development of
wind-generated power, we learned.  Like the cold on the first leg, wind was
to be our constant companion on this trip.  It raged through the gap,
knocking over full water bottles left standing on the snow during a break.
Luckily the air temperature itself was mild or we would have been turned
into frozen statues.

After traversing around the west side of Doubletop Peak through worsening
visibility, we emerged into clear, calm air and a stunning sunset.  We had
not known ahead of time whether or not we could get through a gap between
two sets of cliff bands.  If we couldn=01,t, it was going to mean dropping =
a
few thousand feet into a steep drainage we would then have to climb back ou=
t
of a mile or so farther along.  But the gap went through easily, and we
turned the corner to find ourselves staring at a classic multi-tiered rock
shelf that stretched away for two miles toward our next pass.  The red glow
of evening coated sheer walls above as we made camp among giant boulders.

We were now solidly up on the Gros Ventre high route.  On the map, it was
amazing how little actual distance remained between us and Slide Lake, the
terminus of this section.  We had simply to cross a high basin, another
drainage, and then follow a high plateau to Sheep Mountain, from which it
was =01&all downhill=018.

The wind was blowing hard as we passed Palmer Peak the next day and set our
sights on the Crystal Creek drainage.  A little while later it was blowing
really hard.  We couldn=01,t tell whether the snow flying horizontally past=
 us
was falling from the sky or being stripped off the ground, but either way
visibility was poor.  We went nonstop for a few hours to get off the expose=
d
high basin where the Gros Ventre River originates.

Descending Crystal Creek we took our skins off and skied at a pleasant pace
through nice powder snow to the valley floor.  As we went lower and got out
of the wind, we could see that it was indeed snowing, and that there was
about a foot of new snow on the ground.  Whereas up high the wind kept much
snow from accumulating and sculpted what little coverage there was into a
rock hard surface, down here in the still, densely treed valley the snow wa=
s
deep and light.

That night we cheered ourselves by digging out a large shelter for our
floorless cooking tent.  The Megamid is a pyramid tent that sets up easily.
After digging a square pit several feet down, you erect the tent with one
center pole and have a large, warm area to sit in.  Sheltered from the wind=
,
we were very comfortable and drank cup after cup of tea and cocoa as we
consulted the map and assessed the route ahead.  We hoped to wake and find
blue skies.  Island in the Sky, the plateau that was to be our highway for
the remaining 5 or 6 miles before we descended toward Slide Lake was not fa=
r
away.

The storm wasn=01,t over the next day, but it had stalled a bit.  We moved =
down
the valley through deep snow and then started to climb up an adjacent fork.
Dense woods slowed us to near a standstill, but by nightfall we had reached
a spot where, at least in clear weather, we should have been able to see th=
e
final climb up onto the Island.  The storm was now back on track, and as we
got higher we could feel the first brushes of what was undoubtedly a
screaming wind up on the Island.  Again we excavated a deep pit for the
Megamid and passed a warm evening inside, wondering what the weather would
do tomorrow.

The next day, as was now becoming the pattern, the morning was almost clear=
.
  We got ourselves going and continued traversing up the side of Crystal
Creek=01,s West Fork headed for Island in the Sky.  As we passed over steep=
er
terrain, we noticed how fragile conditions had become with the additional
load of new snowfall.  Everywhere we went we heard the snow collapse, and
shooting cracks ran in all directions.  Sloughs moved on even the smallest
hillsides.  We sincerely hoped we would be able to find a route that did no=
t
cross any open slopes.

By afternoon, true to form, the storm was back in high gear.  Trailbreaking
was knee deep.  If film had been taken of us at this point, maybe replaying
it at fast forward speed would have looked like a normal pace.  The weight
of my pack was becoming painful.  My left leg had strange tingles running
down it and was slightly numb.  Joe said that happened to him sometimes whe=
n
he carried a heavy pack.  =01&Have you been carrying a heavy pack recently?=
=018 he
deadpanned.

Despite the storm, we could see the edge of the Island.  We were right at
the base of it, and only a few hundred feet of climbing would be necessary
to get on top.  We were now at the head of the West Fork drainage, and as w=
e
approached treeline, the wind increased.  Though it was only 2 pm, we
decided to camp and wait one more day to see if the storm would abate.  If
we were going to venture up high in these conditions, we wanted to start
first thing in the morning to have a full day to make our way across safely=
.
  For the third night in a row, we built a snug Megamid shelter.

I was awake most of that night listening to the wind and snow, sometimes
thinking it was easing.  But by morning the four day old storm was coming o=
n
strong.  It was day 8 of our trip.  We weren=01,t getting any breaks this t=
ime.
  Knowing it could in fact go on like this for days, we decided the sooner
we got up and over, the better.

Trailbreaking was difficult as we left the trees to negotiate a few small
cliff bands.  At one point Joe set off a little slough that moved him
downslope about 50 feet.  The terrain was such that we were in no real
danger, but conditions were flashing a bright red light at us.  We knew we
had no steep slopes to reckon with, so we continued on, hugging a scoured
ridgeline where grass poked through the snow.  Soon we were on top.

Island in the Sky is a featureless plateau that runs for three or four mile=
s
just south of Sheep Mountain and due east of Jackson Hole.  It is as high o=
r
higher than anything to the immediate west, and is thus exposed to the full
force of the prevailing wind.  As we shuffled onto this no man=01,s land, I
felt like a bug on a windshield.  The wind was shrieking.  Visibility was
almost zero and we were navigating by compass alone.  I found that looking
straight down at my skis was the best way to maintain balance, as otherwise
there was nothing to see but white and it was hard to tell whether you were
standing or falling.

We leaned into the wind with poles splayed out on either side.  Sharp gusts
or sudden pauses would precipitate frantic movements as we tried to readjus=
t
our stances.  We were in the thick of it.  I think we both realized the
seriousness of our position, though we didn=01,t talk about it.  Of course =
we
could always retreat and wait another day, but the desire to get out was
strong.  As we continued, four or five times, just when we really needed
some guidance, we caught brief glimpses through the clouds of a ridge or
valley far below.  These moments were enough to figure out where we were.
After two or three hours of feeling our way, we made it to the base of Shee=
p
Mountain.  Visibility was too low to see down the slope we thought we could
descend, so we set up our tent prepared for a windy night.

Waking up to clear skies in a place where you went to sleep unable to see
anything is an interesting feeling.  Down below was Jackson, and we were
eight miles from the road.  It all seemed so much simpler now that we could
see.  Of course we ended up making a wrong turn, and a six hour bushwhack
through enormous downfall and dense woods ensued.  Reminiscent of our last
exit, darkness saw us staggering onto a packed snow mobile trail.  A few
more miles and darned if those weren=01,t headlights coming toward us: a fr=
iend
picking us up, and just in time.  We really have to stop driving on those
trails.

Taking that weight off my back for the last time was a relief.  As blood
flowed and feeling returned, I resolved to never again overload myself that
way.  No more stuff hanging every which way off my phone booth-sized pack.
Never again.  I would be a Joad no more.

This is an automated function of Deal Blotter. I have called Will Smith to 
let him know it's malfunctioning; but all deals not using NP15, SP15, or ZP26 
should default to Firm Energy. I've also changed the energy to Firm in Deal 
#458255. If you could let me know the other deal numbers that need to be 
changed, I'll follow up with those too.

Thanks,

Hello-

energy, for example deal 458255.01.  Please change, needs to be Frim Energy, 
we will need to revise the Confirmation Letter.  CAISO energy on NP 15, SP 
15, and Zp 26 delivery points only.

Thank you
Stephanie

Mike still has not returned my calls, and is not at work today. I checked 
with Mike Driscoll, Swerzbin's assistant, and he confirmed that 517876 should 
be $300. It's an EES spread, and the other side (deal #517877)  is $313 - is 
that what Amerex is looking for? He also checked into 517891 and found that 
the delivery point should be SP-15. It's been changed.

Let me know if there are further questions.

Mike Driscoll just talked with the broker, and they agreed to the price Enron 
has - broker will change the checkout sheet now. Sorry for the confusion.

deal 517877 is a SELL for Q2 at COB AT $313............THIS DEAL HAS BEEN 
CLEARED.

Mike still has not returned my calls, and is not at work today. I checked 
with Mike Driscoll, Swerzbin's assistant, and he confirmed that 517876 should 
be $300. It's an EES spread, and the other side (deal #517877)  is $313 - is 
that what Amerex is looking for? He also checked into 517891 and found that 
the delivery point should be SP-15. It's been changed.

Let me know if there are further questions.

Thanks,
Kate

517384 - price has been changed to $260
517891 - mike's book shows Palo delivery - desk was wrong - has been changed 
to LTNW
517884 - price has been changed to $300
517876/877 - missing Amerex deals were under wrong desk (STCA) - have been 
changed to LTNW

Also, I entered many of Mike's deals today, but in my rush forgot to re-set 
my Deal Blotter defaults - so the deals went in under Short Term California 
instead of Long Term Northwest. I've changed them all to the correct desk, 
which should clear up the missing deals, and hopefully will make more sense 
for your checkouts. Sorry about the confusion - entering deals for three 
different desks at once gets a little hectic!

Let me know if you have questions.

I just got out of a meeting and read your e-mails. I have no idea why she 
would have used this counterparty name, but looks like it's all taken care 
of. Let me know if you need anything further on this.

Nancy,

I have attached a draft Confidentiality Agreement for your review. If it is 
acceptable, please sign and fax a copy to me at 503-464-3740. We should be 
able to begin work with a faxed document in place.  

As we discussed, we need to analyze two sources of water for the project; 
city water and the port's well water. Please overnight the containers for 
collection of the water to me at: 

Enron North America
121 SW Salmon, 3WTC 0306
Portland, OR 97204
(Tel.: 503-464-3830)

Ed Clark and I will collect the water samples Friday morning and overnight 
them to you (Saturday delivery) to make sure that they are there first thing 
Monday morning. 

I was able to find a Well and Water Right Evaluation that was performed by 
Robinson and Noble, Inc. If you could send your fax number to me and to Kate 
Symes (ksymes@enron.com), we will fax you a copy for your review. I will also 
work on getting you a conceptual design of the project for analysis of the 
waste water flow.

Thank you in advance for your assistance and speedy response. I realize that 
we are targeting an aggressive date (the morning of October 23) for the work 
to be completed. 

Sincerely,
Laura Wente
503-464-3830

These ARE a kind of desk-to-desk deal, but officially they are 
cross-portfolio deals, because they cross from the ENAEXEC to WEST portfolio. 
I'm not familiar with Unity, but let me check around here and see if anyone 
knows where these deals should be settled. Also let me know if the fact that 
they are cross-portfolio deals helps you at all. That's all I know right now.

If its just an internal move, then it doesn't get paid as far as I 
understand.  Its an internal thing.  Thanks for the info.  Unify is the 
system that creates our invoices.

We don't have fees on the BUY side of an EES sleeve - this particular deal is 
the sale side. Unfortunately, Matt had scribbled something next to this deal 
that looked like ""no bro"" which usually indicates no fee, but it was actually 
"".015 bro."" Anyway, that's probably more information than you 
needed.....sorry!

             Cara,

      I think the report should work that way even now.

     I think I found a deal like that 498488 between EPMI Southwest and EPMI 
Southeast,
     Region R7, please take a look at that when you test the report.

       
       I saw lots of deals on the report with volume 0 and price 0, they were 
entered that way
       in Portland. There might be another reason, but I think someone wanted 
to kill the deals.
       There is an option in Deal Entry to do that, if one opens a deal and 
right click with the
       mouse on the status (Done), one can kill a deal.  


           Kroum

The ""two sides of a cross-portfolio deal"" language is a bit vague and 
misleading. A cross-portfolio deal is kind of like a desk to desk deal. 
Another Enron book has traded with one of ours.

Two important things need to happen with cross-portfolio deals.
 1. They need to only show on the forward obligation report when ""Desk to 
Desk"" is selected.
 2. They are only financial in nature, no physical delivery is ever done 
cross portfolio.

I don't think ""both sides"" is correct. We need to only see our buy or our 
sale when we query for our point.  When the other portfolio queries their 
stuff, they should see their side.

I'm not quite sure how this exchange began, but it sounds like Kroum is 
referring to several different issues here. First of all, our forward 
obligation report does not reflect cross-portfolio deals, an application 
issue that Will Smith, and it looks like Kroum as well, has been working on 
for the past few weeks. 

Also, deal 498488 is a forward deal done on EOL between STSW and their own 
desk. I haven't seen a trade WITHIN a desk before, but I'm sure anything is 
possible. At any rate, this doesn't look like a cross-portfolio deal at all. 
Am I missing something?

As for the zeroed out deals, I'm pretty sure everyone here knows how to 
properly kill deals in Enpower; however, it takes so long that sometimes we 
simply zero out the volume in the interest of time. I've often wondered if 
this litters the system and makes it more confusing for other people to do 
their jobs - do you know anything about that?

I just thought I'd ask these questions while the subject was being raised. 
Please let me know if I can help facilitate these changes or improvements in 
any way.

Thanks,
Kate

All of these have been changed, and the real time desk has been alerted. I 
believe Bill Williams is working on a list for his traders to refer to when 
in doubt of counterparty names. I'll check up on that and let you know.

Thanks,
Kate

Trades with TransAlta go through their energy marketing subsidiary, called 
TransAlta Energy Marketing (US) Inc. These deals were in under the parent 
company, TransAlta Energy Marketing Corp. I know this is petty, but it makes 
people like Rhonda cranky. For some reason she feels it is an offense 
punishable by reaming. I don't. This is just a  reminder.

I just sent Kroum a little missive on our familiarity with the ""killed"" 
feature, as well as why we often zero out deals (Transmission in particular) 
in scheduling only. If I have to teach a course on scheduling for him to 
understand how to build this report I will do it, but I am not really dying 
to do that.

As far as our situation here, If you can properly kill a deal, you should do 
that instead of just zeroing the volume. I quite often have great success 
having many terminal server sessions open at once, and doing the slow stuff 
through a few different channels of TS.  Even as we speak, I am running one 
report for 6 different months, 1 in each of the 5 terminal severs, and one 
locally.  I learned that trick in our old winframe system, and it has served 
me well.

I have torn my hair out over this cross-portfolio vs cross-desk thing.  I 
have explained it to both Kroum, Duong Luu, and Will each at least 3 times.  
How hard is it to get the concept that anything we sell to ourselves is not a 
physical deal?

I would say just keep sending them to me, so we don't all have to pull our 
collective hairs out. The deal you reference below is kind of like a life 
preserver thing. When the market makes a sudden move, it is sometimes faster 
to 'hit' the deal through EOL then pull it on the traders side.  It's not the 
best way to go, but better than losing a bunch of money.

Subject: Desk-to-Desk v. Cross-Portfolio

I'm not quite sure how this exchange began, but it sounds like Kroum is 
referring to several different issues here. First of all, our forward 
obligation report does not reflect cross-portfolio deals, an application 
issue that Will Smith, and it looks like Kroum as well, has been working on 
for the past few weeks. 

Also, deal 498488 is a forward deal done on EOL between STSW and their own 
desk. I haven't seen a trade WITHIN a desk before, but I'm sure anything is 
possible. At any rate, this doesn't look like a cross-portfolio deal at all. 
Am I missing something?

As for the zeroed out deals, I'm pretty sure everyone here knows how to 
properly kill deals in Enpower; however, it takes so long that sometimes we 
simply zero out the volume in the interest of time. I've often wondered if 
this litters the system and makes it more confusing for other people to do 
their jobs - do you know anything about that?

I just thought I'd ask these questions while the subject was being raised. 
Please let me know if I can help facilitate these changes or improvements in 
any way.

Thanks,

             Cara,

      I think the report should work that way even now.

     I think I found a deal like that 498488 between EPMI Southwest and EPMI 
Southeast,
     Region R7, please take a look at that when you test the report.

       
       I saw lots of deals on the report with volume 0 and price 0, they were 
entered that way
       in Portland. There might be another reason, but I think someone wanted 
to kill the deals.
       There is an option in Deal Entry to do that, if one opens a deal and 
right click with the
       mouse on the status (Done), one can kill a deal.

The ""two sides of a cross-portfolio deal"" language is a bit vague and 
misleading. A cross-portfolio deal is kind of like a desk to desk deal. 
Another Enron book has traded with one of ours.

Two important things need to happen with cross-portfolio deals.
 1. They need to only show on the forward obligation report when ""Desk to 
Desk"" is selected.
 2. They are only financial in nature, no physical delivery is ever done 
cross portfolio.

I don't think ""both sides"" is correct. We need to only see our buy or our 
sale when we query for our point.  When the other portfolio queries their 
stuff, they should see their side.

Great - that all sounds about like what I'd expected. Thanks for the 
multiple-terminal-server tip. Again, I'm more than happy to help get this 
forward obligation report up to speed and producing the kind of data we need 
- just let me know.

if you'd like it included on the graph sheet. I think it might be too tight

This is an automated function of Deal Blotter. I have called Will Smith to 
let him know it's malfunctioning; but all deals not using NP15, SP15, or ZP26 
should default to Firm Energy. I've also changed the energy to Firm in Deal 
#458255. If you could let me know the other deal numbers that need to be 
changed, I'll follow up with those too.

Mike Driscoll just checked with the broker - it should be SP-15 - he's having 
the back office change it.

Thanks,

458406 has been changed to off peak.

458733 - Chris thinks this is with APB, but says it may be Prebon. We tried 
to check with Prebon or APB, but no one was at either desk. I'll try to 
contact Evelyn (who I think checks out with Prebon) to see if she's missing 
any deals.

Let me know if APB gets back to you.

Can you have Mike double check the volume for the Sierra Pacific deal.  I 
looked back over my notes and I put 25 then I put 50.

Thanks!!

Prebon just sent over a confirm where Mike Swerzbin:
buys from EES 25 mw of Q2'01 Palo off-peak at $124.95.


Is this a good deal because they did not tell me about it?

The Dow Jones report is compiled of data sent from many different 
counterparties. The lovely people at Dow Jones painstakingly analyze the data 
to ensure its accuracy. Averaged together, these prices become the Dow Jones 
daily index price. And that's the long and short of it. 

The process, as you've guessed by now, is a little more complicated than 
that. For one thing, Dow Jones looks at each counterparty's sales to reach an 
average of all the prices. It would be redundant for each counterparty to 
ALSO report their purchases from each other. Therefore, when calculating the 
Dow Jones data, we only include purchases from counterparties who ARE NOT 
participants in the Dow Jones survey. Following is a simple example:

Participant List  NP-15 Purchases  NP-15 Sales  Reported NP-15 Purchases 
Reported NP-15 Sales
Sempra  Sempra - $250   Sempra - $250  Avista - $270   Sempra - $250
Duke   Duke - $260   Duke - $260      Duke - $260
Enron   Avista - $270   Avista - $270      Avista - $270

Now that's simple!

Following is the participant list for Dow Jones' survey of trading at NP-15 
and SP-15 delivery points. Deals with these counterparty names need to be 
excluded from the calculation of PURCHASES at NP-15 and SP-15 delivery points.

American Electric Power - Amerelecpo
Avista Energy - Avistaene
Duke Energy Trading and Marketing - Dukeenetra
El Paso Merchant Energy
Enron Power Marketing, Inc. - EPMI
Idaho Power Company - Idacorpene
PacifiCorp - PACE
Pacific Gas & Electric Company - PG&E
Powerex Corp. - PWX
Puget Sound Energy, Inc. - PSPL
Mirant Americas Energy Marketing (formerly Southern Company Energy Marketing) 
- SCEM
TransAlta Energy Marketing (US) Inc. - Transalt

So I've probably succeeded in confusing you even more, but please feel free 
to come bug me with questions. Good luck!

To all:

Over the past few months, Energy Operations has formally established global 
standards.   Exception reporting will officially begin for the West Desk on 
Monday, November 20th.  The exception reporting around these standards will:
help us gauge our performance and highlight areas for improvement
better allocate resources to issue areas
ensure individual and global business controllers are up to date as to 
arising issues

To accomplish this, numerous requirements have been established.  The  
requirement that affects trading is as follows:

Transactions are recorded accurately and timely (completeness, accuracy)
Transactions are recorded with 100% accuracy and valued appropriately in an 
approved risk system for the applicable product
Transactions are input into Enpower or TAGG on date of trade (prior to calc)

HOW THIS AFFECTS WEST TRADERS:

The Risk group in Portland and Confirmations group in Houston will now begin 
reporting any exceptions to the above requirement on a daily basis.   Any 
deals entered late, incorrectly or changed after the calc will require full 
written explanation to the Global Risk Controls group (this includes trader 
name).  The materiality of the deal is not relevant, you can be written up 
for 1 MW deals or 200 MW deals.  The Global Risk Controls group is looking 
for flaws in the process, whether it be people-related or system related.  

This exception reporting begins on Monday.  Please come to the Risk group 
with any questions you may have, we would like the West Desk to appear on the 
exception report as infrequently as possible.  If you have any special deal 
types that you believe will be in violation of the above requirement, please 
notify Risk so we can communicate this to Global Risk Controls.

Thanks for your help in this matter,

West Risk

Kate, I think Tom Alonso entered this trade under the wrong counterparty. I 
think it should be FPL Energy Power Marketing instead of Florida Power and 
Light. I received a confirm from FPL Energy Marketing for this trade. Can you 
as Tom and then change in system if I am correct.

Thanks for your help!"

Kate, same thing on this trade. I think it should be FPL Energy Power 
Marketing b/c I received a confirm on it. Secondly on the confirm it states 
that hour 0100-0600 is priced at $95.00 and then again at hours 2300-2400. 
7-22 is priced at $140. However I do not show in the system 1-6 and 23-24 at 
$95. Did he forget to put in the off peak or is FPL incorrect.

Thanks,

I spoke with Mark Fischer about this - Tom Alonso stepped out of the office 
for a minute - and he said Tom would probably want to talk to his contact 
with FPL. So I'm going to wait before changing these counterparty names. I'll 
also check with him on the off peak hours for 517518, and get back to you in 
just a minute.

Thanks,
Kate

517518 and 517520 have been changed to FPL Energy Power Marketing; and Tom's 
sticking by his price on 517518. Would you mind sending me Jeff Wallace's 
phone number if you have it? These guys are still busy trading, so I'd like 
to take care of it myself if I can.

I just signed this very important petition to the President and
Congress urging them NOT to allow drilling in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge, our most magnificent wildlife sanctuary.  Drilling would
cause great harm to this wilderness area which is one of the few truly
wild places remaining.

Please go to http://www.savearcticrefuge.org,
add your name and pass it on!!!

Thank you all for being so patient with me while I am under Carla's wise 
tutelage. Hopefully I'll be up to speed in the next few days, but if you 
notice me doing anything insanely wrong, don't hesitate to yell.

One thing that has lagged slightly, but will be making a comeback tomorrow, 
is the Deal Correction Report. Every afternoon I'll check up on discrepancies 
noted by Houston and determine the source of the error. If the source of the 
error is you, me, the broker, or the computer gods, it will be noted in the 
error report and given to Risk Management to assist them in their daily 
calculation.

I spoke with Kim Hundle and deal # 458802 is not with EES I wasn't sure if I 
had wrote the number down wrong or not.  Sorry.    I also spoke with Neil 
Bresnan after we had spoke and he had said it should be no problem getting 
you on the list.  I will check again and I apologize for the delay.

You're right - 458802 is a deal with Constellation, but it's part of a sleeve 
Mike Swerzbin did for EES. Thanks for the spreadsheet, and for getting me on 
the mailing list.

I spoke with Kim Hundle and deal # 458802 is not with EES I wasn't sure if I 
had wrote the number down wrong or not.  Sorry.    I also spoke with Neil 
Bresnan after we had spoke and he had said it should be no problem getting 
you on the list.  I will check again and I apologize for the delay.
Thanks
Judy

Monica Lande also came up with a list of our outstanding deals with the PX. 
It contains most of the same deals that are found in your spreadsheet, and a 
few that aren't. Also, Bob Badeer has become the leader-by-default of this 
""project."" Let me know if you'd like me to talk with him about our progress 
or have him call you. I'm not sure how involved you are, or how involved 
you'd like me to be, but I thought I'd keep you up to date on the happenings

Bob Badeer is handling the negotiations of the index changes, and he has 
assured me that all deals liquidating within this month have been updated.  
He is still working out the other deals.  If this is causing you any 
difficulty, please let me know.

Kate, called to verball non broker deal,
I didn't realize Diana and Valerie are working on this with Sharen here in

it was an expiry date, he thought it was exercised upon daily, just double 
checking..........just fyi

violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its 
potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

harassment prevention training soon.  This training is mandatory for all 
ENRON employees.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment

UTILITIES CONSIDER COAL AS A FUEL FOR FUTURE FOR FUTURE POWER PLANTS DUE TO 
STABLE PRICE AND SUPPLY ACTIVISTS ARE PREPARED TO MOVE TO COAL
  Skyrocketing oil and natural gas prices are leading power- generating 
utility companies to reconsider coal as an attractive fuel for future power 
plants.?? ""Coal tends to be more predictable, both in pricing and supply, 
than either oil or natural gas,"" said Vic Svec, vice president of public 
relations with Peabody Group. ""We expect to see more coal- based generations 
in the future.""

Looks like a real time guy put this deal in - along with three others - for 
El Paso. Real Time isn't used to marking confirms on their deals, since 
they're usually just trading hour-ahead. Let me know how you'd like these to 
be changed (i.e. ""yes-agreement"" or ""yes-counterparty to send confirm""), and 
I'll do that right away.

Thanks,
Kate

This deal looks to me like it needs to be confirmed, but it was marked no 
confirm.  Do you know of a reason why it shouldn't be confirmed?  If not, I 
need a contact name so that i can send out a letter on it.
Thanks!
Kim

Sorry for the confusion, Sharen. I checked with the traders, and found that 
Deal #458391 does NOT need to be confirmed per Paul Choi in Mid-Marketing, 
who entered the deal with Valley Electric.

Deal #457963 DOES need to be confirmed. It was a trader mistake.

Thanks, 
Kate

These two deals were input as not to be confirmed.  They look like they 
should be confimed to me.  If they do not need to be confirmed, please put 
the reason in the comments in deal entry.  Otherwise, please change to be 
confirmed and let me know.

Thanks!

1. Because 2/18 is a Sunday and this is an off-peak deal, no hours will be 
counted for 2/18. If you need me to change the term anyway, I can. Let me 
know.
2. The rest of these deals traded on Bloomberg after Jeff Richter and Chris 
Mallory left for a power marketing conference. This caused many problems, as 
you can see. Following are the added or corrected deals: 

  1) 523831 - changed from Dynegy to Reliant - corrected
  2) 524481 - buy Duke/March-01/NP/265.00] - added
  3) 524482 - same terms - added

Let me know if you have any further discrepancies with these deals.

Thanks,
Kate

not calculate any volume for 2/18 because it is a Sunday (all off peak hours)

deal 523882
Per Amerex the term should be 2/17 only not 2/17-2/18 - same as above

The above trades were entered in Jeff's deal blotter with a Saturday/Sunday 
mask; I guess Carla has done this before and said it shouldn't make a 
difference because Sunday is an off-peak day and these are on-peak deals. If 
it does make a difference in reference to your group, please let me know and 
I'll be happy to pass the message on to the traders and anyone else who 
enters deals. I can also change those deals if necessary.

Thanks,
Kate

Good Morning,

Over the last couple of weeks, we've made several recent additions to the 
Portland IT applications team.  We hope that with this new influx of talent 
we will continue to ""raise the bar"" for IT support of Enron's trading 
activities in Portland.

Richard Schweiger is our new Senior Applications Specialist. He comes to 
Enron through RHI Consulting where he contracted at Enron for the last 2 
months and has now converted to full-time.  Richard has several years of 
Visual Basic and C++ programming experience. He has been living in the 
Portland, Oregon area for the past 4 years and is originally from 
California.  His current projects include migration of the California 
Pre-Trade application to the intranet as well as building strong middle tier 
architecture to support the new CAL-Web development.

Michael Tully is our new lead Trading Floor Support analyst.  He recently 
moved from Oklahoma where he was the Lead Help Desk Support for Electronic 
Storage Corporation.  Mike's wife is due with their second baby in January.  
Outside of work, Mike love's to scuba dive.  Mike is currently working for 
Comsys and hopes to eventually convert to full-time.  Mike is replacing 
Wendella Rhoads who recently moved back to Eugene to be closer to family.

Dan Maxwell is a new contract developer from Maxim consulting working on the 
California Pre-Trading application.  Dan currently lives in Boise, Idaho and 
commutes to Portland during the week.  Dan spent the previous year commuting 
to Washington DC developing software for GEICO insurance company.  He is 
originally from Miami, Florida where the beach is the place to be but 
counting is a lost art.  

Paul Kane has recently transferred from the IT infrastructure group to the IT 
applications group to work on SQL support and development.
 
On a sadder note, we will be losing Winston Goodbody on December 18th to a 
six month cross-country skiing trek across Wyoming.  Winston has been 
contracting at Enron for the last year and a half and will be sorely missed.

Thanks,  David Poston

Jeff Richter - all deals are on peak - do not recognize Sunday off-peak hours

Chris Mallory - 523831 changed to Bloomberg deal

Matt Motley - 524308 in trade log as buy Aquila/May-01/25 mw/Prebon at 
$260.00 - Matt is tied up in conference right now, but judging from the other 
May deals in his blotter and from his curves, this price is correct. $160 is 
about $100 less than anything else trading at that time. Ask Prebon where 
they got that from...

Thanks,
Kate

We show peak both in Enpower and in Mike's trade log. I'll check with Mike in 
the morning - but in his log he has off-peak circled - that could either mean 
he was questioning it or he was absolutely sure about it - we'll find out 
though!

Thanks,

Kate this trade is from yesterday.

Prebon sent over a confirm for off-peak hours and then sent a revision to 
peak hours.  Which one is it?

Hi Kate, Deal # 509086.01 is still in the system at the PX index instead of 
the Dow Jones SP-15 index.  This trade was done on January 30, 2001.  We just 
received the new index language from Steve Hall in Portland.  I was going to 
confirm this trade but it has the old index.  There is another deal done the 
same day that has been changed (509087) to the new index.  I know some of the 
deals that are not flowing have not been changed because Bob Badeer is still 
negotiating with the counterparties.  Is this one that can be changed since 
it started flowing Feb 1?

Let me know,

Thanks,
Melissa"

This deal is the same as all the others Carla Hoffman entered yesterday - in 
the interest of time, she entered all deals with a Saturday-Sunday mask in 
Deal Blotter. If the deals were on peak, she said it shouldn't matter that 
they were marked to flow both days, because Sunday is all off-peak hours. I 
explained this in a couple e-mails yesterday - I guess I got confused about 
who I told. Carla said she's done this before and it shouldn't be a problem. 
Please let me know if you agree with this. In my opinion, just taking the 
time to explain the discrepancy in the 10 or 12 deals that were entered this 
way actually took more time than it saved. What do you think?

Kate

Kate,  

A request (below) has been made to fix a deal that was entered by Tom and 
Mark incorrectly (through the option exercise function in deal blotter).  The 
deal numbers and legs that need to be fixed are listed below.  Instead of 
being a forward transaction, these legs should be entered as index forwards.  
We are paying the DJ PV index plus $5 or 5%, whichever is more.  Therefore, 
if daily prices were more than $100 at palo verde, the offset should be 1.05.

I know that i have totally confused you but let me know of any questions you 
might have and I will be glad to help.

Thanks,

Kim

Caroline,

Deal #420886 legs 3-7 have no price attached to the deal.  Would you please
add the DJPV index plus an offset of 5%.  On legs 2 & 8 the offset needs to
be changed from $5.00 to 5%.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank You,
Katrina

Kate,

I understand that the deals are not actually flowing on Sunday but for 
auditing/reporting purposes per Melissa Murphy, these deals need to display 
the correct term of 2/17 only instead of 2/17-2/18.

The deals are:  523881, 523882, 523877, 523875, 523876, 523879, 523880, 
523883, and 523884



Thanks!!

1. Because 2/18 is a Sunday and this is an off-peak deal, no hours will be 
counted for 2/18. If you need me to change the term anyway, I can. Let me 
know.
2. The rest of these deals traded on Bloomberg after Jeff Richter and Chris 
Mallory left for a power marketing conference. This caused many problems, as 
you can see. Following are the added or corrected deals: 

  1) 523831 - changed from Dynegy to Reliant - corrected
  2) 524481 - buy Duke/March-01/NP/265.00] - added
  3) 524482 - same terms - added

Let me know if you have any further discrepancies with these deals.

Please let me know the outcome.

Matt Motley - 524308 in trade log as buy Aquila/May-01/25 mw/Prebon at 
$260.00 - Matt is tied up in conference right now, but judging from the other 
May deals in his blotter and from his curves, this price is correct. $160 is 
about $100 less than anything else trading at that time. Ask Prebon where 
they got that from..

These deals have been changed - just thought I'd let you guys know, for 
future reference, that deals scheduled to flow during on peak hours only 
should not be booked through Sunday. Even though the system won't recognize 
any Sunday hours, apparently it messes with Houston's reports. 

Thanks,

Matt just talked to his broker and verified the price at $260. If the back 
office doesn't recognize this in the next couple minutes, tell them to TALK 
to Rodney Drake, the Prebon broker who seemed to be quite sure that our price 
was right. I'm sorry this is causing chaos on your end - but sometimes I 
wonder if the brokers are communicating with people in their own office....?

Surprise, surprise - Mike checked with his broker at Amerex, who said he has 
April written down for this trade. Mike asked him to re-confirm with his back

Let's start over: 


ISSUE 1-Mike Swerzbin
deal 524248 and deal 524266
This two deals checkout with Amerex fine.  Amerex has one deal at 50 mw and 
we have two identical deals at 25 mw.

deal 524247
This deal checks out with Amerex fine.

The deal that I am missing is Enron buys from EES 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for 
Q3'01 at $285.95.


ISSUE 2- Mike Swerzbin
deal 524267
 Amerex has 50 mw and we have 25 mw.

ISSUE 3- Dianna Scholtes
deal 523984
Amerex has price as $345 and we have price as $335.


This has been a terrible ordeal and I will be so glad when everthing is 
resolved!!!

Thanks
Evelyn

Issue 1 - Mike Swerzbin
Missing deal = 524266 (Enron buys EES - 25 mw - off peak - Mid C - Q3'01 - 
price is $285.95)
 Mike Driscoll just spoke with Amerex broker, who confirmed he wanted the 
five-cent fee on a different deal (524247), not this one. Our price is right.

Issue 2 - Mike Swerzbin
Mike agreed to 50 mw, but if we change this deal we have to change the other 
side - therefore, 524267 and 524266 will both be changed to 50 mw.

Issue 3 - Diana Scholtes
This is the first I think I've heard about 523984 - I'm sorry if I overlooked 
it. Diana says it's $345 - it's been changed.

Let me know if this resolves everything.

Kate

This deal is the same as all the others Carla Hoffman entered yesterday - in 
the interest of time, she entered all deals with a Saturday-Sunday mask in 
Deal Blotter. If the deals were on peak, she said it shouldn't matter that 
they were marked to flow both days, because Sunday is all off-peak hours. I 
explained this in a couple e-mails yesterday - I guess I got confused about 
who I told. Carla said she's done this before and it shouldn't be a problem. 
Please let me know if you agree with this. In my opinion, just taking the 
time to explain the discrepancy in the 10 or 12 deals that were entered this 
way actually took more time than it saved. What do you think?

Thanks for the update, Ryan. I've forwarded the e-mail along, and hopefully 
you'll continue to get a good response from all the Blazer fans here. I had a 
chance to catch last night's game - if you could call it that - against the 
Kings. Now all we have to do is pull a Tonya Harding on Chris Webber and 
we've got a chance at the championship! 

I also thought I'd mention that I'm no longer in the same position with 
Enron. I moved into commodity trading a few months ago, so TECHNICALLY I'm 
not the point of reference for Blazer matters - Mollie Gustafson is. I've 
retained the title only because I happen to be the most outspoken fan on the 
floor; so I love receiving all the latest news. But if you ever have a more 
urgent matter, or, for example, when it comes time to renew our season 
tickets, you'll want to call Mollie. She's the woman with the checkbook, so 
to speak. 

In the meantime, feel free to contact me with news about deals, discounts, 
free tickets, a date with the team, etc. (ha,ha)

How did you know Steve Smith would be my first choice for a Blazer date? 
Maybe I'm not as original as I thought I was.

Anyway, I think you've got it straight. Mollie is the administrative 
assistant in charge of ordering and paying for season tickets for the 
Origination group. I'm a trader's assistant  who once worked for Mollie and 
stole the Blazer responsibility out from under her nose. We still cross paths 
every now and then, so anything that comes to me will get to her. 

Thanks for taking such good care of our sporting needs. And you have a great 
weekend too. Don't forget to take a moment of silence for our past Presidents 
on Monday.

energy markets wrought by the web, and it's just beginning. Implecations of 
the internet for energy markets. E. Russell ""Rusty"" Braziel, Chairman and

Hey Dad -
Thanks for your update on the status of the sailing club's opening day. For 
my purposes, April 22 works better simply because I probably won't be coming 
anyway..... Just joking. Looks like I mistakenly made it onto your sailing 
club e-mail list. Unless I'm really invited to opening day?

Kate

Subject: Proposed date change for WSC Opening Day



After some discussion about WSC Opening Day date,  Marilyn and I would like 
to propose moving it from Apr. 1 to Apr. 22. Our  reasoning is as follows:
?
1. Apr. 1 is last day of spring break which will be  a conflict for many WSC 
families. It's also just a week after the board chili  feed on Mar. 25.
?
2. Apr. 22 is the last Sunday of series sailing  before we go to evenings. 
It's the week after Easter, chances for good weather  are marginally better, 
and there are no conflicts that we are aware  of.
?
If you have any suggestions pro or con, please let  me know by Wednesday (we 
need to publish date in Mar. Telltales). If not, we'll  go with Apr. 22. 
Thanks,
?
Bill

Enron requires that we purchase all of our equipment through a central 
purchasing process.  The reasons for doing this are two fold.  

1) Enron supports only certain technologies.  It is important to standardize 
the technology sitting on each person's desktop to ensure it works with other 
technology already on your desk and that the IT staff knows how to support 
the use of this technology.

2) Enron has cut deals with suppliers that give us good prices.  In the past, 
the Portland office has not strictly adhered to this policy.  We had good 
business reasons for not complying--we could buy the same equipment at the 
same price a lot faster if we just bought it ourselves locally.

Here's the problem.  People have not always bought the ""same"" equipment.  For 
example, people have recently purchased flat screen monitors that are 
different than the Compaq flat screens that most of us use.  This requires 
our technology group to understand how the different screens work, whether 
they need different drivers installed on your hard drive, and what to do with 
them if they break.  There are numerous other examples.  In aggregate, this 
practice has put additional strains on our already constrained technology 
support staff and will cause us problems in the future if any of the 
non-standard equipment breaks and can't be fixed or replaced in a hurry.

Accordingly, Dave Steiner and I would appreciate it if you would do the 
following when purchasing technology.
All pending and future purchasing requests should now go through the local IT 
Department.  
Please send an email to the ""IT Portland"" email account when you have an IT 
related need such as a Palm Pilot, LCD screen, special software, etc.  
The local IT team will then assure compliance and availability of the 
requested item(s) and get back to you with cost, ETA, and any other relevant 
information.
If the centralized Houston purchasing process is too slow to meet our 
business need, IT Portland will investigate buying the exact same product 
locally.
 
Again, our goal is to streamline the process while conforming to corporate 
standards.  This will also assure that the items acquired will work with 
existing infrastructure and be easily supported by our IT team.  The team has 
assured me they will be prompt in responding to your requests.  If you have 
any questions, please contact Dave Steiner or me.  Your adherence to this 
process is appreciated."

Thanks for thinking of me during your consolidated e-mail spree. It's always 
nice to arrive at work Monday (or in this case Tuesday) morning and receive 
something other than urgent, faceless messages demanding my immediate 
attention. I received those as well this morning, of course, but being who I 
am decided to respond urgently to the frivolous ones and frivolously to the 
urgent ones.

Your Sunday sounds incredibly more productive than mine - pity. After a quick 
survey of the very little mess left after you two left (THANK YOU!), Molly 
and I decided to bag any further cleaning and instead go for a drive through 
some of the nicer Portland neighborhoods, admiring gardens here and paint 
colors there. Everyone was out enjoying the crisp sunshine and inhaling our 
exhaust fumes. But watching from our comfortable car seats was about all we 
could muster after the weekend's debaucheries. Then we returned home for a 
movie marathon that did not, you correctly assumed, include the Philadelphia 
story. We did watch two fabulous films - ""The Virgin Suicides"" and 
""Croupier,"" both of which I highly recommend. We built a gigantic bed out of 
couch cushions and drank chamomile tea until we passed out. 

Amber the mysteriously absent roommate turned up Monday afternoon, and I was 
amazingly more angry than I had previously thought, mostly because she walked 
into the house smacking of defensiveness, ready to fight. So rather than 
disappoint her expectations, I gave her what she wanted, only with more 
volume. If the neighbors didn't hear us Saturday night, they can be sure 
somebody lives there now.

I've got a call in to my friend Scott to locate Mr. Down Under Wine guy. In 
my slightly more sober state, I'm starting to feel like he may own a winery 
in Australia, not New Zealand. We'll find out for sure later today. And I'll 
let you know when I hear from him.

Thanks again for making the trip DOWN to Portland - you guys were great 
company. I'd love to come to Seattle this weekend; however, I never make 
plans more than one day in advance. I've found myself to be much too flaky 
for that. Let me know if you need notice sooner than that. 

Take care,
Kate

I know you won't get this until Tuesday, I just thought I'd write for the 
purposes of consolidation. It was great meeting you and thanks for your 
hospitality and easy-going ways. I wonder if you watched the Philadelphia 
story. Probably not, but it's not going anywhere. It's a bright sunny day 
here in Seattle and, over a couple?of cups of coffee, I wrote all morning. At 
some point I'm going to go outside and do something today. A walk around the 
lake perhaps or a hike through the woods. 
?
Anyway, I don't have a lot to say. Thanks in advance for your help in getting 
me in touch with the New Zealand dude and do think seriously about coming 
down for dinner next weekend. Stay in touch,
jordan

It was great - we ended up having a really eclectic mix of people. You should 
have stopped by! No worries, though, I'm sure we'll have many more. Thanks 
for the info for Molly - I'll pass it along, for whatever it's worth. Also, I 
noticed you hadn't deposited the check yet - if you'd like, I can bring you 
cash at about 11:30 this morning. Just thought maybe that would be easier for 
you. Let me know.

Kate,
Amerex has a deal on their web checkout traded by Diana on 2/14 where:
Enron buys from Coral 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for 2/15-2/16 at $420.00

I do not see this deal in Enpower.  


When I checked out with Amerex on the 14th all deals were confirmed.  When I 
cleared their deals all deals were cleared.
It is our policy to go back and check their web site for additions, changes 
etc. once every week for the week before and this deal popped up.

Can you please check to see if the schedulers received any confirmation of 
flow for this deal from Coral?

Thanks!!

Hi guys.  I just talked to Willie in Houston and thought I'd pass along what 
he told me.

He said that the Index prices are going to be automated probably by the end 
of this week (that means no more manual entry).

If we have problems with the numbers in EnPower, contact Willie Harrell at 
6-853-9226
If we have problems with the numbers in Unify,  contact  Kelly Lombardi at

Kate,

to cover my you know what.....this will be the new daily checkout for all of 
my brokers.  I am sending this to ensure a quality checkout to minimize any 
risks associated with our transactions.  Even if I don't have any errors I 
will still send a summary everyday of my checkouts for the west deals.  We 
have had several deals pop up from the brokers that we didn't know about and 
did not verbal the day of the trade and this will serve as proof of the 
previous days checkout.

Bend like a reed in the wind? It's funny you should say that, since I've been 
reading a lot about Buddhist philosophy lately. I stayed with a couple in 
London who practice Buddhist meditation pretty regularly. Ever since then 
I've thought something like that would do a world of good for my mental 
health, being that I've always been more of a giant steel piling than a reed 
when the wind kicks up. I did let her have it, don't worry; but my Catholic 
guilt always gets the best of me, and I assure you I'll be extending all 
kinds of undeserved compassion by this evening.

As far as the sick thing goes - screw that. That's one occasion you cannot 
take lying down, or bending like a reed as it were. You sabotage that thing 
with vitamin C and some uber-multi-vitamin and echinacea and hot water with 
lemon and honey and 14 hours of sleep a night UNTIL IT RUNS SCREAMING FROM 
YOUR BODY. I hate being sick...almost as much as I hate bending like a reed. 

Speaking of Woody Allen - I saw his new one, ""Small Time Crooks,"" last night. 
I'd give it an unenthusiastic ""mediocre."" Rent it if you've exhausted all 
other options. Tonight I think we're going to check out ""Traffic"" - I've 
heard rave reviews. Or otherwise it's ""Cinema Paradiso"" for the 
sixty-thousandth time, but this time on the big screen. The deciding factor 
will be money, and beer. ""Traffic"" will cost twice as much as ""Cinema,"" but 
the theater showing ""Cinema"" has comfy couches and serves beer, so I'll end 
up spending twice as much as I would at ""Traffic."" Do you see the moral 
dilemma here? 

I'm sorry to ramble, but today happens to be alarmingly devoid of surprises. 
Having said that, I'm practically positive some catastrophe will occur in the 
next 30 seconds, so I'm going to go now.

Kate

I can't believe that bitch would just wander into the house full of ire and

to until she grows up. If I were you I'd follow the Buddhist path--extend 
compassion to her, don't let your state of mind be controlled by what she 
does, bend like a reed in the wind, etc. Anyhoo . . .

I started to get a little sick last night. Think I might have been running a 
fever, so I came home and went to bed early. But I don't always sleep so 
well. The bed I'm?using gives me the distinct impression that I'm sleeping on 
a grade, that I'm slipping into a pit or a valley. My dreams?are always about 
climbing out of things. And then Hector the dachshund sleeps on the bed with 
me and even though he's only about a foot and a half long, it always seems 
like he takes up all the room. Oh, I'm just complaining. Cross your fingers 
that I don't get sick.

""Croupier "" I've always wanted to see. Glad you give it the thumbs up. I 
think I'm going to head downstairs and watch a movie myself. Perhaps Woody 
Allen's ""Manhattan,"" an old fave I haven't seen in years.

Talk to you soon. Oh yes, and about the weekend. Of course I give you the 
""flaky""?time allowance you need. I would demand the same for myself. If you 
decide to come down, you don't even have to tell us until Friday or Saturday. 
You don't even have to tell us at all. You could just come and not see us and 
head back Sunday if you want. We are that tolerant of flakiness here. No, 
seriously, if you feel like coming it would be wonderful to see you. If not, 
another time will come.

beloved brokers and traders. Thanks for your persistence with all of this - I 
know it gets frustrating. Please let me know whenever I can help - I'm trying 
to respond quickly to the e-mails coming from Houston confirms, but in the

checkout today and promise them another cookie tomorrow if they get their 
deals right!!! ahahahaha

Hey there stranger!

Thanks for the pictures - they've definitely been the highlight of my day. 
It's funny that you sent those now, because over the weekend Molly and I had 
our big housewarming blowout party, and - speaking of strangers - Michael (of 
sushi fame) and his friend came down from Seattle for it! Weird, huh. I don't 
see or hear from the guy in half a year, and then in the same three days he 
not only comes to my house but shows up in my e-mail. 

I can't chat right now - things are just coming to a rolling boil here at 
work. But I'll give you a call this evening. Are you packed for Spain yet? 
Are you ready to leave the laid back island like to which you've grown 
accustomed? Is everyone there still as crazy as when I left them? Write back, 
or give me a call. I'd love to hear the update.

Take care,
Kate"

Subject: RE:


What up dude!

I haven't heard from you in awhile, so I thought I would remind you that you
have a sister and she lives in Colorado and she has no friends and no life
and one psycho roommate and is therefore desperately in need of sane
conversation/gossip through which she can live vicariously.  How's it going?
Are you feeling better?  Is the roommate situation improving?  Mine is SO
not.  And to add to the drama, lonesomeness has once again driven me into
the arms of a man with whom I undoubtedly have no future.  He launched a
surprise attack on Valentine's Day - when my guard was obviously down.  Yes,
it's still the colorblind starbucks guy.  We were just going to go out for A
drink, but 9 vanilla stoli and cokes later we were making out like teenagers
in a prom limo.  Even his baby poop green blazer-style leather jacket had
started to look like an acceptable outerwear addition to his camel-colored
wide-whale corduroy and pumpkin orange sweater ensemble.  It was madness.
So anyway, I shacked, and unfortunately now a precedent has been set, so now
I pretty much spend most of my day coming up with various believable reasons
for not spending the night at his house.    It's been almost a week so I
think he's starting to suspect something.  Little does he know that by the
time this whole debacle is over, he will wish he had never heard the name
""Anna Symes"".  He's great and fun and everything, and yet I feel that
familiar desire to kill this relationship - and not just kill it, but shoot
at it and kick it in the head even after it's dead.  Think I have issues?

Other than that, not a lot happening over here.  I like my new job, although
right now it's really dead and I find myself wondering what I'm supposed to
be doing a lot of the time.  I have been playing phone tag with Monica, but
I think I might start stalking her a little more intensely as I am in
desperate need of some friends.  Actually, starbucks guy and I had an
interesting conversation about this last night.  I have been feeling so down
lately, and I finally realized that this move was a million times harder
than London or Argentina were because I am literally starting from scratch
in the social department.  Michelle is scary and therefore does not count as
a source of moral support or even pleasant conversation.  I'm trying to see
this as a positive thing, like a challenge to see if I can be happy without
the network of people I have always had around me.  I know it's not the
Peace Corps or anything, but it's still kind of scary.  Anyway, that's my
deep thought for the week.  I'm sure soon enough I'll be crying yet once
again about how I want to come home, but for now I'm great (I think!).

By the way, have you heard Ben Lee (singer)?  He Claire Danes' boyfriend, so
you may have heard of him before.  Anyway, you have to check him out - he's
awesome!  The cd I like the best has the word hurricanes or volcanoes or
something in the title (sorry, I can't remember exactly).  It's a good
feel-good cd.  So let me know how it's going out there in P-town, and when
are you coming to visit?  Okay, love you, miss you, etc.!

Besos,
Anna

Hey there - I'm so sorry I haven't responded until now. I've been swamped
with work, moving, and now the flu. Whoo, hoo! So, as far as gossip is
concerned, I'm all dried up for now. I was going to go on a company ski
trip this weekend, but I feel so crappy I can't even imagine being outside,
let alone surrounded by snow and wind at the same time. I imagine you're
totally used to that by now, but keep in mind your weather is accompanied
by sun and not eternal grayness.

Our house is coming along nicely. Molly and I already want to boot Amber
out, but that's okay. We deal with it by laughing about her antics whenever
possible - behind her back or in front of her face. It really helps us out,
and I think it does wonders for her ego too. Work is work. The weather is
foul! Men are too. I don't even have one prospect at this point. Of course
there's always the innocent, fleeting crushes from a distance; but I've got
to admit I hardly even have the energy for those anymore.

I hope you can make it home for a visit soon, because you are going to LOVE
our house. I will definitely keep my eyes peeled for cheap tickets to
Denver, or maybe I'll just do the train and take a long weekend. Either
way, I'll definitely make it there by springtime. Tell me about your jobs,
friends (or not?), and life in general. I'm going to get back to work and
hustle so I can get out of here early and suffer peacefully at home. I'll
give you a call from my sick bed, 'kay?

Take care,
Kate

Here you are, ladies. As per our prior discussion, these are the Dow Jones 
index price reports I promised to send you. Let me know how this works for 
you. If there are no questions, comments, or concerns, I'll forward the 
e-mails to you each week on Tuesday afternoon as soon as I receive them.

And thanks for encouraging Willie Harrell to automate the pub-posting system. 
Sounds pretty logical to me!

crunch -- is driving an interest in nuclear power to heights not seen in 
nearly a generation. ?For the first time since the 1970s, a utility company 
is talking with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about building new units 
somewhere in the United States, using a design completely different from 
plants anywhere else in the world.

So didya hear the Blazers creamed the Nuggets last night? I always knew the 
Pacific Northwest would dominate in sports - they're not battling with that 
ol' Rocky Mountain High if ya know what I mean.

Well I'm sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday - work was hectic and I 
knew that if I started an e-mail to you it would either be half-assed or I'd 
never finish it. Well, I'm going for the former now, because I realized there 
would never be a good time to divulge the full and sordid details of what's 
happening around here, and all the while I wait, more and more important 
nuggets (get it!) of gossip are accumulating.

So it's quite appropriate that you wrote yesterday with roommate issues - 
mine could not be worse. Amber took off for the ""library"" on Thursday night 
and came home.....four days later. After Molly and I had a mild freak-out 
session on Friday - which included calling everybody she's every known, 
including Chris and the police - we heard through the grapevine that Marky 
McCulloch, of Neidermeyer cousin fame, was in town from none other than 
Denver and the two were having a secret and James-Bond-like rendezvous at the 
beach. Well that was all well and fine, other than the fact that she DIDN'T 
TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and we had been planning a housewarming party this 
weekend for the past month and she DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and she 
moved kitty into the house but still hasn't told our landlords or paid the 
$500 deposit, oh, and also, SHE DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING. So many 
things were wrong and bizarre about that, but none more than her attitude 
when she walked in the door Monday afternoon. Let's just say I spared no lung 
muscles in telling her exactly what I thought about her selfish, childish, 
idiotic, and most importantly, psychotically self-important behavior. She had 
the gall to defensively scream back that she didn't tell us BECAUSE SHE 
DIDN'T WANT TO LIE. Hmmmm. Not only did she not want to lie - how sweet - but 
she couldn't have told us because Molly and I have suddenly developed an 
insatiable urge to spread fervent and widespread rumors about Amber's love 
trysts. Now, I KNOW there's nothing I'd rather be doing.

Anyway, enough of that. She and I have reached an understanding that just 
because we're roommates does not mean we have to be friends. We've never been 
good at that anyhow. In other news, we had an amazing housewarming party. I 
really wish you could have been there. Molly and I didn't know 90 percent of 
the people there, which is a good thing because it meant they were all 
interesting, successful, gracious and cute. I think there were about four 
girls there - you could tell who planned the party. Sadly, no love 
connections were made that evening, but I've decided that's my new M.O. - 
keep 'em guessing. My friend Michael from Maui who now lives in Seattle came 
down with his friend Jordan who happens to be hot and writing an article for 
Food & Wine magazine. Very interesting guy, but potentially in the closet, so 
I'm keeping my distance. But they invited me up to Seattle next weekend for a 
five-course meal and $100 bottles of wine at some Microsoft dude's mansion. 
Definitely sounds like my crowd. Should I wear my dirty jeans or my clean 
jeans?

I've got my eye on flights to Denver, but right now it's looking like the end 
of March before I can scrape up that kind of cash. Amber on the other hand 
will be there five times before that because some psycho over there keeps 
buying her tickets. That's fair for ya.

Okay, that's all I can do for now, but call me tonight and we'll do the rumor 
mill justice. Take care and hang in there - we'll be booting a roommate soon 
if you feel like coming back to Portland.

Due to the larger than normal volume of activity this month, the preliminary 
report was distributed early, on 02/09/01.  This is the FINAL report for 
February.   Please note that the changes, since the preliminary report, are 
on the ""February 01 Changes"" tab, and the detail is on the ""Feb 2001"" tab.   
You have received notification on the name changes as they have occurred.  

Please find attached the Name Change/Merger Notification Report for 
February.   To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select 
Enable Macros and Read Only.
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Mar 1
 Please adjust paper size to fit your needs

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:




Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.  

As always, please contact me at x33103 with any questions or concerns.

I'd like to inquire about the Dow Jones index price database currently being 
maintained by the Fundamentals group. It's come to my attention - by virtue 
of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several 
people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests 
from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put 
the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the 
index prices in order to run one of her reports.

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your 
spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow 
Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the 
other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile 
the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you. 
(I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)

Thanks,
Kate"

I'm not exactly sure where the spreadsheet on our site comes from. Our 
preference is to keep everything in our SQL Server database, and many of the 
people that you mentioned have read access to that. When Julie Sarnowski gets 
back from vacation next week, let's talk about uploading these data to the 
server and providing a central facility for the floor.

Subject: Dow Jones Index Prices - Database Access

I'd like to inquire about the Dow Jones index price database currently being 
maintained by the Fundamentals group. It's come to my attention - by virtue 
of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several 
people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests 
from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put 
the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the 
index prices in order to run one of her reports.

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your 
spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow 
Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the 
other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile 
the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you. 
(I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)

Thanks,
Kate

**Clarification**

Harassment Prevention Training

This training is mandatory for all Enron employees employed since the last 
seminar was conducted  in late 1998 or early 1999.  Those who have already 
attended Enron harassment avoidance training will be offered a refresher 
course in avoiding and preventing harassment.

To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful

violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its 
potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment
 Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with ENRON values

Please click here (  )  to sign up for the session of your choice.    If you 
have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713 853-0357.

We are pleased to announce that all employees of EWS and EES will receive 
harassment prevention training.  

The dates and times available for the sessions are:


 Friday, Feb 23; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15
  Monday Mar 5; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15; 4:30 - 6:00

All training sessions will be held in the LaSalle Room at the DoubleTree 
Hotel.
There is a $50 charge for each attendee in the training session."

Subject: Dow Jones Index Prices - Database Access

I'd like to inquire about the Dow Jones index price database currently being 
maintained by the Fundamentals group. It's come to my attention - by virtue 
of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several 
people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests 
from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put 
the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the 
index prices in order to run one of her reports.

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your 
spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow 
Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the 
other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile 
the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you. 
(I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)

Thanks,
Kate

February 22, 2001

+ THIS WEEK ...

Poets may be ""the unacknowledged legislators of the world,"" as Percy
Bysshe Shelley once put it, but what of journalists? Well, in the
February and March issues of Harper's magazine Christopher Hitchens,
a columnist for The Nation and Vanity Fair and the author of a new
collection of essays on literature and politics entitled
*Unacknowledged Legislation*, has been making a bid of his own for
legislator -- or prosecutor -- status, arguing in his inimitable way
that Henry Kissinger ought to be indicted for crimes against humanity.

This week and next in Atlantic Unbound, James Fallows, The Atlantic's
national correspondent, engages Hitchens in an exchange of e-mail
correspondence about both the Harper's articles and the book -- with
its essays on such writers as George Orwell, Salman Rushdie, Norman
Podhoretz, and many others. To accompany the exchange, we're offering
two influential Atlantic articles by Seymour M. Hersh (a journalist
""legislator"" if there ever was one) from May and December, 1982,
which went on to form part of his book *The Price of Power: Kissinger
in Nixon's White House*.

Also this week: a flashback to Charles C. Mann's report on the
Napster controversy from last September's Atlantic, new Unbound
Fiction, fresh ink from Sage Stossel, and more.

Cheers,

Wen Stephenson

In last September's Atlantic, Charles C. Mann argued that most

Chief among them: the fight against Internet ""piracy"" is being led by
a peculiar and grasping business -- the recording industry -- that
should not be allowed to set the rules.

I create a report each afternoon that tracks total volume done by each desk 
through EOL and brokered deals. I've attached last night's report for you to 
look over - if this looks like something you'd like to receive, let me know 
and I'll add you to the mailing list. 

And in regard to the dow jones file, I've just finished entering deals for 
Friday and Saturday, so my afternoon will be devoted to creating that. I'll 
let you know as soon as it's done.



Thanks,
Kate

Here's what's wierd:  I ran a Sales Volume Report for 2/21 only, and got a 
total of  596,284.

On your report for the same day,  I get a total of 1,468,175.  That doesn't 
include anything done by about 4 books that are supposed to be on mine!

I wonder what's up with that??  I just wrote to Duong luu to ask him about 
the sales volume report.

Traded 11-13-00 Chris mallory
deal 457482 and 457481
Prebon shows 50 mw and we show 25 mw on each deal.
Can you check with Chris Mallory because when I checked out with Prebon we 
confirmed the megawatts as 25mw on these deals.

we have two Bill Williams - I assume you mean the real time manager, Bill 
Williams III. Let me know if I'm right, and I'll be happy to add them to the

I just spoke with Nicolay, who helped me develop the EOL Report, and he said 
he'd check the code in both that and the Sales Volume Report to see if they 
are in fact pulling in different data. I'll let you know what he finds.

Here's what's wierd:  I ran a Sales Volume Report for 2/21 only, and got a 
total of  596,284.

On your report for the same day,  I get a total of 1,468,175.  That doesn't 
include anything done by about 4 books that are supposed to be on mine!

I wonder what's up with that??  I just wrote to Duong luu to ask him about 
the sales volume report.

I create a report each afternoon that tracks total volume done by each desk 
through EOL and brokered deals. I've attached last night's report for you to 
look over - if this looks like something you'd like to receive, let me know 
and I'll add you to the mailing list. 

And in regard to the dow jones file, I've just finished entering deals for 
Friday and Saturday, so my afternoon will be devoted to creating that. I'll 
let you know as soon as it's done.

I'm not exactly sure where the spreadsheet on our site comes from. Our 
preference is to keep everything in our SQL Server database, and many of the 
people that you mentioned have read access to that. When Julie Sarnowski gets 
back from vacation next week, let's talk about uploading these data to the

Subject: Dow Jones Index Prices - Database Access

I'd like to inquire about the Dow Jones index price database currently being 
maintained by the Fundamentals group. It's come to my attention - by virtue 
of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several 
people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests 
from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put 
the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the 
index prices in order to run one of her reports.

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your 
spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow 
Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the 
other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile 
the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you. 
(I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)

Thanks,
Kate

Harassment Avoidance FAQ

What do I do if I've already taken the class?
If you've already attended a session in the past while employed with Enron, 
you do not have to attend these sessions.  A ""Refresher Course"" will be 
offered at no cost.  

How do those of us attend the Harassment Avoidance if I do not work in 
Houston?
We are making the Harassment Avoidance sessions available on Video to be 
forwarded to your HR manager.   You are NOT encouraged to make travel 
arrangements to attend the Houston sessions.

Who pays the $50?
The $50 fee will be billed to your cost center. Individuals are not expected 
to pay.

Are there any additional dates than those listed on previous email?
Due to the number of people who have not attended in the past, we are making 
special arrangements to offer more classes in the next few months. 

It is important to note, that unless you've recieved a confirmation, you are 
not enrolled.  

All remaining questions or concerns need to be directed to David Foster 
(x.54360) or by email (david.foster@enron.com)."

www.jhubc.it/admissions/appdownloads), fill them out and send them via
courier as soon as possible.


Information about scholarships are available on the website (also on the
""appdownload"" page). Also, you will receive a list of institutions offering
fellowships together with you application package. Please note, however,
that resources are quite limited and the selection process very competitive.
Hence, we advise applicants to look for additional contacts themselves.

I look forward to receiving your application.
Best wishes and good luck!

The World Trade Center Facilities Superintendent has informed us that PGE 
Underground has a main transformer with a bad network protector and is off 
line.  Power needs to be off to replace this network protector.  While this 
situation is inconvenient, it is an excellent opportuity to put our power 
backup systems to a test under optimimal circumstances, e.g., on a Sunday.  
Listed below is information about the outage.  Please review since it may 
require some action on your part.

PGE must turn off its main power supply to the building from 6 - 7 a.m. and 
then again from 3 - 4 p.m.
The building has a backup generator that will kick in five minutes after the 
main power supply shuts off.
Enron has a UPS that will provide us with five minutes worth of power.
If everything goes well, there should be no impact.
If there are problems with the backup generator or UPS, we could experience a 
power outage.
We should not experience a loss of phone service even in the unlikely event 
of a power outage.
It would be prudent to take precautions if you have any systems that may be 
impacted by a power outage.  You may want to log off your computer and turn 
it off on Friday before you leave the office.

Someone from our local IT group will be here on Sunday in case any problems 
arise.  Please contact Dave Steiner if you have any questions or concerns."

I've started to transfer my Dow Jones e-mails into five separate folders

You can already access February's files for each of these delivery points, 
and prior months will be coming in soon as I have free moments in the day.

I'm not exactly sure where the spreadsheet on our site comes from. Our 
preference is to keep everything in our SQL Server database, and many of the 
people that you mentioned have read access to that. When Julie Sarnowski gets 
back from vacation next week, let's talk about uploading these data to the 
server and providing a central facility for the floor.

Subject: Dow Jones Index Prices - Database Access

I'd like to inquire about the Dow Jones index price database currently being 
maintained by the Fundamentals group. It's come to my attention - by virtue 
of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several 
people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests 
from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put 
the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the 
index prices in order to run one of her reports.

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your 
spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow 
Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the 
other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile 
the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you. 
(I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)

Thanks,
Kate

We'd like to create a daily and monthly trade volume report, similar to the 
EOL Report we currently use to track both online and brokered trades done in 
the Portland office each day. The EOL JF tab seems to track the same data we 
need for a daily volume report; however, it does not display the data in the 
form we need. 

Under the ""Sort By"" heading at the bottom of the report, there are two 
choices - ""Deal #"" and ""Desk."" As I run it now, the report displays megawatt 
volumes and total deals according to desk. We now need to display the data 
according to delivery point. 

Please call Cara Semperger or myself when you get a moment, and we can fill 
you in on all the parameters she's looking for in this report. From there I 
think it should be a pretty simple modification of the query.

Thanks in advance for your help on this.

I just had a brief talk with Tim Belden, and he likes just seeing the sale 
side, so I think we are OK with the report as it stands.

Thank you for your quick response to my questions, and I will hold on to this 
e-mail so that if I need to have a change in this report, I will be able to 
communicate quickly.

Thanks,

Cara,

The Sales Volume Report picks up deals that:
1.  Are Approved             
2.  Are Done                     (not Killed or Pending)
3.  Are Physical                (not Financial)
4.  Have ""Forward"" as part of the Deal Type (...""Forward"", ""Index-Forward"")
5.  Are a Sale                   (not Buys)
6.  Have sheduled date of the flow that starts between the dates selected by 
the user of the report (not strip start date as seen in Deal Entry)

The report groups the data by region

For any additions/changes of the Sales Volume Report please have the above 
restrictions in mind.
Let us know what items you wanted to be changed (or added) and in what way.
That will be of great help in implementing your request for changes.

Thanks!
Nikolay

Dear Kate,

Thank you for your interest in the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced 
International Studies Program. We would like to confirm that your inquiry has 
been received.

We hope that the information we have provided on our web site is helpful in 
giving you a good understanding of the Johns Hopkins University SAIS Program 
and application process. In response to your request, we will be sending you 
the Johns Hopkins University SAIS Program brochure and an application form. 
You can expect these materials within three weeks.

We are proud to be at the forefront of innovative technology -- giving you 
the option of submitting an electronic application via the Internet. This is 
just one of the ways we use technology at the Johns Hopkins University. 
You'll also see it in the classroom, in faculty research, and in student 
services, from how you register for classes to how you look for a job.

There are several benefits to the Web Application option:

*  Saves time, and it is faster than the mail

*  Generates cleanly formatted applications that are exact replicas of the 
paper applications

*  Secure, reliable, and convenient

The Johns Hopkins University SAIS Program Web Application System is a new 
convenient option for applicants with access to the Internet. You can create 
a private, free user account that you can use to work on the Johns Hopkins 
University SAIS Program application. Your user account is password protected 
and allows you to work on your application over multiple sessions using any 
computer with Internet access (Netscape/Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 or 
higher recommended).

Our Web Application System provides high levels of privacy and security.

We authenticate users and encrypt all data transmissions, keeping 
applications safe. The application fee is identical to the paper application 
- you pay no additional charges for use of the system.

There is step-by-step guidance on completing applications. The full set of 
instructions is available on-line. A personalized checklist keeps track of 
important items and deadlines. And an application auditor double checks your 
application prior to submission to ensure all mandatory questions are 
answered.

Using the Web Application System is entirely optional. Candidates using the 
web application will not be given any preference or advantage over candidates 
not using the web application.

The Johns Hopkins University SAIS Program Web Application System is located 
at: http://apply.embark.com/grad/JHU/SAIS/. The web site is run by 
Embark.com, a web application systems company, on behalf of the Johns Hopkins 
University SAIS Program. Embark.com continuously monitors the web site (24 
hours a day, 7 days a week) to ensure reliability, and their staff are 
available to assist all users of the Johns Hopkins University SAIS Web 
Application System.

We encourage you to preview the Web Application System at any time and to use 
the system if it meets your needs. If you have any further questions about 
the Web Application System, please feel free to email Embark.com at 
MBAappmaster@Embark.com, or call their web support staff weekdays between 
8:00 AM and 5:00 PM (Pacific time) at 1-800-734-7627 (option 3).

If you have any further questions, please feel free to call us Monday-Friday, 
8:00 AM to 5:00 PM PST at (202) 663-5700. We very much look forward to 
reading your application.

Sincerely,

Johns Hopkins University SAIS
Admissions Staff"

Here are details of the problem we're having with the Tagg IQ Reports:

Three Mid-Columbia futures trades were executed by Matt Motley, Long Term 
Southwest Desk, on 2/5, 2/6, and 2/7.
Trades pulled into Tagg IQ Reports -
 All three pull into Future Daily Transaction Report (RSX0245F.IQR) 
 Only two pull into Future Net Position Summary (RXSNSUMF.IQR)
 All three pull into Tagg Exchange Capture search - transaction IDs are 
980362/983837/987050
 All three pulled into Tagg Metacalc (Meta ID 77771 - Post ID 1035917 - Post 
ID 77880 - Post ID 1037269) until 2/9 - NOW GONE

Because today is the Nymex Electricity Futures exercise date, we need to know 
as soon as possible for our calculations whether or not these deals are in 
the system, and if not, where they went. My confusion lies in the fact that I 
can find these deals when I do a search in Tagg for any futures deals traded 
at the Mid-C settlement index, and yet the Risk group can no longer see 
anything for Mid-C in their calculation. Please let me know what you find.

Thank you,
Kate

All Matt Motley's deal JUST went in, so you should see those coming through.

Chris Mallory checked with Prebon - this is a sale - it's been changed.

Diana checked Bloomberg - they show 25 mw and so do we for a total of 800 
mw....??

I am sure you expected me to comment on EOL at some point - but just in case 
you don't see the attached reporting.  Essentially in power we are now doing 
the same volume as the Intercontinental Exchange.  If you want reports like 
this, Justin Rostant can produce whatever you wish.

Yesterday:
ICE   1,892,800 MWhs
EnronOnline 1,843,874 MWhs (plus 124,850 MWhs financial)

See attached.

Louise

Deal should be no confirm. It was done by Stan Cocke in Services, and those 
guys deal directly with their counterparty contacts. He thought he marked 
this no confirm, but must have defaulted to confirm anyway. I'll change deal 
as soon as risk is done with their calc.

I just spoke with Justin about collaborating on the ICE and EOL volume 
reports. He doesn't actually have access to ICE data right now, but has 
requested it from staff at the exchange. He's not sure of the exact day he 
might begin receiving this report, but told me it would be sometime next 
week. I'll let you know when I find out. 

Also, do you want this report simply added to the end of the EOL Summary, or 
would you like the information integrated into the tables that show our 
volumes? Let me know when you have a moment.

Thanks,
Kate

I am sure you expected me to comment on EOL at some point - but just in case 
you don't see the attached reporting.  Essentially in power we are now doing 
the same volume as the Intercontinental Exchange.  If you want reports like 
this, Justin Rostant can produce whatever you wish.

Yesterday:
ICE   1,892,800 MWhs
EnronOnline 1,843,874 MWhs (plus 124,850 MWhs financial)

I must know why your roommates are so scary! Mine - well, that's just 
obvious. Oh, and since we last e-mailed, Molly has gone out and landed 
herself a full-fledged boyfriend. Anything to avoid getting a job. He's a 
""natural healer"" and he's also had ""an experience with Jesus,"" so this one 
should be REALLY interesting. Amber and I had a few drinks last night and 
basically pretended like nothing happened - it's easier that way. We both 
know there's no real friendship to salvage, so keeping it strictly in the 
bars is the smartest thing to do. And Anna, don't think for a minute that my 
description of life in Portland is exciting or cultured or romantic, cause 
it's pretty much the polar opposite of all those things. I've been so tired 
this week that I've been spouting out sentences like ""The red computer needs 
to climb my shoelaces and the people riding the dinosaurs are wrong."" It's 
definitely been interesting. I'm on my way to sushi with a few people right 
now, but of course I can see my reflection in my forehead and my hair looks 
like a sad, sad, small animal. Super! Maybe I'll meet the man of my dreams. 
I'll tell you, Anna - I know you've got scary clashing dresser man, but 
sometimes from the single person's point of view, that doesn't look so bad. 
Hang in there - and call me soon!

Love,
Kate

Hey buttface!

Wow - it actually sounds like your roommate problems may be comparable to
mine (except that you probably don't fear for your life quite as much).  Who
is paying for Amber to come to Denver?  It sounds like she might be a little
out of her mind right now, but at least she's not going back to Chris just
yet.  So are you going to Seattle this weekend?  That sounds so fun!  I am
so jealous - parties, dinners, wine, men.  You and I are NOT living the same
life right now.  I am in the process of trying to break things off with the
ugly dresser, which was proving to be difficult until last night, when I
made the mistake of letting him come to a movie with Michelle and I.  Kate,
I was scared.  It was dark and I was surrounded by the two most psycho
people I know.  Josh talked through the whole thing and laughed at
inappropriate moments and tried to hold my hand at one point.  It was
excruciating!  It made Michelle look almost normal.

Not much else going on.  I'll call you this weekend, okay?  We need to dish.

Luego,
Anna

Subject: Re: Rockin in the Rockies, bro



So didya hear the Blazers creamed the Nuggets last night? I always knew the
Pacific Northwest would dominate in sports - they're not battling with that
ol' Rocky Mountain High if ya know what I mean.

Well I'm sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday - work was hectic and I
knew that if I started an e-mail to you it would either be half-assed or
I'd never finish it. Well, I'm going for the former now, because I realized
there would never be a good time to divulge the full and sordid details of
what's happening around here, and all the while I wait, more and more
important nuggets (get it!) of gossip are accumulating.

So it's quite appropriate that you wrote yesterday with roommate issues -
mine could not be worse. Amber took off for the ""library"" on Thursday night
and came home.....four days later. After Molly and I had a mild freak-out
session on Friday - which included calling everybody she's every known,
including Chris and the police - we heard through the grapevine that Marky
McCulloch, of Neidermeyer cousin fame, was in town from none other than
Denver and the two were having a secret and James-Bond-like rendezvous at
the beach. Well that was all well and fine, other than the fact that she
DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and we had been planning a housewarming
party this weekend for the past month and she DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS
LEAVING and she moved kitty into the house but still hasn't told our
landlords or paid the $500 deposit, oh, and also, SHE DIDN'T TELL US SHE
WAS LEAVING. So many things were wrong and bizarre about that, but none
more than her attitude when she walked in the door Monday afternoon. Let's
just say I spared no lung muscles in telling her exactly what I thought
about her selfish, childish, idiotic, and most importantly, psychotically
self-important behavior. She had the gall to defensively scream back that
she didn't tell us BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LIE. Hmmmm. Not only did she
not want to lie - how sweet - but she couldn't have told us because Molly
and I have suddenly developed an insatiable urge to spread fervent and
widespread rumors about Amber's love trysts. Now, I KNOW there's nothing
I'd rather be doing.

Anyway, enough of that. She and I have reached an understanding that just
because we're roommates does not mean we have to be friends. We've never
been good at that anyhow. In other news, we had an amazing housewarming
party. I really wish you could have been there. Molly and I didn't know 90
percent of the people there, which is a good thing because it meant they
were all interesting, successful, gracious and cute. I think there were
about four girls there - you could tell who planned the party. Sadly, no
love connections were made that evening, but I've decided that's my new
M.O. - keep 'em guessing. My friend Michael from Maui who now lives in
Seattle came down with his friend Jordan who happens to be hot and writing
an article for Food & Wine magazine. Very interesting guy, but potentially
in the closet, so I'm keeping my distance. But they invited me up to
Seattle next weekend for a five-course meal and $100 bottles of wine at
some Microsoft dude's mansion. Definitely sounds like my crowd. Should I
wear my dirty jeans or my clean jeans?

I've got my eye on flights to Denver, but right now it's looking like the
end of March before I can scrape up that kind of cash. Amber on the other
hand will be there five times before that because some psycho over there
keeps buying her tickets. That's fair for ya.

Okay, that's all I can do for now, but call me tonight and we'll do the
rumor mill justice. Take care and hang in there - we'll be booting a
roommate soon if you feel like coming back to Portland.

Kate

February 26, 2001:
Crisis and Opportunity Update

If you're like the tens of thousand of others who read the Power Marketing 
Association's Daily Power Report, you know that our industry faces 
unprecedented crisis.? Blackouts, credit crunch, electric and gas price 
volatility, low hydro levels--? and we're not even near the summer.?? What 
are we facing??

Now is the time to think, to plan, to solve tomorrow's problems before they 
arise.?? Join us at the Power Marketing Association's Seventh Annual Spring 
Meeting: Power Markets 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY:? MARCH 14-16, 2001, 
Aladdin Hotel, Las Vegas, NV. 

Crisis grabs the attention, but the opportunities are almost palpable.? Just 
click on the headline for the full story at powermarketers.com:
 

Duke Energy North America Breaks Ground on New Merchant Power ?Facility
 Duke Energy North America (DENA) ?breaks ground on a new $250 million 
electric power generating facility in Arlington Valley, Ariz. The Arlington 
Valley Energy Facility, a 570-megawatt merchant power plant, will supply 
electric power to the wholesale market by summer 2002.

Federal Power Agency Issues Largest Wind Solicitation Ever?
The Bonneville Power Administration's (BPA) decision to solicit proposals 
Feb. 21 for 1,000 megawatts (MW) of new wind energy generating capacity is a 
""major breakthrough"" for the increasingly-competitive clean energy 
technology, the Washingon, D.C.-based American Wind Energy Association? 
(AWEA) said today.

THE POWER OF PEAK SHAVING -- and LIFE-CYCLE COSTING
With peak-demand-controlled rates, businesses can realize as much as a 
60-percent discount on monthly demand charges if they agree to reduce the 
electric power demand to a predetermined level when the utility imposes a 
control period.

A POWER GRAB BY POLITICIANS
...Where power plants were to be built, or where high-voltage lines would be 
strung, might well depend on who could, and could not, bring political 
influence to bear, rather than what the system needed to work efficiently. 
...With the threat of further blackouts looming, legislation is being drafted 
to designate which customers will suffer and which will not -- ?Should 
farmers be cut off, or biotechnology facilities, or computer chip plants, or 
schools?

Just in case this is news to you, I've spoken with Ben Gwaltney (A/P) in 
Houston about processing rebates.  He explained that when applying for the 
rebate, have the rebate check payable to Enron.  Send the rebate check in on 
a Deposit Transmittal Form, and code it with the same codes you had used to 
process the initial expense (company #, expense code and cost center to which 
the rebate should be credited).  If a Deposit Transmittal Form is unavailable 
to you, you can just staple the check to a piece of paper showing the 
appropriate codes.  Mail this deposit form with the rebate check via 
inter-company mail to:  Treasury, Sam Round EB2703.

If I've left someone off of this message who would find this information 
helpful, please pass it on.

Have a good weekend!

subjects.  Joe Sutton is our first guest speaker.

For one hour, you have an opportunity to ask Joe how Enron can break down 
communication barriers.  Share your ideas with him for innovative ways to 
communicate and tell him how you want to receive information.  Also, what can 
Joe personally do to encourage better communication across business units, 
within teams and with your co-workers?

When you change this to no confirm, please put a note in the comment section 
about why we are not domfirming it, because it falls within our guidelines to 
confirm and at somepoint, I will be asked why we did not confirm this deal.

Thanks!

Deal should be no confirm. It was done by Stan Cocke in Services, and those 
guys deal directly with their counterparty contacts. He thought he marked 
this no confirm, but must have defaulted to confirm anyway. I'll change deal 
as soon as risk is done with their calc.

Hello Kate,
You asked me about 'Current Date' and 'Prior Date' items on the MetaCalc 
screen.
The prices to 'calc' are based on those dates   'current-date' vs 
'prior-date`.

The delivery point was changed and the energy wasn't. It is CAISO energy.

She doesn't have the signed confirm back yet. Sharen asked me about it a few 
weeks ago, and Holli told me she'd send it to the confirms group as soon as 
she got it. She's talking to her contact there right now to find out what's 
going on. I guess she's getting a little fed up of beating around the bush 
with these guys - so hopefully she'll get some concrete answers from them 
today. I'll let you know whatever we find out this afternoon.

Thanks,
Kate

You're right - thanks for checking up on us. This deal was actually done this 
morning before Credit came out with the updated watchlist. He checked with 
Tracy Ngo, our credit person, on the deal and she's aware of and okay with 
it. I guess Bob snuck one in there!

Thanks,

No problem. It occured to me, as the list of people I'm sending this to 
continues to grow, that maybe I should fine tune the format a little. If you 
guys have any suggestions about the layout of the spreadsheet, please let me 
know.

So I watched the news last night and discovered to my utter dismay that the 
whole damn city of Seattle began rioting over my pointed absence this 
weekend. Some people just don't know how to control those emotions, I guess.

How was dinner, anyway? I was actually hoping to come, but I seem to have 
misplaced Michael's phone number and so had no way of contacting you guys. 
Also, I wasn't quite confident in my ability to find your house through 
""alternative"" methods such as hanging out at the train station or wandering 
through Microsoft millionaire-type neighborhoods. And to top it all off, I 
lost my voice Friday night - for no apparent reason other than the usual 
deficit of sleep and surplus of cigarettes - and wouldn't you know it would 
have to turn into a full blown cold by this morning. 

As can be expected, we're experiencing the most insanely gorgeous weather 
I've seen in all my Februarys in Portland, which is making my acceptance of 
actually being sick even more difficult. Whatever happened with your fever? 
I'd feel much better if I knew others were sharing my pain. In fact, I 
promptly gave my cold to Amber on Saturday, so I'd have a partner in my time 
of homebound misery. She took it a step further, in true drama queen fashion. 
Case in point - I'm at work, she's rounding out her 39th consecutive hour in 
bed. 

Anyway, I'm going to skip out of here a whopping half an hour EARLY today 
because people are starting to look visibly pained when I try to talk. But I 
thought I'd check on the success of the dinner party and apologize for not 
making it. And if you get a chance, tell Michael that I have a very 
legitimate reason for losing his phone number. Or at least, I'll have one by 
the time he calls.

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office, 
information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

RETAIL: WHAT WENT WRONG, HOW TO FIX IT. Retail electric deregulation has thus 
far been an underwhelming success, but a great deal has been learned, and it 
is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

MANAGING BILLING. The complex requirements for managing billing and

CIS and CRM technology. Energy Retailers must embrace the next evolution of

Officer, Peace Software.

THE INTERNET AND THE VELOCITY FACTOR. Greater price transparency, faster 
execution, reduced transaction costs, increased number and frequency of 
transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to 
energy markets wrought by the web, and it's just beginning. Implecations of 
the internet for energy markets. E. Russell ""Rusty"" Braziel, Chairman and

Deal should be no confirm. It was done by Stan Cocke in Services, and those 
guys deal directly with their counterparty contacts. He thought he marked 
this no confirm, but must have defaulted to confirm anyway. I'll change deal 
as soon as risk is done with their calc.

The Confirms group in Houston has asked me to obtain a copy of the 
confirmation letter you come up with for this deal. This group is responsible 
for keeping records of all confirmation letters, whether or not they execute 
them. So this includes term deals that are marked ""no confirm."" Please let me

I just forwarded this e-mail to Stan and then spoke with him about the 
confirm on this deal. He said he's never received a letter of confirmation on 
these Valley Electric deals - they just verbally confirm them. I've given him 
your name, and he should be contacting you shortly to discuss how to proceed 
on this. Please let me know how I can help.

Thanks,

Sharen,

Kate Symes asked me to email you and let you know that we do verbal confirms 
with Valley Electric.  We speak with Valley quite often, and confirm deals 
with them over the phone.  We have never sent them paper confirms, and we 
would like to keep the relationship the way it is.  If you have any questions 
please feel free to contact me.

Thanks,
Stan

Disregard my other reply - I don't know what I was thinking. Prebon was right 
on this. Both deals were 50 MW (not 25 MW like I said earlier!), and they 
were changed accordingly.

Sorry about the confusion.

Traded 11-13-00 Chris mallory
deal 457482 and 457481
Prebon shows 50 mw and we show 25 mw on each deal.
Can you check with Chris Mallory because when I checked out with Prebon we 
confirmed the megawatts as 25mw on these deals.

Thanks

Thanks - I've changed it. With deals like those, it's fine if you need to 
change the counterparty name in the interest of time or efficiency. Could 
just send me a quick e-mail, and copy Bill Williams III (real time manager), 
when you change deals under the Short Term West Hourly desk? That way we can 
both keep on top of common mistakes. And if it's at all possible for you to 
wait on making those changes until you've e-mailed me, that would be great. 
If I don't respond right away - if I'm out of the office or at lunch - then 
feel free to change away!

Thanks,
Kate

Did you want this deal confirmed? If so, it needs a counterparty contact name 
in it. Let me know.

The third deal - 531910 - I'm checking on with Les right now. Sharen Cason 
asked me this morning who the contact was, and typically with services deals 
the traders like to confirm the deals themselves - so I'm not sure if it 
should be confirmed.

The other two contain contact names - are they not valid in GCP? Do you need 
new names and phone numbers or just numbers to go along with those names?

Kate

460001
Prebon is broker

460002
Term is Q1-01

458618

 New Energy Secretary Guesses He Ought To Read Up On Energy

WASHINGTON, DC-- Spencer Abraham, the newly installed U.S. Energy Secretary, 
admitted Monday that he probably ought to read up on energy. ""I know energy 
is really important, and that there was a big crisis back in the '70s, but 
other than that, I'm in the dark,"" Abraham said. ""I was hoping to be 
appointed Secretary of Transportation, which I know a lot more about, but 
that one was already taken."" The former Michigan senator said he plans to go 
to the library Thursday to look up ""Energy"" in The World Book Encyclopedia."

I just spoke with Justin Rostant, who reported that ICE will begin sending 
him data tomorrow morning. So you can expect the ICE volumes to be included 
on tomorrow's EOL report. Let me know if you have any other specifications 
for the report.

I am sure you expected me to comment on EOL at some point - but just in case 
you don't see the attached reporting.  Essentially in power we are now doing 
the same volume as the Intercontinental Exchange.  If you want reports like 
this, Justin Rostant can produce whatever you wish.

Yesterday:
ICE   1,892,800 MWhs
EnronOnline 1,843,874 MWhs (plus 124,850 MWhs financial)

See attached.

health. If you could direct your e-mails for the remainder of the day to the 
respective traders, I would really appreciate it. And if anything can wait 
until tomorrow, just e-mail it to me and I'll take care of it in the morning. 
I'm going to sleep for the next 15 hours and see if that rids me of this cold

I have a question about how this deal is entered.  You have it entered as 
every day of the week including Sundays and Holidays for the hours 7 -22.  I 
think that will duplicate the off peak hours you have entered for Sundays on 
#533134.  It is already flowing Sundays, 24 hours on #533134.  Is this in 
addition to those hours or is it a duplication?

Also, do you want these two confirmed on one letter or as two separate 
deals.  If together, please put a note in the comment section of deal entry 
sp we will know to confirm both on one letter.

Thanks!"

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing

considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

EPMI just signed an EEI with the Port of Oakland - in addition we did a

EPMI sell 7 MW of power flat at NP-15 for the month of March.  The price is 
$208.  The contact is Wing Lau (phone number is 510-627-1457).

Hi Kate,

I spoke with Jeff Richter this morning and the index sleeve he did on 
yesterday with EES (deal 533084) and Sempra(deal 533085) is incorrect in 
Enpower.  He said he would change the publication code to reflect Dow Jones 
SP-15 Peak instead of Dow Jones NP-15 Peak on both of these deals.

Can you please check with Jeff to see what the status is on these changes. 
The EES deal has been changed. The Sempra deal has not been changed.

Thanks!!

Sharen told me this morning that you guys were waiting on a deal Stewart 
Rosman did with Port of Oakland yesterday and wanted confirmed today. I've 
spoken with a few people here and discerned that the deal wasn't in because 
the counterparty wasn't in the system yet. I took a look and found that Port 
of Oakland had been added, and entered the deal according to the terms 
Stewart sent out in an e-mail yesterday. Deal number is 533916. Thanks for

In reviewing Jeff Shields' expenses for the previous two months, I have found 
two travel itineraries which came without prices on them. Jessica and Mollie 
have both checked their e-mail and confirmed that the only documents sent did 
not detail the cost of the trip. 

The prices I need are from the following trips:

Itinerary only - August 28, Alaska Airlines, PDX-SeaTac-Helena-SeaTac-PDX, 
Reservation # AS/WXOKNK
 (reservation made August 24)
Itinerary only - Sept. 6 to 7, Delta Airlines, PDX-Salt Lake 
City-Spokane-PDX, Reservation # DL/V2KIC3
 (reservation made September 6)

Thank you so much for your time.

Several customers were asking me about Gas gen off line due to gas cuts - 
here is an article from Steve at Seattle City Light that adds light to this.

It doesn't say how much capacity was impacted, but it sounds like  a 
localized problem in San Diego rather than a statewide gas import  problem.? 
I thought it was nice of Mr. Winters to add his expert  commentary.

California Power Plants Get Jolt
As Natural-Gas Supplies Are  Cut

By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal  

LOS ANGELES -- Southern California power plants, already stressed to their  
limits last summer, got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp  
curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity. 

The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce  
electricity. But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns 
that  an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is 
putting the  reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk. 

That's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S.  
burn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able 
to  shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were  
constructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel  
flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than 
gas  and generally has been costlier. 

In California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San  
Diego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to 
grow  new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical 
emergencies last  summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had 
hoped to solve the  problem by speeding up construction of new generating 
plants. Now, they're  finding the state may be building its way out of an 
electrical problem and into  a gas problem. 

One official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single  
fuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a  
comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas 
and  electricity affect each other. ""We don't just need new generating 
plants  and transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too,"" said Terry 
Winter,  chief executive officer of the California Independent System 
Operator, the  organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity 
supplies.  ""You can't look at these things in isolation."" 

The natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company,  
San Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful  
of industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. 
In  California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural 
gas,  and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are 
generating  plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns  
some of the older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil. 
But  it didn't like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution 
when  they burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that 
power  plants here need to operate. 

The San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was 
short  of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, 
including  many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now 
undergoing repair  after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer. 

What's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough 
to  begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers 
and  not big power plants. 

The problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because  
gas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation, 
but  especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard 
last  summer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic 
feet of  gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% 
less. Prices  also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million 
British thermal units  to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are 
down about 8% from a year  ago. 

""Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the  nation,"" said 
John Lavorato, chief operating officer of Enron North  America, a unit of 
Enron Corp. of Houston. But he said they're headed up in  the Northeast, 
based on cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two weeks.  

High prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. 
In  California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was 
$228  per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times 
the price a  year earlier.

I guess TFS originally had Palo on their confirm - which was wrong - then the 
deal got changed to Mid-C. So Enpower is right, and Mike just let his broker 
know to change the delivery point on the confirm.

do not reflect the option in the system.  we will take care of that if we 
exercise the option.  it would be good to get the proper transaction 
execution date in there.

For anyone who didn't see David Letterman the other night, this is a true 
story. A little long, but not dirty (for those who might be offended) and 
totally worth the read: 

On a recent weekend in Atlantic City, a woman won a bucketful of quarters at 
a slot machine. She took a break from the slots for dinner with her husband 
in the hotel dining room. But first she wanted to stash 
the quarters in her room. ""I'll be right back and we'll go to eat,""she told 
her husband and carried the coin-laden bucket to the elevator. 

As she was about to walk into the elevator she noticed two men already 
aboard. Both were black. One of them was tall...very tall...an intimidating 
figure. The woman froze. Her first thought was: These two are going to rob 
me. Her next thought as: Don't be a bigot, they look like perfectly nice 
gentlemen. But racial stereotypes are powerful, and fear immobilized her. She 
stood and stared at the two men. She felt anxious, flustered and ashamed. She 
hoped they didn't read her mind but Gosh, they had to know what she was 
thinking!!! Her hesitation about joining them in the elevator was all too 
obvious now. Her face was flushed. She couldn't just stand there, so with a 
mighty effort of will she picked up one foot and stepped forward and followed 
with the other foot and was on the elevator. Avoiding eye contact, she turned 
around stiffly and faced the elevator doors as they closed. A second passed, 
and the another second, and then another. Her fear increased! The elevator 
didn't move. Panic consumed her. My God, she thought, I'm trapped and about 
to be robbed! Her heart plummeted. Perspiration poured from every pore. 

Then one of the men said, ""Hit the floor."" Instinct told her to do what they 
told her. The bucket of quarters flew upwards as she threw out her arms and 
collapsed on the elevator floor. A shower of coins rained down on her. Take 
my money and spare me, she prayed. More seconds passed. 

She heard one of the men say politely, ""Ma'am, if you'll just tell us that 
floor you're going to, we'll push the button."" The one who said it had a 
little trouble getting the words out. He was trying mightily to hold in a 
belly laugh. The woman lifted her head and looked up at the two men. 

They reached down to help her up. Confused, she struggled to her feet. ""When 
I told my friend here to hit the floor,"" said the average sized one, ""I meant 
that he should hit the elevator button for our floor. I didn't mean for you 
to hit the floor, ma'am."" He spoke genially. He bit his lip. It was obvious 
he was having a hard time not laughing. 

The woman thought: ""My God, what a spectacle I've made of myself"". She was 
humiliated to speak. She wanted to blurt out an apology, but words failed 
her. How do you apologize to two perfectly respectable gentlemen for behaving 
as though they were going to rob you? She didn't know what to say. The three 
of them gathered up the strewn quarters and refilled her bucket. 

When the elevator arrived at her floor they then insisted on walking her to 
her room. She seemed a little unsteady on her feet, and they were afraid she 
might not make it down the corridor. At her door they bid her a good evening. 
As she slipped into her room she could hear them roaring with laughter as 
they walked back to the elevator. The woman brushed herself off. She pulled 
herself together and went downstairs for dinner with her husband. 

The next morning flowers were delivered to her room - a dozen roses. Attached 
to EACH rose was a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The card said: ""Thanks for 
the best laugh we've had in years."" It was signed;

Yeah, Seattle actually had a 7.0 earthquake at about 11a.m. our time. I made 
it out from under our building with only a broken leg and shattered.....no 
just kidding. What's funny is that I was on my way to lunch when the 
earthquake hit Portland, and for whatever reason - my conspicuous 
absentmindedness or the cold medicine I'm high on - I didn't feel a thing. I 
walked out into the streets of downtown to ambulances screaming all around 
and ladies freaking out and running out of buildings. I went to the little 
soup stand I always go to, and the soup guy asked if I had felt the 
earthquake, and I said, you know it's funny but I DIDN'T. And he said, well 
that IS funny because I didn't either. But I think we're the only two who 
didn't notice it. Weird, huh!

Thanks for checking though.

Kate

Sorry Sharon. I just entered this deal for Matt Motley, and my deal entry 
defaults to all days. This is a peak deal and should only flow Monday through 
Saturday, hours 7-22. It's been changed to reflect that.

Kate,

Thanks again for the info.  It just occurred to me that we should probably 
get this on the first or second workday of the month to get the last days of 
the previous months' prices (we have to send an end of month report to 
customers), or as soon as all of the prices are available.  Is that doable?

Caroline

Yes - it's a Puget deal. I'm trying to contact Sean right now to see if he 
and Diana overlapped on these deals. I only see them written once in his

I've put a call in to Mike Driscoll to see which deal is correct. He ""fixed"" 
them yesterday, but frankly I have no idea what he really did, as they still 
look completely different. As soon as I confirm with him, I'll change the

As many of you know, I am relocating myself and my family to Portland.  I 
have a found a new house (yeah!) but need to move my family up here before 
the house will be ready.  So,  I am looking for a house to sit or a furnished 
house or apartment to rent. Two bedrooms or larger.  We would occupy the 
abode through April 14.  I can begin the sit/rental immediately but no later 
than March 31.  

If you know of something, please come see me.

Thanks,

Alan Comnes
