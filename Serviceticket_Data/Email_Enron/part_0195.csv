I agree -  a fundamental assumption of the MNA is that square setoff works and that you can setoff financial and physical commodity contracts.  To make it work, all parties must sign the MNA.  From there you need to believe that square setoff works and that the bankruptcy court will allow the setoff and not make an issue of ""the lack of mutuality"" taking into consideration that the assets of the bankrupt party may be being used to satisfy liabilities of the non-bankrupt party.

Subject:	Master Netting, Set-off and Collateral Agreement

As you know, we are working on the master netting, set-off and collateral agreement to be used with multiple entities, multiple products and cross-border.  I hope to have our comments on the form by the end of the week.  Hopefully we can then settle on a form and proceed for use with counterparties, such as Engage, etc.

One specific issue, however, is the incorporation of the type of set-off language that has been recently proposed by the Legal Trading Committee and, in particular, the use of ""triangular"" set-off.  The Legal Trading Committee agreed to restrict the set-off rights of the non-defaulting party to ""triangular"" set-off for two reasons:

1.	""rectangular"" set-off would be stretching the privity/enforceability issue where the non-defaulting party's affiliates were not a party to the master agreement; and

2.	""rectangular"" set-off could be stretching commercial acceptability with counterparties.

However, in the structure of a master netting, set-off and collateral agreement, I believe both these issues go away, and I think that ""rectangular"" set-off is in fact consistent with the arrangement.  Firstly, unlike a master trading agreement, under the master netting agreement both the non-defaulting party and the non-defaulting party's affiliates, as well as the defaulting party and the defaulting party's affiliates, all should be parties to the agreement, therefore addressing the privity issue.  Secondly, in terms of commercial acceptability, by definition I believe that the parties are agreeing to an omnibus relationship for setting off positions and collateral requirements across all product lines with all trading affiliates.

Please let me have your thoughts.

Regards,
Peter"

Elizabeth:  I was traveling on Friday, but I exchanged v-mails with some of my compatriots about setting up a call tomorrow with you to discuss the foregoing in the context of your long term power purchase and sale commitments.  Do you still want to try to do something on this front on Monday afternoon?  If so, how does 3:00 p.m. (Eastern)/2:00 p.m. (Central) sound?  In that respect, were you able to touch base with John LLodra?  I think it would be good to have him participate since he has a very good understanding of the NE-ISO/NEPOOL and the proposed CMS.  The other possibility may be someone like Dan Allegretti, who is with EES and is now the Chairman of NEPOOL.  Let me know ho you may wish to proceed.  Thanks.  John

Ellen

We did not sell anything until after June 30th.  Go ahead and call Lou, but why would you use December 31st; clearly things are lower in June.  Do you get to pick and choose by each stock which date to use? I'm in the office today but traveling a lot this week.  If you need to reach me after today, please leave me a message at work and I will call you back.  Also Do we need to include the 2,400 from Suntrust in my mom's estate since it was held by both my brother (who closed the account this weekend) and my mother?
Thanks

Elizabeth-  I got the statements you sent me and it looks like the value of some or all of the stock went down in between December and June.  Were any of the securities in the accounts sold or have you just held onto everything?  If its OK with you, I would like to call Louis Alexander at Morgan Stanley and ask him to prepare a formal appraisal of the securities as of December 31 and June 30.  He might be able to do this without charge since the accounts are at Morgan Stanley.  Let me know.

        Attached is an initial draft of a letter agreement between AESC and LVC II, and Enron Power Marketing which is intended to set forth our understanding of the agreement reached between David Parquet and Dan Gordon yesterday.  Although prior versions of this document have been discussed with AESC, in the interest of expediting the review of the draft, it is being distributed to all parties simultaneously, and is for that reason subject to any further comments which AESC may have

concerning it.  

        Since I have not been involved in any of the existing agreements between Enron and Allegheny, I would appreciate it if those of you with knowledge of those matters ensure that I have accurately described in Paragraph 5 of this draft those agreements and the relevant parties to them.

        We look forward to your comments and to moving toward a resolution of the issues between the parties in the near future.

Today is the final day of the EWS United Way Leadership Giving Campaign and we need your help!

Hi Cindy

My name is Elizabeth Sager and I work with Carol St Clair at Enron. She and I play tennis periodically and she said that you may be looking for players for a 4.5 singles league at Memorial on Wed nights.  If you need players, I would be interested in playing.  I'm traveling most of this week and out for the weekend but if you still need players let me know - if you want we could arrange a time to hit.  Thanks - talk to you soon.

Oscar,
 
This is not a black and white issue.   I have already had several meetings with the desk heads and Elizabeth Sager on this very issue and work has begun.   This is a huge industry issue given the changing RTO landscape and its potential effects on the traditional ""into"" product.
 
Until there is clarity on the RTO market structure and transmission rights, there is simply not language that we can get comfortable with.  Rather than blame the traders and/or legal for transaction difficulty, why not immerse yourself into the MISO and Alliance documents and find potential opportunities.   Learn the difference between LMP and ""into"". What are the congestion areas in the Midwest.   What will the basis markets look like?   What is a basis market?What generation units will benefit from LMP/zonal pricing?   What generation will get hurt by congestion? 
 
With regulatory change lies opportunity for marketing transactions.   The fact of the matter is a 2003-06 Into-Cinergy trade (long or short) contains significant regulatory risk, and to protect Enron's shareholders, we need to price addition premium or don't do the trade at all.
 
On the other hand, getting long at a plant bus-bar in a bullish LMP location and getting short LMP seller's choice would be a good trade.   These are the types of transactions the marketing group should be thinking about.   Take advantage of the changing regulatory landscape, don't use it as a crux.
 
I look forward to discussing with you on Monday morning.

Subject: RTO Development and impact to Commercial Transactions






I am requesting that the Legal Department draft and approve specific language that the Mid-Marketing groups can utilize in proposals and subsequent contracts to address the issue of RTO development and the impact on the risk profiles of our commercial transactions.

As deal flow and longer term deals continue to increase, the issue of RTO development is having a pronounced impact on quantfying the risk the trading desk is willing to assume along with the pricing to be offered on particular transactions.

While it would be imprudent to avoid long term deals with primary terms that extend over the development timeline of the RTO's, we need to immediately begin to address this issue in our proposals and subsequent deal confirmations.

The Mid-Marketing Team would like to have generic language that we can begin using by 8/10/01. 


Thanks 

Oscar

Do you still want to try to do something on this front on Monday afternoon?  If so, how does 3:00 p.m. (Eastern)/2:00 p.m. (Central) sound?  In that respect, were you able to touch base with John LLodra?  I think it would be good to have him participate since he has a very good understanding of the NE-ISO/NEPOOL and the proposed CMS.  The other possibility may be someone like Dan Allegretti, who is with EES and is now the Chairman of NEPOOL.  Let me know ho you may wish to proceed.  Thanks.  John

Elizabeth, 

Background: On Wednesday, October 10, the NPUC voted to authorize its General Counsel to seek to void or renegotiate certain SPP/NP long-term power contracts by either going to court or filing a complaint at FERC.  According to the utilities, the contracts are out-of-the-money by approximately $800 million. 

Enclosed, you'll find. . . .:  Attached is a spreadsheet showing all of the physical Enron-SPP/NP deals that are (1) currently flowing or (2) scheduled for future delivery.  I have left off transactions that have been completed because the tenor of SPP/NP's statements indicates that they are seeking prospective relief, not refunds.

I am also going to fax to you two pages showing our credit exposure to SPP and NP.  Worst case, back of the envelope, we are looking at approximately $400 million in MTM exposure for all deals.  However, the prices under these deals range from $27.50/MWh to $311/MWh (the $3.60 deal is for transmission).  It's extremely unlikely that FERC would (1) void every transaction or (2) reduce the price for every deal to $0.  Therefore, the true amount at risk is less than $400 million.

Bottom line:  All in all, I think the risk of FERC undoing these transactions is unlikely for the following reasons: 

1.  The ALJ in the Pacific Northwest refund case rejected claims for refunds of bilateral transactions because (1) the non-California long-term market was competitive, and (2) because of the concern about ""ripple"" claims.  Although the Commission has not yet adopted the ALJ's recommendation, I expect they will because it's the path of least resistance and has popular support.

2.  SPP/NP is the only party arguing that the Southwest market is uncompetitive.  This aspect was fatal to the Pacific Northwest claims because the majority of the market did not want refunds.

3.  SPP/NP was not required to buy power under these contracts----unlike the California utilities, which were required to buy from the PX.  Presumably, these were the lowest prices available at the time.

4.  If FERC voids or reprices these contracts, it will be pressured to do the same for California's DWR contracts. 

Contracts/Collateral:  These transactions are all under the WSPP.  We currently hold no collateral from SPP/NP.  Tracy Ngo informs me that we have not insisted on margin or additional collateral because her understanding was that the WSPP did not let her ask for collateral absent an objective event, such as a credit downgrade or failure to get a rate increase.  I advised her that the WSPP standard allows for a call for collateral if the counterparty's ""financial viability"" decreases.  My view is that SPP/NP's admission that it is $800 million under water is, in itself, cause for a margin call.  I am, however, sensitive to the fact that a margin call might (1) be perceived as ""punishing"" SPP/NP for ""trying to enforce the law,"" or (2) strengthen SPP/NP's resolve to seek refunds.  Tracy will not request collateral until you have weighed in on this.

Mitigation:  I spoke with Tim Belden and Tracy Ngo about this on Monday the 15th.  There is zero interest in trying to work with SPP/NP on a blend/extend.  ""Why should we loan a shaky counterparty more money?""  There is also the feeling that we stand a great chance of winning at FERC.  Ultimately, we three were unable to come up with any ways to mitigate the exposure, other than being ready to vigorously respond to this challenge at FERC and being prepared to issue a statement to the press after the complaint is filed at FERC.

Steve

Elizabeth,

Greetings.  I hope you enjoyed your vacation.  

In the midst of all of the bad news from California, I thought I would pass on some good news.  You may recall that a while back I encouraged Gov't & Regulatory affairs to withdraw a complaint they had filed with FERC to suspend the ISO's underscheduling penalty.  I asked them to withdraw it because the CAISO Tariff said that the ISO would pay the penalty to Scheduling Coordinators that correctly scheduled load and did not incur the penalty (read Enron).  To make a long story short, Enron withdrew its complaint and FERC ordered that the ISO continue to impose the penalty for the time being.

We just received word today that the ISO is crediting us with approximately $30 million in underscheduling payments.  Although with the defaults we may not get full payment, perhaps we can use this as a bargaining chip/offset with California if we have to make refund payments to the ISO.

Hi Alex

Thanks for your messages.  We just got back from  10 days in Colorado (celebrating the big 40 of course) and had a great time.  I would love to get together on the weekend of the 18th ( I don't work Fridays so maybe I could drive up or something).  I'll be out alot next week - I have to go back to Co for work and Grant and I are going to stay the weekend but we will be back on the 12th.  Let me know if you find a place ... I'll also be thinking.  Talk to you soon.

Hi Liz! 
I am going to be in Dallas from Wed. August 15 through Wed. August 22 and thought we could get together 
on the weekend. I have this crazy idea that maybe you could get away- meet me on Friday and we could go to a spa/ 
ranch/yoga center somewhere outside Dallas for Friday and Saturday....I'm looking into an a place.. What do you think??

The two Reliant deals that were sent to Legal (the EOL and non EOL) have already been given to Leslie Hansen for review.

As for the Schedule C being added to the west trades, should Christian or Steve be the attorney to handle those?  Do we have an attorney in the group in Houston familiar with the WSPP?

David,
I understand you are speaking with Shari Stack of Reliant regarding the wording of the option confirmation letters.  I had two other questions that you might help us with.  Sent to legal (deal 702644.01, 700154.01) EOL and non EOL deal, Enron states: Firm (LD) Energy  Reliant is striking through and placing firm (ld) Energy in lowercase.  
[Portz, David]  I think Genia has already allocated these to another attorney(s) in the group, or if she hasn't already, will.   I think it matters which Reliant affiliate you are speaking of, because we only have the EEI in effect with one of them, and ""Firm (LD)"" is a defined product type under the EEI. 


Also on our West trades, Product:  West Firm Energy
Reliant is adding service schedule C. [Portz, David]   I am requesting that Genia Fitzgerald designate an attorney who will help you with this. 

I can refax the above confirmations for your review if needed.

NRG Power Marketing:  The past trades that have not been signed by the counterparty, are those considered executed now that we have an EEI agreement?  
Does it cover the additional language in confirmations such as SP 15, NP 15, Nepool language? [Portz, David]    Past trades brought under the EEI Master were referenced on an Attachment A to the EEI Master dated effective June 29th 2001, prepared by Rhonda in coordination with NRG.  As such, the commercial terms of those confirms (corresponding with the numbers on the Attachment A spreadsheet) have clearly been affirmed in writing by the parties; price has not been specifically affirmed in writing however, and the remaining confirmation boilerplate is intended by the parties to be superseded by the EEI Master's terms.  It would thus seem advisable to reconfirm any currently outstanding trades on using the format(s) of EEI confirmation agreed betweent he parties.    The specific language re SP 15, NP 15, & Nepool would remain in effect as to the underlying trades  --  the EEI Master's text does not treat those matters anyway.  

Thanks for your help!

I received a call this morning from Robert Minkoff.  His company is interested in buying EPMI's claim in the PCA bankruptcy.  I have not had any involvement in the PCA matter for quite some time, so I told him that I would pass along his name and number to someone who might know whether EPMI has any interest in selling its claim.  His telephone number is 201-968-0001.

   Dede Russo and I are planning to have a surprise baby shower for Marty
   Jo
   Rogers from Axia at some point during the two-day EEI Working Group
   session
   next week. We will arrange to have cake, balloons and a few presents.
   All
   you participants are invited to the shower and if I have missed sending
   someone on this email - please forward it on to them.

   Regarding presents, I will buy group presents for the baby this weekend.
   You can either contribute to this or do something on your own (p.s. it
   is a
   boy). If you would like to go in on the group present, you can
   discreetly
   give me money next week but please let me know if so by email NO LATER
   THAN
   THIS FRIDAY so I can plan accordingly. I would imagine that $10 per
   person
   would be plenty.

   Please call me (713) 207-5233 or Dede (713) 207-5240 if you have any
   questions.

   Thanks!

Dede Russo and I are planning to have a surprise baby shower for Marty Jo
Rogers from Axia at some point during the two-day EEI Working Group session
next week. We will arrange to have cake, balloons and a few presents.  All
you participants are invited to the shower and if I have missed sending
someone on this email - please forward it on to them.

Regarding presents, I will buy group presents for the baby this weekend.
You can either contribute to this or do something on your own (p.s. it is a
boy). If you would like to go in on the group present, you can discreetly
give me money next week but please let me know if so by email NO LATER THAN
THIS FRIDAY so I can plan accordingly. I would imagine that $10 per person
would be plenty.

Please call me (713) 207-5233 or Dede (713) 207-5240 if you have any
questions.

Thanks!

Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements, RM01-8-000

ACTION:  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
SUMMARY:  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) recognizes =
that the filing of individual service agreements and paper copies of quarte=
rly market-based sales of electric energy is no longer the most effective m=
eans of meeting the requirements of the Federal Power Act (FPA).  Instead, =
this data must be collected and made publicly available in a manner which i=
s both easily accessible and useful to the public.  To this end, the Commis=
sion proposes that each public utility under the FPA (public utility) would=
 no longer file:  short-term or long-term service agreements for market-bas=
ed sales of electric energy; service agreements for those generally applica=
ble services, such as point-to-point transmission service, for which the pu=
blic utility has a standard form of agreement under its tariff; and Quarter=
ly Transaction Reports summarizing its short-term sales and purchases of po=
wer at market-based rates.  In lieu of the above listed filings, each publi=
c utility would file electronically with the Commission and post on its web=
site an Index of Customers that contains a summary of the contractual terms=
 and conditions in its service agreements for all jurisdictional services (=
market-based power sales, cost-based power sales, and transmission service)=
; and transaction information for its short-term and long-term market-based=
 power sales and cost-based power sales during the most recent calendar qua=
rter.  Under the proposals in this NOPR, to the extent a public utility wis=
hes to avoid filing service agreements for generally applicable services su=
ch as cost-based power sales or interconnection agreements, it would revise=
 its tariff to include standard forms of service agreements for those servi=
ces.  The NOPR also proposes to delete 18 CFR ?2.8, concerning the simplifi=
cation of public utility rate schedule filings, as no longer necessary.

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new=
 building and are currently parking in the Allen Center garage are being of=
fered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the=
 new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The =
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is cu=
rrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly empl=
oyee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name =
to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be m=
ade as spaces become available.=20

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not b=
e opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street=
 level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is avail=
able. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be us=
ed as an exit in the event of elevator trouble.=20

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Pa=
rking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your em=
ail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and=
 receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the =
new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and=
 Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.=20

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have=
 to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)"

Subject:	FW: Mandatory Setoff Language

Please see the attached note.  As our mass market retail contracts for Enron Direct Canada are much more unilateral in our favour, as this is more acceptable and consistent in this market segment, the existing set-off language in those forms provides broad rectangular set-off only in our favour.  My inclination is to leave it that way for these forms unless you think otherwise.  Peter.

Subject:	Mandatory Setoff Language

SENT ON BEHALF OF DEREK FLAMAN:

Further to our meeting on July 17, I have reviewed both the new mandatory setoff language as set forth in Mark Haedicke's memo dated July 12, 2001 (the ""New Setoff Language"") and the setoff language contained in the Enron Direct retail forms (the ""Retail Setoff Language"").  The following are the most notable differences between the two:

1.	The New Setoff Language is drafted for ""triangular"" setoff purposes.  The Retail Setoff Language is drafted for ""rectangular"" cross-affiliate setoff; as such, Enron Direct may setoff any amounts owed by Enron Direct or any of its affiliates to counterparty or any of counterparty's affiliates against any amounts owed to Enron Direct or any of its affiliates by counterparty or any of counterparty's affiliates.

2.	The New Setoff Language provides the non-defaulting party with the right of setoff - note that the non-defaulting party could be either an Enron entity or counterparty.  The Retail Setoff Language provides only Enron Direct with the right of setoff - counterparty has no setoff rights.

Given that:  (a)	the aforementioned differences are beneficial to Enron/Enron Direct, and (b) my understanding is that such differences are generally palatable to counterparties in the retail industry, please advise whether the New Setoff Language should be inputted into the Enron Direct retail forms.

Hi Babak

Could you please give me a call - Our credit group has been trying to get in touch with your credit group regarding some margining issues but have been unsuccessful.   I also tried Sonnet but her voicemail is full.  Thanks for you help.

Thanks for this - it is very helpful.  It seeme to have taken everybody by surprise even regulatory.  Have a great weekend and I will talk to you next week.
 
ps on the midmarket change .... I'll circle the wagons as long as necessary.  No way, no how, no reallocation.  In the East, we allocate work based on project not client base.  The West will likely be the same but .. thanks for the heads up so we can react in the most thoughtful of ways.
 
pss on the secretary front, I've been exchanging messages with Karen so I can get the facts and unanimous approval - I'll try to get MH's OK next weekend.  Will call when accomplished.

Elizabeth, 

Background: On Wednesday, October 10, the NPUC voted to authorize its General Counsel to seek to void or renegotiate certain SPP/NP long-term power contracts by either going to court or filing a complaint at FERC.  According to the utilities, the contracts are out-of-the-money by approximately $800 million. 

Enclosed, you'll find. . . .:  Attached is a spreadsheet showing all of the physical Enron-SPP/NP deals that are (1) currently flowing or (2) scheduled for future delivery.  I have left off transactions that have been completed because the tenor of SPP/NP's statements indicates that they are seeking prospective relief, not refunds.

I am also going to fax to you two pages showing our credit exposure to SPP and NP.  Worst case, back of the envelope, we are looking at approximately $400 million in MTM exposure for all deals.  However, the prices under these deals range from $27.50/MWh to $311/MWh (the $3.60 deal is for transmission).  It's extremely unlikely that FERC would (1) void every transaction or (2) reduce the price for every deal to $0.  Therefore, the true amount at risk is less than $400 million.

Bottom line:  All in all, I think the risk of FERC undoing these transactions is unlikely for the following reasons: 

1.  The ALJ in the Pacific Northwest refund case rejected claims for refunds of bilateral transactions because (1) the non-California long-term market was competitive, and (2) because of the concern about ""ripple"" claims.  Although the Commission has not yet adopted the ALJ's recommendation, I expect they will because it's the path of least resistance and has popular support.

2.  SPP/NP is the only party arguing that the Southwest market is uncompetitive.  This aspect was fatal to the Pacific Northwest claims because the majority of the market did not want refunds.

3.  SPP/NP was not required to buy power under these contracts----unlike the California utilities, which were required to buy from the PX.  Presumably, these were the lowest prices available at the time.

4.  If FERC voids or reprices these contracts, it will be pressured to do the same for California's DWR contracts. 

Contracts/Collateral:  These transactions are all under the WSPP.  We currently hold no collateral from SPP/NP.  Tracy Ngo informs me that we have not insisted on margin or additional collateral because her understanding was that the WSPP did not let her ask for collateral absent an objective event, such as a credit downgrade or failure to get a rate increase.  I advised her that the WSPP standard allows for a call for collateral if the counterparty's ""financial viability"" decreases.  My view is that SPP/NP's admission that it is $800 million under water is, in itself, cause for a margin call.  I am, however, sensitive to the fact that a margin call might (1) be perceived as ""punishing"" SPP/NP for ""trying to enforce the law,"" or (2) strengthen SPP/NP's resolve to seek refunds.  Tracy will not request collateral until you have weighed in on this.

Mitigation:  I spoke with Tim Belden and Tracy Ngo about this on Monday the 15th.  There is zero interest in trying to work with SPP/NP on a blend/extend.  ""Why should we loan a shaky counterparty more money?""  There is also the feeling that we stand a great chance of winning at FERC.  Ultimately, we three were unable to come up with any ways to mitigate the exposure, other than being ready to vigorously respond to this challenge at FERC and being prepared to issue a statement to the press after the complaint is filed at FERC.

Steve

I will be out of the office starting today and will not return until July 30. After we have finalized the terms of the extension with PG&E,  these are the forms that will need to be revised.  Lisa, if for any reason you need any help on this, please feel free to ask Carol for assistance.  She is out today but will be in Friday and Monday.  Thanks.

Subject:	Power Audit Finding

Elizabeth,

After going over the confirmation process with Kim Theriot and getting a
better understanding of that process, we have reworded
our finding as it relates to the confirmation template.  I think at this
point we agree that allowing read only access to the templates is not
beneficial for both groups.  However, we would recommend that legal at
least periodically review the templates (semi-annually or annually)
to ensure the confirmations are proper.  In addition, as an additional
step, have the deal clearing group attach the approval by legal to those
confirmations that require modifications so that an audit trail exists.
Take a look when you have a chance at the attachment below which has the
revised wording for the finding discussed above and get back to me with any
comments or questions.  Thank you.

Mark

'Seasoned Trader' Moving Up To Head Enron Broadband  By Erwin Seba  Of DOW =

bed as ""a seasoned trader"" will lead Enron Corp.'s (ENE) telecommunications=
 unit after its current chief executive takes a different position within c=
orporation in the next two weeks. James Fallon, president and chief operati=
ng officer, will lead Enron Broadband Services after it becomes part of Enr=
on's Wholesale Services Group.   Broadband Services Senior Vice President K=
elly Kimberly told Dow Jones Newswires Fallon will lead the organization af=
ter Kenneth Rice, chairman and chief executive, moves to a corporate job at=
 Enron.   Fallon was unavailable to talk to Dow Jones for this story.   One=
 broker said Fallon's selection indicated Enron isn't backing away from dev=
eloping the bandwidth market.   ""Jim Fallon is a seasoned trader,"" the brok=
er said. ""He made a killing in the power markets. He has a huge reputation =
for making money.""   The broker speculated that Fallon may increase the num=
ber of traders Enron has in the bandwidth market. Broadband Services has an=
nounced plans to reassign and possibly layoff non-trader employees in the c=
oming two weeks.   An analyst said Fallon's appointment indicates future gr=
owth for Enron's bandwidth business.   ""I think Fallon is someone who would=
n't be there if it isn't a good opportunity,"" said Raymond Niles, director =
of power and merchant energy research with Salomon Smith Barney.   In his n=
ew role, Fallon will report to Mark Frevert, chairman and chief executive o=
f Enron Wholesale Services, and Greg Whalley, president and chief operating=
 officer of Wholesale Services.   Rice previously reported to Kenneth Lay, =
corporate chairman and chief executive.   Before becoming president of Broa=
dband Services, Fallon was managing director of global trading and risk man=
agement for the unit.   From 1993 to 1999, he worked in Enron North America=
's wholesale energy business rising from the position of associate to manag=
ing director, leading the power trading business.   Before coming to Enron,=
 Fallon was a nuclear operations engineer for General Electric, a systems e=
ngineer at W.R. Grace and a certified public accountant for Price Waterhous=
e.   Fallon earned a bachelor's degree in marine engineering from the Massa=
chusetts Maritime Academy, a master's degree in accounting from Northeaster=
n University and a master's in business administration from Columbia Univer=
sity.   Fallon takes over a unit that lost $102 million in the second quart=
er of this year and is going through a restructuring to reduce losses at th=
e same time bandwidth prices continue to plummet.   -By Erwin Seba, Dow Jon=

Here are a draft risk memo for this transaction and a set of confirms.  David Mitchell is going to fax a sentence to include in the confirms to deal with the bankruptcy void risk, to me.  I am asking you,  David, by this message, to kindly send the sentence to Elizabeth by e'mail. 

The commercial terms of each trade still need to be put into the confirms.  

Elizabeth thanks very much for helping to get this finished.   ----cgy

Hello Mark -- I have attached an updated agenda with a minor adjustment:
Emerging Market Forms is changed to Developing Products Market Forms to
better flow with the Committee focus on developing products with an
additional focus on weather derivatives and bandwidth.  This also appears to
be the appropriate place to explore the need to update ISDA's Commodity
Definitions.

Unless you have any objections or additional thoughts I'll go ahead and
issue this agenda with the invitation tomorrow.

Hi Ken

In accordance with Lisa's call to you, here are revised drafts of the Modification Agreement and LC for your review.  By copy of this email I am at the same time circulating the documents for review by others at Enron. I apologize in advance for not sending a blackline (a glitch here prevented me from making final changes in blackline) - if you are unable to make a marked copy from your prior version, let me know and I will attempt Tuesday morning to send you one. Thanks again for your help in getting this finalized.

Liz-

Hope all is well.  This is a follow up email to the phone message I left you
this morning.

Please see the attached email from Enron's Kimberly Indelicato.  From the
information I have received it appears that this issue has reared its head
because we have asked Enron to sign our EEI confirmation when EKT is the
Seller.  I have looked through our executed EEI and I find no amendment,
addition, deletion, etc.... to Article 2, Transaction Terms and Conditions,
Section 2.3 Confirmation.  EKT believes that it is in compliance with
Section 2.3.  Specifically ...""Seller may confirm a Transaction by
forwarding to Buyer by facsimile within three (3) Business Days after the
Transaction is entered into a confirmation (""Confirmation"") substantially in
the form of Exhibit A.""

EKT believes it has complied with the requirements of Section 2.3.

Please give me a call when you get a chance.

Elizabeth,

In his absence, Christian asked me to prepare long-form WSPP confirms to govern existing transactions between EPMI and the above counterparties.  While we are also working on EEI agreements with these counterparties, existing credit exposure is high and Tracy Ngo has requested that we move forward with the WSPP confirms as a stop-gap measure.  I would like to run the confirms by you for approval early next week before sending them to the counterparties.  Let me know if this works for you.

Feel free to contact me by email or phone at (503) 294-9829.

Hi Martin

Received your email but I don't have any particular knowledge in this area.  I would assume but without any knowledge that an English judgment would be enforceable in the US ( I would assume that we give English law  guarantees all the time for ISDA and other trading contracts which would have to be enforced against Enron in the US)  Maybe Justin Boyd in London or Clement Abrams (Enron corp attorney who works on guarantees ) would be able to help.  Good luck.

Elizabeth

A trading counterparty of the Oslo office has rejected receiving an Enron Corp. Guaranty governed by English law and subjected to English jurisdiction on the basis that  judgments rendered by an English court may not be directly or safely enforceable in the U.S. (nor is New York or Texan law/jurisdiction an option in this case).  Perhaps you or your group could give me a quick guidance on the position of U.S. law as to the enforceability of English and foreign (civil law) judgments.  Additionally, I wonder if you've seen an arbitration clause in any Corp. Guaranty or can advise whether such an approach to dispute resolution would be acceptable to Corp. (since it is to this c/p).  Many thanks.

Hello Everyone,

I am Bowling, yes, you saw right bowling for Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA)  Saturday, July 14th.
So I am fishing for donations   << OLE Object: Microsoft Word Picture >> 

Would any of you marvelously wonderful, generous, philanthropic people, like to donate to the cause (and I don't mean the Suzanne Kelly cause)?  All donations will benefit research for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and 40 other neuromuscular diseases.  Any donations would be greatly appreciated.  I can be contacted by e-mail or at 713-345-4192.

Thank you all in advance,

Has anyone begun to address the issues surrounding the EEI product definitions and the new rules associated with ""transporting"" power across the new RTO/ISO control areas? Upon discussions with parties involved with the Midwest ISO (""MISO"") when scheduling power through the MISO control area a party will no longer designate an interface but only a source and a sink and the Control Area will determine the best path through its system. How will this affect the obligations of the products as defined under EEI. In particular how will this affect the ""Into"" product definition if the buyer and seller no longer have the ability to select an Interface?

Which by the way, I hope you got to see.  Monday's match was unbelievable. Any chance LLGM is thinking of opening a London office, replete with ... oh, never mind.  See ya on Wed (just call whenever is convenient)

Elizabeth:  sounds good for Wednesday.  Does something in the 12:30 range sound OK for you?  As of right now, I am planning to fly down Wed. a.m. so that should be pretty safe.  I heard you were tied up all weekend in the Wimbledon doubles matches--is that true?  John

Hi Andy

I apologize for the delay in turning the Morgan draft of Collateral Annex - regular business got in the way and we were finishing the final touches on the Collateral Annex that Enron will use pending ""adoption"" by EEI of its collateral annex (I will forward a copy to you when done).  This process of discussing our internal draft really helped frame some issues in general and will facilitate our putting together a good draft for the EEI group.  I talked to Carol this morning and she is working this week on incorporating all the comments received  into the Morgan draft and we should have something to you no later than the 16th. 


Carol's number is 713 853 3989 if you need to reach her for any reason.


Thanks and I look forward to seeing you in August.

Hi, Liz.   Mom's car is being worked on this week, and I should get it back
tomorrow.  It will probably take me another month or two to get it licensed
in Maryland, because I don't want to take a day off from work to deal with
it.  I wonder if you would please start thinking of some system for
disbursing property from the estate.  Figuring out what to do with the car
has been more than vaguely troubling to me, and I think I figured out the
major reason why.  There are some X number of items of property in the
estate that need to be dealt with.   Each of us will likely want to keep
some and not care about others.  Some of them will likely need to be valued
within the estate, and some of them we can probably disburse informally and
outside of the estate.  How do you want to divide these things up?  The car
just seems to be the first of these things that we need to deal with,
because it costs money to maintain.   Shall we have a lottery for all of
the personal property items?  Shall we sell everything and disburse cash?
Or shall we do something in between?  I would like to deal with the car in
the context of everything else.  I do need a new car at some point soon,
but there is nothing sentimental to me about that car  that would make me
want to keep it (except that it is a convertible, which I could not justify
buying for myself at this point) unless I get it for below market value,
which would not be fair to you or Chi.   The blue book value of the car is
only about $2000, I think, at which price I would probably choose to keep
it until my legal fees are done with and I know where I stand financially.
It is possible we could sell it for $4000 - 5000, but I don't know.   I
know I would not pay $4000 for it.

Looking down the road, I know I think about wanting to improve Andrew's
room, and I think about wanting one of the chest of drawer's that are at
Bob's house.  This is probably sentimental, because I don't think Andrew
will care anytime soon, but, in any case, I don't know what the things are
worth.  I do know that I would like to have a system in place where I don't
need to worry too much about what dollar value we each think something is
worth."

Hi Chris

1.  We don't have a ""one off form"" for US power trading, but it may be possible to use the US GTCs (3 pages) - this document contemplates multiple trades but is shorter than EEI.  It however does not define INTO products, and in general EEI is much better and longer.  Credit usually insists on using EEI w full blown credit and product definitions.

2. Success always comes at a price - great job winning out the financial vs. physical debate.  (ps you may think the pain is over but ... in the US, meetings continue in August to finalize collateral annex and new products. oh boy).

Hope all is good and Addy is doing well. Tell Tracy Hi and that I've been waiting for a psychological improvement before I call her - at this rate it may never happen so I'll just have to bit the bullet and call her in my never ending foul mood.  See ya all soon I hope.

Elizabeth - Two things:

1.  One of our originators has been talking to a Canadian counterparty that wants to do a one-off term (3 year) purchase and sale transaction ""into Entergy"".  Would they need to put an EEI form in place or is there another document they could use for a one time transaction.  The customer is a pulp, paper and forestry products company.   

2.  We expect to release a form of EEI master in Toronto later this week.  With the warm weather and the 8 month process I have had to not only act as draftsman, but also meeting organizer, communications coordinator, and a number of other roles that have been extremely satisfying.  While I am satisfied that I managed to keep the group from making too many changes to the EEI form I look forward to closure on this project.

Hi Larry

I haven't talked to Bill, but everyone else is OK with letter.  I thought I would go ahead and prepare execution copies using today's date for everything, get Bill to sign and then fax to you.  Assuming everything is OK with your folks, you could then sign and fax back.  If this is OK, let me know and include the fax number where I should send the letter agreement.  Thanks

Attached is a draft of the Extension Agreement prepared by PG&E and revised by me.  Larry is fine with all changes.  Please review and let me know if you have any comments. Current standstill expired on the 20th and LCs expire on the 29th(Friday).

 Bill - LCs must be soon replaced ; Is someone working on this? Do you want me to look at draw conditions on revised LCs to make sure they track language in Standstill Letter (ie only draw on non-payment in accordance w master)?

I am attaching my proposed changes to the draft - I thought it might speed things up if you and I came up with a form we think works and then circulate it to our respective commercial folks for their approval.  Then if any of our respective commercial folks have any changes we will be that much closer.  Thanks again for all  your help.  Talk to you soon.

Good morning, Elizabeth.  Thanks for your call.  Attached below is my first
draft of the extension agreement.  I'm flying without instrumentation on
this, though, and your review and comments would be very helpful.  I'm tied
up for a good bit of this morning, but will call when I free up.  Larry

Hi 
Sorry I couldn't get back with you sooner -I was stuck in an EES meeting which lasted until 700 and then it followed me home for several hours only to be awoken at 1130 with news that ""only I"" had the authority to sign off on the deal and that it had to be done that night.  At 100, I said I'm done see you in the am.  In the darkness of early morning, we continued.  A temporary calm exists;  the tropical depression looms.  Call you when the rain ceases.
ps Boston was great, thanks

Subject:	Hi

How was your trip to Boston?  It was a bit ""hot"" for Boston this weekend
(something like 82 degrees).  Anyway, hope you all had a good time.  I
think I need a martini (I have put 2 kittens to sleep in the past two days
and 2 others have died in my house in the past 3 days, yuck).  Any chance
you can slip out earlish tonight for a drink?  I have my 5 o'clock lawyer
call, but might be inclinded to skip it since I also have a 4 o'clock
lawyer call on bankruptcy issues.

Subject:=09Re: Draft Responses to FERC Staff


Question1:=09In providing an answer to our questions regarding risk assessm=
ent or management, would you please provide an explanation to the following=
?  We understand that EOL requires that a counter party, before accessing E=
OL to do business with Enron North America, must undergo a credit worthines=
s evaluation.   When a counter party executes or clicks on a price, EOL doe=
s an instant credit check before confirming the transaction.
However, Enron may not only buy from a counter party, it may sell.  What so=
rt of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party util=
izing EOL to purchase from Enron?
Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter p=
arty credit risk that Enron uses?  If yes, may we have copies?  If Enron ut=
ilizes its own agreements, please provide us with a copy.

All counterparties are assessed by our credit department prior to any trans=
action being entered into by Enron whether the transaction is being conduct=
ed over the phone or through EnronOnline.  Enron, as the principal to all p=
urchases and sales on EnronOnline and when completing transactions on the t=
elephone or in writing, requires counterparties to be creditworthy.  In add=
ition, Enron's risk management process is required to be approved by the En=
ron Board of Directors, according to Securities Exchange Act regulations as=
 a publicly held company.  Enron's risk policies are provided in Enron's pu=
blicly available [[10-Q??]]_______ audited financial statements filed on a =
quarterly and annual basis with the SEC.  Enron maintains a separate risk m=
anagement group that has oversight over all transactions done by all Enron =
trading units and that ensures compliance with the risk management policies=
.  This group has a separate reporting line directly to the office of the C=
hairman of Enron Corp. and has the authority to instruct the suspension of =
transactions in order to ensure that trading limits are not exceeded.  In a=
ddition, every counterparty of Enron has to clear a credit check before the=
y can transact through EnronOnline.  The Credit Risk Management group appro=
ves a counterparty for a specific credit limit and tenor limit which are em=
bedded within the EnronOnline database.    Every transaction is passed thro=
ugh an electronic credit check to assure that the credit limits and tenor l=
imits are not violated prior to Enron accepting the counterparty's bid or o=
ffer via EnronOnline, such credit checks are done automatically and there i=
s no human intervention.  As with all Enron transactions, the credit limit =
checks utilize a potential exposure calculation to take into account future=
 price volatility.  The Credit Risk Management group monitors transaction f=
low on all Enron transactions including EnronOnline continually.   EnronOnl=
ine does provide CRM with electronic alerts when customers approach credit =
limits or breach credit limits.  No further transactions are executed unles=
s CRM is sufficiently satisfied that the credit position has been mitigated=
 such that credit limit is still available.

EnronOnline uses the same credit policy as other transactions Enron enters =
into, whether we are buying or selling.  The transactions entered into on E=
nronOnline are all governed by either a Master Agreement or the General Ter=
ms and Conditions (which are a shorter form of contract and differ for each=
 commodity, these are all available on the web-site).  A Master Agreement i=
s negotiated with the Counterparty offline and includes negotiated bilatera=
l credit terms and these terms govern any transactions entered into on Enro=
nOnline.  The General Terms and Conditions which will apply to EnronOnline =
transactions if there is no Master Agreement in place between Enron and the=
 counterparty include industry standard credit requirements which the count=
erparty chooses to accept or not online, should the counterparty not want t=
o accept to language in the contract (for credit or other reasons), the Hel=
pdesk for EnronOnline will facilitate contact between the Enron Credit grou=
p or Enron Legal group with the counterparty allowing the Counterparty to n=
egotiate terms which may be more appropriate to them.

Question 2:    I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect=
 data regarding where a customer's mouse is moving on the system.  However,=
 does EOL require customers to have cookies enabled?   If yes, does EOL col=
lect, use or manage data regarding cookies?

It is correct that Enron does not collect data regarding where a customer's=
 mouse is moving on the system.  It is also correct to note that we have no=
 capability of knowing where the customer's mouse is. =20

EnronOnline does not require customers to have cookies enabled. =20

Question 3:=09Also, why doesn't EOL publish a ""ticker"" of completed trades =
showing prices and quantities?  Does EOL have any plans to start publishing=
 such data?  If yes, when?

There are now several options for viewing historical pricing/transaction da=
ta from EnronOnline.  Reuters recently began showing quotes from EnronOnlin=
e (http://about.reuters.com/enrononlinequotes/), which also provides custom=
ers with the ability to reference historical prices from the date at which =
they acquire access.  In addition, EnronOnline provides a number of online =
charts for products, which graphically depict historical transaction prices=
.  Customers can also run reports to see their own transactions and downloa=
d the results into an Excel spreadsheet on EnronOnline  The system also all=
ows for administrative users, thereby allowing the back offices of counterp=
arties to monitor the trading activity and deal with it appropriately in li=
ne with their own systems.

Enron does not publish transactions completed via EnronOnline however Enron=
 will provide information on such transactions in order to ensure market ac=
tivity is being correctly reflected in the approriate market indices. For e=
xample, Enron does provide EnronOnline transaction data to the Natural Gas =
Exchange in Calgary in order to ensure that indices produced by Canadian En=
erdata accuately reflect the activity in the market place (this will commen=
ce on July 1, 2001).  At the end of each day, EnronOnline makes available t=
o all customers through EnronOnline the weighted average price of that day'=
s transactions.  The data associated with US Natural Gas is sent in this fo=
rmat to Gas Daily for inclusion in their automated exchange index.

Question 4: =09In addition, how does the data collection from EOL/Enron Net=
works flow to the risk management groups?  How is the information used?

EnronOnline transactions are sent to different risk management groups depen=
ding on the type of commodity transacted.  For example, the group that hand=
les U.S. gas settlements is not the same group as the one handling Australi=
an Power.  The transactions are transmitted to the appropriate back office =
utilizing a ""bridge"":  a process that is capable of communicating transacti=
on information into the variety of systems that Enron operates. The potenti=
al for manual input error is thereby removed providing Enron and the custom=
er with more efficient recording of the transaction. The back office system=
s at Enron use transaction information as an input into various functions, =
such as invoicing, preparation of financial statements, risk management and=
 credit.  These back office systems are used to track transactions from all=
 sources, including EnronOnline, the telephone, other trading systems, etc.=
  Information is maintained on these systems according to accounting and re=
gulatory rules, regardless of the source of the transaction.

The Enron commercial employee, who is offering to buy or to sell through En=
ronOnline, does so through a price management software application, this no=
tifies him immediately that a transaction is completed.  The counterparty, =
the Enron commercial employee and the risk management groups are all notifi=
ed by the system at the same time. =20

The data from an EnronOnline transaction is used in exactly the same way as=
 information is used from any transaction completed by Enron. When a transa=
ction is completed, EnronOnline serves purely as a deal capture system that=
 captures the data necessary to feed to our risk management system.  Enron =
Online does not feed settlement systems or credit systems.  It does, howeve=
r, automate our deal capture system, which improves the data feeds to our s=
ettlement and credit systems.

Question 5:=09Also, we assume that data regarding each trade is maintained =
by EOL.  If yes, in what form and for how long?

EnronOnline transactions are captured in the EnronOnline database.  The tra=
nsactions are 'bridged' (duplicated) onto the various systems (databases) m=
anaging the underlying commodity (the risk system associated with the commo=
dity).  We currently intend to store the data for a period of six years pos=
t a transaction completing (for example, deliveries finishing) and this is =
policy across all databases.

In general, EnronOnline is an electronic trading platform that offers free,=
 real-time pricing information for approximately 1,800 products for 13 comm=
odities, including electricity and natural gas.  EnronOnline utilizes e-com=
merce and Internet technology to conduct trading business that previously t=
ook place on the telephone and by fax.   EnronOnline is a proprietary, or ""=
one-to-many"" trading platform. On a ""one-to-many"" platform, one entity, suc=
h as Enron, is the principal to every trade (unlike a ""broker"" type platfor=
m). =20

EnronOnline allows buyers and sellers to act on prices that can change by t=
he second.  Buyers or sellers can also see real-time price spreads of both =
the sell price and the buy price.  For example, on the telephone, a buyer p=
reviously would call to ask about gas prices for each of the next six month=
s, but by the time the trader finished reciting the prices, some prices cou=
ld have changed.  EnronOnline allows counterparties to see the 'bid and off=
er prices"" all the time to make more informed decisions.

The energy products offered on EnronOnline are subject to federal oversight=
 as follows:   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (""CFTC"") has enforc=
ement authority over physical transactions on EnronOnline to police for pot=
ential manipulation.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has regulato=
ry authority over physical natural gas and electricity sales for resale. =
=20

The CFTC has anti-fraud and anti-manipulation enforcement jurisdiction over=
 financially settled derivatives (swaps and options).  Moreover, pursuant t=
o the Commodity Exchange Act (""CEA""), Enron can only trade derivatives with=
 counterparties that qualify as sophisticated according to such rules.  Suc=
h transactions are permitted as long as both parties are Eligible Contract =
Participants (""ECPs"")(generally, corporations, partnerships and other entit=
ies that meet net worth or asset tests). =20

EnronOnline is a proprietary, bilateral trading platform on which Enron is =
a principal to every trade.  As such, EnronOnline is not a ""trading facilit=
y"" as defined under the CFMA.  As a proprietary platform, EnronOnline uses =
Internet technology to provide another method of communication between Enro=
n and its customers. =20

    CALIF. DWR AGREES TO FOOT WINDFALL PROFITS TAX FOR SOME
     Some generators that have reached long-term contract deals
with California will not have to pay a windfall profits tax if
it's approved by the legislature, reports Dow Jones Newswires
after an state Senate Energy Committee hearing yesterday.
Instead, the Dept. of Water Resources will foot the bill.
     DWR director Ray Hart told lawmakers: ""In some of our
contracts, in order to preserve economics, we had to assure
(generators) that we were not going to tax them."" Critics said it
didn't make sense since the state would essentially be taxing
itself. One official with Dynegy Inc. said dealing with the DWR
""was like playing poker with a second grader"" since the agency
seemed willing to ""give up a lot"" (Dow Jones Newswires, Jun. 21).

Hi Elizabeth,

Please find attached a form of a form of retail gas contract and retail electricity contract which we are currently using.  In the retail gas contract, the relevant provisions of the terms and conditions are s.19 Obligations to Third Parties, s.25 Amendments and s.26(c) Termination.

In the retail electricity agreement, the relevant provision is s.25(c).

I hope this helps.

  
If you have any questions or difficulties accessing the documents, please give me a call at (403) 663-2812.

Thanks,

Firstly, we had some clauses that were in used pre-Alberta dereg. in wholesale confirms that were intended to give us outs in the event that we were found liable for market interference (which ultimately we were not) under ""Project Stanley"", and also to deal with the fact that there was some threat that market opening may be delayed or that there may be adverse regulatiory interference (such as price caps).  We no longer use these clauses and they were problematic for a number of reasons, including that they were difficult to draft in a way that disguised the issue from our perspective and nonetheless made the transaction ""firm"" and acceptable to our counterparties.

We also have more general reg. out language in our retail contracts, which by their nature are far more unilateral and less negotiated.

Mark Powell can e-mail you all of these clauses.

Hi Peter

We are starting to work w EES on various retail transactions and the issue of reg outs is front and center for them, what with all the changes that will occur in response to the California crisis.  I think I remember you saying that some of the Canadian deals had reg out clauses.  Do you have any good reg out language that you think would be helpful for me to look at? Thanks

AStorey@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

NYISO opens its Virtual Marketplace on November 1. Whether you've
registered to participate in it, are considering doing so, or are
interested in its potential impact on the existing markets, you'll want to
attend one of the two upcoming seminars scheduled for October 16 and 29.

The programs will cover:
     NYISO bidding fundamentals - a short overview for those new to the
NYISO marketplace
     Virtual Transaction basics
     Virtual Transaction entry
     Virtual Transaction charges
     Billing
     Credit requirements
     Illustrations and examples
     Market Monitoring functions involving Virtual Transactions

Each one-day program will be intensive and practical. It will address your
virtual bidding options and the impact these bids will have on prices in
both the day-ahead and real-time markets. It will give you a good picture
as to how this market works and how your participation may be advantageous
to you.

The day-ahead and real-time markets will change as a result of this new
option. Therefore, this course will be extremely valuable, not only to
those bidding virtual transactions, but also to everyone bidding load or
supply in the existing energy markets.

The course will be run on the following dates as indicated:
     October 16     Albany Marriott, 189 Wolf Road, Albany, New York
     October 29     Desmond Hotel, 660 Albany-Shaker Road, Albany, New York

Course Registration will begin at 8:00 am and the course will start at 8:30
am. Wrap-up each day will be by 4:00 pm.

Register for the seminar through our web site at:
http://www.nyiso.com/services/training/cinfo/index.html

Hi Peter

We are starting to work w EES on various retail transactions and the issue of reg outs is front and center for them, what with all the changes that will occur in response to the California crisis.  I think I remember you saying that some of the Canadian deals had reg out clauses.  Do you have any good reg out language that you think would be helpful for me to look at? Thanks

These contracts are the CDWR deals that got released over the weekend - I'm glad you have them (I was getting copies from Reliant but I'll wait for yours... it will be really interesting to see how the CDWR deals were done).

Elizabeth and Steve, 

Suddenly Jeff Dasovich was on my line telling me he was shipping all of the ""released California contracts"" up here for quick legal analysis. My first reaction was:  why does Enron have to analyze them?   He is apparently part of a working committee of some sort that is advising the government.  These are the contracts that Davis has held on to so long, but is now releasing, and which will show that he bought high priced power and locked it in for long terms.  Jeff says he is in a room with a bunch of idiots who know nothing about contracts and they are all asking questions about the ""out clauses.""  He wants us to tell him what the ""out clauses"" are all about.  Enron never signed a long term deal, so I am wondering what, besides a kind of bizarre curiousity, would have us in that room down there trying to help a bunch of hysterical bureaucrats paw through a foot of legal paper.  

We will get the contracts tomorrow morning and haul them along with us on the plane on the trip down, then talk with Jeff from Houston.  ----cgy "

I understand that the Broadmoor is sold out for the night of the 9th, including the block of rooms held for the WSPP Contracting Meeting.  There is a waiting list, but the waiting list is long.  Here is a list of alternate hotels/resorts in the area, the hotels/resorts have been checked and they do have rooms available:

Cheyenne Mountain Conference Resort  (2.5 miles away from Broadmoor)
3225 Broadmoor Valley Road

I assume that you may have already handled this, but just in case I thought I would remind you that the expiration date under the existing standstill agreement is June 20th.  My general sense is that I thought we probably would want to extend it, at least once to see if any type of deal is possible.  Is that the current thinking?

I assume that your groundstrokes are pretty powerful now since you have been practicing for a few days with very haeavy and soggy tennis balls.  In all seriousness, I hope that you made it through the weekend ok.

Let me know if you want to follow up.  I am looking for a ""doctor's note"" to escape from Sithe.

Elizabeth,
Hi!  Next month LSI is holding a conference on restructuring in the Southwest (Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico).  I would like to attend.  Would Enron pay for my tuition and travel expenses?  The cost of the seminar is $397. 
The conference is July 19 and 20 (Thursday and Friday).  Christian will be on vacation that week, but he said that he thought it would be fine if I went as long as I was available by cell phone.
Steve



ENERGY RESTRUCTURING IN THE SOUTHWEST

July 19 & 20, 2001
Las Vegas, Nevada
Alexis Park Resort
A B O U T T H E C O N F E R E N C E

""In the wake of California's energy market turbulence during the past summer and the subsequent state of emergency beginning in January 2001, states throughout the Western region are reexamining and, in some cases, reversing their policies regarding restructuring of the electric utility industry. This has resulted in ever changing and frequently confusing laws and policies affecting utilities, energy service providers and customers in Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico. This conference will help lay the groundwork for energy professionals from all sectors to better understand current market and regulatory conditions in the Southwest, and the faculty of expert speakers will provide insight as to how evolving policies will shape the markets of the future.""

Program Co-Chairs: Arthur O'Donnell and Fred Schmidt, Esq.

Credits: CA: 14 MCLE credits; NV: application pending. Call about other states

Who Should Attend? Lawyers, producers, public and private distributors, customers, brokers, regulatory agencies and anyone else involved in the area's economic development"

TO MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY:
(Written by Andy Rooney ..................................., BUT FROM ME!)

I've learned....That the best classroom in the world is at the feet of an
elderly person.

I've learned....That when you're in love, it shows.

I've learned....That just one person saying to me, ""You've made my day!""
makes my day.

I've learned....That having a child fall asleep in your arms is one of the
most peaceful feelings in the world.

I've learned....That being kind is more important than being right.

I've learned....That you should never say no to a gift from a child.

I've learned....That I can always pray for someone when I don't have the
strength to help him in some other way.

I've learned....That no matter how serious your life requires you to be,
everyone needs a friend to act goofy with.

I've learned....That sometimes all a person needs is a hand to hold and a
heart to understand.

I've learned....That simple walks with my father around the block on summer
nights when I was a child did wonders for me as an adult.

I've learned....That life is like a roll of toilet paper. The closer it gets
to the end, the faster it goes.

I've learned....That we should be glad God doesn't give us everything we ask
for.

I've learned....That money doesn't buy class.

I've learned....That it's those small daily happenings that make life so
spectacular.

I've learned...That under everyone's hard shell is someone who wants to be
appreciated and loved.

I've learned....That the Lord didn't do it all in one day. What makes me
think I can?

I've learned.... That to ignore the facts does not change the facts.

I've learned....That when you plan to get even with someone, you are only
letting that person continue to hurt you.

I've learned....That love, not time, heals all wounds.

I've learned....That the easiest way for me to grow as a person is to
surround myself with people smarter than I am.

I've learned....That everyone you meet deserves to be greeted with a smile.

I've learned....That there's nothing sweeter than sleeping with your babies
and feeling their breath on your cheeks.

I've learned....That no one is perfect until you fall in love with them.

I've learned....That life is tough, but I'm tougher.

I've learned....That opportunities are never lost; someone will take the
ones you miss.

I've learned....That when you harbor bitterness, happiness will dock
elsewhere.

I've learned....That I wish I could have told my Mom that I love her one
more time before she passed away.

I've learned....That one should keep his words both soft and tender because
tomorrow he may have to eat them.

I've learned....That a smile is an inexpensive way to improve your looks.

I've learned....That I can't choose how I feel, but I can choose what I do
about it.

I've learned....That when your newly born grandchild holds your little
finger in his little fist, that you're hooked for life.

I've learned....That everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all
the happiness and growth occurs while you're climbing it.

I've learned....That it is best to give advice in only two circumstances;
when it is requested and when it is a life threatening situation.

I've learned....That the less time I have to work with, the more things I
get done.

I've learned....Friends are very rare jewels, indeed.  They make you smile
and encourage you to succeed.  They lend an ear, they share words of praise
and they always want to open their hearts to us.


It's National Friendship Week. Show your friends how much you care.  Send
this to everyone you consider a FRIEND, even if it means sending it back to
the person who sent it to you.  If it comes back to you, then you'll know
you have a circle of friends.

HAPPY FRIENDSHIP WEEK!  YOU ARE MY FRIEND,  I AM YOURS, AND I AM DEEPLY
HONORED!

Hi 
Just wondering if you got the package I sent via FedEx last week and had had a chance to get the letters signed.  
I heard that you got more reinforcements recently (Travis and Kaye), and I hope that things continue to go well there.

market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion
List:


COLLATERAL CALCULATION FOR APPLICANTS FOR THE VIRTUAL TRANSACTIONS MARKET:

The largest price delta observed at the 97th percentile level during June,
July, and August, 2001, was $159.33. This
amount  should be rounded to the nearest dollar amount ($159.00) when used
in the collateral calculation process..

The collateral formula is as follow:

The price delta of $159.00 is multiplied by the exposure calculation factor
of 14 ($159.00 x 14 = $2,226.00).  This equals the dollar amount of
collateral required per mega watt hour (MWH).  The $2,226.00 is then
multiplied by the maximum number of MWH's the Market Participant may wish
to bid on a daily basis.  The Market Participant notifies the NYISO of the
maximum number of MWH's they  may wish to bid  per day by completing,
executing and returning the  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CERTIFICATION OF
UNDERSTANDING OF NYISO FINANCIAL ASSURANCE POLICY AND PROCEDURES FOR
VIRTUAL TRANSACTIONS.  This document is attached to Addendum A of the NYISO
Registration Packet dated August 28, 2001.(refer to Page A6 of the Addendum
A).  The NYISO Registration Packet is located on the NYISO web site at:

http://www.nyiso.com/services/relations/cregistration/pdf/nyiso_reg.pdf

The example used in Addendum A stated the Market Participant wished to bid
up to a maximum of 1600 MWH's per day.

In this example, the collateral required would be $2,226.00 x 1600.
Consequently, the collateral requirement to bid up to a maximum of 1600
MWH's per day in the Virtual Transactions Market would be $3,561,600.

Please contact NYISO Customer Relations if you have any questions.

Regards,
NYISO Customer Relations

Oh no.  In the meanwhile,

Ella learned to tie her shoes. Unbelievalbe , but she just did it, just like that.  I talked to her about having Ms Jane help her learn and she put me to shame.

Sam misses you.

I want to book the Broadmoor - it looks great, 3 days tennis, 1/2 day Friday, Sat and Sun, August 10, 11, 12.  Dede is booked, and I have a call in for you and me.  You'll come, right?

I miss you.

I signed up for a little mixed doubles on Friday night, 630 -830.  Do you want me to sign you up?

Everybody is fine.

done  ... and not just that; I'm cruising the internet, investigating the Broadmoor's ""professional"" tennis camp for the weekend of August 10, 11, 12 and booking rooms.  I asked for 4.  How's your game?

In the meanwhile I've been trying to call you but I can't get through to Portland.  Is it raining there?  Give me a call.

Bill McCoy at Morgan Stanley was asked to prepare the first draft, a copy of which I am forwarding to you for your review. Please review and let either Shari or I know if you have any comments or thoughts - while EEI's message does not indicate when comments are due ( I have a call into EEI but have not yet heard back), I have asked Shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch with EEI within the next week or so.

Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=""------------E36A7CD4CD12DC11F94F8638""

Andy,  As discussed, heer is MSDW's proposal for a draft version of a
Collateral Annex that can be used in connection with the EEI Agreement
(it would be advisable for a clause to be included in the EEI cover
sheet incorporating the collateral annex by reference).  We are offering
this draft as a starting point for the industry's efforts to develop an

Dear Market Participants:

Methodology used in developing the NYISO Virtual Bidding Credit
Requirements:

Day Ahead Market Hourly Zonal LBMP and Real Time Market Integrated Hourly
Zonal LBMP values were used as the data source for developing the NYISO
Virtual Bidding Credit Requirements.  These values are available on the
NYISO web site.  The time period of June 1, 2001 through August 31, 2001
was used.  Peak hours are defined here as the hours of 6am (06:00) through
and including 10pm (22:00).  The absolute value of the difference of the
DAM and R/T price was calculated for each peak hour.  The 97th percentile
of these series of prices was calculated for each zone.  The maximum of
these zonal 97th percentiles was calculated to be $159.33.  The data
manipulation and calculation was performed in MS Excel. The attached
spreadsheet contains the data used in the June 2001 to August 2001
calculations.


(See attached file: Virt Bidding Credit Req data.xls)

By copy of this email, I am asking Mary Cook to send to you a draft of the latest form of MNA.  This MNA , I believe, is still a work in progress and is intended to include  only  Master Agreements for which we are comfortable that the underlying transactions are commodities subject to the special bankruptcy code protections.  Hope it helps.

Elizabeth,

We are working on a settlement transaction which will leave a variety of
relationships in place with a group of financially troubled companies. We'd been
negotiating a netting agreement, and after you spoke to our group, it occurred
to us that we ought to take a look at your netting agreements for potential use
in our transaction. Could you please forward an example of one to me? We would
be netting with multiple parties on both sides, so it will be a ""rectangular""
netting arrangement, if I recall your descriptive terminology correctly.

Thanks much.

Paul Puchot

Ella has an appointment for 1 hour 1130-1230 with Loiuse (recommended by Ms Ing and who is also a good friend of Mary Baisich the women in Clear Lake I was waiting on ) 6 blocks from AOS next Wed.  I'm working on insurance coverage now.  My appointment at MD Anderson may conflict - can you make it if I can't?"

Andy

Perhaps we could clarify the following issues at our next meeting:

*	Is there a difference between credit assurances and performance
assurances?
*	Is a guarantee considered a credit assurance or a performance
assurance?
*	In sections 8.1 (c) and 8.2 (c), I am not sure that a margin call is
clearly defined. I believe that initial performance/credit assurance such as
a guarantee to support a collateral threshold should be excluded from this
definition, otherwise you would be reducing the overlimit amount by the
amount of the guarantee posted at the time of contract execution.

Your comments would be appreciated.

Hi Joy
 
I RSVP'd yes to this but did not know of the about Indian Princesses schedule- Ella and Grant will be out of town on the 20th so will not be able to make the Scouting for Food event. Sorry.  Thanks and talk to you soon.

Subject: Brownies! - Scouting for Food




Hello Brownie Families,

 

Our 1st grade Brownie troop is starting up!   During our first meeting, the girls learned a bit of GS history, said the Girl  Scout Promise and Law, sang two new GS songs and talked about the many  activities that they might participate in as a Girl Scout.  We also made 55  greeting cards for a Council sponsored service project where cards will be  sent to residents of nursing homes in Texas.  It was a great  meeting!

 

A few days after our troop meeting, we learned  of an interesting service opportunity.  

Scouting for Food is a special day, October 20th,  for Girl Scouts to help feed the hungry.  Girls ages 6-11years old will  tour the Houston Food Bank, participate in a service project, have a snack and  receive a ""Scouting for Food"" patch.

 

The specifics are:

Saturday, October 20th, 9:00 a.m. - 11:15  a.m.

Houston Food Bank, 3811 Eastex Freeway, Houston, TX  77026

A parent needs to accompany each  child.

Response deadline:  Wednesday, September 25, email Joy  Lee jeffjoylee@earthlink.net <<mailto:jeffjoylee@earthlink.net>> , or  713-660-8764

 

There is a fee of $3 per girl for this event.   The troop will be paying for the girls, therefore it is VERY IMPORTANT that we  have an accurate count.  There is no fee for the parents.

 

Sorry for the short deadline, but we have to pay to  reserve our spots and this event will fill up.

 

If you are interested in attending or have any  questions, please contact Joy quickly.

 

FYI... more will be arriving soon about other troop  activities.

 

Troop #12478 Leaders - Claire, Sheryl, Barbara and  Joy

 HI Pamela

Sorry for the delay in responding (my external calls are not working) but it turns out that I have a scheduling conflict that will prevent me from speaking on Oct 11th/12th.   Thanks again for the invitation to speak - hopefully we will be able to speak again in the future.

Hi Andy

 I would not be able to make the meetings during the week of July 23rd but Carol could on the collateral annex. The WSPP is holding its meeting on August 10th so that also may not be the best time for people, but again Carol could likely attend the collateral annex meeting.  Hope all is well. And as always thanks for your help."

Look at California's spin on contract provisions preventing California from seeking FERC review of contract prices.  California officials now argue that such provisions indicate that suppliers had undue bargaining power.  Rather than protecting suppliers, these provisions are having the opposite effect of drawing political and legal scrutiny.---sch


THE STATE
Energy Pacts Bar State From Seeking U.S. Review of Prices
Crisis: The provisions suggest the amount of clout generators had during negotiations. Consumer advocates want the agreements redone.
By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGEL
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

October 15 2001

SACRAMENTO -- Buried in the fine print of the long-term contracts California officials signed to buy billions of dollars in electricity are provisions giving up the state's right to seek a federal examination of whether the contract prices are unreasonably high.

Critics of the contracts call those clauses the clearest evidence yet that many of the agreements need to be renegotiated.

""You would never find a provision like that in a contract that was negotiated under normal circumstances, because it's patently ridiculous,"" said Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey). ""It demonstrates how much clout the generators had in negotiating these contracts."" The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is obligated to ensure that wholesale power prices are ""just and reasonable."" If the FERC finds otherwise, it has the authority to order power sellers to refund profits.

In recent weeks, Loretta Lynch, president of the state Public Utilities Commission, has asked the FERC to review two of the state's long-term power contracts. The prices and terms of those contracts may be ""unjust and unreasonable,"" Lynch said. Neither contract had the no-challenge clause.

But when asked about contracts that include the prohibition, Lynch expressed outrage.

""They didn't want anybody looking over their shoulder,"" she said. ""From my perspective, that contractual provision is great evidence that the generators knew they were sticking up the state. . . . If they thought this was a reasonable contract, why wouldn't they want FERC to uphold their deal?""

State's Bargaining Position Was Weak

The companies with no-challenge clauses in their contracts included Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, Dynegy Power Marketing, Sempra Energy Resources, Allegheny Energy Supply Co., Coral Power and Williams Energy Marketing & Trading.

S. David Freeman, the state's chief negotiator on long-term power contracts who was recently named head of the Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority, said the clause needed to be understood in the context of the energy crisis.

At the time the contracts were negotiated, the state's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, had already failed to pay energy companies hundreds of millions of dollars for power purchases.

""Our reputation as a state for sticking by what we said and having credit was not all that great in January,"" he said. ""They were asking, 'Is this a serious deal? Is the state of California committed to it?' What are you going to say--no? [Then] you're not going to get a deal.""

The state began a hurried effort to negotiate long-term contracts in January after energy prices on the spot market spiraled to unprecedented heights. The costs threatened to bankrupt the state's utilities, which were unable to buy power on their own for their customers.

State officials negotiated dozens of contracts, some lasting as long as 10 years, which offered prices ranging from $58 to $249 per megawatt-hour--a far cry from the $500 per megawatt-hour the state was frequently paying on the spot market at the time.

But by summer, the wild energy market stabilized and prices dropped. California suddenly found itself paying more under the long-term contracts than the $15-to-$30 per megawatt-hour offered on the spot market.

""Look at the context in which the state was entering into these contracts. They were pretty much desperate,"" said Mike Florio, senior attorney for the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco.

""We were talking about windfall profits, taxes and seizing power plants, and I think the generators started putting in their contracts anything they could think of to keep the state from undoing the deal once things calmed down, which they have.""

Michael J. Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said the clauses provided ""the kind of reassurance that allows the financial community to say we're willing to invest in California.""

""It's not that we're superseding anything, frankly, it's that we've said we don't want the party we've done the transaction with to try to derail it,"" Niggli said.

He acknowledged that the contract clause cannot prevent the state from asking for federal review.

""The question becomes, 'Will FERC accept that or consider that?' "" he said. ""And then, 'Do we consider that a breach of the contract in any way shape or form?' ""

Bowen and Freeman predicted that the clauses would not stand up to court scrutiny. ""Frankly, I wasn't too concerned about the clause,"" Freeman said. ""I don't think it's enforceable.""

Enforceable or not, Bowen said, the clauses would complicate any state efforts to seek FERC review.

""The very fact that they were able to get that kind of language in the contracts tells you it wasn't an evenhanded situation,"" she said. ""I believe the state in negotiating the contracts did the best possible job it could under the circumstances, but that doesn't excuse [officials] from the responsibility of trying to improve the situation now.""

Hi Kathy

Thanks for the message - it was great to see you yesterday.  Sam is fine - the doctor thinks some steroids would help.  Yuk.  Did you like Dr. Injac?  My kids love him.  I'm leaving in about an hour and will not be back until the middle of next week but will write then and we can set up a time for lunch.  Talk to you soon.

Hi Liz,
 
It was fun catching up with you at  Dr.Injak's.  Like you, I married a geologist (my dad and brother-in-law are  also geologists).  It's a nice change from lawyers.  
I hope Sam is doing OK.  What did the doctor  say to do for him?
Let me know what your schedule is like and we can  meet some time.  I'm fairly flexible, but have a nanny only 2 days per  week, so the rest of the time Connor is with me.  My little  shadow.
 
Ciao,
Kathy Ellis Cook"

Elizabeth,
Below is the one comment from Pacificorp on the CA that I had marked up.  I am attaching the markup I had sent to Pacificorp.  Prior to sending execution copies I thought you might want to look at it in light of the fact that the contingent call option portion of the proposed transactions would likely be a physical deal with EPMI.  I am taking the next two days off but will be back on Monday.

Glad to help.
Only need one change; I don't have Brent's e-mail address, but  I'll trust Sanjeev to forward this:
 
In Section 2, where it says:
""at the time of disclosure or is thereafter  acquired from a source other than the Disclosing Party that was not known  to""
add a comma between ""acquired"" and  ""from"".

market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion
List:


COLLATERAL CALCULATION FOR APPLICANTS FOR THE VIRTUAL TRANSACTIONS MARKET:

The largest price delta observed at the 97th percentile level during June,
July, and August, 2001, was $159.33. This
amount  should be rounded to the nearest dollar amount ($159.00) when used
in the collateral calculation process..

The collateral formula is as follow:

The price delta of $159.00 is multiplied by the exposure calculation factor
of 14 ($159.00 x 14 = $2,226.00).  This equals the dollar amount of
collateral required per mega watt hour (MWH).  The $2,226.00 is then
multiplied by the maximum number of MWH's the Market Participant may wish
to bid on a daily basis.  The Market Participant notifies the NYISO of the
maximum number of MWH's they  may wish to bid  per day by completing,
executing and returning the  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CERTIFICATION OF
UNDERSTANDING OF NYISO FINANCIAL ASSURANCE POLICY AND PROCEDURES FOR
VIRTUAL TRANSACTIONS.  This document is attached to Addendum A of the NYISO
Registration Packet dated August 28, 2001.(refer to Page A6 of the Addendum
A).  The NYISO Registration Packet is located on the NYISO web site at:

http://www.nyiso.com/services/relations/cregistration/pdf/nyiso_reg.pdf

The example used in Addendum A stated the Market Participant wished to bid
up to a maximum of 1600 MWH's per day.

In this example, the collateral required would be $2,226.00 x 1600.
Consequently, the collateral requirement to bid up to a maximum of 1600
MWH's per day in the Virtual Transactions Market would be $3,561,600.

Please contact NYISO Customer Relations if you have any questions.

Regards,
NYISO Customer Relations

Greg and Peter

Pamela Hickerson called and wanted to know if I would be interested in speaking in Calgary in Oct. at seminar her organization is hosting. Greg I think you may already be speaking. Is that right?  Would this be a good opportunity?  She wants me to speak about US power trading contracts and on-line trading.   Any thoughts if this is worthwhile?  Thanks for you input."

Willy and I were thinking we would get a sitter from 5pm-11pm on Saturday
night for Sam , Ella and Lucy. What do you think?? The agency charges a
$ 30.00 flat fee and then anywhere from $10- $15 an hour after that.

POWER SALES AND TOLLING ARRANGEMENTS
IN TODAY'S MARKET

On Tuesday, June 5, 2001, Baker Botts will be presenting an internal legal
training seminar entitled ""Power Sales and Tolling Arrangements in Today's
Market"" in the main conference room on the 13th floor of our Washington
office, 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue (The Warner).  Bob Bohme, of our Washington
office, will be the speaker for the program.  He will address a number of
drafting and negotiation problems commonly encountered in power sales and
tolling agreements.  Although the program is geared toward lawyers, it may
also be of interest to non-lawyers involved in these negotiations.

Subject: Power/gas trading structure


We are re-evaluating the EBS trading structure.  Currently, EBS uses a series of LLP's to minimize/avoid Texas franchise tax.  I detest LLP structures, as they can be hard to maintain; Lisa feels the same. Our EBS tax contact (Wayne Gardner) advises us that ENA/EPMI handle the franchise tax issue with some form of out-of-state swap, or something along that line.  I'm looking for a contact person who might know something about it.  I'm guessing Stephen Douglas is a good prospect, although I understand he is out.  Any thoughts/suggestions/cautions?
 
Thanks,
 
Kay

Can you met with Ella's school sometime mid morning on either Wed or Thurs next week.

On Colorado, we currently are scheduled to return on Wed the 22nd.  On this schedule we would miss parent orientation (Tues) and the kids would miss the first day of school which is a half day (Wed). Reschedule?"

Thanks for the note - I had alot of fun on Sat. too.  I'll call you later to talk about camps - I was kind of thinking of doing a 1/2 day camp at the MET but...  The teachers name for swimming at the H is Lauren ... just call the regular number and ask for swimming and then leave message for her. She will call you back."

I think this message was sent in response to the message you tried to send from my computer ( not the old message) ... so I don't think the IT people got the message that you tried to send today.

Thanks.  Hopefully the request I sent in from your computer will work.  I'll give them a call to let them know that you tried to send in your approval and the address was correct on the e-mail but you had the delivery failure.

Alas, no agreement to execute at this point.  We have come a long way, howe=
ver, and only 2 serious issues remain open.  (All the others are at least m=
ostly resolved -- see my 5/1/01 revision w/ marginal notes made during my 5=
/2/01 meeting w/ them.)  This file is in my office with all the others.

XOM requires that all of its contracts contain 2 provisions, both of which =
are problematic for Enron.

(1)  The Federal Contractor Supplement -- exhibit F to the EEI Master -- is=
 designed to assure XOM's compliance w/ the U.S. federal government's requi=
rements imposed on all government contractors.  There are 2 categories of r=
equirements:  environmental laws compliance and small business participatio=
n in federal govt purchases of goods and services.  Since XOM has adoped a =
""General Commercial Plan"" to comply with such requirements, XOM has promise=
d the U.S. govt that ALL its contracts will contain these provisions.  And =
that's what the auditors from the U.S. government would be looking to ascer=
tain in a review of XOM's compliance.  As for Enron, we do engage in busine=
ss w/ the U.S. govt, but we have not adopted a ""General Commercial Plan,"" s=
o we have to address these issues on an ad hoc basis.  Taking the last para=
graph of this Supplement as an example (addressing the use of women and min=
ority owned businesses by Enron in supplying services to XOM under this con=
tract), at this point, Enron isn't really prepared to undertake such things=
 and all those I dealt with on this seem a bit nervous about Enron's abilit=
y to comply.  I've communicated w/ Michelle Cash, George Wasaff, and Cathy =
Riley (at Calvin Eakins direction) on this topic, and I asked Cathy Riley t=
o have her director, Calvin Eakins, phone me to discuss this further, but h=
e did not call.  And there does not seem to be a very good solution to this=
.  XOM has suggested revising the language in Sec. 10.13 (based on my 5/1/0=
1 draft) to add a final sentence ""The Federal Contract Supplement is attach=
ed as Exhibit F and each Party shall comply with such requirements to the e=
xtent appplicable.""  This certainly takes care of all of XOM's concerns, bu=
t I'm not sure this gets Enron all the way where we need to be.  See, for e=
xample, Dave Nutt's markup of the environmental provisions (in the file), a=
nd Cathy Riley says there are no exceptions or exemptions to the small busi=
ness requirements.  We might be able to get some outside expertise on this =
or get Sharon Butcher to help resolve it.

(2)  Limitation of Damages -- Article 7 waives consequentials, etc. for bot=
h parties.  XOM insists that this provision must carve out damages resultin=
g from the ""gross negligence and/or willful misconduct attributable to its =
managerial and senior supervisory personnel"".  You can see the full details=
 of the provisions they're looking for in the XOM language in sec 10.4 (sam=
e draft), the extensive indemnity language which they added in the last rou=
nd and which we generally don't mind giving them.  But this impacts Article=
 7 because the Enron version of the waiver expressly states that the waiver=
 applies to indemnities, and, of course, XOM will not tolerate any exceptio=
ns to the liability of each party (yes, it's mutual) for the gross negligen=
ce of its managers, etc.  There's a true story behind all this that dates b=
ack to the EPA emissions requirements on Reformulated Gasoline (RFG).  Mobi=
l hired a lab to do the testing, the managers of the lab company encouraged=
 the testing staff to ""fudge"" the results, tons of RFG hit the market that =
was not in compliance, and a huge black mark on Mobil and zillions of dolla=
rs lost were the result.  And the contract provided that the lab's damages =
were limited to the testing fees, and apparently, that worked for the lab c=
ompany.  So, it's a deal breaker for XOM  b/c they say that if Enron's mana=
gers decide to turn off the lights at all the refineries for some specious =
reason, they need to have proper recourse against Enron.   I''ve argued wit=
h them about this, based on the nature of this contract, the power trading =
business, etc. but to no avail .....  It would seem that Enron's language i=
n Art. 7, w/ the following rather narrow change, might work for both partie=
s, but it's up to you, now.
=09UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR CONS=
EQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST PROFIT=
S OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR CONTRACT, =
UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE provided, however, that nothing =
in this Article 7 shall be interpreted to limit either Party's liability un=
der Article 10.4(b). =20

Let me know if you have any questions about this. =20

Elizabeth,

EESI would like to add the following to your revised Confirmation Agreement (red text only):

Special Conditions, paragraph (2) subparagraph (iii) shall be modified as follows:

""(iii) that any remedy that EESI may have against EPMI under this Transaction is limited by the remedy actually obtained by EPMI under the NYSEG Transaction (unless EPMI shall have failed to pay any uncontested amounts due and owing from EPMI to NYSEG under the NYSEG Transaction or EPMI shall have failed to deliver the Attributes received from NYSEG to EESI, in which case EESI shall have a claim against EPMI for the replacement value of the Attributes not delivered to EESI)""

If the above referenced change is acceptable please forward to me a revised Confirmation Agreement.

Regards,

Richard

I have reviewed Chris' version of the Confirmation below.  I have made a
few changes to it now that there is only one Delivery Period.  The attached

As far as I am concerned, it is ready to go. Let's see if Elizabeth

I agree that Netco will also need to use WSPP and we should anticipate responding accordingly.  For general conversation, though I still think we should recommend EEI.  As we open up for contracting, I think Christian, Steve and I will be able to quickly identify those Caps who will only use WASP.

The dealers and some of the customers are ok with an EEI but some important counterparties are anti-EEI.  BPA comes to mind.  Digging in our heels on an EEI-only position might make it difficult to get up and running.  Do you have a view of this?

intercompany trades do not necessarily terminate upon bankruptcy - the parties don't have to perform but for valuation purposes the market positions are not terminated until notice is sent.  I've been talking to Jim and others to help determine when we should get the trades officially terminated.  This issue needs to be addressed soon.

Here is the draft.  To the extent that it is helpful, EPMI is where PGET was in the last deal; Party A is where EPMI was last time; and Party B is Avista.  It's late, and the document is getting confusing, so I'm sending it to you now without proofing it.  I'm taking it home with me and will read it again tonight.  Have an 8:00 conference call in Mary Cook's office or in the office that I am sitting in right now (Harry Collins' old office).
 
Take care.

Hi Liz: 
These are the directions to Mike Larkin's house in Centerville where you will pick up the keys.  You will need to give him two checks..one for $500.00 and a deposit of $150.00. I will reimburse you the $500.00 and will get the deposit check back when I pick up the keys.   
A separate e-mail will follow wirh directions to the house.  I am asking Mike for a number to the house.  Call me when you get there and leave a number.  I'm not sure when I will head out of town tomorrow, but it will be by 2:30pm to avoid traffic.  Also send me you cell phone number.  My cell phone which I will keep on on my trip down is (202) 260-6132.  Also give me a call when you get into Dullus.  If you guys want to sleep here we can have a slumber party.  I have new sleeper couch and the kids could sleep on the floor.

Subject: Application Dear Mike: 
Attached is the rental application. Our plans are taking shape for the trip to Wintergreen.  My sister will be flying into Dullus Thursday night and will head for Charlottesville.  Could she pick the keys up Thursday evening around 8:30 or 9pm and drop off a check at that time? She plans to stay in a hotel Thursday night, but will be the first to arrive at the house on Friday. 
Several questions -   Could you e-mail me directions to your house and to the house in Wintergreen?  I am planning on giving you two checks-  one for $500. for the three nights and one for $150.00 for the deposit. Is that correct? Does Wintergreen have a pool and or a clubhouse of any sort that serves lunch or dinner?  Is there a grill at the house. 
I look forward to hearing from you.

Just to confirm

	Payment through Wed - 11/14 (with interest) = $14,153,688.78
	Payment through Thur - 11/15 (with interest) = $14,155,586.71

The Settlement Agreement is written based on a Wed payment - if they want to argue for another $1,100 in interest, then we can send it to them in pennies.

Bill,

As mentioned during our conference call this morning, we have significant
Lend and Park activity with ENA (and some activity with Enron Energy
Services).  Potential stressed net exposure peaks at $ 12.4 million in April
' 02.

Due to the recent downgrades of Enron Corp.'s (Guarantor of ENA's
obligations to PG&E) senior unsecured debt rating to BBB- by S&P and other
rating agencies, we respectfully request that Enron North America provide
PG&E with a Standby Irrevocable Letter of Credit in the amount of $ 6.5
million expiring no earlier than October 30, 2002.  This request is made
under the provisions of PG&E's Gas Rule 25 (Gas Services-Customer
Creditworthiness and Payment Terms).

I would appreciate your letting me know when the L/C will be issued.  Thanks

The hourly index is a must for me (the day-ahead index is unhedgable for us and we would give them free money for the next 10 years).   It is important to understand that under the new proposed structure, VEPCO will call on this energy many more days than they do now and it is very important that we create an index that we can hedge.  
I will not due this deal based on a day-ahead index - it must be hourly at the interface we defined.

Please clarify your call option vs. firm delivery comment.

Kevin and Elizabeth,

Attached is a proposal summarizing our restructuring talks with VEPCO last week.  We had proposed to them what Kevin had suggested, and they said their view on pricing in Virginia is slightly different (at a discount to PJM/VAP as against a premium suggested by us).  They'd requested we send them some discussion points from our meeting today, so we can continue our discussions on an ongoing basis. Please review the bullet-point summary of our discussions last week, and the draft proposal.  We would appreciate your quick comments - but keep in mind, this is just to stimulate further discussions with them. Our overall objective is to migrate them to a new contract and away from their rights to audit the last few years.

Discussion summary:
Both parties agree that the contract needs to be revised to reflect current market conditions (pricing, liquidated damages, etc.).
Enron would retain flexibility around the physical delivery points.
VEPCO would like to continue treating this as a call option (versus a firm delivery).
Settlement:  Would prefer the Day-Ahead index versus the hourly index
Could also look at another PJM West index - VAP/Alleghany
Will look at alternate times for calling on power, if necessary
Would like to renegotiate by 12/01/01

Agreed that all parties would review the proposed framework with traders to try to ""fill in the boxes"". It was however recognised that there were difficulties in interpreting what was intended by the proposed RTO's and the relationship with the current Into Cinergy market.
	
AEP viewed that purchase of transmission was the critical area, who had to purchase what and several scenarios to work through. Whether Seller buys a wheel, whether buyer buys a wheel, or under MISO both parties buy a  wheel. This clearly has knock on effect for obligations in respect of firm and non-firm transmission and curtailment. In particular, what if non-firm is elected and how this flows through into obligations of the parties to a transaction.
	
Perception that the framework prepared by AEP will start all interested parties in the same place to talk about the issues. 
	
It was agreed to try to get a representative from Duke to join the next call as they were an Into Cinergy product trader as well.
	
The next call was scheduled for November 29th at 10 o clock Eastern time. It was suggested that everyone at least take first page of Mitch's schedule and talk to the traders, since this would probably the best starting point, Mitch encouraged any comments to be shared earlier if possible.
	
Signed you up for this call in your absence.
	
Marcus

Susan,
  
  Thank you for all of the documents.  I am expecting that we will be able to turn another draft out tomorrow (Tuesday) but I do want Sam to see it before it goes out and I have not made contact with him today (Monday).  I will touch base with you again tomorrow on timing.  I am using very little of the original draft and instead, am using almost everything that you sent to us.

  The outline of notes from Alan and Mike that you sent to me seemed to reference Mike Roan's comments.  I have the ouline with Alan's comments and their joint outline but I do not have a stand alone document for Mike Roan. 
I
  will work with what I have but if you do have a separate document from Mike and want me to use it, could you please send it to me if you  have a free minute?  The other material from Alan and Mike seems helpful.  

Thanks very much,

Cathy

Attached are:

1.  The outline I e-mailed you previously, with Alan Comnes' comments.
Basically Alan has added a Section II, which arguably could be
incorporated into Section IV of the previous outline.  

2.  An outline of some notes from Alan Comnes and Mike Roan (both
economists).  Some of these points may be useful to add; please do so at
your discretion.

3.  EPSA's draft comments for your information (could not remember
whether I had forwarded them to you).

    Hello! Sorry I couldn't get back with you last night. I was at a dinner and got home a little too late to call.
    As it turns out, I will be helping with Brownies today also so I'll pick up Anna at car pool. If you'd like me to pick up Ella, just let me know at work before ~2:30 (713 745-0678 or vhuff@mdacc.tmc.edu --  but not this home email address). The carpool number is 349.
    See you at the sit-upon workshop!

Hi Moms,
If you have some time on Tuesday afternoon, we  could use some additional hands at the Brownie meeting.  One of our  projects will be to make a ""sit-upon"".  The girls will be lacing and  beading and we think some extra hands to help will be necessary.   Please reply if you can make it.  We probably will be  starting the project around 3:50 or 4pm.  
Sorry for the late notice and thanks in  advance,
Joy Lee"

You are playing Line 3 at 8:15.  The park (Oaks of Woodlake) is on the corner
of Ella Lee and Tanglewilde.   Ella Lee is one block north of Westheimer
(Between Briar Forest and Westheimer).  And Tanglewilde is one block east of
Gessner.  Park on the Tanglewilde side (there is a small parking lot or you
can park on the street).  Please bring water.  They have a water fountain,
but no ice.   I'm sorry you have to keep playing the late match, but that's
the way the lines keep working out.  I won't be playing, so would it be
possible for you to keep the scoresheet?  You can sign as captain, and I'll
just get the scoresheet from you when I see you.  Maureen Garrett will be
playing Line 4 at 7:00pm, and she can show you how the scoresheet works if
you have any questions.  Thanks a lot!

Looks like there is alot of work needed on Cathy's draft. I'm working this weekend and hopefully we all can meet on Monday.  Meanwhile can you get from John anything in writing that we used in connection with opposing the Bingham bill.  Those arguments would be very helpful to maybe repeat in the FERC response

Subject: RE: draft of comments on Reporting Requirements NOPR




Answering Susan's question, the EPMI's draft comments on the reporting requirement NOPR are in fact consistent with our position on the Bingaman bill.  As initially drafted, that bill would essentially require FERC to do what it proposes in this NOPR to under its existing discretionary authority.  We have used many of the arguments in the draft comments in our discussions against this aspect of the Bingaman draft.

Attached is a draft of EPMI's comments on the Reporting Requirements NOPR.

John, I assume this is consistent with our position on the Bingaman bill but let us know if anything needs to be changed.  

EPMI's comments are due next Friday, October 5.

Hi Scott

Enron was heavily involved in the EEI.

Anything and everything in the EEI can be changed.  I attach a sample of some our standard changes for your information.  We also add others from time to time.  Our position on issues depends upon the counterparty involved.  Feel free to amend choice of law, confirming party (which by the way sometimes EPMI also changes) and whatever else you want assuming you think appropriate for your dealings.  On typos, we know they exist but question whether there is anything misleading.  (We were under tremendous pressure to ""release"" the document - after release we do not want to ""re-release"" unless something is misleading.)  If you want to fix, feel free to do so in the cover page. 

   This is a sample of EPMI's older cover page amendments

Subject:	Edison Electric Institute/Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement

Elizabeth:

I am one of the contract attorneys from Bracewell & Patterson  assisting EES on various projects.  One of the matters which has been delegated to me is the review of a Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement between EES and A'lones.  I met with Richard Ring yesterday, and he indicated that you might be able to answer a few questions.  

First, Richard has informed me that ENA was heavily involved in the development of this document, and, as a result, the form is used ""as is"" and without amendment, save for information to be provided in the Cover Sheet.  One of my ""marching orders"" is that choice of law provisions in EES paper should require Texas law.  The Edison form opts for New York.  Is this something that can be changed? 

Second, what about more substantive matters, such as who takes the lead in sending transaction confirmations?  In the A'lones transaction, it is contemplated that EES will be the Buyer.  The Edison form places primary confirmation obligations on the Seller.  I am informed that EES prefers to be the confirming party, regardless of whether it is the buyer or seller.  Is this something that can be changed?

Third, there are a variety of typographical and reference errors.  i.e. double commas (see paragraph 2.2), doubled phrases (paragraph 5.1(h)(i)), and possibly mistaken use of defined terms (see use of ""Product"" in second line of paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2).  What is the Company's position on correcting these types of items?

I apologize that this is being e-mailed, as it would probably be quicker by phone, but my connection to the phone system is lagging somewhat behind my connection to the computer network.  Thank you for your time and attention.

Elizabeth -

Here are the comments from me and Dede. I have given it to our Credit Dept.
and asked for comments but I doubt they will have much to add. Call me if
you have any questions with what we wrote.

With regard to the full-blown WSPP Collateral Annex, Dede and I think it
would be better to get the EEI one in a final form before converting it
over to fit into the WSPP. Otherwise, we could be revising the 2 documents
in parallel.

I am planning to get the short draft WSPP Collateral Annex over to you
today.

Thanks!

Shari

Now that our pan-commodity services agreement is back in play, I need to follow up on either a master netting agreement, or state-of-the-art netting language.  I can't recall who has ownership of these, so I thought I would start with you two.  Where should I look?

To All:
 
Please let me know your availability for a conference call  next week on 10/1-10/3 or 10/5 at 2pm Eastern TIme to discuss the  following:
 
1) Getting a EEI Contract Working Group organizational plan in  place asap.  The best antidote for preventing an Energy Industry Standards  Board from taking over the EEI Contract management is to have a separate,  well-defined and broadly-supported group in place.
 
3) Agenda and schedule for the next meeting of the Working  Group.
 
3) Adding new members to the drafting committe.  In  particular, Noel Trask of the Excelon Power Team has asked to join.
 
ASAP, I would like to get the optional provisions  circulated earlier this week up on the website and through the listserver   along w/ the announcement of our organizational proposal and future working  group meetings.
 
Thanks.

Hi Chris

Hope all is well with you, Tracy and the kids.  How is Addy (opps, spelling is bound to be wrong)?  Are you coming to the legal conference?  And now for the real reason of my email - Can you send me Tracy's telephone number.  I've been wanting to call her for months and say hi but the stupor got in my mind and I couldn't shake it free. Its a beautiful day here today - the first for months and I'm committing to a new .... well, at least a call to Tracy.  Hope to see you at the legal conference.  Did you hear I have to speak?  At least it is with Klauberg.

FERC Judge Rejects Claims For Elec Refunds In Pacific NW
  
09/24/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shouldn't order refunds for power sales in the Pacific Northwest, a FERC administrative law judge told the commission Monday. 
""I recommend that the commission not order refunds in this case because the prices weren't unreasonable and, unlike (California), the market is a competitive market,"" concluded Carmen Cintron, the FERC judge presiding over the case. 
The spiraling prices in California's dysfunctional power market were only one of many factors contributing to the region's high electricity prices, which were primarily the result of a supply shortage as the hydropower-dependent region experienced a drought, the judge said. 
""Spot market bilateral sales constituted only a small percentage of the total volume of transactions in the region because forward contracts are heavily relied on,"" Cintron said. 
Overruling the finding of FERC trial staff, Cintron found there was no evidence that sellers exercised market power in the region. 
""The prices were agreed to by willing buyers and sellers,"" the judge said. 
The judge urged FERC to grant a motion by Puget Energy Inc. (PSD) and dismiss the case. 
     
At issue were refund claims totaling more than $1.9 billion, with three-quarters of that amount claimed by California on behalf of the state's Department of Water Resources for purchases in the refund period of Dec. 25, 2000, to June 20, 2001. 
In July, FERC set the case for an expedited hearing before Cintron after separating the Pacific Northwest claims from a larger refund proceeding involving power sales in California from Oct. 2, 2000, through June 20, 2001. 
The administrative law judge is scheduled to forward an initial decision to the commission in the California refund case in December. 
Unlike California, the Northwest had a vibrant and functional competitive market, and ordering refunds for the minority of those in the proceeding making claims would have detrimental effects on the market, Cintron told the commission. 
""Evidence of record indicates that refunds would have a negative impact to the Pacific Northwest market,"" Cintron concluded. ""This business relies on finality of deals and reliance on your trading partner."" 
""Balancing the short-term benefit of refunds to a few market participants against the immediate and long-term damage to the market and to future investment decisions, it is impossible to reconcile refunds with the overall public-interest standard,"" Cintron said. 
California sought $1.466 billion of the nearly $2 billion in total claims. The remainder was claimed by municipally owned utilities in Seattle ($278 million); Tacoma, Wash. ($65.4 million); Clark, Wash. ($64 million); Eugene, Ore. ($39.7 million); Sacramento, Calif. ($4.6 million); and Northern Wasco County, Ore. ($4 million). 
Also, the Port of Seattle sought $9.4 million in refunds. 
Cintron was persuaded by the ""ripple"" claims arguments of the majority opposing refunds. They argued that awarding the claims of the few seeking refunds would destabilize the overall market, since most sellers themselves would then stake claims for refunds. 
""Unraveling these transactions is, to be mildly stated, a complex task,"" Cintron said. 
""The immense number of potential ripple claims is directly related to the highly active nature of the (Pacific Northwest) wholesale electricity market,"" the judge said. 
""Given the sheer magnitude of contracts that would have to be rewritten as a result of ordering refunds, it would be impossible to unwind the chain of transactions that resulted in a single bilateral sale,"" she said. 
The commission may either accept or reject Cintron's recommendations, which were intended to form the basis for whether FERC should order a more expansive hearing to determine refund amounts owed. 
In the event FERC does move to order refunds, Cintron offered her conclusions on what constitutes a spot-market sale in the region's bilateral contracts market. 
While power marketers had argued for a strict definition - sales of no more than 24 hours duration - those seeking refunds had argued that refunds should apply to sales for periods of up to a year or longer, particularly if they were indexed to spot-market prices. 
Cintron accepted the middle-of-the road recommendation of the Bonneville Power Administration to conclude that spot-market sales should include transactions of up to one-month duration.

To ensure that you are not embarrassed or surprised by anyone, this is where we are with Consumers.

A quick update on where we are:

We have asked for documents from Consumers and should be getting those in the next week or so.  We have also asked to take the depositions of the two Consumers' bookkeepers who allegedly made the ""payment mistake.""  Those should take place in the next three to four weeks.  To date, Consumers has not indicated a desire to conduct any discovery whatsoever.  Unbelievable.  Our counsel believes that Consumers doesn't really think this case will be arbitrated; but rather is hoping that as we approach an arbitration date, we will become much more willing to compromise.  As far as an arbitration date is concerned, nothing is set yet. We have agreed to approach the arbitrator (Professor White) after the depositions and check his calendar for available dates. I do think that, given Consumers cash-poor situation, they will attempt to get this matter resolved by year-end.  

Call me with questions.  Otherwise, I will keep you updated.

As most of you know Genia will be out of the office for a period of approximately 4 weeks from the 4th October. 

During this period Alice Wright will, in addition to her other responsibilities, be available to assist in the preparation of cover sheets and other aspects of work normally performed by Genia. However, while Alice has spent some time with Genia over the past few weeks gaining an understanding of the preparation of EEI Cover Sheets, this is a new area for her and she will require both our assistance and patience.

During this period, for example, it is likely that the attorneys will, from time to time, need to complete cover sheets using the credit work sheet and I would encourage all of you to spend some time with Genia to make sure that, if required, you will be able to perform this task. There are clearly other agreements which we all ask Genia to prepare and  any such agreements should be prepared by the attorneys until Genia's return.

Subject: Brownies! - Scouting for Food




Hello Brownie Families,

 

Our 1st grade Brownie troop is starting up!   During our first meeting, the girls learned a bit of GS history, said the Girl  Scout Promise and Law, sang two new GS songs and talked about the many  activities that they might participate in as a Girl Scout.  We also made 55  greeting cards for a Council sponsored service project where cards will be  sent to residents of nursing homes in Texas.  It was a great  meeting!

 

A few days after our troop meeting, we learned  of an interesting service opportunity.  

Scouting for Food is a special day, October 20th,  for Girl Scouts to help feed the hungry.  Girls ages 6-11years old will  tour the Houston Food Bank, participate in a service project, have a snack and  receive a ""Scouting for Food"" patch.

 

The specifics are:

Saturday, October 20th, 9:00 a.m. - 11:15  a.m.

Houston Food Bank, 3811 Eastex Freeway, Houston, TX  77026

A parent needs to accompany each  child.

Response deadline:  Wednesday, September 25, email Joy  Lee jeffjoylee@earthlink.net <<mailto:jeffjoylee@earthlink.net>> , or  713-660-8764

 

There is a fee of $3 per girl for this event.   The troop will be paying for the girls, therefore it is VERY IMPORTANT that we  have an accurate count.  There is no fee for the parents.

 

Sorry for the short deadline, but we have to pay to  reserve our spots and this event will fill up.

 

If you are interested in attending or have any  questions, please contact Joy quickly.

 

FYI... more will be arriving soon about other troop  activities.

 

Troop #12478 Leaders - Claire, Sheryl, Barbara and  Joy

I am overloaded on end of quarter deals and market disruption etc.  I suggest just sending out the current status of the form to begin negotiations, with the suggestion by comment that the parties may wish to develop a CSA type of attachment.

Subject: Mandatory Set-Off Language



Elizabeth, please call me to let me know how you want to proceed on this. 

I reviewed with Mary last week the set-of language for the trading forms in light of Robert Anderson's review and suggested revisions.  Mary had reviewed the language with your outside counsel and for reasons, most of which I did not necessarily follow to be honest, they were not agreeable to Robert's suggested revisions (other than the ""without limitation"" language (which I note has now been inserted only in part, and therefore may still problematic, in that it refers to being without limitation to either party's rights, which would include the defaulting party's right to object to the enforceability of the entire set-off provision or to assert some alternate form of set-off arrangement)).  I agreed with Mary that I would again review that matter with Robert.

I have again reviewed the matter with Robert, and he remains concerned with the language as is, since the triangular set-off as proposed without also dealing with the issue of mutuality, which is fundamental to the concept of set-off, results in a contractual agreement (assuming that we get past the privity and consideration issues), to call something ""set-off"" that fundamentally is not set-off.  Robert's concern is that if the issue of mutuality is not addressed the current language could be viewed by a court not as set-off but as an assignment of a third obligation as security, that may be unenforceable for various reasons, including non-perfection.

Robert also makes the following points: 

1.  His suggested revisions already are a compromise from what he believes would be required in a more detailed provision addressing these complex issues;

2.  To the extent that we introduce triangular set-off that may not ultimately be enforceable, we are running the risk of the entire clause not be allowed by the courts, and therefore having no right to set-off;

3.  As drafting points, the ""without limitation"" language still provides the defaulting party with an argument to avoid the entire arrangement, and there is no specified date for the currency conversion;

4.  In terms of the issue of consideration, it is an issue of contract formation, which is fundamental to a contractual right of set-off;

5.  In terms of when the mutuality of the obligations arises, he is agrees that it would be best that it arise form inception, but he thought that would be difficult to sell commercially, and therefore setled on default but prior to elected termination.

In short, Robert's point is that even with his revisions he would have concerns, but without his revisions he has serious concerns around enforceability, and it is difficult for me to simply ignore his advice given both his reasoning and my experience with Robert's advice.

In terms of where to go, I think there are the following solutions: 

1.  We can see this as a Canadian issue, and therefore incorporate Robert's changes in the Canadian forms only - physical and financial;

2.  We can have Robert speak to your outside counsel and see if they can't come to some common ground on more universal language;

3.  We can leave the matter as is for all forms. 

(I am more comfortable with 1 than 3.) 

Why don't you give me a call.  I am sure we all want to move past this and, ackowledginging the risks, simply need to agree on a definitive approach.

Peter.

HI 

So much wasted time and energy and the well is running dry at the same time the animosity towards Enron and marketers seems only to be increasing. I like the proposal to merge the discussions but... You will recall at the WSPP meeting in Colorado I asked Mike Small if he wouldn't consider merging the discussions/ contracting groups.  After a long winded story about the personal pain he has and will continue to suffer (Shari's name came up a lot), he said he did not think it would ever work.  I'm all for trying to forge this single contract approach and I think EEI members, drafting committee and all, would relish it as well.  What do you think is the next best step?  

ps - the meeting in San Diego on the 1st is still unclear for Houston based Enron employees.  Terrorists Halloween scares have made everyone unlikely willing to fly.  We are trying to get Mike to allow a videoconference but so far no commitment that this is OK.  Lets talk about this also.

Hoping not to stay the course, again.  Talk to you soon.

I agree with Christian that we cannot win over the WSPP folks simply by telling them that their contract is not as good as ours.  Everytime I venture out to the larger NW community of IOUs, munis, and federal PMA's I realize that the WSPP is more than a contract, it's almost a religion.  One cannot convince a Muslim that the Bible is better written than the Koran.

Whether it's assimilation or merger, or the hint that the WSPP might be destined for a larger role in advocacy and education, we need to give Mike Small a face-saving way of relinquishing the WSPP contract.  Modifying the WSPP to look like the EEI only strengthens the resolve of WSPP-ers to stick with the original contract.---""Why should I change, the agreements are virtually identical?""

Elizabeth, 

I am going to divide my presentation into two parts.  One is going to be designed to give the marketers ""talking points""  and the other is going to be a technical thing where I show them some bad wording and tell a couple of scary war stories. 

I would like to get your take on the following kind of big picture Enron policy on WSPP approach. Unless you agree with and support this kind of ""How Enron views the WSPP"" policy, I shouldn't be advocating it at the meeting.   

Enron's view is that the days of comparing the WSPP Agreement to the EEI should be coming to an end.  It is time for a joint committee of WSPP and EEI experts to merge the agreements.  Everybody is wasting too much time comparing the two agreements and trying to say one is better than the other.  Every amendment that has been made in the past two years brings the agreements closer and closer into alignment and it is preposterous for any serious lawyer to argue that we are better off with two agreements, one that is almost like the other one.  Valuable resource time is being wasted.  Enron believes that a joint committee should accelerate the merger of the agreements. 

 This will free up the WSPP organization to do what it does best:  provide an extremely useful industry formum kind of function.  The WSPP should be focusing on more boondoggles and more future looking work like getting ready for RTO West, dealing with the emerging California changes, and open access in Oregon and Nevada.   Right now, the highly talented regional organization is spending an unfortunate amount of time trying to distinguish its contract from the EEI when both are converging toward the same center.  This unfortunate distraction is keeping the WSPP from adding the tremendous value it does add through its boondoggles and industry issue discussions. The WSPP organization is needed for bigger and better things than dragging us through an ever narrowing labyrinth of legal distinctions. 

We need this kind of glazed over positive spin on the WSPP process because our marketers do not like to be isolated from the cozy herd at these boondoggles.  Sales people do not want to feel alone and different.  They are all about the slimy intimacy of sales.  It is hard for Stewart Rosman to go to Cour d'Lane and have Greg Wolf and Shari Stack confront him with difficult questions about why Enron is voting so and so on such and such.  He wants to feel loved.  Therefore,  this policy would let our marketers praise the WSPP for being a great organization,  but at the same time, advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to more important projects.  Rosman should say:  Enron loves the WSPP,  it has done a great job with the contract reformation,  that task is done,  we now should move on to bigger and better tasks.  Let's get the contract stuff wrapped up with a joint committee and get more important matters on the agenda.   

Something like this is what we need to do with this ongoing mess.  Otherwise, we pit Enron's clearmindedness  against a stubborn mass of  inert resistance and much toxic upheaval is the only result. 
The world, including our little western power world, is not made up of people sitting around trying to be rational.  It is full of all of the conflicts of history, ambitious tirades, irrational idiocyncracies and strong personalities.  The WSPP institution is like one of the warring tribes of Lebanon.  They are not going to go away.  Enron needs to be more subtle in its regional diplomacy.  Praise them as we bury them on the contract front.  As our headquarters commander, I beg you to  let Steve and me, as field operatives,   pursue this diplomatic initiative over the next months. We can wind these guys up to talk this kind of talk next Wednesday.   One consequence of the policy is that you would have to urge the EEI bureacracy to embrace a joint committee approach.   ----cgy

As you requested  attached is language EPMI/ENA currently uses for index based power deals at various delivery points.  This language forms the basis for what is inserted into physical and financial confirmations for power index-based deals.  The underlying confirmations may also contain conforming language depending upon the delivery point and the counterparty.  This language is updated/revised periodically as indexes change, new information becomes available and/or to fit the agreed upon transaction.  If you have any questions, please call me at 713 853 6349.

Elizabeth,

I have attached the index language we are currently using in confirmation letters.

 << File: Index Language Power.doc >> 

The Megawatt Daily Index language in the above attachment is used for Cinergy and Comed (the delivery points are not listed in the example).

Let me know if you need anything else.

Melissa,

On yesterday, Bob Caden and Dave Cena called and left messages about invoice #NTP010905.  They both said that this invoice is tied up with other invoices that are currently being discussed with Bill Bradford.  They both suggested that you give Bill Bradford a call.  Also, Dave Cena said that if you would like to speak to someone at PG&E, you can give him a call at (415) 973-4144.

Subject: EPMI selling power in Canada

Morris--Thanks for your previous information where you said, from a tax 
standpoint, that EPMI could buy and sell power in Canada as long as the 
trading was done in Houston (or Portland).  Can the EPMI traders physically 
meet in Canada with Canadian counterparties, as long as the agreement is 
executed by EPMI in the US?

Morris/Elizabeth/Jeff -- Tom May, our new NY trader, wants to wheel power 
to/from NEPOOL or NY through Hydro Quebec Power and New Brunswick Power.  
Rhonda and I will take care of the EPMI wheeling agreements on HQ and New 
Brunswick.  Who can make sure that EPMI has the necessary export permits to 
take power out of Canada (DOE or NEB)?  Thanks.

The latest version of the EEI-NEM Master Contract now can be downloaded from 
EEI's website at  http://www.eei.org/issues/contract/.  We only ask that a 
short registration form be filled out first so that we can better serve the 
community interested in using the contract.  We are making the contract 
freely available, multiple copies may be made, our only restriction is that 
the contract not be resold.  We also request that attribution to EEI and NEM 
be given in all copies of the contract.

Our intention is to use the EEI website and listserver as tools to help 
promote dissemination and use of the contract.  For instance, we could make a 
listing of companies using the contract on the website.  Also, we are 
considering posting on a periodic basis responses to requests for 
clarification or interpretation of the contract terms that would be of 
interest to the user community.  Please let me know if there are other 
enhancements that you would find helpful

All:

I received an RFP from Northeast Utilities for sale of peaking plant 
entitlements to which I would like to respond (respose due Fri 5/12).  A 
requirement for any transaction coming out of this process is that the 
winning buyer must be signed on to NU's Tariff 7 (mkt based rate tariff).  Do 
any of you know whether or not we are already signed on to this?  If not, 
would one of you be able to review this tariff (attached) to see if there are 
any problems with it?  Thanks.

John

Hi Brent 

Hope all is well.

I received your email.  In the US we do physical power puts and calls,  
usually on a daily, weekly or monthly basis (e.g several month deal that 
gives party right to receive/sell energy on a daily basis).  The confirmation 
for them is very simple, and generally assumes an underlying master that 
would govern the physical delivery if the option is exercised as well as all 
the other general terms and conditions.  
By copy of this email, I would ask Leslie Hansen to send you copies of a put 
and call confirmation which she can get from our documentation group.

Looking forward to seeing you soon back in Houston

(Thanks Leslie)

Michael

I received a call from your attorney a few days ago; she was  inquiring
about the status of the draft of the power sales agreement.  .  I misplaced
her number; therefore I did not get back to her.  Please apologize to her
for me.  We have not spent much time with your draft because we feel our
positions are so far apart that  NES's time was better spent working with
those suppliers that understood the program and were comfortable with the
program.  We have one contract signed and are negotiating with two other
suppliers.  Is there any point to sending ENRON a copy of the agreement NES
is will to sign or has ENRON decided it has very little interest in the
program as it is structured?

Friday morning would be great for the Gibbs & Brun lawyers to meet with 
Tabors.  They have been speaking to him about a meeting in DC next week but 
if we could do it here it would be fantastic.  Let me know if you can get 
Tabors to stay over.

I don't see anything glaringly wrong in these, but I am not a corporate 
lawyer.  It seems to have section balanced voting at the committee level 
(except that each member gets one vote at the ""parent"" level, section 6.5 -- 
how is balanced voting assurred there?)  Also, it takes one year to withdraw 
(section 5.7)  It seems like the timing should be shorter, perhaps, 6 
months.  ,I assume that MAPP and MAIN have hired corporate counsel to draft 
these, but JOE do we need to have one of the Enron corporate lawyers look at 
these?

		 Subject: TVA/Gleason - second transmission credits doc

Elizabeth, we discussed this matter intenally yesterday, witht he following 
conclusions:

We want to be able to apply Gleason Network credits to all transmission costs 
(from all  TVA-related control areas)
We want to be able to go negative on application of the credits - when 
network upgrade invoices to Gleason have not  yet caught up to transmission 
credit requests from all of the control areas.
We do not want to make a monthly declaration of transmission requirements.  
We need to agree with TVA on a process to keep track  of the credit usage and 
balance.

We would like to go over them with you in our 2:30 pm meeting today - at the 
controol room conference table.  

Larry.

Subject: Re: Ltr to Soderquist - Designate Recipients of Trans Credit  

Larry:

Please make sure folks are up to speed on this. In any current month, the 
amount of the transmission credit is equal to the then current amount of 
capital costs paid by Gleason to TVA for the Shleby upgrade, less any 
transmission credits previously used. I think the way to go is first to see 
if we can use the credits to offset transmission charges from our other TVA 
plants (on this point, TVA said no, but since Luke is out of the picture, we 
should make another run at this). If that does not fly, (that is, if the 
amount of credits we can use in any month is limited to the transmission 
charges otherwise due from Gleason on the power it generates), we obviously 
want to make sure we designate a credit amount equal to only as much as we 
actually need. 

Given that I believe we are the first IPP to be in this situation with TVA, 
and given that TVA is to repay us in 2009 for the actual cost of the Shelby 
upgrade less transmission credits actually used, we also need to make sure we 
are accurately tracking both upgrade costs and transmission credits used, and 
that TVA agrees with what we believe to be the correct balance. Jody Pierce 
and Amy Copeland are aware of this, but I caution that we need to be 
extremely careful given the amount of money involved. Toward this end, I have 
asked Jody and Amy to make sure each TVA Shelby upgrade invoice is adequately 
labelled as such by TVA before we make payments. I strongly suggest we put in 
place a similar system for transmission credits whereby we receive TVA 
signoff as part of the process Dennis To references below.

Please follow up with Jody, Amy, and Lloyd to make sure everyone is up to 
speed on this as we proceed, and please make sure that an adequate process is 
set up to account for transmission charges, credits, and balance of Shelby 
upgrade costs.

Thanks much,

Ben

Attached is the audit confidentiality agreement we used in our audit process
last year.  As I mentioned, it did have legal review by several of the audit
team member companies, and all of our team members signed it.  Hope it
helps.

Adam:  Will you be in charge of this filing on behalf of the Wind companies?  
Christi:  Will you be in charge of this filing on behalf of the peakers, or 
should we include someone from that group in the process as well.

Mary:  This should include all the people who need to be involved.  Also, EES 
has a section 203 application pending before FERC now to acquire PG&E Energy 
Services.  I want to wait to file this tariff with FERC until we get FERC 
approval on the PG&E ES application (we hope to get FERC authorization by 
mid-June).

 Hi John

Just wanted to let you know that we still have not heard from TVA, re dual 
interconnect with Southern. In the next week or so we will give them a call.  
On the Gleason facility, TVA has been relatively helpful and has agreed to 
let us go ""commercial"" sooner than they otherwise would be required to.  
Maybe this is a thawing of relations.  Just dreaming.

Talk to you soon.

Hope all is well.

The June 1 issue of PUF contains an article about the Master Contract.  The 
reporter interviewed me and Richard McMahon, another EEI staffer, after our 
NY workshop.  The reporter promised that I would see the article before 
publication.  This never occured.  Had I had seen it I would have tried to 
correct several errors.   At the outset, I want to apologize for the 
mischarcterization of me and Richard McMahon as ""architects"" of the 
contract.   The true architects are the many industry representatives who 
devoted their time, energy, and company resources to participating in the 
year and a half drafting process.  EEI's role was only as a facilitator; 
hosting meetings; disseminating information, and sponsoring our series of 
contract workshops.
I intend to correct this error in a letter to the editor.

Mike - 

I just spoke to my contact at Entergy.  They have moved exclusively to the 
WSPP contract to streamline their contracts department and protect them 
against inconsistent contractual language.  They are not bending on this 
requirement at this time.  As such, I think we need to proceed with signing 
this agreement unless there are any significant issues.  

Could you coordinate the execution with legal ( I think E. Sager was working 
on this).  Arlyn Kelleher is the contact on Entergy's side.  Her # is 
281-297-3582.

Kevin, Kyle, Elizabeth - are there any significant issues that would prevent 
us from executing this contract?  We need them as a counterparty and I do not 
think sleeving is the answer.

Thanks,
Rogers

Mike - As much as I wanted to come to the June 12th WSPP meeting, a conflict 
arose which I am not able to get out of.  In my absence, I asked Christian 
Yoder to help out (general Enron thoughts) and Randy Osteen (Constellation)

At the request of Christi Nicolay, attached please find the definition of an 
""Into Product"" that was prepared by a group of industry participants working 
with the Edison Electric Institute (EEI)  (this definition is also available 
on the EEI web page).  The only other definition of an ""Into"" product of 
which I am aware is the information that is available on the Cinergy web page 
or the definition published by NYMEX for its ""Into Entergy"" product.  If you 
have any questions about the ""Into"" energy product that is so commonly traded 
in the over-the-counter market in the East (eg ""Into Entergy"", ""Into TVA"", 
""Into Cinergy"", ""Into ComEd""), please don't hesitate to call me.

Attorney-Client Privileged Communication
Not Discoverable



Hi Tim

Leslie Reeves recently spoke to me about an outstanding receivable we still 
have relating to PCA.  

PCA went into bankruptcy in 1998.  At the time of PCA's bankruptcy, PCA owed  
a $5.3 million receivable to EPMI.   On EPMI's books, this uncollected 
receivable amount was offset by an out-of-the money forward position EPMI had 
with PCA which we were able to take to zero when PCA defaulted (contract 
provided for one  way payments upon the occurrence of an event of default) 
and some funds from credit.  After netting all these amounts,  there is still 
a $600,000 receivable showing up as owed from PCA to EPMI.  Based on the 
current bankruptcy proceedings, it is not likely that EPMI will receive any 
additional funds from PCA (we have taken a very low key approach in the 
bankruptcy due to the lack of PCA funds, the extensive amounts owed by PCA to 
other creditors, the assertions being made by PCA against some of the other 
creditors, and the legal effect of the one-way payment termination payment 
that provided us a significant offset to the receivable).

Accordingly, unless I hear otherwise from you, I will talk to Leslie and tell 
her to go ahead and clean up the $600,000  PCA receivable now, and in the 
unlikely event PCA makes payments to any creditors,  we would then give such 
amounts received from PCA back to you. 

Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks
Elizabeth

Here is a rough draft.  I will also start on TVA letter.  Per my earlier vm, 
I am struggling with the benefit of a 2 year proposal vs. 7.  I'm not sure if 
we get any ""cap"" benefit from making a seven year deal even if TVA doesn't 
accept our offers (benefit would assume that TVA has an obligation to cover 
entire position which is contrary to what our outside counsel has said in the 
past.  According to Bob, since TVA is asking for specific performance, it may 
not be reasonable for TVA to cover entire period.  I will try to talk to him 
tonight.). If  TVA accepts one of our proposals and then we lose the 
termination argument, what do we do? Supply? Terminate Again? In either case 
our proposal for 7 years will likely not cap our damages.  Let me know what 
you think.  I'll be in early tomorrow.  Thanks"

Richard and Jeff - 

As we discussed,  I will need further assistance from you to complete several 
of the entries.  I have put your names by the entries that will either need 
to be updated or to be completed. I believe Julia and Mark T would be the 
best to provide updated information on the SEC Risk and the CFTC Risk , 
respectively, and I will get with them shortly to update.  This document has 
limited access; only my assistant, Brenda Whitehead can view/revise.  
Accordingly, Jeff and Richard - please either call me to discuss your 
comments and I can complete the chart with Brenda or else provide Brenda with 
your written comments.  Thanks for your help.

The following Message was sent to members of Contract List Server, the EEI 
Contract Standization Mailing List.
Andy Katz sent out the following message...We have had many 
undeliverables...I would appreciate your letting me know if you receive this 
message...thanks.
Working Group Members:

The drafting commitee met on September 15 to discuss the status of the Master 
Agreement and the agenda for the October 13 meeting at EEI's offices.  The 
general consensus of the drafting committee is that the Master Agreement is 
sound and there is no need for revision to the base terms and conditions of 
version 2.1.  Based on that meeting, the drafting committee would like to 
cover the following at the October 13 meeting :

GETTING CONTRACT IN PLACE.  The drafting committee believes that the number 
one priority is to get the Master Agreement used by more participants in the 
marketplace.   We would like to hear from the working group about the status 
of the Master Agreement in their organizations and issues about the contract 
that are holding up its use.  We will solicit suggestions on how to get wider 
acceptance of the Master Agreement.  The drafting committee has thought of 
holding another workshop in late January to address implementation issues 
such as establsihing credit thresholds.

STANDARDIZED SUPPLEMENTAL PROVISIONS.  There are  several areas not addressed 
in the base contract that are frequently used as customized supplemental 
provisions identified on many parties' cover sheets.  The drafting committee 
identified the following as useful to develop as suggested optional 
supplemental provisions that could be used in negotiating a cover sheet with 
a counterparty:   (1)  the incorporation of prior transactions as being 
governed by the Master Agreement; (2) the use of the Master Agreement for 
electronic trading; (3) alternative dispute resolution mechanisms; (4) 
treatment of new taxes or changes in regulatory policy; (5) additional 
products (e.g. Western firm or CAISO energy); (6) agreements with respect to 
agency relationships; (7) ""regulatory out"" provisions; and (8) provisions 
involving ""one-way"" counterparty relationships, i.e. sales only or purchases 
only.

The drafting committee will ask the working group to allow it to develop 
these provisions and once consensus on language is reached among the drafting 
committee members, they would be made available for downloading on the EEI 
website for use by the industry as suggested optional provisions.  We will 
also discuss the ways to tie these provisions to the Master Agreement general 
terms.


PROCEDURE FOR GETTING CONTRACT INTERPRETATION.  The drafting committee will 
discuss ways to get answers about the contract disseminated quickly.  One 
suggestion is to have a frequently asked questions section up on the EEI 
website.

As a reminder, the meeting will be held from 10-4.  Please contact me if you 
have any questions or comments about the agenda.   If you plan to attend or 
need information about hotels or transportation, please contact Patricia 
Young at 202-508-5757 or pyoung@eei.org. Thank-you.

Hemstock and Aleck Dadson on any particular issues relating to market 
operations in Ontario or Alberta.  I also need someone in the Toronto office 
to provide me with the definition of ""Interval Meters"" that I have included 
as a potential delivery point.  I have left that definition as a bullet and 
we will need to fill it in or remove it, if the latter makes more sense.  
Finally, once the last few business issues are resolved next week, I would 
like to set up a call with Jeff Hodge and Elizabeth Sager to obtain final 
internal legal approval on this agreement so that our commercial people can 
commence marketing the paper to potential counterparties.  Mark Powell will 
be using this form of the agreement in conjunction with the current ENA form 
of physical power GTC to prepare a Canadian form of physical power GTC that 
may be used to transact physical power transactions of less than one year in 
duration with counterparties with whom we do not have masters in place.

Thanks

Greg

Hi

Thanks for the feedback - you never know how things are rec'd when you 
standing for 90 minutes in front of a crowd of credit numbers guys, in a dark 
room with slides that are barely legible, taking about a contract that only a 
lawyer could love ... OK tolerate.  I'll send you the presentation by mail.  
Hopefully I didn't get too carried away.


Looking forward to seeing you Friday.

Hi Andy

I read through all of your Article this weekend .

 What a job!

I will forward to you this afternoon or first thing tomorrow an electronic
copy of my suggested changes, which also attempts to pick up those given to
me by Dede.  After you receive it, I thought it might be helpful to talk
over the changes so you can see where I was coming from.

Thanks

Attached for your review is a draft of the Joint Brief of Intervenors in the 
PCA
proceeding at the D.C. Circuit.  As you know, the Brief must be filed with the
Court on Friday.  Thus, to ensure that there is sufficient time to address
issues/concerns, we request that Intervenors provide comments as soon as
possible on Wednesday.  Please bear in mind that the Court has allotted
Intervenors 8,750 words and the current draft is right at that limit.  Over 
the
next day, where appropriate, we will add citations to the record, include 
other
citations such as case name short cites, and shorten quotations.  We look
forward to your comments.

Shari and Elizabeth,

     We revised our CAISO language to address the 10 minute pricing
implemented recently.  See attached.  Do you plan to change your language
also?  As you can see, I took the easy way out and did not reference either
the 10 minute price or the Hourly Ex Post Price -- I just said the price
paid to CAISO by the Buyer.  Do you think this works?

Jim -- EPSA already acts as our agent on generic NERC matters, especially the 
Market Interface Committee.  EPSA will not get involved in the NERC regions 
such as WSPP, since these are local matters.  If we do not have the resources 
to be effective in the WSCC region, we should discuss pulling out with Tim.  

Christi -- Please forward these documents to Jeff Hodge or Elizabeth Sager 
and ask for their help.
I will need to vote on them early next week at the WSCC Board of Directors 
meeting.  Thanks  JOE

Joe --

Not sure if we ever decided anything on this?  Have we ever thought about 
having EPSA act as our ""agent"" for NERC matters and working through that body 
to cover legal / policy change reviews?

I don't know if we have the $$ to review these documents.

Attached is a summation of the WSCC Executive Policy Issues Task Force 
meeting held in San Francisco on November 2,  In addition there are several 
attachnebts that will be voted on at the Board meeting in December including 
the By Laws for the formation of the WIO.  It is anticipated that the WIO 
will be ready for a FERC filing during the 1s half of 2001  There is a large 
amt of material and some of it needs review by legal in my opinion.   Note 
that we voted  ""no"" on the EHV ballot  because it restricts access to 
information.  The bylaws and the detail documents are most critical for legal 
review.  For clarity read them in the following order:  EPITF Nov 2;  
wiosummary; bylaws;detail doc.  If there aqre questions you can call me at 
520 646 5539 or E mail at richard.ingersoll@enron.com

           Attorney Work Product/Not Discoverable

Top Legal Risks

1.  Power Forms -  Trading contracts in the power industry are very weak.  
Typical problems include, trading under multiple masters, no liquidated 
damages for non-delivery, no events of default or calculation of termination 
damages, broad performance outs.

2. Agency - Several of our major trading partners operate through an agent 
acting on behalf of several operating companies. This creates uncertainty as 
to which entity is liable for which trades.

3. Municipalities - Difficult authorization issues associated municipalities.

4.Complexity of transactions - Power transactions can be very complex as a 
result, in part, of difficult delivery mechanics and volatile pricing.

5.Timing of transactions - Power transactions typically must be completed on 
a very tight time schedule.

6. Lawyer Training - Difficult, time consuming process to train lawyers on 
how to document transactions involving power.

7.Process for approval of transactions - Uncertain procedures for making sure 
everybody understands risks associated with transactions.

Documentation Projects

1.  EEI - cont'd work to make EEI the trading contract for power/lessen 
reliance on WSPP.

2.  One-off Power Form - creation of contract to be used for individual 
transactions that are not part of a master.

3. Product Definition - cont'd work on creating/building acceptance for power 
product definitions.

4. Platform Trading - Encourage use of EEI as trading platform for all 
e-trading.

5. Single master contract for all physical commodities/financial trading  -  
work with ISDA to develop single contract for physical trading and then roll 
that into single contract for physical and financial trading"

How's things going?  I hope at least OK if not well.

Hey about the Sat party, I'm thrilled.  We would, of course, love to come to 
your house (I think Gail told me that you generously offered to host your own 
birthday party) but we would also love to have you guys at our house as well 
(wouldn't you rather relax, drink and let the kids shuffle around without 
having to worry about the diner preparation, and worse yet, clean up - after 
all it is your party - mine's next).  Let me know what you think.

Enron's Third-Quarter Profit Rises 31 Percent as Sales Surge

Enron's Third-Quarter Profit Rises 31 Percent as Sales Surge

     Houston, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
largest energy trader, said third-earnings rose 31 percent as
revenue more than doubled.
     Net income rose to $292 million, or 34 cents a share, from
profit from operations of $223 million, or 27 cents, in the year-
earlier quarter. Enron was expected to earn 32 cents a share, the
average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson
Financial. Revenue rose to $30 billion from $11.84 billion.
     Revenue from Enron's wholesale energy operations and services
unit, which consists of marketing energy commodities and investing
in energy-related assets, more than doubled to $28.2 billion from
$11.1 billion. Revenue from its retail energy services business
almost tripled to $1.48 billion from $542 million.
     In the year-earlier quarter, a gain of $345 million, or
44 cents a share, and a charge of $278 million, or 36 cents, made
net income $290 million, or 35 cents.
     Shares in the Houston-based company rose 50 cents to $80
yesterday. They've risen 80 percent this year.

HOUSTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., North America's biggest buyer and 
seller of electricity and natural gas, said on Tuesday its third-quarter 
earnings rose 31 percent, beating Wall Street's expectations as online 
trading helped drive strong growth at its wholesale energy operations. 
Recurring net income rose to $292 million or 34 cents per share from $223 
million or 27 cents in the third quarter of 1999. Wall Street analysts had 
expected earnings of 32 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson 
Financial.
""Our wholesale and retail energy businesses have achieved record-setting 
levels of physical deliveries, contract originations and profitability,"" said 
Chairman and CEO Ken Lay. 
""We operate in some of the largest and fastest growing markets in the world, 
and we are very optimistic about the continued strong outlook for our 
company,"" Lay added. 
Enron, which has recently branched out beyond energy into fields such as 
broadband telecommunications and metals trading, said third-quarter revenues 
rose 154 percent to $30 billion compared with the same period of 1999. The 
company's stock has risen some 80 percent so far this year.

Arena-backers promote plan to group of Hispanic leaders 
By JANETTE RODRIGUES 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Pro-arena forces did some direct marketing to the Hispanic community Monday, 
pitching the $175 million plan to a grass-roots group of Latino leaders. 
More than 150 community activists and leaders, precinct judges and 
civic-association members attended an informational meeting and 
get-out-the-vote rally for the Nov. 7 arena referendum. The rally was 
sponsored by the Let's Build It Together political action committee. 
""By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this, it 
empowers us,"" said Celina Garza-Ridge, a Harris County-Houston Sports 
Authority director. ""It's very important to be able to say the Hispanic 
community made a difference, and we are exactly in that position."" 
George Postolos, the Houston Rockets' chief operating officer, said the team 
is actively courting the Hispanic community. 
The pro-arena committee, headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, 
and Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, does not want a 
repeat of the 1999 referendum. 
Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal. The sports 
authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and 
county to oversee and develop sports venues. 
The Rockets made a 30-percent participation commitment, similar to the one 
made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field, to fairly share 
the new arena's design and construction jobs with minorities and women. 
The team also promised to distribute up to $50,000 a year in neighborhood 
improvement grants of up to $1,000 each to worthy grass-roots, nonprofit 
organizations and civic clubs in inner-city Houston. The new program targets 
the Hispanic community, Postolos said. 
The new arena plan is being endorsed by a cross-section of Latino leaders, 
including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez, state Rep. Mario 
Gallegos, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others. 
Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city, and the Hispanic community, is 
getting more tangibles this time around. 
He said, ""When you consider that our community will get 30 percent 
affirmative action, that our youth will be taken care of through youth 
outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well, this 
is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the 
Hispanic community."" 
Mercedes Alejandro, who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston, 
heard the details of the plan for the first time. 
""It's good if it creates jobs for the community, and opportunities to rebuild 
the community,"" she said. ""We want it to be good for the whole, not the few."" 
Humberto Barrera, president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization, 
was critical of Hispanic leaders, not the arena plan. 
""I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay 
raises for teachers, health care and public safety, than building arenas for 
rich entrepreneurs,"" Barrera said. 
Richard Torres, director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told 
attendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing. 
Sergio Davila, president of the Eastwood Civic Association, brought up the 
lack of Latinos in leadership positions on the team's staff. Postolos 
acknowledged that the team needs to do better. 


	



TVA Says Enron Breach Of Power Sales Pact Cost $140 Mln
By Bryan Lee

10/16/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The nation's top two power providers are battling in 
a U.S. court over an unexecuted power sales agreement.
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has filed a claim against the power 
marketing unit of Enron Corp. (ENE) alleging breach of a power sales 
contract. 
TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its 
distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen 
expenses contributing to the government-owned utility's inability to meet its 
debt-reduction forecast. 
According to the documents, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, the alleged 
breach of contract contributed to a $140 million shortfall during fiscal year 
2000. 
TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case, which is 
under a court protective order. 
""A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract,"" said 
David Smith, TVA's chief financial officer, when asked Friday to elaborate on 
the line item in the information provided to TVA's distribution utility 
customers. 
But after consulting with attorneys, Smith revealed that Enron was the 
subject of the claim. 
TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment 
order from the U.S. District Court in Chattanooga, Tenn., in February, 
stemming from a dispute over a long-term sales agreement, an Enron spokesman 
said Monday. 
In March, TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of 
contract, a TVA spokesman said Monday. 
But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract, or to 
elaborate further on the dispute, citing the judge's protective order. TVA 
said Enron sought the court seal. 
The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houston-based 
energy giant and TVA, a government-owned utility that ranks among the largest 
U.S. power producers. 
The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to 
the lucrative U.S. Midwest power market, which saw extreme price spikes 
during hot weather in the summers of 1998 and 1999. 
After the summer of 1998 - in which power that typically sells for between 
$30 and $50 per megawatt-hour spiked as high as $7,000 per megawatt-hour - 
Enron cited a study showing that TVA's power grid represented the only 
unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest. 
TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were 
spiking upward. 
Enron built gas-fired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on 
the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access 
across TVA's system. 
After the summer of 1999 saw a repeat in extreme price volatility, Enron 
began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by 
failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service 
requests. 
A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement 
over the government utility's handling of transmission-access requests. 
But the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public 
with its complaints about TVA's transmission service. 
In February, Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson 
asking for the government's help, charging that TVA was unfairly giving its 
own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enron's 
requests were gathering dust. 
Enron later dropped the matter, saying that TVA was processing its 
transmission service requests on a timely basis. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones

Mark had asked me to call Williams and invite them to the ISDA Energy meeting 
in Houston last week.  Tim at Williams very much wanted to participate.  As 
you can see from his email, he must not be on the distribution list for 
ISDA.  Can you see if it is OK to add him to the distribution list for future 
meetings.  Also, I called Dynegy at Mark's request and they very much want to 
participate as well - Harlan Murphy called me afterwards to ask that he also 
get notice of the meetings because they fully support the idea of one Master 
for all trades.  I will get Genia to forward Harlan's address info to you.  
Thanks for your help.

Elizabeth 36349

PS Mark 

At the EEI meeting last week there was a fair bit of discussion about cross 
defaulting all commodity lines and using a single master for all trades.  It 
seems that there is alot of interest in this idea.

Elizabeth,
Is it possible that we can be included on future mailings/meetings of the
North America Energy and Developing Products Committee - due to the late
notice of the last meeting on 10/10 in Houston we were unable to send a
representative.  We will, with ample notice, attempt to send a
representative to future meetings as Williams has an interest in the topics
that would be discussed.  Thanks for your assistance.  Tim

I agree w Tracy - the Calpine master is legally sufficient for trades and our 
relationship w Calpine is sensitive.  We do not need to push the EEI Master 
unless they want it in which case we are happy to oblige.  Just FYI, 
depending on  the trade we would likely like to  add product definition (eg 
West Firm, Into Product since products are not defined in master).  

John

When you are ready with the deal terms, just let me know and we can find the 
right person to help you document it given the nature of the product involved."

Hi Dede
Just wondering if you would be able to hit next week? How about Monday 
(anytime anywhere) or Wednesday?  Also, I see that Shari has sent out CAISO 
language which I have not yet reviewed.  Maybe we can also schedule a real 
meeting on Monday to finalize.  Let me know if that works for you.  See ya."

Attached are clean and blacklined drafts of the revised PPA for Indian Mesa

format, but because of numerous internal drafts, the track changes document 
was simply too confusing with internal comments showing as deletions.? As a 
result, you will not be able to go into the blacklined version and 
accept/reject changes, nor make additional changes to such document without 
such changes being re-inserted into the ""clean"" version.?

Hi Shari,

Christian asked me to review these inc/dec examples.  I think these are an 
excellent idea and will be very helpful to your counterparties in 
understanding how the Adjustment Payment works in combination with inc/dec 
pricing.

I made some corrections to the examples, which I have attached as a redline 
document so that you can see what I did.  You will also see that I added a 
few words here and there to clarify things.  The other document is a clean 
version incorporating all of the proposed changes from the redlined document.

John,

We need to make sure we are valuing the spread option using only No. 2 oil in 
Dec, Jan & Feb.  We will almost certainly be curtailed during blow out events 
in the winter and, therefore, it is not appropriate to use nat gas as the 
winter fuel.

Do you suppose that Shari could handle this for John today?  This is the 
first I've seen of the term sheet, and I haven't even taken the time to read 
it, so I'm not even sure exactly what this deal is.  ""Tolling"" means so many 
different things..............  Shari sent this company an EEI Master this 
summer and has been bugging them about it but w/ no response (according to 
the database).  Maybe this would be a good opportunity to advance 
that.........
And I'm still working on the Maine SOS proposal, and VPPSA and the N. 
Carolina project that David Fairley wants comments on yesterday, as well as 
the Reedy Creek stuff that came up as a rush yesterday afternoon (I've left 
you a vmail on that).  
Regards,
Janice

		 Subject: Black Hills Pepperell tolling transaction

Attached is an indicative term sheet I shared with the customer yesterday 
relating to the referenced tolling transaction.  Preliminary feedback from 
the customer has been positive, so I am hopeful that we will come to mutually 
agreeable pricing and terms on this transaction.   I should get some 
additional feedback sometime today. 

I have raised the flag with the customer that we need to put paper and credit 
terms in place, and given their desire to close on this quickly, we will 
likely need to move quickly on this today/tomorrow.   As for cedit, their 
consultant indicated that a corp guarantee from the Black Hill Power Corp 
parent is probably not the customer's preferred approach, but rather credit 
arrangements tagged specifically to the project.  The project is owned by 
Black Hills Energy Capital, which invests in power projects through some sort 
of investment fund.  Their consultant speculated that Enron might have some 
interests in that investment fund relating to some projects out West, but he 
wasn't sure.   In any event, depending on their desire to move forward with 
us, we will need to be ready to talk credit/contract with them on short 
notice.

I'll keep you all updated on any feedback i get from the customer.

Regards
John

		 Subject: Review Procedure for Power Contracts

Effective today, there is a new legal review procedure for physical power 
contracts that are individually negotiated, with a term longer than one 
year.  Please notify me (Janette will maintain a list of contracts, 
counterparties and status) when drafting starts on such power contracts and 
provide me with a draft with sufficient time to make comments prior to 
closing.  My objective is to insure a consistent approach on these power 
contracts.  Thanks for your cooperation in this matter.  Please forward this 
memo on to the lawyers on your team.

Mark

As you are aware, I reviewed the proposed Canadian Power Master and have been 
speaking to Greg Johnston about various issues.  The Canadian Master is based 
upon EEI but has been ""retyped"" making changes based upon variations in the 
way US power has evolved from that of the Canadian master gas contract (the 
basis for a number of the differences from EEI) , operational distinctions, 
differences in product and jurisdictional issues.  EEI has called me and 
stated that they want to attend a meeting on November 9th  in Ontario to 
advocate the use of the EEI form in Canada.   Peter Keohane, I know, wants 
the form he and Greg prepared to be the model Canadian form for all the 
reasons he stated in his email to you.  Do you think I should set up a 
meeting with you, Jeff Hodge, Peter K., Greg J. and myself to discuss.  At 
that time, we could also discuss the significant ""policy differences"" to make 
sure that everybody knows what is going on and that there are good reasons 
for the differences.

Thanks
Elizabeth

I also think this is a great idea - there would be a tremendous benefit if 
the EEI contract became the standard for on-line trading platforms.  While 
Enron currently uses simplified GTCs for trading online with those 
counterparties with whom we do not have a Master Power Trading Contract (if 
we do that agreement governs power trades), we have talked about and likely 
will eventually make the EEI contract the ""default"" contract if there are no 
other arrangements in place.  I would fully support and provide any 
assistance to pursue this idea with and through EEI.

Andy,

I could provide language by the end of next week, if needed by then.

Separately, I understand that we intend to emphasize marketing efforts
towards all potential EEI users, but utilities in particular due to that
group's lower acceptance rate to date.  Another ""group"" to which I believe
that we should emphasize our marketing efforts includes the online trading
platforms.

Three types of online trading platforms presently exist: (1)proprietary
exchanges (EnronOnline, Dynegydirect); (2) consortium platforms (ICEX); and
(3) independent, third-party platform (Altra) [these platforms are similar
to (2)but differ in that the shareholders/backers have not committed
liquidity].  The volumes traded on these types of electric platforms are
significant and growing.  According to MegawattDaily, Ameren Energy
conducts
about 40% of next-day deals and 30% of forwards on various electronic
platforms.  There are presently close to 25 platforms (of course, with so
many competitors, as usually happens, there will probably be a weeding out
and/or consolidations/mergers...the Jurassic period notwithstanding, as
blame for the mass dinosaur extinction lay with an errant meteor or
possibly
the taking up of cigarette smoking by the majority of the dinosaurs
according to Larsen...all apologies for the joke).

As each platform system has different definitions, products, and contracts,
and as several of the platforms are considering adopting standard
contracts,
I believe an opportunity exists to push the EEI as either the exclusive
standard agreement used for trading on a particular platform or as a
default
agreement for those proprietary and other platforms under which trading
partners lack executed Masters with the counterparty.  In fact, according
to
published sources, Houston Street, RedMeteor, and others have been working
with others for several months on developing industry standards.

Just a thought.

Babak

Some random thoughts:

There was a teleconference today regarding the credit annex.  Bill McCoy
should have draft language by early next week.  This draft only addresses
EEI transactions, but could easily be expanded to transactions under other
master agreements.  I will circulate Bill's draft as soon as I get it.
Randy Baker & Michelle McLendin (Duke), and Lisa Grof & Frank Hilton (AEP)
have volunteered to work on the on the credit annex subcommittee.

According to my notes, assignments for the remaining optional provisions
are
as follows:

1) Incorporating old  trades - Elizabeth
2) One-way transactions - Buddy
3) New products e.g. Western Firm/CAISO - Dede & Elizabeth
4) Regulatory Out - John Crespo & Randy Osteen
5) New taxes - Fritz
6) ADR - Patty
7) Agency relationship - Elizabeth
8) Electronic Exchanges - Babak

Additional provisions
9) Credit Annex - Bill McCoy, et al.
10) incorporating prior trades not under netting, Frank Stllingwerf
11) Broker Confirmations ?
12) Over Deliveries - Phyliss Lemel

What kind of deadline for these assignments is realistic?

Randy Osteen & I plan to meet next w/ week to start planning the workshop
in
Atlanta we plan to hold at the end of January.  If anyone has ideas for the
program please let us know.

I plan to fix up the contract web page next week

Sterling Koch of TransAlta said he would like to set up a presentation
opportunity for an EEI contract representative to talk to the Canadian
standardization group.

Finally, EEI has a block of rooms and meeting space at the Four Seasons in
Newport Bearch, CA for our Legal Committee from April 18-21.  We would like
to shorten our meeting to two days.  Ed has offerred the block of rooms and
meeting space to us for the night of the 20th and the 21st if we want to
put
on a conference or hold a meeting then.  Something to think about.

Jim - 

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  While I'm still checking,  I am 
not aware that there is a ""formal process"" for being a board member of a 
non-corporate entity like SPP. We would, however,  want to look at the 
equivalent of SPPs Bylaws to make sure that members are not going to be 
liable for actions taken and to see if SPP has something like D&O insurance, 
protecting the members.  We can talk to SPP and see what there is.  Let me 
know if you want us to request/review documents.  Thanks

Elizabeth --

Ron McNamara heads up Government Affairs activities for SPP.  He has been 
asked to be a member of the SPP Board.  This would be great for EPMI because 
we would have more ability to influence SPP and its actions regarding opening 
the market.

What form of approval do we need to have internally (if any) before Ron can 
become a SPP Board Member?  Are there any internal restrictions on this type 
of activity? 

Not sure if there are any risks, but I want to make sure that Ron won't be 
harmed by pursuing this opportunity.

Thanks,

Jim

Was Ontario Power Generation the Canadian company you mentioned this morning 
that has alot of generation in Ontario and would likely be a major factor in 
determining the contract to be utilized in Canada?  Shari has had numerous

I've attempted to draft language for the ""CAISO Schedule Adjustment""
definition, as we discussed yesterday.  We can discuss this proposed
language in our call tomorrow:

""CAISO Schedule Adjustment"" means a schedule change implemented by the CAISO
on a schedule coordinator-schedule coordinator transaction after the CAISO's
final hourly scheduling deadline for the transaction, and on which
transaction the CAISO imposes Inc and Dec Prices.  Such schedule change
shall neither be caused by, nor within the control of, either Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a CAISO Schedule Adjustment shall not be
deemed to occur if the schedule change is due to (i) the curtailment of
imports into, or exports from, California; (ii) load deviations; (iii) the
failure of a Party to accurately submit or balance its schedule with the
CAISO.

I'm glad you cancelled.   I agree that the changes are much broader than we 
intended.

More importantly, I miss having not played tennis this week, and I'm going to 
DC this weekend, and likely out next week.  A short interlude but that's all.

On an EEI note, are you/Reliant going to the meeting in Ontario that is 
addressing contract issues in Ontario (Andy is speaking about EEI).  Are you 
supporting the use of EEI in Canada.  I think I have our Canadian office 
convinced to use it with dealers but they would want to ""Canadianize"" it, 
thereby creating an EEI Canadian.  Any thoughts.

PS I am going to WSPP meeting just for the day - Mike Small has mentioned 
playing tennis on Monday morning before the meeting.  Still not going?"

From Rick Antonoff:

Following our telephone conversations on Sunday and Tuesday, please find
attached our revised preliminary draft memorandum addressing the bankruptcy
issues that we have been discussing, and incorporating the additional facts
raised during our telephone conferences this week.  Based on our
discussions and the revisions made to the draft Settlement Agreement this
week, our draft memorandum is now based upon the Avista transaction.

Attached are clean and redline versions of the revised draft.  The redline
is marked to show changes from the draft we circulated on December 22,
2000.

We look forward to receiving your thoughts and comments after you have an
opportunity to review the memorandum.

Regards.

		 Subject: Re: Draft Letter

In the interest of time, I am forwarding the attached contract to Kevin 
Hughes, Wanda Curry, Don Black, Ron Adzegary, and Marty Sunde.  Please read 
the attached and confirm that this is your understanding of the  PGET/EPMI/ 
EEMC assignment.  

I am also at this time forwarding to the working group my four main points, 
which I think reflect my main areas of concern under the drafts:

1.  I would like to say  that  the price is the same under the transactions.  
Transaction costs should be dealt with separately. 
2. While we have agreed to take a pass through of the bankruptcy risk,  this 
draft provides that we take on all contract dispute risk.  As I understand 
it, EPMI intends to pass through all risk, such as change in delivery point 
risk, under the contract.  Since EPMI is our sole provider of power to EES 
(other than  the PGET contract), EPMI is in the best position to manage  
general contract risk with its counterparties, as it does today with all our 
physical electricity purchases.  EPMI may  have disputes under contracts for 
many reasons that EEMC is not aware of and will not be in a position to 
influence once the contracts are  assigned to Avista.
3. I assume if EPMI  trades out of  these positions as it manages its own 
portfolio, the credit risk would not follow to subsequent counterparties and 
the EPMI/EES confirm terms would revert to typical confirm language.
4.  I was operating under the assumption that the tax issue would be resolved 
with Steve Douglass prior to signing the main documents.  I am not sure 
whether this issue can be quantified by EES tax today.  Any suggestions or 
ability to resolve/quantify today?  Same concern for the accounting issues.  
My concern here is that if the transaction leaves us in a worse economic 
position as a result of making EPMI whole, this would need to be addressed 
with our business people. 

Elizabeth and JOhn, what are the next steps.

Confidential - Attorney Work Product/Not Discoverable

A. PGE

I. Termination Rights Based on the Failure to Post Collateral

It is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on PGE's 
or one of its subsidiaries's failure to post collateral as required by the 
underlying contracts"":

1.  PG&E/ENA - Financial ISDA  - Enron exposure $23 million

2.  PGET Power/EPMI - Physical power - Enron exposure $215 million

3. PGE Canada/Enron Canada - Physical gas - Enron exposure $15 million

4.PGE Canada/ENA - Physical gas - Enron exposure $1 million


II. Termination Rights Based on PG&E's Failure to Pay Indebtedness

It is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on 
PG&E's or one of its subsidiaries's default on indebtedness in excess of a 
threshold (either $100 million or $50 million):

1. PG&E/ENA - Financial ISDA - Enron Exposure $23 million

2. PG&E/EPMI Physical Power -Enron exposure ($90 million)

3.PGET Power/ENA - Physical Coal - Enron exposure $200,000

4.PGET Power/ENA - Financial GTC - Enron exposure ($6.2 million)

5.PGET Power/EPMI - Physical power - Enron exposure (out of the money, 
currently used to net other EEMC power master which is net in the money $215 
million - see contract 2 above)

6.PGE Canada/Enron Canada - Physical gas - Enron exposure $15 million

7.  PGE Canada/ENA -Physical Gas- Enron exposure $1 million

8. PGET Gas/Enron Canada - Enron Exposure ($2.3 million)

9.PGET Gas/ENA -Financial ISDA - Enron exposure $ 48 million

10. PGET Gas/ENA - Physical gas - Enron exposure ($25 million)

11. PGET Gas/EES - Physical gas - Enron exposure ($700,000)

Most of the above agreements are supported by a guaranty from PG&E's parent 
(PG&E Corporation) in the amount of $475,000,000.  We have not yet made 
demand on the parent but could do so after PGE or its other unregulated 
subsidiaries failed to pay amounts due.  

Exposures are approximate as of 1/19/01.  Before terminating, we would need 
to verify actual contract language.

B.  SCE Default

SCE is in default of a contract between SCE and EPMI relating to  a power 
sales position which is out of the money to EPMI approximately ($35 million) 
based upon SCE's failure to make payments on debt in excess of $100 million. 
Under contract we could suspend deliveries (limited period) and then 
terminate and accelerate amounts due.  Amounts payable could offset amounts 
owed by SCE to EPMI or its Affiliates including Enron Wind or Portland 
General.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT
DO NOT DISTRIBUTE

Elizabeth:

I looked through the CMS PPA on my return flight to NY.  While I think we 
should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone, I 
nonetheless thought it might be of some help to set forth a few preliminary 
focal points for those discussions, particularly if you don't get to this for 
a few days.  I thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some 
comments as I was thinking through some of the issues/positions.  Also, I'll 
have to run down the conflict issue when I get back into the office, but I 
thought I could generally review the PPA in any event.

In addition, I did not know whether it was ENA's or Dynegy's obligation to 
work on a response to CMS, but I thought it made some sense to see what one 
might look like on paper.  (See  attached).  At this point, however, I'm not 
sure whether MPLP should furnish any specific contract-based rationale in 
writing to CMS as to MPLP's position that the capacity charges should be 
adjusted on a calendar year basis.  You will note that the draft letter 
focuses on the language dealing with the adjustment formula to the Contract 
Capacity Factor (which clearly is done on a calendar year basis), rather than 
the scheduled changes to the stated capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D.  
As noted below, there are some issues underlying this position.

Preliminary Overall Assessment

The PPA essentially is inconsistent on the capacity charge adjustment issue.  
While many of the relevant computations are done on a calendar year 
basis--which generally supports MPLP's position--the effect of adjusting the 
stated capacity charges on a calendar year basis results in two anomalies: 
namely, the stated capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for ""Year 1"" only would 
apply for 3 months, but even more importantly, the capacity charge (on 
Exhibit D) for ""Year 35"" would apply for the last 21 months of the Contract 
Term.  The anomaly ""running in the other direction"" is that, under CMS's 
interpretation, various computations would be made on a calendar year basis 
(e.g., Contract Capacity Factor), and adjustments resulting therefrom would 
be applied ""mid-stream"" (i.e., after 3 months of the alleged ""contract year"" 
).  My overall concern is that an arbitrator may focus on the anomaly 
(described above) that results by applying Exhibit D using a calendar year 
concept (i.e., the 21 month ""Year 35"" issue) since that is a fairly easy 
concept to get your arms around..

More Information/Diligence/Research

Before a definitive conclusion on the issue can be made, we likely would want 
to review or undertake, as the case may be, some additional 
information/diligence/research, such as (which I assume we could generally 
obtain from the Michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e-mail you 
forwarded):

--The Michigan PUC presumably approved the PPA (prior to the first amendment) 
in a published Order.  Was there anything in that Order or the submissions 
(or exhibits thereto, including financial projections) that might provide 
some guidance?

--My guess is that there must be other CMS QF PPAs with the same type of 
pricing structure since this issue essentially would arise in every instance 
where the COD was not a Jan.1.  Do we (or local counsel) know whether this 
may be a ""global"" attack by CMS on these types of PPAs?

--While not directly relevant to the contract interpretation question, 
confirm with local counsel that CMS would have recovered the ""excess"" 
capacity payments from its customers--so that it presumably would have to 
issue a customer refund if it were to prevail on its claims.

--CMS ""self bills"" itself under the PPA.  Has the statute of limitations run 
on any of its claims for refunds for prior years?  Can CMS's prior course of 
dealing be used to support MPLP's contractual interpretation, or is there 
otherwise an equitable argument that CMS should not be able to recover prior 
""overpayments"" (as opposed to prospectively adjusting the capacity 
payments)?  (This could be particularly helpful to try to settle out the 
dispute on the basis that MPLP would concede the issue on a prospective basis 
only).

--The cover letter from CMS suggests that the alleged payment error resulted 
in payments in excess of the avoided cost rate authorized by the PUC.  Isn't 
this determination to be made over the life of the PPA, rather than for any 
particular period?  Assuming CMS's statement is correct, I assume it does not 
affect the validity of the PPA, but only whether CMS can recover the ""excess"" 
amount in rates?

--Do we have any leverage in the event we were to raise this dispute with the 
PUC?  If so, can this be used in the context of trying to work out an overall 
restructuring of the PPA?


Certain Points in Support of MPLP's Position

--The definition of ""Contract Capacity Factor"" provides for a calendar year 
determination and, most importantly, provides for a partial year calculation 
for the year in which the COD occurs that ends at the end of that calendar 
year.  If the capacity charge should be adjusted as of the anniversary of the 
COD date, it arguably would not make sense to have a partial year calculation.

--Sec. 10(a) provides that if in any calendar year the Contract Capacity 
Factor is less than 60%, then the capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D 
""shall be adjusted for the next calendar year as follows.... The capacity 
charges for the following calendar year shall then be determined....  
(Emphasis added).  This section makes specific reference to Exhibit D and 
makes the adjustment effective for the next calendar year, not on the next 
anniversary of the COD.  It arguably would not appear to make any sense to 
apply the Contract Capacity Factor adjustment on a calendar basis, but 
determine the capacity charges on a COD anniversary basis if no adjustments 
thereto are required because the Contract Capacity Factor levels do not 
require an adjustment.

 --NOTE:  The counter-argument, however, is that the foregoing language only 
pertains to the computation of a percentage ""haircut"" or adjustment that is 
applied to the stated capacity charges on Exhibit D, whatever those may be, 
rather than to when the annual stated capacity charges are effective.  That 
is, making this adjustment on a calendar year basis, even though the 
scheduled capacity rates change each October 1, is not necessarily in 
conflict with the rest of the PPA.

--Sec. 2(b) (Effective Date and Term) provides that the Agreement runs for 35 
years ""and thereafter from year to year,"" unless a party gives at least one 
year's notice to terminate which termination shall be effective ""at the end 
of the 35 years or any calendar year thereafter."" (Emphasis added).  Thus, 
for example, if one month after the end of the 35 year term--i.e., October 
31, 2030--a party gave notice to terminate, such termination would be 
effective December 31, 2031, not September 30, 2031 or September 30, 2032 
(i.e., not on the anniversary dates of the COD).  Thus, the PPA contemplates 
in certain respects certain ""stub"" years and certain ""long"" years, a 
contractual scheme that is at least analogous to MPLP's position on the stub 
and long years for the timing of the scheduled changes in the stated capacity 
charges on Exhibit D.

--There are other calendar year based obligations--for e.g., Sec. 13 (and 
Exhibit B) reflect termination payments that, again, are calculated on a 
calendar year basis.  (We should discuss with the commercial people the 
economic rationale underlying the termination payments to see if there may be 
additional support in that respect).  (Note that some other calendar year 
based calculations were eliminated by the First Amendment to the PPA, but can 
still be used to reflect the underlying ""calendar year"" flavor of the PPA 
since the issue at hand existed even prior to the First Amendment).

A Few Additional Points to Note

--The PPA is devoid of default language, LDs, etc.; however, MPLP could bring 
a claim against CMS to arbitration (Sec. 18) for what it believes it is owed 
when CMS does not pay the full capacity charges in 2001 (plus interest as 
provided at Sec. 20) and keep performing under the PPA.

--Although I do not see a significant issue here, let's briefly discuss the 
potential for CMS to try to affirmatively use an ""indication"" of a regulatory 
disallowance pursuant to Sec. 10(c) as a way to attempt to force its 
""contract year"" interpretation of Exhibit D.  While Sec. 10(c) is one of 
those ""old school"" one way regulatory outs, MPLP would undoubtedly use Sec. 
10(e) [requiring CMS to defend the PPA) to prevent CMS's affirmatively use of 
the PUC to support its contract claim.  (In Pennsylvania, PECO, in an 
analogous circumstance, attempted to use a PUC determination as justification 
to attempt to break a PPA with a QF).

Let me know when you wish to follow up.

Peter, just a follow-up to your email.

1.  I would agree that OPG is mistaken.  After the meeting, Chris and I and 
others started the process of explaining to Joel Sheinfied, a contract 
administrator, why deliveries in a pool situation were not just financial 
settlements but involved a physical commitment to deliver or cause to be 
delivered power.  On this issue I think it would be helpful to present OPG w/ 
a product definition that works with the physical master.  I know Chris is 
already working on this.  From what it sounds like, the Ontario pool is not 
that different from NEPOOL.  In UI, Chris worked on a product definition that 
you could incorporate into the physical master.

2. I also agree that in pools, a fm will only exist when the pool fails and 
there are no deliveries capable of being made (not a single MW flowing).   
This is what we did in UI.  This is what we do in the California pool.  This 
is what we attempt to do in NEPOOL.  I think the EEI fm gets you to the same 
place (nobody could call fm if the pool were making deliveries) but agree 
that the language could be more direct.  With the California product (CAISO 
energy) we expressly modify the EEI fm since there are so many other things 
we also have to fix.  We likely in the future will also modify fm for the 
NEPOOL product but we are still trying to introduce so many other products in 
the US that this is a change for the near future.  In general, fm is unique 
to the product and I believe will change with each product.  When Chris and I 
were talking to OPG we told them that the fm we would be proposing for the 
Ontario product would be just as you stated:  Fm is only possible if the pool 
fails.  Just FYI, the god awful ""Into""product in the US was created by Enron 
for the very reason you stated: we wanted to eliminate fm risk in a non-pool 
market - we did this by obligating the seller to continuously be required to 
change delivery points (and not be allowed to call a fm) within the defined 
control area if for any reason the prescheduled delivery point was 
unavailable.

Harrison called this am at home.  He said that you'all had discussed plans 
for Sat.  Because it's his B-day he wants to go out  - He seemed to suggest 
that you were on board, so I said OK too.  Hope that's OK.  There may be a

I think I could 3:30 (deal may be closing, but unlikely - if it did I might 
have to cancel - I would know by lunch). If you want, we could maybe try 
hitting at the HCC (the Houstonian courts are booked, otherwise we could try 
there) - now that I45 is closed, traffic around the MET during rush hour is 
terrible and I wouldn't want you to get stuck.  If this doesn't work, just 
let me know and we can find another time."

be provided to AA for their MTM review.  Hopefully this will result in a 
favorable review and we can move to close.  Michael, I will contact you 
regarding the timing of when we should hear back from AA.

Attached are the final PPA and GPSA documents.  No change was made to Section 
5.02(g) due to Kevin Presto's discussion with Roger.  Looks like we are going 
to try and get this accepted by AA as is.  I did make change in Section

Rodgers
As we discussed, here is a first effort at a revised TVA offer letter.  I 
drafted the Into TVA Option as a series of calls tied to the MOPA delivery 
term and quantity - not sure if this anything close to what you all had in 
mind.  Please let me know what shape you all think the offer ought to take 
and we can revise accordingly.

		 Subject: Enron Guaranties for Indian Mesa II PPA & GSPA

Attached are clean and blacklined drafts of the Enron guaranties to be made 
in support of EPMI's obligations under the Indian Mesa II Renewable Energy 
Purchase Agreement (""PPA"") and Green  Premium Sharing Agreement (""GSPA"").? 
The guaranty for the PPA is blacklined against the Enron EPC Contract 
guaranty in favor of the banks which was granted in connection with our 
Cabazon Wind Power Project (the project most recently financed by EWC) and 
the GPSA guaranty is blacklined against the PPA guaranty.  As we discussed 
last week, since the Enron guaranties will need to be in a form that will 
acceptable to our project lenders and equity participants, we thought that we 
should start with a form that was used in our last financing and that was 
negotiated by Enron and the banks.  We plan to use the same basic form for 
the Enron guaranty that will be made in favor of EPMI with respect to the 
seller's obligations under the PPA.  We will forward the draft of that 
guaranty to you later today.  Please feel free to give me a call if you have 
any questions concerning the attached guaranties.  Thank you.

Here is a revised draft of the CDWR risk memo.  Events change everyday. This 
morning's paper reports that a rate increase of 40% may be imposed by the 
CDWR as early as today and the new bond issue amount is purported to be 16 
billion (rather than the 10 initially discussed)

		 Subject: Proposed Changes Based on California Energy Shortages

Over the past several months, we have reviewed in detail our trading 
contracts and the companies through which we conduct our trading business in 
California.  In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit 
and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any "" 
future California"", we propose the following changes:

1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All 
Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading 
contracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a 
major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to 
have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best 
advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.

2.     Mandatory Master Netting Agreements For Counterparties With Multiple 
Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have 
multiple masters with a counterparty, a ""bridge"" should be put place between 
the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or 
more masters.

3.     Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.  Merging 
EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient 
from both a credit and legal point of view.

4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event -- 

Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts 
or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes 
will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity 
to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv)substanially improve 
Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range goal is 
conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a single entity 
and a single or limited number standardized agreements.

Hi Carol

I don't know of any available nannies but will keep my ears open.  I used a 
service, Nanny Professionals, and was very pleased with the quality of 
candidates they sent over (our nanny has been w us for over 5 years).

Good luck on your search.

ps - Thanks for playing last week.  I look forward to playing again after 
Thanksgiving."

it onto Lake Street. Look at odometer and 4 miles after you'll come to Elk
Creek Road. (You'll pass into a different county, see West Settlement on
Left.. , Grange Building on right with dairy barn and cows across the street
) Take soft turn onto Elk Creek and round bend over small bridge (vly
creek). we are the first house- second driveway - on the left.. White with
unstained picket fence. The key is for the side door at back. There are two
driveways .. use the second for easy unloading through back.

Our neighbors across the street are Barbara (blonde sister) and Pat
(brunette sister) Dury. (914)254 4360..
Eric Rosen (first driveway on left) 254 4643... ... Stan & Adele Seigel
driveway to right... feel absolutely free to call upon them if you feel the
need.. I'm sure Eric will stop by with his new puppy Clifford.. Karen and
Jim Rauter live on the high road.. (Lake Street extension) 254 4180.. they
have a little boy Julian about Sam's age.. Again please feel free to call
them.. She is the one that has the interesting job with the not for profit
environmental group..

Nearby Attractions : Eric Rosens pond...see his garden too.... Walk down his
driveway until you get to trailer .... garden on right... veer off left past
the trailer into brush and follow path through two fields and see pond on
right.. Good Evening walk to see Great Blue Heron in pond .. His new house..
(I helped design) is on top of the hill....Also Walk up Elk creek Rd.just
watch for fast traffic.. nice views.. walk through little abandoned cemetery
across the Siegels driveway and walk up that hill and through the fields for
nice vistas. Definitely take a bike ride down high road all the way back to
Johnson Farm... In general we feel free to access the creeks through other
peoples property especially if they are not in sight... P.S. the wagon in
the yard is how we get Lucy back to Eric's .. until we go off the road..We
also left our hiking pack if Sam can be carried in it...

Swimming is available at the Pine Hill Lake . .. Go back to Route 28 and
take left go over Pine Hill and see Lake on right.It is a public facility
with life guards and the  ""beach "" looks a little fakey from the road but
the swimming is reallywonderful with a floating dock.. There are some creek
swimming holes but we don't really frequent any though if  you see a bunch
of cars along the road chances are that's one....

In the town of Fleischmanns there is a really nice park with a public
swimming pool, soccer field, tennis courts, basketball courts.. another good
place to hang and play frisbee with the kids...
Other day excursions... Little Pond and Big Pond Recreational areas.. or
hike to Giant Ledge ...see Big Indian turnoff from Route 28 and follow that
road until you come to the first sharp right bend and see parking on
right... Ledge is about 1-1/2 miles... (careful of the edge) a beautiful
vista and a not too strenuous hike.. You can find these places on the maps
of the Park in the Plastic envelope inside the big cluttered mess of a
cabinet in the Living Room .. This is our too busy to put away depository..

For food shopping you should make a pit stop in Boiceville Supermarket on
the left of Route 28 on the way to the house from the thruway.. it is the
cheapest best selection and place to stock for the week. If you arrive on a
Sat. in time to go to the Round barn Farmers Market near Roxbury on Route 30
there are fresh produce and food stands and some times live music in a
wonderful old round barn.. See attached maps....
Also go to Margaretville once you are at house for shopping.... wine store..
cheese store and an A&P... For a special meal stop at the seafood place on
route 28 in Arkville.. He goes to Maine every week for fresh lobster.....

Check out the antiques center in the old theater in Margaretville for good
browsing..
Other towns of interest and beautiful drives... Andes has old hotel with
restaurant and is very pretty.. also has good thrift shop..
Bovina is a beautiful little town with a good cafe style grocery run by
relocated tasteful city folk.. good food!!!

Things about the house.... Unfortunately we have developed a knocking in our
pipes in the bathroom.. don't be alarmed.. just adjust the controls to help
get rid of it..... Also more importantly we donot use the water for cooking
or drinking as it is hard-not so good tasting and has a high salt content-
We use the nearby spring to fill the jugs at the foot of the steps in the
basement.. The Spring is located on the ""high road"" going back towards
Fleischmanns you pass West Settlement where honey stand is.. go over little
bridge then see meadow on left go past this meadow about 100 yards until you
see a stand of tall pine trees on left and there is a wide shoulder on the
left side of the road ... look for the spring on the right side of the road
across from the pine stand.... It is delicious water... The house water is
just fine for bathing and rinsing food...
Also make sure the shower curtains stay closed while you are showering as
the water can escape out the back if you don't close them... Another thing
if there is alot of rain the water will get a brownish tint to it.. If it
gets really bad and you don't want to use it to bathe you can go to the
public
showers at Pine Hill Lake or even ask Barbara across the street if you could
borrow hers...  We have actually gotten an estimate to upgrade the whole
system so if the guy calls while you are there tell him we will contact him
when we return... For clothes washing there is a Laundermat in Margaretville
where you can play frisbee in the field behind the place or go fishing in
the creek while you wait..P.S. My rod is in the basement and the reel is on
top of the Fridge....

Well I think that's the most of it.. I'll call you from Block Island with
our number there. In the case of Emergency call Eric or Barbara or 911...our
fire number is posted on the mailbox... Eric Rosen works at the Cafe on Main
Street in Margaretville in the evenings... (there is a hospital emergency
room on route 28 in Margatretville) If you need to see a doctor for some
reason call Karen to get the name of her pediatrician...
otherwise Dr. Marguerite Collins may be able to help .. she has an excellent
rep.


Have Fun and can't wait to see you !!"

PS - Chris, I agree with your  comment re the EEI copyright  and references - 
I'm not sure what the right answer is - do you want to continue calling it 
an""""EEI Canada""?  Is that OK with EEI? Do you think we should rename it in 
the name of the organization that ""approves"" it?  Is that OK w EEI?  Maybe 
you should discuss at meeting and then we can discuss with Andy from EEI to 
get EEI's approval/consent."

turn the document around in advance of our call with Gayle McKenzie at Morgan 
Lewis which is confirmed w/ her and has been set up for  2pm Houston time on 
Tuesday. 

If you need to reach me - please call Jan King on (503) 464-8814 or my direct

		 Subject: Draft PG&E Letter



PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

Elizabeth:

Attached is draft of the termination payment letter with a few suggested 
changes, but nothing major.  I tried to include a blackline, but it seemed to 
get corrupted so I don't know if it will be of much use to you. A few notes:

(1)  I did not have the various contracts with me when I reviewed this, but I 
have asked Jim if he could make sure I did not make any inaccurate statements 
as well as input the few contract section references that are open and the 
information on the Canadian termination.  (However, I was not sure whether 
you wanted Peter Keohane to input the relevant information on the Canadian 
side.).

(2)  In light of PG&E's letter to us, I thought we may want to make some 
short statements about the affiliate set off rights under the Bankruptcy Code 
in the termination letter.

(3)  I modified some of the language on the CalPX liabilities.  I didn't have 
my exposure sheet with me, but I thought I recall that we were both owed 
money from the CalPX  and that we had some risk on the chargeback liability 
depending on how FERC ultimately comes out on the issue.  As you know, the 
FERC decision about 3 weeks ago prohibited the CalPX from proceeding with the 
chargeback ""under these circumstances"" or some type of language like this, 
but it seemed to have punted the final resolution of the issue until at least 
the commandeered contract valuation issue had been resolved--thus, although 
perhaps not likely, it seemed to me at the time that FERC gave itself an 
opening to reconsider the chargeback issue after the valuation determination 
had been made.

(4)  While I bracketed the language, I thought we may want to affirmatively 
and briefly set forth the business reason why EPMI is holding the direct 
access claim to at least give them something to think about.  As we have 
discussed, PG&E's likely reaction will be that we are using unsupportable 
self help to not pay them anything on the termination of the 3 power 
confirmations by claiming a set off for the negative CTCs.  To the extent we 
can articulate a short business rationale for EPMI having that claim, it may 
at least make them pause as to whether our business rationale arguably could 
prevail.

(5)  We note in the letter certain claims we have against PG&E that we are 
not setting off--e.g., the ISDA termination payment.  We also reference the 
claims held by EPMI through the CalPX, even though we are not ""terminating"" 
any ""contracts"" in that respect.  I assume that we do not want to reference 
in the letter the claims held by Portland General which ""route"" through the 
CalPX and the ISO, even though we are not claiming rights of offset for 
those.  PG&E will be put on notice of those when we put in Portland's claims 
as part of our proof of claim with the bankruptcy court.

 I'll plan on getting together with you to review this tomorrow afternoon.  
Lastly, I have not read the decision yet, but I saw that the DC Circuit 
upheld FERC in all respects in the PCA case so since our contracts do not 
have to be on file, they can be terminated without waiting for the 60 day 
period to expire.  That should reduce another potential challenge to the 
power contract termination.

Thanks.

John

At the last EEI meeting there was a strong interest in beefing up the 
collateral provisions of the EEI (what a great idea).  Bill McCoy at Morgan 
Stanley was asked to prepare the first draft, a copy of which I am forwarding 
to you for your review. Please review and let either Shari or I know if you 
have any comments or thoughts - while EEI's message does not indicate when 
comments are due ( I have a call into EEI but have not yet heard back), I 
have asked Shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch 
with EEI within the next week or so.  Thanks for your input.

Andy,  As discussed, heer is MSDW's proposal for a draft version of a
Collateral Annex that can be used in connection with the EEI Agreement
(it would be advisable for a clause to be included in the EEI cover
sheet incorporating the collateral annex by reference).  We are offering
this draft as a starting point for the industry's efforts to develop an
EEI Collateral Annex.  Please feel free to distribute it and let Ed or
me know if you would like to have a conference call with others to
determine the next steps in getting feedback.  Bill McCoy

Hi

We are so bad - we suddenly woke up and realized that Friday is December 
1st.  That means Saturday is the 2nd - Sam's birthday.  SO I'm writing 
invitations now.  Here it is: 

Can Eleanor and Alice join us on Saturday for a train party at the zoo?  
Around 10:00?  We would love to have you all come too, or not, if you prefer 
to  ..... shop.

PS Hope your holidays were, well, a holiday."

Thanks for your message

Mike Small is definitely a better tennis player than WSPP facilitator.  
Coaching seems to be his real passion.

I'm sorry I  can't play Saturday am - it is Sam's 3rd birthday and we are 
scrambling to find a birthday concept.

On a better note, I can play all this week. Any day, any time works for me - 
let me know when you can.

Talk to you soon."

Liz-
We areleaving for Block Island on Monday and I wanted to get you some info.
for your trip.
I am forwarding by Fed Ex tonight keys for the apt. and for the house.

NYC Address: 156 First Avenue between 9th and 10th Street Buzzer # 21 Ground
floor apartment on right back ..
Good Breakfast place for Family is the KKK on first Avenue between 12th and
13th St... or is it 11th and 12th.. LOOK on right side as you go up the
avenue.. cheap and good with garden in the back......
Directions to house from NYC:

Take the West Side Highway in Manhattan to the G.W. bridge. Go to upper
level of bridge and stay in right side lane. ..take first right hand exit
after going over the bridge onto the Palisades ParkwayNorth. Stay on
Palisades until you see exit (9??)for Route 287 North to Albany (to New York
State Thruway) on right. Go North on thruway to Exit 19 Kingston. ( about an
hour ). Once through the toll, stay on the right and merge onto the traffic
circle taking first right exit to Route 28 Pine Hill. Take Route 28 all the
way to Fleischmanns Exit (about 50 minutes ....You'll go past Olive ,
Boiceville , Shandanken, Phoenicia, Pine Hill). Take exit and round bend
into town.
Look for first and only gas station on right and take right turn just before
it onto Lake Street. Look at odometer and 4 miles after you'll come to Elk
Creek Road. (You'll pass into a different county, see West Settlement on
Left.. , Grange Building on right with dairy barn and cows across the street
) Take soft turn onto Elk Creek and round bend over small bridge (vly
creek). we are the first house- second driveway - on the left.. White with
unstained picket fence. The key is for the side door at back. There are two
driveways .. use the second for easy unloading through back.

Our neighbors across the street are Barbara (blonde sister) and Pat
(brunette sister) Dury. (914)254 4360..
Eric Rosen (first driveway on left) 254 4643... ... Stan & Adele Seigel
driveway to right... feel absolutely free to call upon them if you feel the
need.. I'm sure Eric will stop by with his new puppy Clifford.. Karen and
Jim Rauter live on the high road.. (Lake Street extension) 254 4180.. they
have a little boy Julian about Sam's age.. Again please feel free to call
them.. She is the one that has the interesting job with the not for profit
environmental group..

Nearby Attractions : Eric Rosens pond...see his garden too.... Walk down his
driveway until you get to trailer .... garden on right... veer off left past
the trailer into brush and follow path through two fields and see pond on
right.. Good Evening walk to see Great Blue Heron in pond .. His new house..
(I helped design) is on top of the hill....Also Walk up Elk creek Rd.just
watch for fast traffic.. nice views.. walk through little abandoned cemetery
across the Siegels driveway and walk up that hill and through the fields for
nice vistas. Definitely take a bike ride down high road all the way back to
Johnson Farm... In general we feel free to access the creeks through other
peoples property especially if they are not in sight... P.S. the wagon in
the yard is how we get Lucy back to Eric's .. until we go off the road..We
also left our hiking pack if Sam can be carried in it...

Swimming is available at the Pine Hill Lake . .. Go back to Route 28 and
take left go over Pine Hill and see Lake on right.It is a public facility
with life guards and the  ""beach "" looks a little fakey from the road but
the swimming is reallywonderful with a floating dock.. There are some creek
swimming holes but we don't really frequent any though if  you see a bunch
of cars along the road chances are that's one....

In the town of Fleischmanns there is a really nice park with a public
swimming pool, soccer field, tennis courts, basketball courts.. another good
place to hang and play frisbee with the kids...
Other day excursions... Little Pond and Big Pond Recreational areas.. or
hike to Giant Ledge ...see Big Indian turnoff from Route 28 and follow that
road until you come to the first sharp right bend and see parking on
right... Ledge is about 1-1/2 miles... (careful of the edge) a beautiful
vista and a not too strenuous hike.. You can find these places on the maps
of the Park in the Plastic envelope inside the big cluttered mess of a
cabinet in the Living Room .. This is our too busy to put away depository..

For food shopping you should make a pit stop in Boiceville Supermarket on
the left of Route 28 on the way to the house from the thruway.. it is the
cheapest best selection and place to stock for the week. If you arrive on a
Sat. in time to go to the Round barn Farmers Market near Roxbury on Route 30
there are fresh produce and food stands and some times live music in a
wonderful old round barn.. See attached maps....
Also go to Margaretville once you are at house for shopping.... wine store..
cheese store and an A&P... For a special meal stop at the seafood place on
route 28 in Arkville.. He goes to Maine every week for fresh lobster.....

Check out the antiques center in the old theater in Margaretville for good
browsing..
Other towns of interest and beautiful drives... Andes has old hotel with
restaurant and is very pretty.. also has good thrift shop..
Bovina is a beautiful little town with a good cafe style grocery run by
relocated tasteful city folk.. good food!!!

Things about the house.... Unfortunately we have developed a knocking in our
pipes in the bathroom.. don't be alarmed.. just adjust the controls to help
get rid of it..... Also more importantly we donot use the water for cooking
or drinking as it is hard-not so good tasting and has a high salt content-
We use the nearby spring to fill the jugs at the foot of the steps in the
basement.. The Spring is located on the ""high road"" going back towards
Fleischmanns you pass West Settlement where honey stand is.. go over little
bridge then see meadow on left go past this meadow about 100 yards until you
see a stand of tall pine trees on left and there is a wide shoulder on the
left side of the road ... look for the spring on the right side of the road
across from the pine stand.... It is delicious water... The house water is
just fine for bathing and rinsing food...
Also make sure the shower curtains stay closed while you are showering as
the water can escape out the back if you don't close them... Another thing
if there is alot of rain the water will get a brownish tint to it.. If it
gets really bad and you don't want to use it to bathe you can go to the
public
showers at Pine Hill Lake or even ask Barbara across the street if you could
borrow hers...  We have actually gotten an estimate to upgrade the whole
system so if the guy calls while you are there tell him we will contact him
when we return... For clothes washing there is a Laundermat in Margaretville
where you can play frisbee in the field behind the place or go fishing in
the creek while you wait..P.S. My rod is in the basement and the reel is on
top of the Fridge....

Well I think that's the most of it.. I'll call you from Block Island with
our number there. In the case of Emergency call Eric or Barbara or 911...our
fire number is posted on the mailbox... Eric Rosen works at the Cafe on Main
Street in Margaretville in the evenings... (there is a hospital emergency
room on route 28 in Margatretville) If you need to see a doctor for some
reason call Karen to get the name of her pediatrician...
otherwise Dr. Marguerite Collins may be able to help .. she has an excellent
rep.


Have Fun and can't wait to see you !!"

I think the wedding is on for the 23rd.  My mom wants us to stay at a hotel 
while in DC.  I think Bob would likely want us to stay in DC for Christmas 
Day since Chi will be on honeymoon, but I am not real sure on this.  Bob is 
out in OK over New Year's and I will need to go back up the following weekend 
to stay with Mom while Bob is out.  What do you think.

PS My mom is chain smoking - she bought a cartoon of cigarettes with Chi.  
Chi thinks we should just let her make her own choices.  What do you think.

would like to schedule time with you and Mark T to think through how we 
should approach the creation/adoption of a single contract for 
physical/financial(maybe) trading.

Elizabeth:

ISDA is holding an Energy conference on March 6th, 2001 at The Four Seasons
Hotel in Houston.  We would be delighted to have you speak again on the same
issues you discussed at our North American Energy and Developing Products
Committee meeting last October at The Regency Hyatt.

Please find attached a DRAFT agenda for the morning discussion for your
information.  I am in the process of finalizing the agenda and would
appreciate advice on selecting bullet points to describe briefly the
discussion on the Comparison of Master Agreements used in North America and
Europe.  I have allowed 45 minutes for the discussion (12:15 PM - 1:00 PM).
In addition, we would welcome any suggestions you may have on inviting an
ISDA member from a another company to help you discuss topic.

 <<elizabeth sager.doc>>

I will call you soon to discuss.

Thanks and regards,
Liz

I think it looks great - my only thought really is on the middle section 
relating to cleaning laying out the elements of negligence and a statement of 
the standard to be applied  - I quickly revised your section to give you an 
idea of what I was thinking.  In any event I think you are absolutely on the 
right track.  Good luck and let me know what else I can do.

Lawsuit Filed In San Diego Vs Enron For Power Mkt Abuses

11/29/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A second lawsuit is being filed in San Diego 
Superior Court Wednesday against Enron alleging the company, and others, 
overcharged California consumers more than $4 billion for electricity 
service. 
On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy 
Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO), 
AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy. Both lawsuits are seeking class 
action status and may be consolidated into one complaint. 
The complaints allege unfair trade practices and illegal trust activity. A 
news conference announcing the details of the lawsuit will be held Wednesday 
morning in San Diego.
Enron does not own or operate major generating units in the state, but is 
active in trading electricity here and securing long-term fixed rate 
contracts for large industrial customers. At times, Enron sells power back 
into the California Power Exchange, the market where power is bought and sold 
in the state. 
An Enron representative said he has not yet seen the lawsuit and was unable 
to comment. 
The lawsuits claim Enron and the other energy companies withheld power supply 
last summer, created shortages by selling power out of state and used 
real-time confidential data about power plant activity to drive up prices. 
The lawsuits are an attempt to force generators to refund about $4 billion 
for electricity, the amount consumers were allegedly overcharged. -By Jason

FYI. This is a pretty paper on legal/risk aspects of power trading. I think 
it would help in training future lawyers/staff.

Dear Jane,

Further to our discussions on Friday, I attach a copy of the Energy Trading
Paper prepared by our Washington office.

The paper is relevant to what we are focussing on now with EPSA, and 
discusses:
what is happening in the US and English markets, the legal issues in merchant
power sale contracts, the EEI agreement (on which Enron's EPSA is largely 
based,
or was it vice versa), and compliance issues.

A few of points I found particularly interesting:

* The way in which many of the risks are born seems to be reasonably
settled in the US market/EEI form.  The issue is to what extent Japan
will/should follow the same allocation, on which subject the Enron EPSA seems 
to
be setting the pace, at least for the moment.

* We cannot discount the danger that some of the counterparties in Japan
will in fact become insolvent or choose not to perform.  We have attempted to
cover this in EPSA.

* The treatment of force majeure, particularly non-performance by the
back-to-back supplier/customer, will need more attention as specific fact
situations arise.

* The need for a commercial/legal response system to be in place to
immediately address any failures.

I hope you find the paper useful and, as discussed, I rely on you to 
distribute
it to other persons within Enron who are likely to be interested.

Best regards

Paul Davis

Hi

Sorry to hear about being SICK - the only good there is re-experiencing the 
pure joy of being merely healthy.  After that nothing bad matters.  Would 
love to see you sometime - maybe next week lunch?  The Heights is still grand 
... too me.  Come by or call anytime.  Address  822 Columbia (on Columbia 
between 8th and 9th) Phne 713 8644023.

See ya

Here is another Tolling that Stuart did and reviewed when we were thinking of 
taking back a PPA (in this case we were supplying gas and taking electricity, 
so your deal does not have the same perspective) when we sold the plants - 
this deal never happened and was very convoluted because of lease accounting 
issues. Anyway it may be helpful on your toll.

Elizabeth:

ISDA is holding an Energy conference on March 6th, 2001 at The Four Seasons
Hotel in Houston.  We would be delighted to have you speak again on the same
issues you discussed at our North American Energy and Developing Products
Committee meeting last October at The Regency Hyatt.

Please find attached a DRAFT agenda for the morning discussion for your
information.  I am in the process of finalizing the agenda and would
appreciate advice on selecting bullet points to describe briefly the
discussion on the Comparison of Master Agreements used in North America and
Europe.  I have allowed 45 minutes for the discussion (12:15 PM - 1:00 PM).
In addition, we would welcome any suggestions you may have on inviting an
ISDA member from a another company to help you discuss topic.

 <<elizabeth sager.doc>>

I will call you soon to discuss.

Thanks and regards,
Liz

Hi Charlotte

Hope you had a good trip last week.  Work has been horrendous - power and gas 
prices are decimating my free time - hope EES commercial is not suffering the 
same onslaught.

When would be a good time to play (Dan keeps reminding me to finish up the 
tournament) This week looks bad, but I maybe could play this weekend (less 
preferable) or Monday, Tuesday (need to get baby-sitting but likely doable) 
or Wed next week.  Let me know what works for you.

See ya

So far, Ella has been pretty immune to Barbie (Sam on the other hand is 
fascinated - his doctor chastised him for staring  in the Dr office) - she 
wants an angel puppet, a doll and a car for xmas.  If she asked I would 
likely give her some barbiesque items  for the reasons you stated (she's 
going to get them from somebody someday). "

Hope all well (despite the press).

Hi Shari

I need help as well from JS on those two issues.  On the LDC supply we need 
to understand the relationship between SD Warren, the LDC and NEPOOL - f/m 
and supply obligation will be impacted but I don't know how until we 
discuss.  Also need to understand the possible penalties from taking from 
LDC.  CMS assignment of load I also need to understand - I think it relates 
to getting the necessary NEPOOL credit but? .. I put a call into JS"

EPMI is entering into more and more transactions that are settled against a 
floating, published index price.  Our physical contract does not currently 
provide for what happens if the published source is not available or is 
otherwise materially changed. Under ISDA for financial trading,  this is 
addressed as a Market Disruption Event (MDE).  Under ENA's standard contract 
for financial trading, there is included as a MDE ""the imposition of trading 
limits on the range within which the price of the commodity may fluctuate"".  
What this may mean is that if a cap is imposed on power prices, then in lieu 
of using the capped price to determine the floating price, you would be 
required (under ISDA) to eventually get brokers to determine what the price 
would have been without the cap.

I want to add language to our physical contracts that addresses material 
changes/disappearance of the published prices that would mirror the financial 
trading terms and doubt whether we would want to make the imposition of a cap 
on power prices a MDE.  If you treat the imposition of a cap (say in CA of 
prices to $500 or in NEPOOL to $1,000) as a MDE, then we would be required to 
secure quotes as to what the price would have been without the cap each time 
that a pricing date trades at the cap level.   This only seems fraught with 
litigation risk to me.  Alternatively, if caps are not deemed a MDE, then you 
would always settle against the published prices, even if they are 
""artificially"" determined after the trade was entered into.  While caps are 
not appealing, I think it would be better to not have the imposition of caps 
be considered a MDE.  I have spoken with the financial trading group and they 
will follow our lead on this.  So, depending upon what you both think, we 
will make sure that financial and physical power are treated the same on this 
issue.  

Thanks for your thoughts."

Janice,

Another high priority deal.  The attached proposal is for Western Resources 
in order to cover a short position we have in SPP.  Noone will sell us FLD so 
we are agreeing to a system firm deal with one catch.  Western Resources will 
put in reserve 20-25% of the total deal value in an account.  They will then 
reimburse us  up to the amount in reserve, if they cut us.  I have tried to 
lay out as muck detail in the attachment as possible.  This deal would need 
to be closed by Jan 1.  Let me know if we need to meet on this and I will get 
someone from the desk to come along.  I will call you to follow up on this.  
Thanks.

-Joe

Calling brokers to find out what prices would have been is an impossible

Calif. utilities risk imminent default, S&P warns
(UPDATE: Recasts, adds details, background. Adds byline)

By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern =
California Edison are at grave risk of default and bankruptcy within =
weeks, and are likely to see their high credit ratings fall to low junk =
grades if they do not get regulatory help by Friday, credit rating agency =
Standard & Poor's said on Wednesday.

``S&P is prepared to take dramatic rating action,'' said Richard Cortright,=
 an S&P analyst, in a conference call. ``The ratings are expected to drop =
deeply into speculative grade to reflect the likelihood of imminent =
default.''

The agency assessed the situation as the California Public Utilities =
Commission prepared to meet Thursday to consider whether to allow Pacific =
G&E and Southern California Edison to pass on at least some of their =
skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs to consumers.

Shares of PG&E Corp.(NYSE:PCG - news), the parent of Pacific G&E, closed =
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $20-15/16, down $1-7/16, or =
6.42 percent. Shares of Edison International (NYSE:EIX - news), the parent =
of Southern California Edison, closed at $17-7/8, down $1-1/8, or 5.92 =
percent.

The utilities operate under a rate freeze through March 2002, and are also =
unable to negotiate long-term supply contracts. These factors expose them =
to the vagaries of the volatile spot power market.

Wholesale power recently cost more than $1,400 per megawatt hour, a more =
than 40-fold increase over the $35 per megawatt hour rate last year.

California imposed the rate freeze as part of its deregulation of the =
utilities sector, which was intended to promote competition and consumer =
choice.

Among the options the commission has to remedy the situation are a hike in =
the utilities' price caps.

Even that, however, would constitute a ``band-aid on a bullet wound,'' =
said Ron Barone, who leads S&P's utility group and also participated in =
the conference call.

Californians have already been warned to cut back their energy use, and =
that they may be subject to rolling blackouts.

Cortright said unless the commission offers the utilities significant =
regulatory relief, Pacific G&E and Southern California Edison will be =
dependent on the capital markets for cash infusions, if any are available.

``There are bills that are coming due in January and February,'' he said. =
``We would be naive to think that the capital markets are going to open =
their doors to satisfy (their needs) in the current environment.''

``To be frank,'' he added, ``we are amazed that events have been permitted =
to reach anywhere near this critical stage. It truly is unfathomable. We =
really do need some emergency actions taken now.''

Pacific G&E last completed a big bond sale in October, selling $1.35 =
billion of bonds. Southern California Edison and its parent, Edison =
International, sold an equivalent amount in early November.

Both companies carry ``A-plus'' corporate credit ratings and ``single-A'' =
senior unsecured debt ratings. Pacific G&E's secured debt carries an =
``AA-minus'' rating. Those ratings are considered mid to high investment =
grades.

One trader said Southern California Edison's debt began on Tuesday being =
quoted by price, like junk bonds, instead of by the extra yield they offer =
relative to similar maturity U.S. Treasuries, like investment-grade bonds.

Its 5.875 percent notes maturing in September 2004 were quoted Wednesday =
at about 87 cents on the dollar, yielding about 11.3 percent to maturity. =
No price quotation was immediately available on Pacific G&E's debt.=20

We are fine with Nolan's changes.

Please note one additional change: Exhibit B, Item 1, the ""Confirmation
Number"" should be corrected to read 403862.

To complete this transaction, the following needs to happen:

1.Enron needs to sign off on our's and Avista's changes and add the correct
references in the second to last ""WHEREAS"".

2.Enron and PGET (Dan Sarti) need to finalize the Enron payment amount under
Section 7.

3.PGET (Dan Sarti) needs to provide our wiring instructions for Section 7.

4.Avista needs to provide its wiring instructions for Section 8.

I will be checking voice mails and, later this afternoon, will check
e-mails, should you have any questions.

We have received a copy of PG&E's comments.  For the most part, we accept
the language.  Only two small modifications:

Change #1: Page 2....second full paragraph.  Replace the word ""refund"" with
""return.""

Change #2: Page 6...last paragraph.  After PGET's wording (which is okay
with us), insert the following: ""The return of AVISTA Collateral by PGET to
AVISTA shall be deemed to be a condition precedent to the consent of AVISTA
herein.""


Other than that....we're okay with all other language.  I'd be interested in
seeing Enron's comments to PGET's version, as well as this revised version
by Avista.

		 Subject: FW: footnnote each item under Exhibit B



REGARDING THE SETTLEMENT, ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT

Tracy Ngo correctly pointed out volumetric ambiguities on the two original
confirmations between Avista Energy and PG&E Energy Trading.

Let me summarize below:

(1) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 404335 showed Total Volume
of 982,400 MWh's.  PG&E revised the Total Volume to 981,600 MWh.  Avista did
not respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.  Our records show
that the original volume of 982,400 is correct (there was a leap-year day in
year 2000).  The broker confirm and the PG&E revision seem to be both in
error.  Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy and
Enron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh's.  Since this
Assignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommends
language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email from
Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&E and
Enron? Please advise.

(2) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 403862 showed a Total
Volume of 14,400.  PG&E accepted the confirm ""as is.""  The broker
confirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh's.  Therefore, both
PG&E and AVISTA screwed up.  HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh's
should correctly be as per the broker confirmation.  Again, our counsel
recommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see
email from Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to
PG&E and Enron?  Please advise.


To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enron
and Avista.  Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron's
confirm's prevail).  Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.  We
would like to see those confirms in advance if possible.

Lastly, time is of the essense.  We are scheduling power already for January
deliveries....therefore, we must act quickly on this assignment so as to
prevent any problems with scheduling, etc.  I suppose that we could delay
the start dates to February 1st, 2001 if necessary.  Perhaps not a big
issue.

REGARDING THE SETTLEMENT, ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT

Tracy Ngo correctly pointed out volumetric ambiguities on the two original
confirmations between Avista Energy and PG&E Energy Trading.

Let me summarize below:

(1) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 404335 showed Total Volume
of 982,400 MWh's.  PG&E revised the Total Volume to 981,600 MWh.  Avista did
not respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.  Our records show
that the original volume of 982,400 is correct (there was a leap-year day in
year 2000).  The broker confirm and the PG&E revision seem to be both in
error.  Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy and
Enron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh's.  Since this
Assignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommends
language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email from
Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&E and
Enron? Please advise.

(2) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 403862 showed a Total
Volume of 14,400.  PG&E accepted the confirm ""as is.""  The broker
confirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh's.  Therefore, both
PG&E and AVISTA screwed up.  HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh's
should correctly be as per the broker confirmation.  Again, our counsel
recommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see
email from Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to
PG&E and Enron?  Please advise.


To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enron
and Avista.  Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron's
confirm's prevail).  Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.  We
would like to see those confirms in advance if possible.

Lastly, time is of the essense.  We are scheduling power already for January
deliveries....therefore, we must act quickly on this assignment so as to
prevent any problems with scheduling, etc.  I suppose that we could delay
the start dates to February 1st, 2001 if necessary.  Perhaps not a big
issue.

Thanks,
Nolan Steiner

FYI - Here are copies of the final documents for the PGET/Avista transaction 
that are being sent out for signature tonight.  Thanks for everybody's help 
in getting this done.  I will be out tomorrow but can be reached at home 713 
853 6349 or on my cell phone 713 854 5747 and will be checking messages.   
Travis and Tracy will assist in gathering all the fax signatures and refaxing 
to all parties.

Remember - EPMI is required to wire the payment to PGET ($115,714.50) and WE 
NEED TO GET WIRE INFORMATION FROM PGET.  Also PGET must release cash 
collateral to Avista - we should follow up to make sure this happens.

Thanks again.

Dear Chris, 

As discussed with my colleague Tracy Ngo, attached please find a draft 
agreement which would cover the proposed arrangement between EPMI, MEGA and 
PGET. It is in a form acceptable to both PGET and EPMI. If the arrangement is 
to go ahead, please give me any comments from your attorneys ASAP.  Also, if 
it goes ahead, we will need to know the details of the master agreement 
between MEGA and PGET, and receive a copy of the relevant transaction 
confirmation. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. 

Sincerely,

$0.4 mm).  Please note that the report now shows the max exposure to PG&E 
across all EES Gas portfolios.



Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Monica

fyi - we have right to terminate EEMC power positions assumed by EPMI and 
have been letting them know that we might exercise this termination right if  
they don't help us on the collateral issues.

Lisa and Bill:

Despite all of our hard work, 5 pm central is 45 minutes away.  We would
like the forbearance letter extended.  I repeat our request for an
""evergreen"" forbearane (i.e., forbearance continues in effect, subject to
termination on one days notice), but in any event need a sufficient number
of days to keep the momentum going forward.  Please confirm by return e-mail
your response, with faxed copies of reissued letters to follow immediately.

With respect to the Netting Agreement, I am reviewing, and need to talk to
Lisa.

Per my voice mail, in addition to other changes we are discussing, I would
like to modify PG&E Affiliate and Enron Afiliate to mean affiliates who are
party to an Underlying Master Agreement, and expressly recognize that PG&E
Gas Transmission, Northwest Corporation is not a PG&E Affiliate.  These
additions are shown blacklined in the first attachment to this e-mail.
Also,
add to signature block of the Netting Agreement and to the coverage of the

FYI - Here are copies of the final documents for the PGET/Avista transaction 
that are being sent out for signature tonight.  Thanks for everybody's help 
in getting this done.  I will be out tomorrow but can be reached at home 713 
853 6349 or on my cell phone 713 854 5747 and will be checking messages.   
Travis and Tracy will assist in gathering all the fax signatures and refaxing 
to all parties.

Remember - EPMI is required to wire the payment to PGET ($115,714.50) and WE 
NEED TO GET WIRE INFORMATION FROM PGET.  Also PGET must release cash 
collateral to Avista - we should follow up to make sure this happens.

Thanks again.

We've been doing some work for EBS, which has been very interesting.

     We have a client that is interested in trading SO2 and NOX allowances

you guys.  I would appreciate it if you would send me copies of the agreements
you use so I can forward them to our client.  Thanks.

		 Subject: ENRONform termination letter.WPD


  Dear Elizabeth,

Please find attached the draft form termination letter, coupled with a Notice 
of Settlement Amount, that you requested.  Please note that we recommend that 
these form letters be used merely as guides as the contracts that Enron has 
entered into with the PG&E entities all provide for varying procedures for 
termination.  Therefore, each contract should be referenced prior to sending 
out a termination letter.

Additionally, Jim Huemoeller and I believe that it would be best that one 
person be responsible for preparing the various terminations, or in the 
alternative, have such person review each termination letter so that there is 
consistent wording and so that the Enron and LeBoeuf persons responsible for 
monitoring the PG&E situation are certain which contracts are being 
terminated.

Please let us know if you have any questions, or if we can be of further 
assistance.

Best regards,

Christina L.C. McDonald

Please find attached the latest version of the PG&E Summary. We believe all 
of the technical bugs have been kicked out of the document. However, you will 
still need an extra-memory capacity printer in order to print. Please let me

Woody has asked that we do whatever is needed to put good paper in place with 
the following counterparties so that his deal flow in NE can be done a bit 
more smoothly.
New Brunswick Power
Green Mountain Power
Central Vermont PUblic Service Company
Northeast Utilities (agent for CP&L, Western Mass, etc.)
Bangor Hydroelectric Company

As you know, I've already gotten some of the wheels rolling on these 
counterparties, but the work isn't finished yet on any of them.  And Green 
Mountain just filed a new tariff.  Is this something that I could ask Marcus 
to work on with me?  (I understand from Genia that he's now in our group and 
is looking for work.)  Thanks.

Regards,
Janice

Subject: California sues PG&E over its reorganization

The California AG and PUC have petitioned FERC to vacate its order approving 
PG&E's recent reorganization.  Obviously by this reorganization, PG&E is 
attempting to shield its assets in the event of a bankruptcy.  I'm wondering 
if we should become active in this case, to protect our interests in the 
event of a bankruptcy.

		 Subject: Draft DASH for CMP Standard Offer Deal

John, thanks for the update. I sat down with John Lavorato and Dana Davis 
this morning to review the deal and get John's approval under the current 
terms. He has approved the deal in it's current form however, to the extent 
that we have any material change in the terms I'll need to be sure he's OK 
with the changes in advance of any binding committment with Central Maine. 
This is definitely a deal we want to do and given the anticipated 
acceleration in the negotiations and possible execution, we need to be sure 
that we're able to react and transact quickly. Dana Davis is obviously on 
point for all pricing. For all others who have involvement here - please 
ensure that you're on board with your piece of the deal as is, and available 
to focus on any negotiated changes that may come up over the next couple of 
days. Berney Aucoin will be on point for coordinating and managing all 
internal pricing, approvals, etc., so be sure that Bernie can get ahold of 
you if he needs to.  

Also, for the DASH signatures, why don't you move both Kevin and I to 
""Regional Management"" and let Ader and Davis sign for Origination and 
Trading. 

Thanks and good luck!

Subject: Draft DASH for CMP Standard Offer Deal

All:

As some of you may be aware, we are in the process of negotiating with 
Central Maine Power Company regarding the assumption of a portion of their 
wholesale obligations associated with their Standard Offer Service load in 
the State of Maine, covering at least March 1, 2001 - Feb 28, 2002.   We are 
currently in the process of negotiating a contract and transaction terms.  
They are simultaneously discussing same with other suppliers.  At this point, 
there are a number of outstanding items (including numerous contract items 
and credit arrangements).  However, we expect that the pace of the 
negotiation process will be very quick over the next 1-3 days.   As an 
example of how quickly things might move, CMP has indicated that the Maine 
PUC is poised to hold deliberations and approve CMP's signing of a contract 
within 24 hours of CMP/Enron agreement on contract terms (with updated firm 
pricing to be supplied just prior to PUC deliberations and held open for 
about 2-3 hours).

Key members of our negotiating team on this deal are as follows:

Origination/Marketing:  John Llodra, George Wood
Legal:  Janice Moore
Regulatory/Governmental:  Daniel Allegretti
Commodity Structuring:  Jim Meyn, Zach Sampson
Credit:  Edward Sacks, Tracy Ngo

Attached below is a draft of the DASH for this prospective deal.  Items 
subject to change or still under negotiation are noted.   While this DASH is 
prepared assuming we obtain a multi-year extension swaption, there is a 
chance it may end up being a single year deal for the period Mar 1, 01- Feb 
28, 02.   My intent in sending the DASH at this time is to familiarize you 
all with the aspects of the deal at this point in time, to enable us to move 
quickly to get internal approvals in the event we reach final agreement with 
CMP over the next couple of days.  Once agreement is reached with CMP on 
outstanding items, a revised DASH will be circulated.  Please feel free to 
call me at 978-449-9936, or Jim Meyn/Berney Aucoin in structuring (5-3223, 
3-4784) if you have any questions on the commercial structure or valuation to 
date.  Thanks.

Regards
John

I have attached ready-to-file drafts of the letters necessary to terminate 
EPMI's Participation Agreement with the CalPX.  In addition to the letter to 
the CalPX, I am reasonably certain that a FERC filing is required to 
terminate the Participation Agreement because it is a power purchase/sale 
agreement, the form of which is on file with FERC.  Just to be safe I 
prepared the transmittal letter, notice of termination, and notice of filing 
necessary to file with FERC.  Among other things, I requested waiver of the 
60-day notice period.

I'll wait for further instruction before doing anything else on this matter.

Subject: State Restructuring: CA PUC Adopts DWR Regulations,
Re-Regulates Utility Generation


California PUC Adopts DWR Regulations, Re-Regulates Utility Generation
DWR power to go only to SCE and PG&E customers, for now
Obligates SCE and PG&E to make DWR whole for its unrecovered costs
Re-regulates all generation retained by the 3 IOUs
Each to file cost-based rates
Rate base to be net depreciated book value, less recovered stranded costs
The California PUC adopted emergency regulations for the delivery and
payment mechanisms the state*s Department of Water Resources (DWR) will use
in fulfilling its electric purchase and sale obligations under emergency
bill AB 1X.  Under the provisions of AB 1X, which the PUC apparently had
confidence would be enacted without significant change, the PUC requires the
DWR to sell the power it purchases directly to the retail end use customers
of Southern California Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E).
Since the law requires the PUC to ensure that DWR recovers all of the costs
of its power purchase program and yet also limits the recovery to only an
allocable portion of the utilities* currently frozen energy charges, the PUC
recognizes the possibility that DWR*s costs may not be fully recovered at
certain times.  The PUC makes SCE and PG&E liable to pay any shortfalls to
ensure DWR recovers its costs on as current a basis as possible, but
suggests it is open to further consideration of this policy.
URG Assets Re-Regulated
The PUC orders the three utilities to each make *Advice Letter* filings to
establish cost-based rates for their URG.  The rate set will be made
retroactive to whenever the utility stopped bidding its retained generation
into to the PX, which SCE and PG&E said they stopped doing on 12/28/00.  The
two utilities said they stopped participating in the PX day-of and day-ahead
markets on 01/19/01.
The PUC directs the utilities to calculate their cost of capital-related
revenue requirements using the amounts in their respective Transition Cost
Balancing Accounts (TCBA) as the rate base.  The TCBA reflects the net book
value of utility generation assets less the recovery of those assets*
stranded costs.  The PUC will allow utilities to record in a memorandum
account the difference between this reduced rate of return component of
revenue requirements and their last PUC authorized rate of return for the
same assets, for possible future use in adjusting the TCBA-based rates.  The
amounts in these memorandum accounts will represent the difference between
their current allowed returns and what they *may have earned had these
generation costs been recovered under traditional cost of service ratemaking
in place prior to restructuring.*  The cost-based rates so determined, the
PUC says, would comply with the principle that ratepayers pay just and
reasonable rates, and as costs change would be subject to adjustment.
The PUC decides that SCE, PG&E, and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) should
use their *utility retained generation* (URG) in the following order, to: 1)
serve their existing customers at cost-of-service based rates; 2) sell power
at cost-based rates to other California investor-owned utilities; and 3)
sell or barter excess power from URG to minimize future costs.  The PUC
directs that if any surplus generation exists, it should first be offered to
other California IOUs at cost-based rates, with any net proceeds to benefit
in-state ratepayers.  URG consists of utility-owned generation and long-term
purchased power contracts.
Since the December 15, 2000 order from the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) ending the investor-owned utilities* obligation to sell
all of their energy produced through the Power Exchange (PX) and buy all of
their energy requirements from the PX (the so-called *buy/sell
requirement*), utilities had no regulatory direction for using and pricing
their retained generation.  In lieu of an evidentiary hearing, because of
the need to protect the public interest during this time of nearly
continuous Stage 3 supply emergencies, the PUC now provides this direction.
The PUC makes SDG&E a party to the URG aspects of its order, while the PUC
does not apply the DWR delivery and pricing rules to SDG&E, at this time.
The AB 1X law does not exclude SDG&E*s retail customers from receiving DWR
power, but the PUC opts not to require DWR power to go them at this time.

In this interim order adopted on 01/31/01, the PUC says it does not end the
rate freeze, set an interim valuation, or otherwise provide a basis for
ending the rate freeze.  As far as it addresses the pricing and use of
utilities* retained generation, the order only sets an interim basis for
pricing the power utilities continue to produce and provide to their
customers since the effectively defunct PX no longer fulfills this function.

Residual Pricing of DWR Power
Because of the provisions of AB 1X, which was enacted the day after the PUC
adopted its order, the PUC must price DWR power residually, or as a
percentage of what each SCE and PG&E retail end use customer currently pays
them for energy.  The utilities* energy charges are currently frozen at
different levels for each utility and each customer class.  The percentage
is calculated by dividing (1) the amount of power provided by DWR and
delivered by the utility, by (2) the total amount of power generated or
purchased by the utility and the amount of power in item (1).  The amount of
power purchased by the utility includes purchases from QFs and others for
resale, as well as any energy they purchase in the ISO*s real time market.
This percentage or ratio will be calculated daily.
The PUC provides the following example, if a utility generates and purchases
750 MWh of power and delivers along with it 250 MWh of DWR power for a total
of 1,000 MWh, each customer owes DWR 25% of the energy charge in their rates
for the power they used that day.
Utilities will collect these amounts from customers on behalf of DWR and
hold the amounts in trust for DWR.
As the law requires the calculation of the amounts to be collected on the
basis of the megawatt hours DWR actually purchases and delivers, while
calculating the amounts it is entitled to recover from utilities* retail
customers in dollars of costs, there is a built in potential for DWR*s costs
to be under recovered, depending on how the actual price DWR pays for each
MWh matches up with the utilities* existing, frozen energy charges.
The PUC says that making the utilities liable for any shortfall in the
recovery of DWR*s costs *satisfies the legislative concern that the State
recover the funds expended.*  If the two cash-strapped, nearly bankrupt
utilities are liable for substantial amounts to make DWR whole, these
amounts would likely only add to the approximately $12 billion in unpaid,
overdue purchased power costs they have already accumulated.
Following the provisions of AB 1X, the PUC sets the DWR price of power upon
resale as equal to DWR*s purchased power costs, plus administrative costs,
transmission and scheduling costs, and other related costs, less any
overpayments DWR may subsequently recover from suppliers.
Again following the provisions of AB 1X, the PUC directs DWR to retain title
to its power until sold to the utilities* retail end use customers, and
reminds that under the new statute *neither the full faith and credit nor
the taxing power of the State of California may be pledged for the payment
for any obligation.*  The PUC orders the two cash-strapped utilities to
deliver DWR power to retail customers and directs the utilities to take no
ownership or other interest in DWR power, acting only in an administrative
capacity as billing agents for DWR.
The PUC*s interim order is posted on its web site at:

stabilization cases, Application numbers 00-11-038 and 00-11-056, of which
SDG&E is a party.

Dave and Ed,

We closed two option deals with TVA last week.  They have sent the following 
comments on our standard confirms. 

Dave - Rogers has already commented on the 16 hour call.  His comment was 
that this is a 16 hour call, all or none, not up to 16 hours.  Secondly, the 
option is exercisable in 50 MW blocks (increments of 50MW) not a minimum of 
50 MW.  Please look at the rest of the language and let me know your 
thoughts.  Thanks.

Ed-  there are some credit additions on page 3 under credit assurance.  Let 
me know what you think.

Thanks guys.

-Joe

David,

TVA's proposed credit assurance language should be amended to reflect our 
standard language with the downgrade event being established at BBB- or 
Baa3.  Also, your redline should also delete any subjectivity which provides 
the TVA the unilateral right to call for additional or replacement 
collateral.  In looking at historical agreements (i.e. master options 
agreement), our standard credit provisions have been accepted.  I will 
forward another email with their prefered gty form.  It appears that we 
currently have outgoing gtys; however, they govern certain agreements like 
the Master Options Agmt.  Comments or questions, please call.

conference in Houston on March 6th, 2001.  As you know, Harlan Murphy and
Dede Russo will join you on the discussion of the Use of a Single Master
Agreement for Physical and Financial Trading.  Will you contact Harlan and

Also, throughout the PPA I asked you to add comments or clarify a few 
sections.  If you can add your comments today, lets meet first thing 
tommorrow to discuss (leave me a message tonight and I will come in early to 
read before we meet).  I didn't bother with the Green Sharing Agreement since

Hi John

Thanks for the  offer but despite what you say, your legal prowess is still 
far more important to me - I would likely have ceased working long ago w/out  
LLGM.  I rode up on the elevator with Jeff Skilling and he asked me if I 
still liked my job.  I first asked if I had a choice and then confessed it 
could be better.  I don't think I won many points with him, particularly when 
I asked him if he liked his job.  Oh well, any connections there?

I'm sending out documents tonight on the utility exposure by confirm to you 
and Jim.  I can talk to you and Jim about that as well as offset with the 
commandeered positions anytime on Wed morning.  Let me know what time works 
for you."

The discussion regarding the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 with 
Ken Raisler of Sullivan and Cromwell has been scheduled for 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. 
in Sandalwood Rooms A & B of the downtown Hyatt Regency Hotel (sorry, we will 
not be serving lunch).

Attorneys and legal specialists in the swaps/Enron Net Works group are 
strongly encouraged to attend.

Each of the attorneys should have already received a package that includes 
the complete text of the CFMA, as well as the text of the Commodity Exchange 
Act, black-lined to show how it has been revised by the CFMA.  Please let me 
know if you have not received this package.

Sometime next week I will give Ken a broad outline of topics we would like to 
cover.  Please e-mail me with your thoughts in this regard.  Thanks -- Bob

There is an internal political risk that if we send out this letter the way

Hi John 

You must have told CA to take a rest while you were in Florida - all was 
quiet and now my office is now clean (I didn't know what to do with my time 
so....).  Now that you are back,  I'm wondering if my peace and quiet will be 
shattered. Meanwhile,  I hope you and your family had a wonderful break.

And back to work, we are meeting on Tues morning at  900 Houston time to 
discuss block forward trades - do you think you can participate?  If not, no 
big deal.  Talk to you soon."

Hi Andy

I will speak on any panel, but my preference would be the  1st panel and I 
would speak on the CA experience and how EEI helps.  Also, I'd be happy to do 
products on day 2.  Hope all is well and look forward to seeing you soon.

PS Thanks so much for the plant - it is resting comfortably in my office and 
reminds me of all the times at EEI meetings and the wonderful friends I have

Andy

I would be happy to do product/Into discussion as well.

I'll talk to Tracy but don't think she can make it from Portland to speak.  
If you need a speaker for the credit support annex I could help or maybe 
another Houston based credit person (I'll check to see if we have any any one 
available)

I'll be out of the office on the 7th (I'm speaking at ISDA as well as eye 
surgery in am so..   but I'm sure David Portz could show you the Enron 
building. His number is 713 853 9239.

I think it would be a good idea to distribute a sample MNA - maybe you could 
forward it to Liz Sullivan and see if she can get it in the ""package"".  I'm 
not sure about overheads something would likely be nice but I'm not sure what 
yet.  Lets talk on Monday

things we could talk about on Tues.  An unproofed draft of the brief 
presentation will be sent to you by my assistant.  Please feel free to mark 
up, delete or supplement.  On Mon when we talk and divy up parts , each 
person can then finish out the presentation as they want it.  .

 Dede I'll call you on Monday at 930 and then we can conference Harlan in.   
Thanks for everybody's help and have a great weekend."

Hi Cregg

Got your email - I don't know of any openings now but will certainly keep my 
eyes and ears open, and if I hear of anything I will let you know.  Good luck 
to you in your search - with your self realizations in tow (cynicism is

CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY/CLIENT INFORMATION
NOT DISCOVERABLE

Two years after PCA's bankruptcy, we received a demand letter from PCA.  PCA 
claims that EPMI owes PCA $15,126,445.16 for damages resulting from EPMI's 
wrongful termination of transactions in June 1998.  This amount appears to be 
based on PCA's calculation of the forward values of the terminated trades, 
and certain ""preference payments"" that PCA claims were made to EPMI.  This 
claim is in its preliminary stages.  I will update you with further 
information as soon as we get a handle on what the Trustee is really 
seeking.  As you will remember, we currently have a proof of claim pending 
against PCA for over $5 million dollars representing our unpaid receivable 
amount.

Bill

In connection with this matter, it would be very helpful if you could have 
someone gather the following information:

1.  Date and amount of last payment made by PCA, splitting the relative net 
amounts owed to and from EPMI (I would assume that payment for April 
deliveries was made - accordingly, I would assume that the last payment we 
received from PCA would have been around May 20th).

2.  Total amount of MWH delivered to PCA but for which PCA never paid for.

3.  The details of how you calculated the net MTM exposure of the terminated 
transactions (pursuant to an email to me dated July 27, 1998 you had 
calculated the MTM as of July 7, 1998 at $3,772,939)

As always, thanks for your help."

I understand that the procedure for getting a flat screen is to request, 
possibly plead, although not confirmed, with your supervisor and if he/she 
agrees, to send a copy of the email to Janette Elbertson, who will then 
permit the release of a flat screen to such poor wretched individuals.
 
Following the above procedure, please could I have a flat screen? At the 
moment I have borrowed one as the procedure stalled at the first hurdle last 
time due to ""masterly inaction"".

Hi Andy
I received this email but for some reason I can't open it.  Today is my last 
day in the office until the 22nd.  Can you resend this to me and I will look 
at it when I get back next week.  If it can't wait that long, go ahead and 
send to David Portz and he may be able to assist you.
Look forward to talking to you soon.
Elizabeth"

		 Subject: Cinergy and Enron Transaction



 Attached is a draft of the three party agreement between PGET, Enron
and Cinergy.  My understanding is that it is with respect to 75 MWh and I
have drafted it accordingly.  I have used the format which we and Enron have
previously used.

 In addition to your review of the Agreement generally, I need
specifically a copy of the two confirms for the Enron/PGET transactions
being terminated and I need to know the settlement payment.  Also, the
appropriate reference to the existing Enron/Cinergy needs to be included.
What will be the effective date for the assignment/termination?  I know we
want to sign this tomorrow, but how quickly can it be implemented.

 Please forward internally within your organization as necessary to
complete this transaction.

 Elizabeth and Jeff, please call me as soon as possible.

I'm not sure - I kind of think we need to keep going to some of these 
meetings, if nothing else to educate the industry and to listen to the

Dede Russo plans to prepare a presentation on the optional provisions that 
were assigned to members of the drafting committee last October.  Other than 
the CAISO Firm Energy and Patty's arbitation provisoin, we have not received  
additional language.  Dede is going to put together a handout by next 
Tuesday, if she does not receive any provisions from those listed below, she 
will use Reliant's language.  It would be presented for illustrative 
purposes, but could sway the audience.  Here is your chance to get your 
organization's preferred provisions out at the conference.  So, send your 
draft provisions to me and Dede by cob on Friday 3/16 please.  For those who 
may have forgotten, these are the assignments:

Prior Transactions:  Liz
Unilateral Contract:  MartyJo (sucessor in interest to Buddy Broussard)
New Taxes:  Fritz
Reg Out:  Randy/John
New Products:  Dede will handle this
Collateral Annex:  will be a separate panel

Bruce and Mike:

Attached please find the most recent versions of the Frontera Energy 
Marketing Services Agreement and the companion Master Power Purchase and Sale 
Agreement.  Eric and Frank asked that I forward these to you.  Please be 
advised that these are still under review at TECO, but reflect the most 
recent discussions concerning this arrangement.

You will note that I have made some changes to the Master Power Purchase and 
Sale Agreement to reflect the relationship being established under the Energy 
Services Agreement and to harmonize the terms of that agreement with the 
overall business relationship being established.  Please recognize that there 
are likely to be further revisions following additional review.

I look forward to concluding this arrangement in the next several days.

		 Subject: Call with Pirog


** PRIVATE **

Set forth is a brief summary of my call with John Pirog last night.  Overall, 
I felt we made a lot of progress.  At the end of the call, Pirog said that 
prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was possible, but at the 
end he said that he thought we could probably work through a number of the 
issues and he said he was going to send some sample language for our 
consideration on a few of the points.  We said that we would be begin to 
modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts we spoke about and 
that we could then ""compare notes.""  He said that CDWR viewed the Enron 
Contract as an important one and he said he would be back to us fairly 
quickly.

Material Regulatory Change Provision.  Pirog said CDWR would be willing to 
accept such a provision if it were limited to an event that adversely affects 
CDWR's ability to perform under the contract, most particularly its ability 
to pay for power.  (Such an event likely would be a CA legislature or 
regulatory generated change).  Pirog said he thought that CDWR would agree to 
a termination payment if this occurred, although they may not want the MRC to 
be characterized as a ""default"" (which should not be a problem from our 
standpoint).   CDWR would not be willing to protect EPMI for a change (e.g., 
in law) that materially affects EPMI's business, but does not adversely 
affect CDWR's ability to make payments to EPMI.  (For example, a new CA law 
that requires sellers into CA to turn over all their books and records to the 
CPUC).  Further, as we anticipated, he said CDWR was not willing to be on the 
hook for a termination payment for an event outside its control, such as a 
FERC change or Federal Legislation that adversely affects us.  However, he 
did say that CDWR might entertain a ""no LD walk right"" for EPMI if such a 
change adversely affected it.  My sense is that ultimately Pirog/CDWR will 
back track on that since such a change could occur when our contract is 
heavily in the money to CDWR and this would allow us an out without paying 
LDs.

Early Walk Provision.  He reiterated that CDWR would not extend the Option.  
With respect to the early walk away right that has been offered, it was 
discussed that this could be structured in such a way that EPMI could walk 
from the deal (without receiving or paying a Termination Payment) up until a 
date certain (September 1 and September 30 were mentioned by me as 
possibilities, although Pirog said that other suppliers had a shorter window) 
(our request is based on the gloomy news that has been eminating from the CA 
Treasurer's office about the bond issue), provided that if the bonds were 
issued earlier than that, the walk away right would terminate; that is, EPMI 
would not be free to walk if CDWR was able to issue bonds with an investment 
grade rating prior to the Drop Dead Date.

Termination Payment Due Date.   Pirog said CDWR cannot shorten it from 180 
days.  He said all other suppliers have lived with that.  Pirog is 
sympathetic to our concerns, but said that the ""bond guys"" are already 
nervous about only having 180 days (if they had to issue bonds to pay the 
LDs).

Suspension of Delivery.  Emphasizing our concern with the 180 days, I 
requested that CDWR provide some flexibility on our right to suspend 
perfromance in the event of an event of default and, perhaps some other 
events, such as a bond downgrade.  Pirog said he thought CDWR could work with 
us on that.

Downgrade not a Default.  CDWR was not willing to have a bond downgrade an 
event of default.  However, he said CDWR would be willing to consider having 
a Downgrade Event a ""no LD walk right"" for EPMI and perhaps an event 
justifying EPMI in suspending deliveries.  In other words, a Downgrade Event 
would be treated like an Event of Default, but no termination payment would 
be owed and EPMI would have the flexibility to suspend performance.  Pirog 
also discussed adding a covenant that CDWR would attempt to secure a Credit 
Rating with respect to the claims paying ability of the Fund in the event 
that no bonds were issued.  That is, if no Bonds were outstanding and the 
Fund did not have an investment grade rating, we could terminate, but without 
LDs.

Cross Defaults.  This clearly is one of CDWR's hot buttons, and we will not 
be able to get this is my sense.  However, when asked about the idea of a 
Cross Default Out w/out a termination payment, he stated that he would like 
to discuss that further with CDWR.

LD Calculation Methodology.  Pirog said it was very unlikely CDWR would 
accept our proposed language.  He said they are striving for consistency 
among contracts and said their proposal is viewed as more ""objective.""  My 
sense is that we will need to get comfortable with it in general.

Arbitration.  In general, Pirog did not have a problem, except for the 
following: a desire to limit it to contractual claims only (i.e., no tort 
actions, extra-contractual disputes, etc. would be subject to it).  Also, 
holding hearings in New York City was not well received, and a request was 
made that all three arbitrators be neutral.  I would think that the situs 
issue will be a big one for Richard Sanders in light of the political 
environment if a dispute were to arise.  My general sense, however, is that 
this is not a ""deal breaker"" for CDWR.

Assignment.  In general, he understood the nature of our changes on this 
issue and said they were reasonable although he caveated that on this issue 
as well they are looking  for some consistency.  We were again asked if 
assignment back to the IOUs would be acceptable, even though he knew what our 
reaction would be.  Pirog offered to provide us sample language, which we 
said we would look at.  We stated that conceptually this would be a difficult 
sell in light of the environment.  He did not elaborate on how stringent the 
assignment standards are in the other deals.

New Govt Charge Pass Throughs.  A pass through of some governmental charges 
was considered to be okay, but he said our proposed language was too broad.  
Pirog offered to provide some examples of acceptable language on this.  He di 
agre, howeve, that if for example, CA imposed an excess profits tax, that it 
was fair for us to be protected from that.

Legal Opinions.  Pirog did not think that a legal opinion from Hawkins would 
be forthcoming, although he did say that he would look into whether or not 
they would be providing one on the bonds.  Also, he said it was a possibility 
that the California Attorney General would issue the opinion on the bonds, so 
we might possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from Hawkins.  
Realistically, it likely will be very difficult to get this before we have to 
extend the option; perhaps, we can put in a covenant on CDWR to get us that 
before our walk right expires.

Additional CDWR Covenants.  Pirog stated that the additional covenants we 
have requested are conceptually okay with him, but need to be discussed 
internally with CDWR.

Pro Rata ""Spread"" Amortization.  Pirog had not reviewed the idea of 
amortizing the Credit Amount over the four year term, and said that he would 
run it by CDWR.

CDWR Information.  Pirog said he would follow up with CDWR on how often it 
plans to give suppliers financial information.  He was resisting our request 
for monthly information, although I pointed out that we really only wanted 
information that frequently in the beginning of the transaction as things 
start to fall into place.

Let me know when you wish to follow up.

John

My goldfish died this weekend - He was with us for over 6 months.  A trusted 
companion for me in the early morning as he sang sweet ""O's"", he looking for 
food and me looking for peace of mind early in the morning before the days' 
voices began.  

Another day today looks like another week which is how this whole past month 
feels.  Hopefully this to will pass.


Looking forward to talking to you soon and seeing you in early April.







ps - Great work on WAPA;  I get the distinct sense that no matter what, CDWR 
will close.   I hear Skilling told Portland that he loves trading and 
promises resources.  Oh my."

All:

Here is a rough first cut at a DASH for a potential deal with NSTAR to serve 
their Default Service.  Jim/Zach - please fill in all relevant numbers 
relating to volume/pricing, etc.   Also - please begin to get RAC in the loop 
with respect to this position and VaR impacts, etc.  Others - please review 
pertinent sections and edit/expand as appropriate.

Timing on this will likely be quick from this point and thus I would like to 
try to have a completed draft by COB today or first thing tomorrow.  We have 
a call with NSTAR tomorrow AM to negotiate the contract, and assuming all 
goes well there, we could be asked to sign a binding agreement by as early as 
Wednesday.

Please call me to discuss.  978-449-9936.  Thanks

Just wanted to let you know that all the great work in Blue Range is paying 
off in the US - citing Blue Range, a Houston bankruptcy court correctly 
decided that a gas contract was a forward contract relative to the US safe 
harbor provisions.  If you want a copy of the opinion let me know.

Hope all is well.

		 Subject: Revised Draft


John:  as per your request, attached are revised drafts of the Confirmation 
and Cover Sheet, which are blacklined against the respective documents from 
the short-term deal.  I recognize that you are still reviewing certain 
questions/points with CDWR and there may be some items reflected in this 
draft that neither you nor CDWR has ""signed off"" on.  Nonetheless, in certain 
cases I thought it made sense to provide you with specific contract language 
on some of the points we discussed so that you could clearly see what we may 
be proposing on a particular item.

Please note, in particular, the following:

--on the LD calculation, we reverted to your proposed language on obtaining 
multiple market quotes, etc.  However, after talking to Enron this evening, 
we would like to propose that if quotes cannot be obtained despite the 
parties' good faith efforts to do so, then only in that circumstance would 
the calculation be based on the Non-Defaulting Party's losses.  While, based 
on the product Enron is selling, we anticipate that quotes will be readily 
obtainable, we think it makes sense to revert to the Non-Defaulting Party's 
loss calculation in the highly unlikely event that quotes are not obtainable 
despite using all efforts to do so.  I know that you expressed some 
reservations the other evening that this process potentially could be subject 
to some manipulation.  This is not so.  If CDWR was the Defaulting Party and 
it disputes the loss calculation made by Enron, such dispute would become the 
subject of arbitration.  In such case, the Non-Defaulting Party's would have 
to furnish its historical and current power curves to prove its case.  Since 
those same figures necessarily are needed by Enron to report its trading 
positions on a day to day basis as part of its normal business operations and 
such information feeds directly into its financial reporting statements and 
other relevant financial information, etc. that becomes, in part, part of its 
SEC filings, in a discovery proceeding this information would be very 
transparent.

--with respect to the situs of any arbitration proceeding, Enron strongly 
believes that it is only fair to both parties that this be conducted in a 
neutral site.  The draft provides for New York City, although Enron is open 
to other possible locations.

--the revised draft reflects only the $127/MWh alternative scenario since you 
indicated that, preliminarily, you felt that CDWR would not be likely to 
choose the alternative structure we had discussed.

--we would like to further discuss the effect of an adverse federal 
regulatory change.  I'm sure you can appreciate this in light of the current 
environment, although we would think that freely negotiated bilateral 
contracts would not be subject to the types of changes being discussed.  
Enron is not seeking a termination right with LDs, but would like to further 
discuss a termination right without compensation in the event of a major 
adverse federal development affecting the contract.

--we have dropped our request that Enron have the right to suspend 
performance in the case of a Bond downgrade event.  However, we think it is 
appropriate that if that circumstance occurs, that the due date for payments 
by CDWR should shorten to 7 days and if the Bonds are subsequently upgraded 
that the payment schedule would revert accordingly.

--you requested that we propose a limit on the right of a Non-Defaulting 
Party to suspend its performance in the case of a Default by the Defaulting 
Party.  We included a 60-NERC day limit on such right in the revised draft.  
This is important to Enron as we discussed, particularly in light of Enron's 
acceptance of the 180 day period on the timing of a Termination Payment 
which, as you know, is unheard of in the power sale (or virtually any other) 
arena.  (Nonetheless, we fully understand the position enunciated by the bond 
people on this point).

--on assignment, the Enron commercial people cannot agree to a pre-approved 
right of CDWR to assign the contract to the IOUs.  As we discussed, it may 
very well be the case that at the time any assignment were to be effected 
that Enron may already be at the limit of its overall exposure with those 
counter parties.  It can't be in a position where such an assignment could 
cause it to violate those limits.

--we included an outside date by which Enron must decide whether or not to go 
forward of the first to occur of (1) September 30, 2001 or (2) seven days 
after the Bonds are issued.  You had indicated that CDWR might be willing to 
consider such an ""outside date"" as long as (i) the $127/MWh pricing was in 
effect from April 1 and (2) Enron had to act very shortly after the Bonds are 
issued.  We have proposed 7 days for this.

--in concept, we probably will be ok with the alternative of securing a 
credit rating for the Fund (as opposed to the Bonds), although we have 
referred that question to the credit people to make sure.

--in light of your response about opinions not being provided by outside 
counsel, we modified the confirmation to request that the opinions could be 
from the AG, or if CDWR cannot do that, then from the GC of CDWR.  We felt 
that this would not involve additional work since these presumably will be 
rendered in connection with the Bonds and we provided that they generally 
would be provided to us after the Bonds are issued.

I think the foregoing represent most of the items we had discussed.  Please 
let me know when you wish to discuss.  Also, it may make sense for our next 
call to have the respective Enron and CDWR commercial folks on the call since 
it may be the case that many of the final decisions involved may be 
commercial ones.

Lastly, please note that while we have discussed most of the points addressed 
in the revised drafts with Enron, in order to expedite the process, we are 
sending these drafts simultaneously to you and Enron.  Thus, it is possible 
that Enron may have further modifications or changes to the documents.

Thanks.  We look forward to working with you to finalize the requisite 
documents.

John

Elisabeth:

I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among 
other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its 
jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) 
made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades 
through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact 
on our standard reps relating to the ""trade options exemption"" and as to the 
parties being ""eligible swap participants"" (are they still required)?  Is 
there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

 Description: 8ppm monochrome personal laser printer at 600 x 600 dpi

Do these numbers include both EES and EEMC with respect to both PGE and SCE.  
If not I need them all combined.

Thanks for your help.

Per Mike's request, the attached note has our latest estimate on PX credits.  
We are expecting to have a final estimate by Friday.  Let me know if this 
timing works for you.  Thanks.

Our current estimate of PX credits thru Mid March is ~$570MM including the 
$269MM we transferred to EPMI in Dec.  I don't expect the rest of March to be 
large, but I'll get you an update asap.

Hi Carol!

Thrilled to hear all is going well.  I would love to play tennis anytime 
(hopefully sooner rather than later so I can take advantage of  that 
lingering fatigue that takes months? years? to abate).  We can play at the 
Met either around lunchtime or sometime after 4:00.  Weekends would also 
work.  Can you play next Tuesday or Wednesday?  Call or write.

See you soon
Elizabeth

John:  Following up on your voice mail, attached are revised drafts of the 
Confirm and the Master Agreement.  Please note that, as you may recall, 
Elizabeth Sager is out of town today and I have not been able to catch up 
with her to get her views on the things set forth in your e-mail to me, or 
with Christian.  However, we had a brief conversation after our call 
yesterday about some of the points on your ""list"" and I have tried to 
generally work with what you have proposed on a few of the points in light of 
my conversations with Elizabeth and Christian.  Since I have to leave the 
office within an hour or so today, I thought I would forward some proposed 
language on some of the points for your consideration with the hope of 
expediting the process.  These drafts, therefore, are subject to Enron's 
review and comment.

Please call me if you wish to discuss.

John

For those of you planning to attend the Power Marketing Workshop in Newport

the conference rate.  I suggest you try the Marriott ($199-$219 per night) 
949/640-4000 or the Hyatt Newporter ($275 per night - $99 govt. rate) 
949/729-1234.  Both are close to the Four Seasons.  The Four Seasons - 
949/759-0808 - may have some rooms available for the night of April 18 at 
their regular rate.  Looking forward to seeing you in California.

Would it be possible to order a dual card to enable me to  move towards less 
paper and more on-screen work? 
 
Thank you. Believe the cost is of the order of $400.

Hi Harlan

Hope your enjoying your fortuitous timing - since you've been gone we haven't 
seen below triple digits and there is no relief in site.  In that vain, I'd 
love nothing more than to pull you back for nothing less than an Into 
meeting.  I spoke w Kevin Presto, head of East trading, and he has proposed 
that we all get together no earlier than the end of next week, with 
afternoons and Tues or Thurs being the best days.  He would propose that he, 
Rogers Herndon and John Zufferli attend.  Let me know what days would work 
for you.

Happy trails
Elizabeth

Here are proposed responses to these discovery requests:

Request for Admission - Admit that CPSC agreed to go forward with the 
transaction proposed in the July 30, 1999 letter absent a guarantee from 
CPSC's parent company.

Answer:  EPMI objects to this request in that it is vague and ambiguous, 
particularly in its use of the term ""agreed to go forward.""  Subject to and 
without waiving this objection, EPMI denies this request.

Interrogatory - If your answer to the preceding request for Admission is 
other than an unqualified admission, state in detail the basis for your 
denial or qualification of the admission.

Answer:  EPMI objects to this interrogatory for the reasons stated in its 
response to the preceding request for admission.  Subject to and without 
waiving this objection, EPMI states that CPSC made no apparent effort to seek 
LCRA's consent to an assignment as contemplated by the July 30, 1999.  In 
telephone conversations in the late afternoon of the last day for the parties 
to have entered into such an assignment pursuant to the terms of the July 30, 
1999 letter agreement (which conversations were initiated by EPMI several 
days earlier) CPSC indicated that it would begin to negotiate an assignment 
without a parent guarantee, but CPSC did not, in fact, agree to an assignment 
before the expiration of the time period contemplated by the July 30, 1999 
letter agreement.  After that time had expired, CPSC did not continue 
negotiations with EPMI.
Let me know what you think.

David and Elizabeth,

Here are the redlined versions of the NSP amendments.  The changes are 
straight forward.  The only thing that I found was that they only changed the 
date in one of the agreements...they should probably be changed in both.  
Please review and resend to me at your earliest convenience.  Our goal is to 
execute tomorrow.

Thanks,

Terri

this made me think of you...


  All in good humor:
  A man in a hot air balloon realized he was lost.  He reduced
altitude and spotted a woman below.  He descended a bit more and shouted,
""Excuse me, can you help me?  I promised a friend I would meet him an hour
ago, but I don't know where I am.""
  The woman below replied, ""You are in a hot air balloon
hovering approximately 30 feet above the ground.  You are between 40 and 41
degrees north latitude and between 59 and 60 degrees west longitude.""
  ""You must be an engineer,"" said the balloonist.
  ""I am,"" replied the woman.  ""How did you know?""
  ""Well,"" answered the balloonist, ""everything you told me is
technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information,
and the fact is I am still lost.  Frankly, you've not been much help so
far.""
  The woman below responded, ""You must be a manager.""  ""I am,""
replied the balloonist, ""but how did you know?""
""Well,"" said the woman, ""you don't know where you are or where you are
going.  You have risen to where you are due to a large quantity of hot air.
You made a promise which you have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to
solve your problem.  The fact is you are in exactly the same position you
were in before we met, but now, somehow, it's my fault.""

Here is a brief memo prepared by Dan Watkiss relating to the relationship 
between TVA transmission and marketing.  N

 I will call you later to discuss TVA letter. Kevin does not want to make 
offer to sell at market based rates.  Also want to discuss if there is any 
way we can challenge TVA on the hourly tag problems of last week.

Talk to you soon.

ES--Bob Madden may be interested in this.  If TVA is not formally separated, 
then TVA control area saying it will not retag when EPMI changes the source 
(from ENSE to AEP, for example) and TVA marketing not taking us as an 
upstream if we do that are really interconnected.  Maybe Bob can come up with 
something.

Bill--Does TVA ever buy transmission on any other TP's system?  It must not 
or it would have to file it Practices as a OATT with FERC.  Does TVA just buy 
or sell at its border?  Thanks.

Hope you had a good weekend.

Monday April 9, 2:52 pm Eastern Time 
Calpine says PG&E in breach of power contracts
(UPDATE: updates with company comments to analysts)
SAN JOSE, Calif., April 9 (Reuters) - Independent power company Calpine Corp. 
(NYSE:CPN <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=cpn&d=t> - news </n/c/cpn.html>) said 
on Monday that bankrupt utility Pacific Gas and Electric was in breach of 
contract after failing to make some $267 million in payments and it would 
seek prompt court action to secure payment or be freed from its energy 
contracts.
ADVERTISEMENT  
<http://rd.yahoo.com/M=183981.1387645.2975805.1320407/D=fin/S=7811756:LREC/A=6

<http://rd.yahoo.com/M=183981.1387645.2975805.1320407/D=fin/S=7811756:LREC/A=6
31358/R=0/*http://www.hrblock.com/taxes/partners/yahoo/index.html >
``Right now there is breach of contract'' for power Calpine has provided 
Pacific Gas and Electric, Calpine senior vice president Lisa Bodensteiner 
told an analysts teleconference. 
``We are filing motions this week with the bankruptcy court to direct PG&E to 
pay us. If it doesn't decide this, we will then ask the court to relieve of 
us of our contacts and let us sell to the open market,'' she said. 
San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine said in a statement earlier Monday it was 
confident PG&E would be able to pay Calpine's 11 qualifying facility 
subsidiaries (QFs) for past-due power sales. 
Calpine's 11 QF plants, which generate around 600 megawatts of power from 
small natural gas-fired and geothermal plants, are part of a fleet of 
qualifying facilities that can produce up to about a third of all the power 
generated in California. 
As of March 31, Pacific Gas and Electric owed a total of $643 million for 
power the QFs have supplied to its customers, according to the California 
Public Utilities. 
PG&E must assume Calpine's contracts in its bankruptcy proceedings for them 
to continue, Calpine said. 
PG&E Corp. (NYSE:PCG <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pcg&d=t> - news 
</n/p/pcg.html>) unit Pacific Gas and Electric Co., California's largest 
inverstor-owned utility, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday 
after piling up around $9 billion in wholesale power costs it has not been 
able to recover due to California's 1996 deregulation legislation. 
Calpine senior vice president Jim Macias told analysts that if PG&E ``were 
dumb enough'' not to affirm the contracts, Calpine could make an extra $380 
million selling the energy tied up in its QF contracts with PG&E on the open 
spot market. 
``We are in constant discussions with state municipal utilities and the state 
to sell our power. We are very confident we will be able to move this energy 
should the contacts be rejected,'' Macias said. 
He estimated spot electricity prices in the state are currently about $260 
per megawatt hour. 
A Calpine spokeswoman said Monday the company's QF facilities operated when 
California declared power emergencies, but could not comment on whether they 
operate when an alert is not called. 
In addition to the $267 million currently owed, San Francisco-based Calpine 
also holds a long-term $68 million note receivable with PG&E for energy 
deliveries from 2003 to 2014, but that the note is note yet due. 
Calpine, which said it did not expect the $267 million PG&E owes it to grow, 
said the utility had paid 15 percent of what PG&E owes it for energy 
delivered in December and January, but had not paid anything since. 
Calpine, which has its own natural gas storage reserves in Sacramento, 
Calif., also said it expected to make payments to its gas suppliers.

Registration is still available for our upcoming workshop on the EEI and WSPP

hotel,  however, we need to know  soon how large a block to guarantee.  
Please let me know if you or anyone from your company is planning to attend 
this conference.  We have an outstanding program planned and our brochure 
(PDF-ADOBE) is attached.  The brochure contains a registration form that

Elizabeth and David, have you had a chance to get back with Bonnie's
assistant who is trying to schedule a meeting this week to work on your
affidavits in response to Calpine's motion for summary judgment? We are
trying to meet this Thursday 4/12. Will you either call Lee Carrier at
853-6612 or respond to me by e-mail regarding your availability? As our
response is due on 4/20, I would appreciate your earliest response. Thanks
very much. Laura Gibson

To all:

I've put together a slide presentation that can be used for the 10am (Let's 
Make a Deal), 11:15 (When the Deal Does Not Go Down); 1:30 (Show Me the 
Money); and 2:30 (Major Meltdowns) panels.  Please feel free to edit, 
supplement, comment or suggest alternatives.  I am assuming that Harlan and 
Elizabeth will have other handouts for the 8:30am panel.  Mike Small's 
handout is attached.  I also plan to add:  the model tariff and service 
agreement, slides concerning the EEI contract development process, a page 
showing the location of the eei contract website, and list of upcoming 
activities.  Please let me know if there is anything else you think should be 
added as a handout (preferably something that does not need to be created 
from scratch).

Patty, in addition to the attached slides, Bob Viola said he was comfortable 
with using John Varholy's presentation, but wants to discuss further.  I've 
asked Marvin Goldstein if he intends to use his forward contract and 
bankruptcy memo for his presentation.   Its attached.  Shari Stack said she 
will finish up her presentation and send it to you  today.  Contact info for 
your panels:  Bob Viola 617-912-6256 (rviola@edisonmission.com); Marvin 
Goldstein 212-806-5629 (mgoldstein@stoock.com); Mike Small 202-393-1200 
(small@wrightlaw.com); and Shari Stack 713-207-5233 
(shari_stack@reliantenergy.com) .  If you need Marvin's hotel number I can 
try and get it, he's on vacation this week.  He did not return a message I 
left yesterday.  David has a conference call scheduled for Friday for his 
panels and hopefully, you can set one up for yours this week.

Looking forward to speaking w/ you this week.

Ok to incorporate language referring to ERCOT/West product that we trade 
under EEI (West firm should already be handled and ERCOT confirms talk about 
product but without definition).

OK maybe to modify transmission contingent but need to clarify why with 
Harlan and then advice/discuss w traders.  We do not commonly use those

Dynegy has requested a meeting with us to discuss what an ""Into Product"" is 
and how this product works with what is currently going on with transmission 
and how it may be impacted by future changes in transmission.  Attendees from 
Dynegy will include Griff Jones (Dynegy's head of trading), Matt (whose last 
name I didn't get) and their lawyer Harlan Murphy.  If you think somebody 
else should attend or if you want them to come over here, let me know and I 
can talk to Harlan.  Assuming the meeting stays scheduled, I will schedule an 
internal meeting to briefly go over the EEI Into definition before we meet 
with Dynegy.

As you are aware, in connection with the EEI effort we worked extensively 
with a large group of industry participants to define  what an Into Product 
is.  Dynegy and PECO were the two companies that were very outspoken against 
they way the product ultimately got defined.  Dynegy put on a big dog and 
pony show before a large group of industry participants trying to argue that 
EEI's Into product was flawed.   Their position, while not completely 
expressed, hinges on the concept that if you sell an Into Product and are 
making deliveries on firm transmission, then the Seller will always be 
excused from performance if the firm transmission gets cut for any reason (in 
general, this is contrary to EEI which obligates the Seller to go to another 
interface unless the cut was due to Buyer's use of non firm transmission when 
firm was available or due to Buyer's attempt to move the energy away from the 
receiving control area).  Dynegy's approach was driven by the fact that they 
have extensive generation and that the vast majority of their deals go 
physical.  At the time, we suggested that if they were worried about cuts in 
firm transmission, then they needed to sell a transmission contingent 
product.  Dynegy's concept was rejected at the EEI meetings.

I hope that the meeting will accomplish the following goals:

1.  Get Dynegy to agree to trade Into with us under a common Into definition 
- Dynegy will not sign an EEI with us because of the Into definition.  We 
trade Into extensively with them, but clearly do not have a common 
understanding of what we are trading.  Critical to clear up this ambiguity.

2. Secure Dynegy as an advocate of EEI - Because Dynegy was so vocal against 
EEI's Into definition, if they now started using EEI, it would further boost 
acceptance of the contract and isolate PECO as the only other major voice 
against the Into definition.

3. Reexamine the Into Product as it is currently drafted and consider what 
will happen as access to transmission changes - Because the Into product is 
such an important part of East trading today, it is critical that internally 
we all agree how it should operate. Additionally, it is critical that we 
start thinking about how the Into product will be affected by changes in 
transmission, such as the advent of RTOs (with long term Into deals we may 
want to consider addressing what happens if the receiving control area goes 
into an RTO)

Call me with any questions/thoughts.

Thanks
Elizabeth

Speakers,

I thought you might like to see who has registered for the workshop.  FYI

After looking at this I realize it may not be as helpful as I thought - 
certainly would need to add more analysis on the delivery obligations like FM 
and other rights to interrupt.  Call if you have any questions (713 853 6349).

ps  if you get a chance I would love to see the form PGE used in addition to 
the WSPP - I think you said it was PGE 11.

Thanks
Have a great weekend.

Andy,

We still have some internal work to do before we can say whether there is
any chance BPA will use the EEI contract in the future.  Personally, I think
this depends largely on what the prevailing industry trading arrangements
are, and that seems to be the WSPP agreement right now.  But our eyes and
ears are open.  I will be attending the conference and expect it to be very
informative.  Thanks for sending out the brochure.

Here's the final conference brochure.  The last panel of the day has a
comparison of the EEI and the WSPP and what the future holds for each.  If
you were inclined, having your thoughts on which agreement the BPA would
likely embrace in the future would be helpful.  If you speak, you get to
attend the entire conference for free.  Also, please feel free to pass the
brochure on to any counterparties in the west that you think would benefit.
FYI, if there is enough interest we can try to arrange getting additional
rooms at the Four Seasons at the conference rate.  If that is not an option,
there is a Mariott that we have a national account w/ that is only 5 minutes
from the Four Seasons.  If we get enough overflow we will guarantee the
Mariott a block of rooms to get a discount rate.  I

I don't have a final brochure on this, but here is a draft.  I've also
attached my law review article on the EEI Contract.  I can't recall if I
gave you  one at the WSPP meeting in S.F.  Hope all is going well.  If BPA
would like me to do a separate presentation on the EEI Contract, I can
arrange that as well.

One hundred and forty two hours ago, I wandered into the Houston Casino, not 
really sure why other than a free floating anxiety that could only be 
appeased by attending to the ministerial tasks in life that so frequently 
make us forget how good life is.  So after a rousing game of tennis on Friday 
morning while my children were frolicking with Dede's 3 children at the 
Houston Country Club, I tackled my desk and made head way to no where. After 
trashing 457 emails, I opened the the 458th.  And then it came to me.  An 
epic. A history. A sense of time, commitment and value. A place where my 
roots are (as you all know, my mom and dad are buried in a family graveyard 
200 feet from the only barn not burned in the Shenandoah valley during the 
Civil War and which was used a Yankee hospital).  And of course there is the 
hope of sustaining energy to cope with this lackluster, stressful career in 
the Casino. 

And the Gods must have seen this coming too.  Being meager and always wanting 
to commit small, I sought only volume 1 of the opus.  Not to be found.  
Plenty of volume 2s and 3s but not a volume 1 to be found.  Other than in the 
sole, 3 volume set, neatly packages in the box, high up on a lonely shelf.  I 
knew I was on the right track when the person behind me tried to grab it out 
of my hands.  I fought and won.

I'm now on page 32 having met Jefferson Davis and Dear Abe.  At this rate 
I'll be finished in about 4 years, a true history of the war.

May Shelby be with us all  providing sustaining .......

I'm sure there's a scholar out there who has already published that big 
magnum opus on ""Dogs in the Civil War.""  However, Shelby Foote doesn't 
mention a single dog in his work and so the topic hasn't entered my 
imagination.  Your name is Patrick Cleburne.  I'm sorry about the gender 
thing, but your spirit and behavior is the same as his and you're going to 
have to go through this reading cycle bearing my comments about his behavior. 
I'll try to work in some dog analogies if I can.  Cleburne was a German 
Shepherd if there ever was one.  I would have hated to be across that line 
looking at his formation over there.   ----cgy

Isn't there some canine hero/heroine that is mentioned in one of the history 
books?  I would prefer waging the battle as a four-legged soldier, North or 
South it doesn't matter, we are here just to serve our Masters.

One hundred and forty two years ago today, the great great great grandfather 
of Stacy Dickson, a guy named Edmond Ruffin, when other sober minded men held 
back, stepped up to touch a burning torch to a big cannon pointed across the 
Charleston harbor at Fort Sumter and touched off the great Civil War. His 
rash temper caused him to play directly into Lincoln's hand and forever after 
it would be said:  ""The South started the war.""   On this anniversary day, 
Clyde Durham, itinerant journeyman energy attorney,  touches off his third 
consecutive reading of Shelby Foote's great American Iliad about that war, 
this reading giving him more sustaining energy to cope with his lacklustre, 
stressful career in the Casino than any other theraputic activity he has yet 
found.   The Civil War imagery and analogies  will be flowing soon.  I see 
Elizabeth as a daughter of old Virginia with the Sager homestead right there 
in the Valley where much of the action took place.  I'm not sure where your 
folks would have fit in Genia, but you will soon be  assigned the proxy name 
I can't think of at the moment, the Irish warrior who fought for the South.  
Unfortunately I am on the North side.  I hope this won't cause serious 
professional difficulties for us as we wade through the epic battles and 
their respective corporate analogies. ----cgy

Hi Carol

My home number is 713 864 4023 - weekends would work fine so give me a call 
any time.  

This heat is unbelievable. I've become weak in body and have recently only 
played inside at the Met - I'm playing this weekend outside for the first 
time in weeks - I'll probably get killed.  Just FYI  I will be out of town 
next weekend but around after that.  Anytime you want to play, just give me a 
call.

Lucky you - as I struggle at my desk dealing with the fallout from extreme 
volatility in Western power prices,  I can think of nothing more pleasant 
then holding a newborn (they never cry and don't eat that much - right?), 
luxuriously watching the drama unfold at the US Open.  Go Davenport.  Lets 
hope Martina fares as well.

Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.

Elizabeth

Before that though we have tennis scheduled (he'll kill me but I do have the

The libor curves are calculated using market data at the close of the day for 
swap instruments namely the libor cash rates (published on Telerate page 
3750), eurodollar curve (prices published on Telerate 910) and the swap curve 
(prices published on Telerate 19901). The interpolated spot curve is 
calculated using a boot-strapping methodology. Discount rates can be

I spoke with Richard and we will have to renew.  He is currently trying to 
get the PX bankruptcy court to allow us  to take back our security in light 
of the FERC ruling re chargebacks, but due to uncertainty of the FERC ruling, 
court has not been willing to allow us to remove. Richard continues on the 
case.  In the meanwhile, the PX/bankruptcy court will not allow the LC's to 
expire without drawing down.  So we should go ahead and renew.

Attached is a draft letter setting forth Enron's damages in connection with 
the termination of certain commodity forward and swap positions with PG&E.  
In lieu of sending out multiple letters and then aggregating the exposures  
for set off purposes, I thought it would be more understandable if we put all 
the matters in one letter.  For each product line,  I thought we could attach 
all the relevant information (I'm not sure if this is making it too easy for 
the court but it seems like the right thing to do). Each commodity line then 
would assemble the following and attach as an Appendix to the letter:

1.  Copy of Master Contract or applicable GTC
2.  Copy of transaction confirmations
3.  Copy of termination notice sent to PG&E
4.  Chart summarizing key commercial terms of transaction(s)
5.  Chart summarizing unpaid receivables and invoices for same
6.  Chart setting forth termination payment calculation for each terminated 
trade
7.  Paragraph describing methodology used to determine termination payment 
valuation (eg - 4 quotes secured, threw out high and low and averaged middle)
8   List showing quotes secured (entity, person, time and amount) and the 
extent available, written confirmation of such quote

I will be out of the office the rest of this week but will organize a call 
for early next week in order to finalize the PG&E package.  

Thanks for all your help.

receivables issue with respect to the post-bankruptcy/pre-termination period 
in the calculation.  Also, please note that there are still some brackets in

From today's Gas Daily:


=01+Three strikes=01, bill hits California

California Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza,
a Democrat, will introduce a bill today that will
make it a felony for any energy supplier in California
to engage in a conspiracy to drive up prices
or manipulate the market.

The bill would apply to any company selling
gas or electricity into the state or to any of the
state=01,s utilities, said a spokesman for Cardoza.

Under terms of the proposed legislation,
offenders would be subject to California=01,s ""three
strikes"" law, which sentences convicted felons
to jail for life after three offenses. Directors, officers
or any other employees associated with
market manipulation of a company would be
subject to this bill, the spokesman said.

Cardoza will introduce the bill at a press
conference today at 2 p.m. Pacific time. CD

 No easy solutions to crisis

The crisis in California is far beyond short-term
fixes parading as potential solutions, and
there is no turning back for deregulation in the
state, according to a report released yesterday
by consulting firm Andersen.

California has no choice but to forge ahead in
repairing the damage that ill-planned deregulation
measures have caused, the Energy Crisis in the
Western U.S.: Lessons for navigating regulatory
and market minefields report says. ""There=01,s a common
wisdom that knows you can=01,t unscramble the
egg,"" said Matt Smith, head of Andersen=01,s North
American energy consulting practice. All that can
be done is correct the mistakes, he added.
In addition, steps must be implemented to
prevent the spread of the California ""virus"" to
other states=01, electricity marketplaces, Smith said.

""To begin, in our view, the energy crisis in the
western U.S. has produced formidable challenges
for utility industry regulators, state and federal
policymakers, and industry executives,"" Smith said.
""The virus spawned in California requires new strategies
to contain and reverse the damage.

""The implications for the development of
competitive energy markets go far beyond the
western United States. Unfortunately, California
has taught the nation that regulatory and political
barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis.""

The proposed solutions put in motion by
federal and state regulators, as well as California
policymakers, have only led to an increasingly
uncertain market and tension among those
working for a viable resolution, the report says.

""In reaction to the breakdown, many of
California=01,s political leaders now prefer to abandon
deregulation,"" the report says.

The report concludes that power shortages
and blackouts are inevitable this summer. The
deregulated marketplace, which took a year to
throw off track, will more than likely take a number
of years to put right, the report says. MCM

Competing evidence clouds Calif. investigation

Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20
California Assembly
has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the=
=20
state=01,s current
energy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane=
d=20
heavily on a
report prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility=
=20
Southern California
Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.

But the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natu=
ral=20
Gas -- is not
ready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i=
t=20
recently presented
as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.

As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP=
UC=20
are pointing
the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde=
r=20
prices through
affiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against =
El=20
Paso is The Brattle
Group=01,s study of the California market.

Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman=
=20
of the
California Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20
Group=01,s market
study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not=
=20
caused by normal
market forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during=
=20
which Assembly
members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in=
=20
the California
market.

El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor=
t=20
presented to
legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence=
=20
of factors, not a
conspiracy, caused the price run-up.

Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa=
so=20
to conduct
work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20
concluded that the
increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the=
=20
main culprits in the
California gas price imbroglio.

Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,=
=20
said he
""didn=01,t see any smoking gun"" in either report.

""We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20
Study and a little
on the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20
legislature is the best
place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies,"" Campbell=20
said. ""I believe FERC
is looking at this situation "" and it would seem to me that that=01,s the=
=20
appropriate place.""

Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to=
=20
give support
to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. ""It=01,s being pushed=20
basically by the Public
Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion"" by=20
pipeline companies to
push up gas prices in California, he said.

The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20
assembly when
it had failed on the federal level: ""There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus=
t on=20
natural gas but on other
things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the=
=20
finger elsewhere for
the problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein=
g some=20
of that with the
public utilities commission.""

Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20
prices is a different
matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se=
em=20
to have taken
on a life of their own.

The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily=
=20
litigated effort to
force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20
participants. Following
on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out=
=20
The Brattle Group
report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20
major pipelines that
serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.

Several parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the=
=20
requested data
contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20
process to move
forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting=
=20
access to evidence
(GD 4/23).

Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their=
=20
case. The commission
recently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a=
=20
large block of
pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20
addressing the California
Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th=
e=20
California border
controversy obviated the need for more investigation.

The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a=
=20
hearing into
whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv=
e=20
up the price of gas
delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place=
=20
this summer. (RP00-

1.? Members of the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Subcommittee 
opened? hearings today on the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between 
Southern California Edison Company (SCE), Edison International (EIX), and the 
California Department of Water and Power (CDWR).? Testifying on behalf of SCE 
were SCE Vice President Bob Foster and Ann Cohen.? Additional hearings will 
be scheduled next week at which time the subcommittee will hear from 
representatives of the Governor, the Attorney General, and CDWR.? Among other 
things, committee members questioned the wisdom of acquiring the transmission 
system, particularly on an ""as is"" basis, the price to be paid, alternative 
structures that would not require an acquisition by the state, and the rate 
of return on new investment in the utility. 

2.? Also in Sacramento, the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price 
Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market is scheduled to continue its 
investigation Thursday on market manipulation.? 

3.? Governor Davis' representatives have been negotiating a transaction with 
Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the 
utility's transmission assets.? The Governor's representatives expect to have 
an agreement within one to two weeks. 

4.? Also today, Governor Davis announced the appointment of Richard Sklar to 
head a team that will speed the construction of power plants in the state.? 
The ""Governor's Generation Implementation Taskforce"" will work to bring 
electrical generation facilities on line by coordinating state permitting, 
siting, finance, design, and construction efforts in a ""one stop shop."" 

5.? At its open meeting this evening, the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC) approved an order addressing market monitoring and 
mitigation for California wholesale power markets.? Based on the FERC staff 
presentation and discussion during the meeting, it appears that the market 
monitoring and mitigation plan for California includes the following:

(1)? a requirement that all generators which entered into a Participating 
Generator Agreement with the ISO, and all non-public utilities in California 
that sell into the ISO's real-time market or use the ISO transmission grid, 
must offer all available electric capacity during all hours to the ISO 
real-time market, except for hydroelectric units.

(2)? all public utility load serving entities in California must submit 
demand bids in real-time markets during all hours.

(3)? all sales by market participants that have been granted authority by the 
FERC to sell power at market-based rates are subject to a refund condition to 
prevent anti-competitive bids into real time markets.

(4)?? the ISO is required to submit weekly reports to the FERC on scheduled 
outages and bid data to facilitate market monitoring.

(5)?? all sales into the ISO real-time market during a period of reserve 
deficiency (i.e., during Stage 1, 2 or 3 emergencies) will be subject to 
price mitigation.? The FERC order will include a formula that the ISO will be 
required to apply for purposes of calculating a proxy price for all such 
sales.

The order will also enhance the ISO's ability to coordinate and control 
planned outages. 

The mitigation plan will be in effect for a one-year period, and will be 
subject to periodic review.? The FERC is also requiring the ISO and the 
investor-owned utilities to submit a filing by June 1, 2001, to form a 
Regional Transmission Organization (RTO).? If an RTO filing is not submitted 
by that date, then the market monitoring and mitigation plan will terminate 
automatically.? The FERC is also directing the parties to work with RTO West 
(an RTO approved for the Pacific Northwest) to develop a plan for including 
California within RTO West, with a goal of ultimately creating one RTO for 
the entire western interconnection.? Finally, the FERC is instituting an 
investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act with respect to 
wholesale power sales throughout the western interconnection.? Apparently, 
potential refund liability would apply to wholesale power sale transactions 
in the western interconnection entered into for a period of 24 hours or less 
and made when reserve deficiencies are 7.5% or less.

FERC also approved the formation of RTO West, an eight-state RTO combining 
the transmission assets of nine utilities in the Pacific Northwest.? The FERC 
asked the RTO to make a submission to it by December 1 of this year on its 
plans for including Canadian transmission and widening the scope of its 
operations in a broader regional system. RTO West first submitted its plans 
to the FERC last October. It includes nine electric utilities serving eight 
western states with some 50,000 miles of transmission lines. The nine 
utilities include Avista, BPA, Idaho Power, Montana Power, Nevada Power, 
PacifiCorp, Portland General Electric, Puget Sound Energy and Sierra Pacific. 
The states where the RTO West would operate are Washington, Oregon, Idaho, 
Nevada, Utah and parts of Montana, Wyoming and California. 

A more detailed analysis of the FERC orders will be provided in tomorrow's 
update.

Mark

Attached is the draft memo. After you have had a chance to review, please 
call me with your thoughts/comments.  I would also like to briefly speak with 
John Klauberg about ""East Coast"" municipalities to make sure he thinks this 
policy works in the east as well.  John is going to call me early this 
afternoon.  Also, to the extent you think we should highlight financial 
trading policies like I have done, I would like Mark to review what is 
written (he did confirm that this is financial trading's policy).  Finally, 
it would be very helpful if I could get your thoughts on to whom we should 
distribute the memo.



Thanks

Larry:  In accordance with our conversation late last week, I am enclosing =
a=20
revised draft of the proposed standstill agreement that was discussed on=20
Wednesday.  My comments primarily involve the following:

(1) As you and I discussed last week,  I thought it made sense to specify a=
=20
reasonable date by which Enron and PG&E shall have reached closure on a=20
settlement agreement on the contract termination and related claims.  I =20
proposed a one month period to do that.  If the parties can=01,t come to an=
=20
agreement in that time period, then the =01&mechanics=018 in the MPA for re=
solving=20
a dispute dealing with the calculation of the termination payment would be=
=20
=01&reactivated.=018  Obviously, if we are making progress, the parties can=
 always=20
extend the date.  I felt it was appropriate to specify the window period to=
=20
make sure that everyone is focused on attempting to get a prompt resolution=
. =20
Assuming a final settlement agreement is agreed upon, the conditions of the=
=20
extension of the =01&stay=018 would be embodied in the settlement agreement=
 itself =20
(as opposed to this letter).

(2) Enron agreed at the meeting that it would keep the LCs in place while t=
he=20
parties were working to see if a settlement agreement could be reached, and=
=20
that requirement is reflected in our revisions to the letter.  Thus, the=20
revised letter provides that Enron will do this for the =01&Initial Extensi=
on=20
Period=018 (i.e., to May 25, 2001).  Your draft had provided that Enron wou=
ld be=20
required to keep the LCs in place even if no settlement agreement were to b=
e=20
reached.  My view is that any requirement to maintain the LCs beyond the=20
Initial Extension Period and any conditions with respect thereto, if agreed=
=20
to by Enron, should be part of the final settlement agreement executed by t=
he=20
parties, rather than as part of this letter.  Also, we note that, as a=20
contractual matter, the MPA does not require the non-defaulting party to ke=
ep=20
in place any security in favor of the defaulting party when, as a result of=
 a=20
termination, the non-defaulting party owes a payment to the defaulting part=
y.=20
 See Sec. 5.5.

(3) Your draft of the letter provided that Enron =01&agrees=018 to enter in=
to new=20
master gas agreements and consummate term transactions on =01&commercially=
=20
reasonable terms.=018  The revised letter specifies that Enron agrees to=20
negotiate with PG&E in these respects simultaneously with the negotiations=
=20
towards a settlement agreement, but any commitment on Enron=01,s part to ef=
fect=20
a contract or transaction with PG&E will only arise as a result of the=20
parties=01, execution of the definitive transaction documents (as opposed t=
o=20
this letter), the execution of which shall be in the sole discretion of eac=
h=20
of the parties.


Please call me at your convenience to discuss any questions on the foregoin=
g=20
or on the revised letter.  Thanks in advance for your help in moving this=
=20
forward.

Subject: Breaking News : Williams Ordered to Pay $8 Million Refund to Cal-ISO

From Natural Gas Intelligence:

Breaking News : Williams Ordered to Pay $8 Million Refund to Cal-ISO 
posted 10:05 AM (CST) May 1, 2001 


Williams Energy Marketing & Trading has been ordered by FERC to refund $8 
million to the California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) and has had a 
""prospective condition"" placed on its authority to sell power at market-based 
rates for a year as part of a stipulation and consent agreement.

The agreement, which FERC approved Monday, was in response to a mid-March 
order that directed Williams Energy and AES Southland Inc. to show cause why 
they shouldn't be found in violation of the Federal Power Act (FPA) for 
allegedly engaging in actions that drove up prices in the California bulk 
power market and potentially compromised the reliability of the transmission 
gid. The two companies entered into the agreement with FERC's Market 
Oversight and Enforcement Section to resolve all the issues in the show-cause 
order [IN0I-3-001].

Specifically, the agreement calls for Williams to refund $8 million of the 
$10.85 million in additional revenues it received when two AES generation 
units, designated as reliability must-run (RMR) units, failed to provide 
immediate service to the Cal-ISO in April and May. The ISO was forced to call 
upon other non-RMR units and pay a much higher price (near or at $750/MWh) to 
Williams. Williams is the exclusive marketer for power from the two AES 
plants at issue --- AES Alamitos LLC and AES Huntington Beach LLC in Southern 
California. The Commission also conditioned Williams' market-based authority 
such that it will have to bear the financial cost of replacement power if a 
RMR unit is unavailable at any time over the next year.

Significantly, the agreement does not find that either Williams or AES abused 
their market power in California. It rejected the California Public Utilities 
Commission's request to impose penalties --- over and above refunds --- on 
the companies. Moreover, the agreement does not put an end to the ""formal, 
non-public investigation"" that FERC ordered in mid-March into violations 
arising out of the conduct of Williams and AES.

Elizabeth,

I work for Georganne and we are trying to find all the pieces in the risk 
books.  It would be very helpful if we could get the appendices that are 
mentioned in the document below.  Could you help me with this?

thanks

Hello, attached below is an example of a monthly option and a daily option.  
The only difference being one is exercised once a month and the other is 
exercised daily.  The times that options are exercised varies by delivery 
point and whether the option is daily or monthly.  We can send you a list of 
these rules if needed.



Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
Melissa

Sounds great - I was at the Met last night doing drills and reserved a court

about having one of the pro's in training (Micky) drill us and I spoke with 
him and I think he would be available.  Would you'all like to do that?  Let

Hi Larry


I spoke with Peter Keohane and Mark Powell from our Canadian office and
they would be available at any time today, Tues the 8th , to go over the
Canadian Gas Master between ECC and PG&E.  Let me know what time works for
you.

Thanks

Elizabeth:  PG&E cannot accept the added language as you have presented it;
as you well appreciate, it arguably would have the effect of diminishing
PG&E's current rights.  I have accepted your changes and provided a revision
that I think more fairly preserves each party's status quo rights.  Please
keep in mind that PG&E already is agreeing to a modification of the LC
drawing events as an accommodation to Enron.  In light of that and of our
need to cooperate and move forward, I hope you can leave things as they
appear in this revision.  I'll try to call you tomorrow to confirm.  And,
thanks for attending to this.  Larry

Elizabeth:  Good to hear from you.  David Anderson is immersed in the
agreement, and he should be the one youwork with on it (415-973-6659;
dwa@pge.com).  By the way, we seem to have stalled a bit on finalizing the
stand-still agreement, which, as I last understood it, had only one
remaining issue, namely, the wording of the drawing provision for the LCs.
Can we get that one behind us, also?  Thanks.  Larry

Do we need a pre-meeting?   Quite honestly, Dynegy's position is not 
unreasonable - it forces the sinking utility to assume the transmission risk.
I understand the EEI position and long term it is definitely the right answer 
from a liquidity and MTM accounting standpoint and I will clearly support 
that position in our discussions with 3rd parties.

The ultimate goal for ENA is to go away from Into products completely and 
trade power within zones of RTO's or ISO's where transmission and congestion 
is managed by an independent operator with all transmission costs passed on 
to the load."

Ms. Sager,

The printer that was originally recommended by the IT technician for Genia 
FitzGerald is not capable of handling her printouts.  He has determined that 
she needs a larger printer and he recommends the following:

 Black/white Network Printer HP 4100N in the amount of $1,503.00

If this meets with your approval, please forward this message to Janette 
Elbertson.


Thank you,

Steve/Christian,

The attached file is a draft of an asset management agreement prepared by Stu 
Zisman.  The later version obviously contained more negotiated points, so I 
think this one is more helpful.

I'm working on a transaction now which involves serving load as well as 
selling power. I found this one helpful for issue identification and 
exculpatory language, however.

and I have been working on. As has been discussed, the Standstill Period 
would be until June 20th, the LCs would be extended until June 29th and the 
draw condition re 20 day expiry would be deleted.  

Please review the attached and let me know if this would be OK to execute

Joe & Elizabeth,

I received the revised document from Will Frederking, EESI Legal which is 
attached for your reference.  The only items that have been changed are in 
Special Conditions:
Second Sentence was divided into four parts (i), (ii) (iii) & (iv)
Ninth line ""or representations"" was added after the words ""any Affidavits""
Sixteenth line ""upon written request from EESI"" was added after the words 
""between NYSEG and EPMI, and""

Joe,  my proposal for Contract Price section is to complete with $3.65 / MWh.

Will provide the payments, billing and notices information as soon as I 
receive from EESI Legal Department representatives.

Let me know what you think.

Regards,

Richard

Attributes)

Elizabeth,

EESI would like to add the following to your revised Confirmation Agreement 
(red text only):

Special Conditions, paragraph (2) subparagraph (iii) shall be modified as 
follows:

""(iii) that any remedy that EESI may have against EPMI under this Transaction 
is limited by the remedy actually obtained by EPMI under the NYSEG 
Transaction (unless EPMI shall have failed to pay any uncontested amounts due 
and owing from EPMI to NYSEG under the NYSEG Transaction or EPMI shall have 
failed to deliver the Attributes received from NYSEG to EESI, in which case 
EESI shall have a claim against EPMI for the replacement value of the 
Attributes not delivered to EESI)""

If the above referenced change is acceptable please forward to me a revised 
Confirmation Agreement.

Regards,

Richard

Joe & Elizabeth,

I received the revised document from Will Frederking, EESI Legal which is 
attached for your reference.  The only items that have been changed are in 
Special Conditions:
Second Sentence was divided into four parts (i), (ii) (iii) & (iv)
Ninth line ""or representations"" was added after the words ""any Affidavits""
Sixteenth line ""upon written request from EESI"" was added after the words 
""between NYSEG and EPMI, and""

Joe,  my proposal for Contract Price section is to complete with $3.65 / MWh.

Will provide the payments, billing and notices information as soon as I 
receive from EESI Legal Department representatives.

Let me know what you think.

Regards,

Richard

		 Subject: XOM

Alas, no agreement to execute at this point.  We have come a long way, 
however, and only 2 serious issues remain open.  (All the others are at least 
mostly resolved -- see my 5/1/01 revision w/ marginal notes made during my 
5/2/01 meeting w/ them.)  This file is in my office with all the others.

XOM requires that all of its contracts contain 2 provisions, both of which 
are problematic for Enron.

(1)  The Federal Contractor Supplement -- exhibit F to the EEI Master -- is 
designed to assure XOM's compliance w/ the U.S. federal government's 
requirements imposed on all government contractors.  There are 2 categories 
of requirements:  environmental laws compliance and small business 
participation in federal govt purchases of goods and services.  Since XOM has 
adoped a ""General Commercial Plan"" to comply with such requirements, XOM has 
promised the U.S. govt that ALL its contracts will contain these provisions.  
And that's what the auditors from the U.S. government would be looking to 
ascertain in a review of XOM's compliance.  As for Enron, we do engage in 
business w/ the U.S. govt, but we have not adopted a ""General Commercial 
Plan,"" so we have to address these issues on an ad hoc basis.  Taking the 
last paragraph of this Supplement as an example (addressing the use of women 
and minority owned businesses by Enron in supplying services to XOM under 
this contract), at this point, Enron isn't really prepared to undertake such 
things and all those I dealt with on this seem a bit nervous about Enron's 
ability to comply.  I've communicated w/ Michelle Cash, George Wasaff, and 
Cathy Riley (at Calvin Eakins direction) on this topic, and I asked Cathy 
Riley to have her director, Calvin Eakins, phone me to discuss this further, 
but he did not call.  And there does not seem to be a very good solution to 
this.  XOM has suggested revising the language in Sec. 10.13 (based on my 
5/1/01 draft) to add a final sentence ""The Federal Contract Supplement is 
attached as Exhibit F and each Party shall comply with such requirements to 
the extent appplicable.""  This certainly takes care of all of XOM's concerns, 
but I'm not sure this gets Enron all the way where we need to be.  See, for 
example, Dave Nutt's markup of the environmental provisions (in the file), 
and Cathy Riley says there are no exceptions or exemptions to the small 
business requirements.  We might be able to get some outside expertise on 
this or get Sharon Butcher to help resolve it.

(2)  Limitation of Damages -- Article 7 waives consequentials, etc. for both 
parties.  XOM insists that this provision must carve out damages resulting 
from the ""gross negligence and/or willful misconduct attributable to its 
managerial and senior supervisory personnel"".  You can see the full details 
of the provisions they're looking for in the XOM language in sec 10.4 (same 
draft), the extensive indemnity language which they added in the last round 
and which we generally don't mind giving them.  But this impacts Article 7 
because the Enron version of the waiver expressly states that the waiver 
applies to indemnities, and, of course, XOM will not tolerate any exceptions 
to the liability of each party (yes, it's mutual) for the gross negligence of 
its managers, etc.  There's a true story behind all this that dates back to 
the EPA emissions requirements on Reformulated Gasoline (RFG).  Mobil hired a 
lab to do the testing, the managers of the lab company encouraged the testing 
staff to ""fudge"" the results, tons of RFG hit the market that was not in 
compliance, and a huge black mark on Mobil and zillions of dollars lost were 
the result.  And the contract provided that the lab's damages were limited to 
the testing fees, and apparently, that worked for the lab company.  So, it's 
a deal breaker for XOM  b/c they say that if Enron's managers decide to turn 
off the lights at all the refineries for some specious reason, they need to 
have proper recourse against Enron.   I''ve argued with them about this, 
based on the nature of this contract, the power trading business, etc. but to 
no avail .....  It would seem that Enron's language in Art. 7, w/ the 
following rather narrow change, might work for both parties, but it's up to 
you, now.
 UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR 
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST 
PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR 
CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE provided, however, that 
nothing in this Article 7 shall be interpreted to limit either Party's 
liability under Article 10.4(b).  
Let me know if you have any questions about this.  
Regards,
Janice

Thanks for the note - I had alot of fun on Sat. too.  I'll call you later to

call you back."

Can you met with Ella's school sometime mid morning on either Wed or Thurs 
next week.

On Colorado, we currently are scheduled to return on Wed the 22nd.  On this 
schedule we would miss parent orientation (Tues) and the kids would miss the 
first day of school which is a half day (Wed). Reschedule?"

Hi John

I will look into this - Part of the problem is also that I don't have an 
assistant (Brenda left a few weeks ago and my new assistant (Alice)( HOORAY 
), doesn't start until June 1st) who can approve or knows anything about 
invoicing.  "

Elizabeth,

Who will be taking over Janice's negotiations with VEPCO?  Their attorney, 
Shelley, called and wanted the new Enron attorney to give her a call.  Her 
number is 804-273-4149.  I apologize that I received this call this morning, 
but am not getting to you until now.

POWER SALES AND TOLLING ARRANGEMENTS
IN TODAY'S MARKET

On Tuesday, June 5, 2001, Baker Botts will be presenting an internal legal
training seminar entitled ""Power Sales and Tolling Arrangements in Today's
Market"" in the main conference room on the 13th floor of our Washington
office, 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue (The Warner).  Bob Bohme, of our Washington
office, will be the speaker for the program.  He will address a number of
drafting and negotiation problems commonly encountered in power sales and
tolling agreements.  Although the program is geared toward lawyers, it may
also be of interest to non-lawyers involved in these negotiations.

I have it on very good information that the Credit Dep't is staging a 
""workathon"" this week and Bill B. has promised Elizabeth that if we give her 
our top 5 CP's for whom we need credit input/info (credit worksheets, 
follow-up calls, etc.) - we will have the information we need by the end of 
the week.  Some in Credit have even brought their sleeping bags to the 
office. They appear to be taking this very seriously! 

So..... Elizabeth asked that we each give her the names of our top 5 
Counterparties for whom we need Credit input/info. We need to give her the 
names by 10 am tomorrow (Tuesday).

Greg and Peter

Pamela Hickerson called and wanted to know if I would be interested in 
speaking in Calgary in Oct. at seminar her organization is hosting. Greg I 
think you may already be speaking. Is that right?  Would this be a good 
opportunity?  She wants me to speak about US power trading contracts and 
on-line trading.   Any thoughts if this is worthwhile?  Thanks for you input."

Elizabeth,
Below is the one comment from Pacificorp on the CA that I had marked up.  I 
am attaching the markup I had sent to Pacificorp.  Prior to sending execution 
copies I thought you might want to look at it in light of the fact that the 
contingent call option portion of the proposed transactions would likely be a 
physical deal with EPMI.  I am taking the next two days off but will be back 
on Monday.

Glad to help.
Only need one change; I don't have Brent's e-mail address, but  I'll trust 
Sanjeev to forward this:
 
In Section 2, where it says:
""at the time of disclosure or is thereafter  acquired from a source other 
than the Disclosing Party that was not known  to""
add a comma between ""acquired"" and  ""from"".

I have it on very good information that the Credit Dep't is staging a 
""workathon"" this week and Bill B. has promised Elizabeth that if we give her 
our top 5 CP's for whom we need credit input/info (credit worksheets, 
follow-up calls, etc.) - we will have the information we need by the end of 
the week.  Some in Credit have even brought their sleeping bags to the 
office. They appear to be taking this very seriously! 

So..... Elizabeth asked that we each give her the names of our top 5 
Counterparties for whom we need Credit input/info. We need to give her the 
names by 10 am tomorrow (Tuesday).

Bill.  Does it need to be executed by an officer?  If so, Kevin could 
probably sign it.  Thanks.

David - 

Please review the insert that Entergy provided.  They have requested that the 
Into Entergy System Border includes... ""from an interface that has sufficient 
ATC posted that will allow for the purchase of Daily Network Designated 
Resources on the Entergy Transmission System.""

I am ok with this b/c the def of an into product requires firm trans to be 
avail to sink into the CA (Entergy in this case).  In the event firm is not 
avail, then supplier can take LD risk associated with non-firm trans.

Entergy agreed with this interpretation.

Also, because this is a large deal for them, they need to get approval from 
higher levels.

Please provide me with some feedback as this deal is critical to my trading 
position/strategy.

Thanks,
Rogers

Hi Andy

 I would not be able to make the meetings during the week of July 23rd but 
Carol could on the collateral annex. The WSPP is holding its meeting on 
August 10th so that also may not be the best time for people, but again Carol 
could likely attend the collateral annex meeting.  Hope all is well. And as 
always thanks for your help."

 HI Pamela

Sorry for the delay in responding (my external calls are not working) but it 
turns out that I have a scheduling conflict that will prevent me from 
speaking on Oct 11th/12th.   Thanks again for the invitation to speak - 
hopefully we will be able to speak again in the future.

Andy

Perhaps we could clarify the following issues at our next meeting:

* Is there a difference between credit assurances and performance
assurances?
* Is a guarantee considered a credit assurance or a performance
assurance?
* In sections 8.1 (c) and 8.2 (c), I am not sure that a margin call is
clearly defined. I believe that initial performance/credit assurance such as
a guarantee to support a collateral threshold should be excluded from this
definition, otherwise you would be reducing the overlimit amount by the
amount of the guarantee posted at the time of contract execution.

Your comments would be appreciated.

Subject:  Collateral Annex Activities



As agreed on the 5/31 conference call, Enron will prepare an annex discussion
draft which incorporates comments provided to the group.  Anyone wishing to, 
may

I have it on very good information that the Credit Dep't is staging a 
""workathon"" this week and Bill B. has promised Elizabeth that if we give her 
our top 5 CP's for whom we need credit input/info (credit worksheets, 
follow-up calls, etc.) - we will have the information we need by the end of 
the week.  Some in Credit have even brought their sleeping bags to the 
office. They appear to be taking this very seriously! 

So..... Elizabeth asked that we each give her the names of our top 5 
Counterparties for whom we need Credit input/info. We need to give her the 
names by 10 am tomorrow (Tuesday).

By copy of this email, I am asking Mary Cook to send to you a draft of the 
latest form of MNA.  This MNA , I believe, is still a work in progress and is 
intended to include  only  Master Agreements for which we are comfortable 
that the underlying transactions are commodities subject to the special 
bankruptcy code protections.  Hope it helps.

Elizabeth,

We are working on a settlement transaction which will leave a variety of
relationships in place with a group of financially troubled companies. We'd 
been
negotiating a netting agreement, and after you spoke to our group, it occurred
to us that we ought to take a look at your netting agreements for potential 
use
in our transaction. Could you please forward an example of one to me? We would
be netting with multiple parties on both sides, so it will be a ""rectangular""
netting arrangement, if I recall your descriptive terminology correctly.

Thanks much.

Paul Puchot

At the last EEI meeting there was a strong interest in beefing up the 
collateral provisions of the EEI (what a great idea).  Bill McCoy at Morgan 
Stanley was asked to prepare the first draft, a copy of which I am forwarding 
to you for your review. Please review and let either Shari or I know if you 
have any comments or thoughts - while EEI's message does not indicate when 
comments are due ( I have a call into EEI but have not yet heard back), I 
have asked Shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch 
with EEI within the next week or so.  Thanks for your input.

Andy,  As discussed, heer is MSDW's proposal for a draft version of a
Collateral Annex that can be used in connection with the EEI Agreement
(it would be advisable for a clause to be included in the EEI cover
sheet incorporating the collateral annex by reference).  We are offering
this draft as a starting point for the industry's efforts to develop an
EEI Collateral Annex.  Please feel free to distribute it and let Ed or
me know if you would like to have a conference call with others to
determine the next steps in getting feedback.  Bill McCoy

Tennis plan looks great.  Total time 1 hour 35 minutes.  No problem.  I 
played  last night with Grant and 2 other guys (only the second time I've 
ever played doubles with Grant) - my forehand/backhand down the line won some 
respect (thanks to our practice sessions no doubt) but my net game continues 
to be wobbly, shaky, timid, erratic , random.... in a word, pitiful.  So here 
is to continued improvement - See you at 1130 on Thursday, court 1.

Also Genia sent you by email our EEI cover sheet last week but she just left 
me a message saying you may no have rec'd it.  Did you get it?  If not I'll 
resend.  Just let me know. Thanks"

Broadmoor's ""professional"" tennis camp for the weekend of August 10, 11, 12

As you know, the next meeting for the Wholesale Electric Contract 
Standardization Group will be held this Friday, May 7, on the 4th floor of 
EEI's offices at 701 Pennsylvania Ave, N.W. from 9:30 a.m. * 3:30 p.m.  
Attached are the agenda and draft contract for discussion at the meeting.  If 
you plan to attend and have not already done so, please fax back to 
202/508-5673 the form sent to you on April 13, or respond to this message by 
using your e-mail program's ""ReplyTo"" function.  If you have any questions or 
concerns, please call Kathy Seaman at 202/508-5757.

Those still planning to reply to the book-out survey may send their responses 
directly to Caroline Goodson at cgoodson@schiffhardin.com for summarization.  
Should you have confidentiality concerns, you may send them to EEI at 
kSeaman@eei.org; we will then strip out any identifying material to ensure 
anonymity and forward them to Caroline.

We hope that the subcommittee groups will be able to report the results of 
their efforts so that we can devote time to these issues at the meeting.  
Please pay particular attention to anything in the contract that's bracketed, 
as these will be major areas of focus at the meeting.

Hi Karen

Going to the legal conference.  Lucky me. I get to go only for Wed. night and 
2 hours on Thurs. then get to fly to DC for meetings w MH and others 
regarding contract standardization.  

Your analysis is historically correct but recently we have changed our 
policy. The new policy is meeting w limited sucess.

Let me know if you need any thing else.

Melanie

In general, Enron would prefer all matters with respect to power go to 
arbitration for all issues.  When we first started trading power we limited 
arbitration because we were uncertain where/how the market was going.  
Accordingly, we limited arbitration to financial matters only.  I only raised 
the issue last week because the scope of arbitration came up in another case 
and we were uncertain whether an issue of proper termination would be subject 
to the arbitration provision or not.  In conclusion, based on today's 
policies (arbitrate everything), I would not think that there would be any 
reason for us to be concerned with preserving  an argument of limited 
applicability of the arbitration language found in the PCA Master.

I briefly reviewed your draft answer and will fax the comments to you shortly.

Thanks

Comments on the draft.

The language in 3.1 and 3.4 should be enough to show control of the 
generator's running status by EPMI (which has been delegated to Enron -SE 
Corp. for control area responsibility purposes).

In 3.8, Yes, EPMI would need to schedule the gas and electricity.  Please add 
""EPMI is responsible for scheduling any necessary transportation to the Gas 
Delivery Point and transmission from the Energy Delivery Point.""

5.2  Change ""energy"" to ""power""

12.1 As you discussed with Sam, this agreement would have to be filed at FERC.

First, on the Control area services agreement, (1) Add ""Area"" after Control 
in the title  (2) 2nd line-- should be ""EPMI to ESE"" instead of ""EPMI and 
ESE"".    Also, Whalley will be ""                        ""  (I'm checking what 
his title will be and I'll call you so we can finalize and you can initial 
it).

Second,  the LT purchase agreement that was filed at FERC between EPMI and 
SCC was a power purchase agreement.  The new agreement is a tolling agreement 
whereby EPMI delivers gas to Brownsville Power.  Would EPMI transport the gas 
on the pipeline?  or would ECT?  Several months ago, Stacy Dickson called and 
asked me if I knew whether EPMI could buy natural gas or transport natural 
gas  (as opposed to ECT, which does this under the FERC blanket, I think).  I 
told her that I didn't know and she said she didn't think that the particular 
deal she was working on would be structured with EPMI, so not to look into 
this.  Therefore, as I recall, I did not get an answer to this.  I also have 
not looked into the gas side of Genco (see note below).  I thought that Becky 
Cantrell and Julie Gomez handle the gas side for ECT.  If you want me to 
check into this type of question on the gas side, let me know.  I can also 
ask Sam B. who may know right away.  (I have not worked on the gas marketing 
side, just the pipes, so I would need to look this up.)

I had a thought this morning.  The three plants are fueled with gas.  GENCO 
buys the gas from ECT, and then transports it to the plant.  Is there any 
FERC reporting requirements related to the gas transactions?

3:30 a.m. in EEI's offices at 701 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 
20004.  A revised contract and agenda will be forthcoming.

If you plan to attend this meeting, please inform Kathy Seaman at

In the meantime, attached for the entire group is a Petition for Exemption 
filed with the CFTC on May 19 requesting that certain Electric Energy 
Contracts be exempted from CFTC jurisdiction under the Commodities Exchange

As you may know, a group has been convened to develop an industry contract
to trade gas.  The group is called GISB-Canada and as the name suggests,
they intend to use the GISB gas contract as the Base Agreement and to
modify the language to make it applicable in Canada.  At first, they were
just going to change language like ""MMBtu"" to ""joule""; ""jurisdiction"" to
""province""; and reference a Canadian Bank interest rate rather than the
Wall Street Journal.    They were going to stay away from what they deemed
""substantive"" changes.

I have asked them to reconsider this decision and to take the opportunity
to ""update"" the GISB, hopefully, in a manner that could be used
cross-border.  I have explained that most of our counterparties supplement
the GISB with their own Special Provisions and we could use these
supplements as a starting point for creating an Industry Standard GISB
""update"" that could be used cross-border.

In this regard, would you please send me a copy of your company's Special
Provisions so that I can forward them to Ian Anderson in Canada.  Also,
would you please put me in touch with someone in your organization that
might be interested in participating in this effort.  I think it would be
very helpful for the Canadians to hear about our experience with GISB and
gas trading in general in developing an Industry Standard Contract.  The
next meeting in Canada is this Wednesday at 12:00 p.m. (Houston Time) and
again on June 26.  I would like to send them something to consider prior to
the June 26 meeting.

Thank you so much for your help on this.

Dede Russo

I'm not sure what their issue is but the CFTC issue related to thier interest 
in being able to terminate their purchase obligations for a price.  This is 
the type of provision we can't have in the contract because of CFTC 
concerns.  Let  me know whats next."

Western Power Market Stands 'Poised on the 
Precipice' According to the ICF Kaiser Consulting
Group's 1999 Bulk Power Outlook

FAIRFAX, Va., June 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Power markets in the Western System 
Coordinating Council are ``poised on the
precipice'' of capacity shortfalls and extreme price volatility this summer 
and next, according to a new study of the regional
market by the Energy Practice of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``The West 
stands at least a one in three chance of
experiencing price spikes similar to those seen in the Midwest market during 
the summer of 1998,'' said Judah Rose, a Senior
Vice President with the Group and the director of the ICF study.

ICF's analysis of the West points to a number of key near-term implications: 

     Regional Capacity Deficits. The region is in a delicate supply/demand 
balance, with most sub-regions of the West relying
     on a capacity surplus in the Pacific Northwest to meet near-term peak 
capacity requirements. Because demand growth is
     outpacing new supply additions, those deficits will only become more 
extreme over the next two years.
     Volatility Exacerbated by Hydroelectric Dependence. A fifth consecutive 
year of above-average hydroelectric generation
     -- the principle cause of the Pacific Northwest surplus -- will again 
mask the West's precarious supply/demand balance in
     1999. However, if the drought conditions of the early 1990s resurface, 
the West will find itself at an even greater risk of
     price spikes.
     Upward Pressure on Prices. Prices are on an upward trend for 1999 and 
2000, the result of both higher regional spot
     natural gas prices and the increasing value of ``pure capacity'' -- the 
value of ensuring reliability for consumers. 

The study also evaluates the long-term future of the Western market and 
highlights the following key results: 

     Capacity Requirements Growing Steadily. The region's underlying demand 
growth is strong, creating a long-term regional
     capacity need totaling more than 18,000 MW by 2005, unless there is a 
serious economic downturn in the region.
     Energy Prices Trending Downward. The trend for long-term energy prices 
is for negative real growth through 2010, but
     the region will remain susceptible to near-term volatility while market 
institutions continue to evolve and new supply is
     slowly added over the next few years.
     Capacity Prices Rising Slowly. Current low capacity values will continue 
to rise (but still remain below many other
     regions) as new, more efficient generation is added.
     Strong Gas Demand Growth at Stable Prices. Gas demand for power 
generation is poised to more than double by 2010,
     with the most explosive growth in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest 
subregions. Even so, the West region's vast gas
     supply potential appears capable of meeting this growth with little, if 
any, real price appreciation through 2010. 

``The Western U.S. Region volume of our Bulk Power Outlook, along with the 
other five regional volumes, offers
comprehensive insights into the rapidly changing North American power 
markets,'' said Sudhakar Kesavan, President of the
ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``No other firm can match our analytic 
capabilities -- which are based on an understanding of the
fundamentals driving electric power markets -- and the knowledge gained from 
working one- on-one with the market's key
players.''

About the ICF 1999 Bulk Power Outlook

ICF's analysis of the Western market is part of the 1999 Bulk Power Outlook, 
an authoritative assessment of North American
regional bulk power markets through 2010. The study also provides the 
analytical basis for ICF's extensive and well-respected
consulting services providing market assessment, asset valuation, and project 
due diligence evaluations for the North American
electric power and natural gas industries. The 1999 Bulk Power Outlook is 
available for six regional markets -- West,
Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, South Central, and Canada -- well as a 
National Subscription, which includes the six regional
studies and a North American summary volume. Additional information on the 
1999 Bulk Power Outlook, including a
prospectus, sample volume, and order form, can be found at 
http://www.icfkaiser.com/consulting/products/BPS.htm.

The 1999 Bulk Power Outlook is part of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group's 
growing family of products and services. Related
studies on energy and environmental issues recently completed by ICF include 
the SO2 Allowance Market Outlook and the
Ozone Transport Region: NOx Allowance Study, which detail ICF's views on air 
emissions allowance markets.

Subject: TMOS Committee Meeting



To All Subcommittee members:

    TMOS accepted the Enabling Agreement with one exception, they
changed the language in 5.2 and 5.3 to the pre-May 19th language.  It
became clear that even if TMOS sent this issue back to our subcommittee
and the subcommittee voted to keep the revised language, that TMOS might
still not accept it.  The issue, as Kenneth Ragsdale put it, was ""who is
going to use the Exhibit ""E.""  To avoid postponing the Agreement going
to TAC, TMOS decided the issue in their meeting, which they clearly have
the right to do.

    I have  received a few more comments relating to scrivenor's errors
which I would like to clean up.  I will forward a revised final version
to all of you and TMOS by the end of next week.

    To all of you . . . job well done.  To Naim, who continued to
relentlessly push for the completion of this project, THANKS!

Margaret

Subject: ERCOT AGREEMENT



To all subcommittee members:

    Attached is the final draft which is being sent to TMOS for
approval.  Because the participants voted 7 to 3 to keep sections 5.2
and 5.3 as they are currently drafted, no changes were made to those
sections.  I reviewed and used most of TXU's and Southern's edits
regarding typos and clarification, which I appreciate.  If you would
like to see the changes, then go to Track Changes and highlight on
screen.

    Thank you all for your help. Hopefully this agreement will be
approved at TMOS and then TAC.  I will (or Naim) will keep you apprised.

Good morning, Elizabeth.

I thought I would send you the comments and suggested revisions I put
together when I reviewed the proposed master agreement.  Hopefully we can
shorten the negotiation process this way.
I look forward to hearing from you when you've had a chance to look this
over.

""A long time to wait"" - thats what Ella says all the time, only she's usually 
wrong and you are definitely right.  In the process of becoming dedicated to 
nothing but dispute resolution it appears I've lost my civility  .... imaging 
that  ..... becoming just like so many trial lawyers.

Steve is giving testimony today before the US Senate Comm. on Energy and 
Natural
Resources in support of the dereg bills.  His oral testimony states that TVA 
has
refused to provide us with the same service it provides to itself.  Both the
oral and written testimony seek a new NERC, comparable treatment for native 
load
uses of the system, and ""green tags"" at the generator (not traced through to 
the
end user).  He will also discuss recent transmission access problems we have
encountered (new tag requirements , unannounced scheduling deadline changes, 
TLR
cuts, wrong info on the NERC redispatch page, etc.)

		 Subject: Canadian Form of Physical Power Master Agreement

Please find attached for your information/review the final form of the 
Canadian Physical Power Master Agreement to be implemented and used by Enron 
Canada to trade physical power in Canada.  This form has been created using 
the EEI form of master used by Enron North America, the Canadian gas master 
and the British Energy Power Purchase Agreement.  Wherever possible and 
particularly with respect to many of the procedural provisions, such as 
billing, confirming, triggering events and the miscellaneous provisions, I 
have used the language from the current form of Canadian gas master both to 
create consistency between our Canadian gas and power businesses for our 
operations, systems and accounting groups and to hopefully make it easier for 
our commercial people to market the power paper to counterparties, as it will 
be very similar in many respects to our form of gas master with which many 
counterparties will already be familiar.

Regarding the power products tradeable under this master, further to a 
discussion Peter and I had with Jeff Hodge and Christian Yoder, the products 
described in Schedule A have been created based upon an amalgam of the EEI 
products and the WSPP schedules of products.  Given the uncertainty of how 
exactly the two Canadian markets that are set to open in 2001 will look, it 
was determined best to have a minimum of broadly defined products, which will 
be further defined over time as the markets develop, rather than trying to 
introduce a large number of complex products that may end up neither 
applicable nor appropriate and which would only serve to make negotiations of 
the form with counterpartys more difficult.

I would ask each of you to review the form and provide me with any final 
comments you may have at your earliest convenience so that Enron Canada can 
commence marketing the paper to counterparties.  In performing your review, 
please keep in mind that this master is intended to be an agreement that is 
cross-jurisdictional and, therefor, general in scope and nature and will be 
equally applicable to power trades in Alberta as in Ontario (or any other 
province over time).  Any jurisdictional specific provisions will be built 
into the confirms on a trade by trade basis.  Nevertheless, particularly for 
Rob Hemstock and Aleck Dadson, I do want to ensure that we have not included 
any provisions that may cause Enron Canada any concerns in Ontario or Alberta 
based upon our current understanding of how those two regulatory regimes will 
unfold.

Thanks for your assistance on this matter and I look forward to any comments 
you may have on the document.

Greg

review

Elizabeth and David,

Mike Robison asked that I send you a listing of the counterparties that the 
Y2K team has classified as Mission Critical in order to perform a review of 
the contracts for these counterparties in connection with the Y2K project.  
The attached spreadsheet lists all of the Mission Critical counterparties.  I 
have them sorted by commodity so you can look for power.  Please note that 
there are 2 sheets in the file.  The first contains approximately 140 Mission 
Critical counterparties.  We also added about 60 more that we are assessing 
and these are listed on the sheet labeled ""Tier 2"".  There is a power list on 
that page as well.  If you have any questions on this information, please 
leave me a message as I will be out of the office starting tomorrow through 
Monday, July 27.  I will be checking messages while I am out on vacation.




In addition, I am attaching the spreadsheet that we used to capture the 
results of our analysis of Houston gas contracts so you can see the format to 
use.

Subject: Jim Fallon in Charge of Power and Emissions Trading

Greg Whalley has informed me that Jim Fallon will now be in charge of East 
Power, West Power, and Emissions Trading.  This means that my boss will now 
be Jim Fallon rather than Greg Whalley.  I met with both Greg and Jim when I 
was in Houston last week.  Greg was very complimentary of the work that we've 
done here.  Greg has become extremely busy since his responsibilities have 
expanded from North American trading to risk management worldwide.  
Accordingly, he thought that it made the most sense to consolidate the power 
trading functions in North America under one person.

Jim was also very complimentary of our work.  We have been profitable for 6 
straight quarters --  exceeded plan in 1998 and have exceeded plan in Q1 and 
Q2 of 1999.  He wants to see this success continue.  Jim expects to spend at 
least one day out of every two weeks up here.  I am looking forward to 
working with Jim.  He has done an outstanding job running the east power 
desk.  This should enable us to increase coordination between the two groups 
and allow us to have a strong advocate in Houston.  While it's too early to 
say anything definitively, I don't expect much to change on a day to day 
basis here.  If anyone has any questions please don't hesitate to ask.

Privileged and Confidential.  Attoney Client Work Product.

Attached is a draft letter for your consideration.  Our outside counsel 
believes a letter like this would help us in our position that we do not have 
to continue buying energy when there is no transfer capability at the SDP 
because we know TVA will reject it.  Sending this letter is not critical to 
the sucess of our position but would bolster it somewhat.  Before deceiding 
to sent or not, I wanted your thoughts on how you think that giving this 
information to TVA would impact us, particularly given TVA's actions today, 
re acces to transmission through third party transactions.  Lets discuss this 
afternoon.

Thanks

Last week, the WSPP drafing group met in sunny California  to continue the 
slow and steady march towards a standardized, ""national"" agreement. Schedule 
C , the service schedule for firm transactions, was the primary topic and the 
following is a summary of where the group is headed.

After much discussion, we proposed  that the group consider the definition of 
firm energy  that Tim, Christian and others have been considering.  The 
following is proposed language (the base was EPMI's version) that the WSPP 
group is currently reviewing:

Firm Power is power that is sold and scheduled in accordance with applicable 
reserve requirements for which the only excuse for the failure to deliver or 
recieve are those set forth in Schedule 3.9 of the WSPP Agreement.  Seller 
shall take steps necessary for the power to be considered Firm Power under 
this definition.

Schedule 3.9 only allows interruption if (i) within agreed recall time, (ii) 
due to an Uncontrollable Force or (iii) power is need for native load; 
provided, however it was agreed that a party would neverless be liable for 
LDs if it interrupts due to native load requirements (this last point is a 
major accomplishment that apppears to have uniform agreement and will be 
implemented in the next draft - the group claimed that the ""optics"" are 
necessary to help traditional utilities).  As a further note, the group 
agreed to do away with all references to C1 and  C2 and have just one 
Schedule.

Changes from EPMI's proposed definition where  the result of the following 
discussions:

1.  Generated vs. Sold - ""Sold"" was elected over ""generated"" because the 
group thinks that it is the receiving control area that determines the 
generator's reserve requirements.

2. ""Schedule""  was added to bolster the scheduling requirements.

3.  ""Reserves"" instead of ""Operating Reserves"" was used because the group 
thought the word operating may be too restrictive.

4.  ""WSCC reserve requirements"" was replaced with ""applicable"" reserve 
requirements because the group thinks that the WSPP Agreement is national in 
scope and should not be limited to WSPP.

5.  References to Non-firm supply as being excluded from Firm Power was 
excluded because the group thought it was redundent  - no control area would 
accept a non-firm supply as being firm.

6.  Power rather than energy is being used only bacause that is the decision 
that has already been made.

This defintion will be further discussed at  the next meeting on Aug 20th in 
Denver.  Prior to that time, I would like to get your thoughts on how this is 
shaping up and what additions/deletions are appropriate.  I look forward to 
hearing your thoughts.

Thanks.
Elizabeth

Mark

Attached is the preliminary outline of a conference EEI is considering 
holding on November 17, 1999 to introduce the form of standardized power 
contract developed through EEI.  You will note that EEI listed you as a 
potential speaker.  EEI has also called me to discuss my role in this 
presentation but I wanted to get your thoughts first.  

Thanks

Subject: Conference on Standardized Contract



As part of our outreach process for the standardized contract, EEI is 
planning to offer a conference for the industry and regulators on November 
17, 1999 in Washington, D.C.  We would like to invite you to participate in 
the conference as speakers because of your roles in developing the Master 
Agreement.  I've attached a proposed program for the conference would 
appreciate your comments.  Not all the issues need to be part of the oral 
presentation, but could be included in the written handouts.

Please review the program to see which issues you might want to address.  Let 
me know if you are interested in being on the program, are available, or have 
someone else to recommend as a speaker.  As co-chairs of the working group, 
it seems logical to make Patti and Dave moderators. for the main sessions on 
the contract.  I've filled in some other potential speakers.  Also, we were 
thinking of having speakers on managing trading floor operations and credit 
ratings for power marketers.  Any suggestions there would be welcome.  If 
need be, we can set up a conference call to discuss working out the rest of 
the presenters for the program.

Joe:  I do not know if you have contacted I.G. George Prosser yet.  
Apparently,  the Hill & Knowlton bad press is all over today's local valley 
papers.  I spoke to two Hill contacts today who advise that if George Prosser 
appears at all reluctant to proceed,  please let me know and these Hill 
contacts will contact him directly to advise him to go forward as they are 
willing to lend him their political support.

Subject: TVA authority

Craven Crowell's authority to act without a full TVA board is limited by 
federal statutory authority to only carrying out ""administrative functions.""  
He is explicitly prohibited from carrying out ""policy functions"" without the 
other board members in place.  We know who the Administration intends to 
nominate for the two board vacancies, however, these candidates can only be 
officially nominated and confirmed by Congress sometime after Congress 
reconvenes on September 8th at the earliest.

Since I know you would like an immediate fix to your TVA control area issue, 
during the month of August you might pursue TVA's policy actions against our 
control area in violation of federal statute.  (In the meantime, however,  I 
am continuing to work the Appropriations strategy (best possible resolution 
date October 1, 1999) and the Authorization strategy (best possible 
resolution date October 7, 2000.))

Currently, the TVA Inspector General George Prosser who can be reached at  
(423) 632-4120 is in hot pursuit of Mr. Crowell.  He has successfully had 
legislation introduced to curb Mr. Crowell's authorities, and soon will issue 
a report (sure to receive much front page negative publicity) that Mr. 
Crowell ""lied"" to Congress by failing to disclose a TVA $100,000 monthly 
publicity retainer with Hill & Knowlton to a House Congressional Oversight 
Committee.  Ironically, this retainer was to help Mr. Crowell obtain 
favourable earned media.

We believe  the I.G. could easily be persuaded to pursue the wrong-doing 
caused by Mr. Crowell in developing TVA policy in the absence of a board.  If 
he pursues the case, he would likely immediate reinstate our positions during 
the investigation so as not to cause further harm, plus he could require TVA 
to pay damages if he successfully proves his case.  Regardless, this 
investigation would cause nasty publicity for TVA.

I have discussed with Joe Hartsoe what materials he may wish to provide the 
I.G. in order to help him make our case that this action ""created policy.""  I 
have also given Joe Hartsoe a listing of all of TVA's industrial customers 
likely curtailed during the heat wave.  We should contact a few of these 
industrials in order to also ask them to intervene against TVA's policy 
action on our control area.  These industrials could also claim monetary 
damages from being wrongfully curtailed by a policy that arguably reduced the 
amount of available power in the region.  

The down side is Mr. Crowell could pursue ""administrative"" retributions 
against Enron activities.

Dear Elizabeth,

In response to the recent business reorganization, we are working to=20
streamline Enron=01,s Global Internet addressing structure.  As a result, t=
he=20
messaging group has been working to ensure a timely conversion from our=20
current addressing scheme of ""@ect.enron.com"" and ""@enron.co.uk"" to a unifi=
ed=20
""@enron.com"" address. =20

A great deal of effort has been put into this project to eliminate any=20
duplicate addresses across Enron's Global Messaging Enterprise. Some of you=
=20
may find that your original  Internet ""short name"" was changed as a result =
of=20
your short name being the same as someone else's at Enron.   In addition to=
=20
changing to a standard ""@enron.com"" we have made a global change to allow=
=20
users to receive email  by short name and long name (see below).

This consolidation will become effective for all former ECT users, beginnin=
g=20
Monday, September 6, 1999. =20

 Internet short name:  esager2@enron.com

 Internet long name:  Elizabeth.Sager@enron.com

Please note middle initials may be used to uniquely identify individuals wi=
th=20
the same name and differentiate them as unique, all names do not have middl=
e=20
initials.
i.e. John.A.Doe@enron.com

Your old ""@ect.enron.com"" and ""@enron.co.uk"" addresses will continue to be=
=20
supported until November 1st.
When ordering your new business cards, we are recommending that users begin=
=20
printing their long name address instead of short names.
In order to minimize the impact on your business please begin advising your=
=20
outside contacts of your new address and effective date of Monday, Septembe=
r=20
6th as soon as possible.
If you have additional questions regarding your new address, please contact=
=20
your local help desk.

Thank You for your support in this global messaging endeavor.

in touch. I have suggested talk 5 in the pre-conference seminar, however, 
talk 3 is also available. I would be more than happy for you or your

working to a very tight schedule so if you could let me know ASAP if you 
could speak I would very much appreciate it.

Many Thanks

Three documents are coming your way by three routes:  1. the draft 
definitions for our confirms is attached.  2. the agenda for the WSPP 
meeting  is easy to get off the internet:  Brenda can put in ""WSPP.com"" into 
the search engine and pull up the WSPP homepage on which is listed the agenda 
for the meeting which can be printed out.  3. Jan is sending a monster fax of 
the latest proposed changes to the agreement.   

When you have all this paper, let's talk.--cgy

Enabling Agreement.  The copyright application is pending but I know of
no reason not to use it before the approximate 6 months it will take to
obtain the copyright.  In any case, as you all know, this agreement was
created by a committee of ERCOT members and their attorneys.  It is a
voluntary instrument and may be used by anyone choosing to do so (even
non ERCOT members).  It is not required to be used by any ERCOT member
or anyone choosing to do business within ERCOT.  It may be modified by

the agreement and as reflected in the disclaimer on page one of the
Agreement.

    Please call me with any questions.  Good luck to you all. I enjoyed

As we initiate the process to certify the Wheatland and Wilton Center plants

the control area company for the Southeast peakers, and EPMI entered into an 
agreement with Enron-SE Corp. for control area services.

I would like to create a new company named Enron-MW Corp.  Enron-MW Corp.

Elizabeth,

Following my e-mail of last week sending you a version of a new Dutch law 
governed pro forma Physical Power Master, I have since made some minor 
changes to that version to deal with typos, etc.  I now attach the final 
Dutch law version below, plus an English law version of that document.

Kind regards

Richard
I am attaching a revised copy of the agreement. TVA has agreed to these 
changes.
TVA supplied the basic changes and we intervened in a couple of cases where 
we did not think they met our agreements.
My  comments to are as follows:
I believe the second bullet is better stated than the original one we 
submitted. We support this wording.
In the last paragraph, if Enron also supports the wording related to ENNA and 
ENCA we need to include your name in the sentence.
Please disregard the original document and let's work from this one.
Thanks

Hi Christian

distributed later this week.  Contract ""rollout"" is in Nov.

I have scheduled a meeting for October 7th from 8:30 to 2:30 in room 3321 to 
recommence the project we began in January to review the existing 
Houston-based financial, gas and power trading forms.  All of you should have 
received a black binder labelled ""Analysis of ECT's Finacial, Power, Gas 
Forms""  which contains all of the long and short forms used for trading (as 
such forms existed in January 1999), as well as my summary comparison as to 
how each of the forms handles certain legal issues (eg, termination, cover, 
assignement, confidentiality ....).  If you did not receive or cannot locate 
this binder, let me know and I will forward to you another copy.  This 
analysis was done in January.   I am aware that some of the forms may have 
changed since then but have not undertaken to ""update"" the memo as we will be 
able to discuss such changes at the meeting.

The purpose of the meeting is to review how each of the Houston-based 
trading  forms has been structured and to note where there are differences.  
The ultimate goal is to determine what Enron's ""model"" trading provisions 
should be and to determine a consistent approach unless there is a justified 
rational for treating the commodities in a different manner.  With this in 
mind, I would hope to be able to create a ""modular type"" contract  whereby 
each legal issue would have a recommended approach, evidenced by language 
that will be approved by the group.  By way of example, Enron's gas contract 
prohibits assignement without consent, which consent can be withheld for any 
reason.  The financial form provides that a party can not unreasonably 
withhold its consent.  At this meeting we would discuss what the preferred 
approach is and then begin the process of drafting appropriate language, 
which language would be approved at a seperate meeting.  This  ""modular 
assignment section"" could then be dropped into all trading forms unless 
differences were required due to the commodity/product involved.

You will note that the analysis performed to date does not include all areas 
of a trading contract.  Similiar steps will still need to be undertaken with 
other provisions such as credit terms.  At the meeting, I hope to further 
discuss the additional areas everybody believes should be reviewed.

Aron Roffwarg, a lawyer  from Bracewell, will also be at the meeting to 
assist us in this effort.

Thanks

Subject: Proposed WSPP Firm Power Definition





The WSPP operating/contract drafting committee is meeting on October 7 in
Phoenix to discuss the reserve requirements for firm sales.  I would 
appreciate
your review and comments on the following as a definition for Firm Power for 
use
in the WSPP Agreement in lieu of the current language.  This language would be
inserted in Schedule C and replace Sections C-3.3 and C-3.6:

     Firm Power shall be interrupted only if the interruption is: (a) due to 
an
     Uncontrollable Force as provided in Section 10 of this Agreement and 
power
     is not available at the Delivery Point; or, (b) where applicable, to meet
     Seller's public utility or statutory obligations to its customers.  If
     Seller exercises its right to interrupt to meet its public utility or
     statutory obligations, Seller shall be responsible for payment of damages
     for failure to deliver Firm Power as provided in Section 21.3 of this
     Agreement or in any Confirmation Agreement.  If Firm Power is interrupted
     for any reason other than as provided in subpart (a) above, the
     non-performing party shall be obligated to pay damages under this 
Agreement
     or Confirmation Agreement.

Hi John - You are in good company - I never call or write those I care about; 
only my ""enemies"" get to hear or see me.  And if that doesn't tell you how I 
spend my time, nothing will.  Now that summer is almost upon us (its only 92 
degrees in Houston), I hope for more.  Give me a call and lets try to catch 
up this week.

Hope all is well for you.

Hi Smith

If a six week delay in responding doesn't merit a big I'm sorry I don't know 
what does.  My sincere apologizes in not responding sooner.

We have been looking for a power trading lawyer for about a year.  In March 
Mark H. decided that since we couldn't find one outside that he would bring 
in people internally.  Accordingly, back in April we had 3 internal lawyers 
move into the group.  As a result of this shift,  we are not currently 
looking for additional lawyers for power trading, but if things change I'll 
let you know.  Just FYI, there may be openings in other areas (finance, 
asset  development).  If you are interested, let me know and I'll call you 
back.  Also, I know that power trading lawyers in general are in hot demand  
...  other organizations may be hiring.  I will be up in Portland, next 
week.  Maybe we can talk then

Again, my apologizes on the long delay."

I have already got re-approval from the commercial group and the amednments 
are more editorial.

Attached is the latest EEI contract for your review.  If you have any changes 
you think should be incorporated, please let me know before the the 16th of 
November.

As you all are aware, I have been working with EEI to come up with the 
definition of an ""Into"" product.  I circulated a draft definition at the last 
EEI meeting.  There will be a conference call on Tuesday Nov.9th from 230 to 
430 to further discuss with EEI members.  Let me know if you would like to 
participate.  In the meanwhile if you have any comments on the draft Into 
definition I circulated, please get me our comments as soon as possible.  I 
will be meeting with the traders later today to discuss with them.  

Thanks for everbody's help on this project.  The end may be near.

Subject: Standardized Master Purchase and Sale Agreement



The attached Master Purchase and Sale Agreement represents the culmination of 
a tremendous effort by the Standard Contract Working Group and Drafting 
Committee.  Every effort has been made to be as inclusive in the process of 
creating this document as possible.  Many compromises were made in creating 
this contract and  is not necessarily everyone's ideal agreement.  
Nevertheless, the contract should be a workable tool that hopefully will 
benefit the power market.  A clean and redline version of the contract are 
attached.  They were prepared by the Drafting Committee and every effort was 
made to include comments received during and since the September 24 meeting 
at EEI.

At this stage of the initiative, it would not be productive to circulate 
non-substantive comments (word smithing/formatting).  On the other hand, it 
would be useful to send any substantive comments or questions about the 
mechanics of the contract and how the contract language might apply under 
certain scenarios.  The best forum to respond to your questions or comments 
will be the November 17 Power Marketing Transactions conference in 
Washington, D.C.   Accordingly, it would be helpful to tailor your comments 
to the conference program.  Questions, comments, and hypotheticals could be 
worked into the panel discussions.  Moreover, many of your colleagues from 
the Working Group will be on the panels or attending the conference.  For 
your convenience, a copy of the conference program is attached.  Send your 
comments to either Patty Dondanville, pdondanville@schiffhardin.com, or David 
Perlman, dmperlman@pwrsrc.com

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Hi Everyone:

    It was brought to my attention by more than one eagle-eye that there was
a typo in section 13.1 of the Enabling Agreement.  The PUCT substantive rule
was 25 not 26.  Attached is the corrected document.  The admin office has
this corrected version as well.

    Sorry for any problems.

I've rewritten Schedule C as I think we would like to see it.  This draft
defines firm power as we're used to seeing it in the East, and places a
separate requirement on one of the parties to provide minimum operating
reserves.  I wasn't sure who should be the default provider of the reserves;
however, I'm inclined to think it should be the Buyer.  Please take a look
at the attached document and let me know if you have any comments.  I
haven't circulated this to anyone else yet, and probably won't until I hear
back from you.  Thanks to all of you.

Happy Thanksgiving!

Have you seen this?  Obviously, I ended up speaking to that Dow Jones
reporter late last week, at the request of our media relations dept.  I was
horribly misrepresented.  Virtually all of the reporter's questions were
about the factual differences between the EEI and WSPP contracts and this is
what the article ended up looking like.

Christi

Here is a brief summary of the TVA/EPMI lawsuit - Let me know if you would 
like more information 

(Note - the MOPA has been filed under seal in order to protect 
confidentiality  - The judge was sensitive about this given the potential 
right of a party to get the MOPA from TVA under a FOIA - Accordingly, we 
don't want to encourage further invetigation of the MOPA by third parties)



*EPMI filed a declaratory judgement proceeding on November 15, 1999 against 
TVA in the District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.  Judge Edgar 
has been assigned the matter.

*The lawsuit concerns the interpretation of an option contract EPMI and TVA 
entered into on December 6, 1995 (Master Option Purchase Agreement (MOPA).

*The sole issue presented by the declaratory judgement is the obligations of 
TVA and EPMI under the MOPA in the circumstances where EPMI is unable to 
schedule for delivery, or deliver, energy requested by TVA under the MOPA at 
the Scheduled Delivery Point (SDP) if the available transfer capability at 
the SDP is not sufficient to allow the schedule or delivery.  EPMI believes 
that the MOPA unambiguously addresses the issue.  

*A trial date in late June 2000 has been set.

*EPMI filed a Motion for Summary Judgement on November 18, 1999.

As you are aware, the legal group has been considering EPMI's options given 
TVA's failure during the summer of 99 to treat Enron's control areas in a 
manner similiar to other control areas. 

 One option we have considered is the possibility of claiming monetary 
damages against TVA  for TVA's breach of NERC policies.  In order to make 
such a statement, we would, in essence, be required to assert that the NERC 
policies are a ""contract"" which all NERC members are obligated to abide by 
and for which the failure to do so could result in monetary damages.  One 
concern with this strategy is whether EPMI and/or its affiliates could 
possibly be damaged in other, unrelated  proceedings if it was determined 
that NERC policies were indeed ""contractual obligations"" (e.g., a third party 
claims monetary damages against EPMI for an alleged violation of NERC 
""contractual policies"").

It would be very helpful if you would consider this issue and get back to me 
with any thoughts or comments you have.

Thanks for your help.

Patty and Harlan

I received your emails.

1. I agree with Patty that I'm not sure the first section of the agenda is 
relevant other than in connection with the product descriptions.

2. I would like to add the Unit Contingent definition as a discussion point.

3. My apologies given, but I'm still working on the revised draft of the INTO 
definition.  I promise that it will be avaiable no later than early Monday.  
If at all possible, I will try to get it out earlier but I can't promise 
given current work committments.  I will let you know by Thursday afternoon 
if it looks like earlier is doable.

Let me know if there is anything else I can do.

Thanks

Subject: Re: Draft Agenda for 12/15/99 EEI/NEMA Contract Group Meeting



Athough I know that PECO had a variety of questions about the interplay
of the FERC transmission policies and the force majeure definition at
the Nov. 18 meeting, I think we should keep the Houston session focussed
on the Products definitions first, and only deal with the force majeure
definition as it relates to the other products definitions.  If PECO
wants to continue to explore the transmission points, or other FERC
policy points they no doubt will, but I don't think they go on the
agenda, and certainly not first.
I think it would be very important to attach current products
definitions to the agenda, and would therefore plead with Liz and Marty
to see if we can get those implemented and to Andy for distribution by
Friday.  Also, Mitch Dutton was the one with custody of the System Firm
definition, and I will call him today to see if he can get it massaged
and to Andy by Friday morning.
  I'd love to have a discussion, with traders present, about the
bookout issue, but I don't know if we'll have time.  The other ""global""
issue that the traders need to focus on (and will no doubt want an
update on) is the status of the efforts to get FERC on board.  Andy, can
we at least give them tentatively that we WILL meet with FERC staff in
January, and the tentative dates of the rollout sessions on the contract
in Houston and New York?  PD

>>> <HEMU@dynegy.com> Tuesday, December 07, 1999 >>>
Please take a look at this and give me your thoughts.  One area that I
believe
needs more work in particular is the item referring to FERC policies; I
think
this is PECO's issue, but I'm not sure what FERC policies they are
concerned
about.

I would like to attach the current definitions of the products to the
agenda.
Do we have a definition of the ""Into __"" product that has been updated
since the
November 9 conference call?  Is there a new defintion of the ""Firm
(LD-System
Reliability)"" product?

What about trying to tackle bookouts if we have the time?  Is there
any
conceivable way we will have the time?

Thanks,

I've been hiding in the weeds.  Hisss.  I agree w/ Patty and Liz that product 
definition should be the primary focus of the meeting.  It would seem most of 
the transmission related issues PECO (or Dynegy) have could be addressed in 
the context of the force majeure definition and how specific product 
definitions tighten or loosen FM excuses for non-performance.

I think we can represent that discussions w/ FERC staff will take place 
during January.  Our meeting coordinator is talking w/ Mariott about roll out 
meetings in Houston during the first week of March and in NYC late 
April/early May.  Let me know if you have any scheduling conflicts during 
those timeframes and I'll circulate some proposed dates w/ the product 
definitions.  Also, let me know if you are not interested in participating in 
one of or both roll-outs.

I will gladly circulate product definitions, but will be out of town after 
the 10th.  Could you CC: Patricia Young at EEI 202/508-5757 pyoung@eei.org 
with any definitions you want circulated.

Another topic I would suggest discussing briefly  if time is available is the 
results of the contract survey.  We have received many responses. Tabulation 
of the results should be done by our meeting.

Please take a look at this and give me your thoughts.  One area that I believe
needs more work in particular is the item referring to FERC policies; I think
this is PECO's issue, but I'm not sure what FERC policies they are concerned
about.

I would like to attach the current definitions of the products to the agenda.
Do we have a definition of the ""Into __"" product that has been updated since 
the
November 9 conference call?  Is there a new defintion of the ""Firm (LD-System
Reliability)"" product?

Hi John

Thanks for WSJ article.  Now if only you could notify senior management over 
here and let them know I would forever indebted (but hopefully richer as 
well).

TVA has sent us a system impact study agreement that I am having faxed to you 
now.  We have to send out on Thursday.  Do you have time to review and we can 
discuss tomorrow.

Here are materials I recieved from EEI in anticipation of the EEI product 
description meeting on Wed.   I would guess that the bulk of the meeting  
will be spent on the ""Into"" definition, which draft was prepared by David and 
myself, but we will also need to provide requested alterations to the other 
product definitions (unit firm and system firm).  If you have any 
questions/thoughts about the Into definiton, please call either David or me.

Subject: Agenda and Product Definitions for Dec. 15 Meeting



Attached is the agenda and draft revised  definitions for the ""into"" and 
""system reliability"" products.  These files are in Rich Text Format.

As part of our discussion of the product definitions, we will discuss the 
effect of transmission curtailments on the parties' obligation to perform.  
We want to focus on the words on the page in Schedule P.   If anyone thinks 
the words on the page do not accurately reflect the business people's 
understanding of the allocations of risk and responsibilities in trading that 
product, please let them come to Houston with alternative WORDS that they 
feel better reflect the business relationships that exist in the 
marketplace.  The goal of the Houston meeting is to have  FINALIZED the 
WORDS, so that the document is ready to present to the industry and FERC.

We will convene at 10 am and adjourn at 4pm.  Lunch will be provided. 
Dynegy's offices are located in Houston at 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800.  If 
you need directions or information about hotels, please contact Michelle

Elizabeth,

We have seemed to hit a brick wall in finding out who has monitored the fax 
machine we have discussed on the 31st Floor.  Don Black's assistant, 
Claudette Harvey said no one really collects the faxes and it is used by two 
groups.  Kay Chapman another assistant on the floor said it used to be 
monitored by Hub Gavela (sp?) but he is no longer here.  We called the 
service number on the fax to see if we could get a ""poll"" report listing all 
the faxes that have come in and found out this particular machine only has 
memory for the last 10 faxes.  I have called Lucent (the telephone people) 
and with approval from my manager they can give me a phone report of all the 
incoming phone numbers to that machine since September 1st.  Please advise.

Thanks,
Genia

energy under the MOPA at market based rates.  As you are aware,  the current 
plan is to send TVA  notice on Jan. 4th.   

The draft of the control area  petition should be ready for circulation on 
Tuesday, the 28th.   Once received, I will forward both the petition and a

Subject: Draft of Confirmation for Physical Transaction with Merrill 
(Moosehead)

As we discussed, attached is my draft of a confirmation under the Master 
Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement by and between EPMI and Merrill Lynch 
Capital Services, Inc.  In addition to the comments/questions noted within 
the Confirmation itself, I have the following thoughts/questions:

1) Note that the Enron Corp Guaranty is currently limited to an aggregate 
amount of $30,000,000 (this may become an issue late in the day when the 
folks over at Merrill figure out that this is one of the disadvantages to 
using a confirm as opposed to doing a sep. transaction with a separate and 
distinct Enron Corp. Guaranty);

2) Per Section 1.1 of the Master, in the event of any conflicts between the 
Master and a Confirm for a particular transaction, the Confirm governs;

3) Section 1.4 of the Master Agreement makes reference to a ""Qualified 
Financial Contract"" - is that applicable to this Transaction?  Might this 
somehow cause the accountants to treat the Transaction differently?;

4) Do we need to negate the reference to a ""Forward Contract"" in Section 4.6 
of the Master (Elizabeth we spoke about a concern that you had regarding this 
exact issue);

5) What changes should be made to the Confirm given the agreed to changes in 
the ISDA (Severability and Notice Update for example);

6) The last sentence of the Master appears to be missing some language.  It 
currently reads ""Disallowance of cost pass-through or any unfavorable or any 
Affiliate of the Non-Defaulting Party shall not constitute a requirement for 
a change to the terms of this Agreement."";

7) Should we still eliminate the last portion of Section 8.1(ii) of the 
Master to permit free assignment to an Affiliate (this previously was a big 
issue given our concern that we might have to assign certain rights to an 
Affiliate in the event of a bankruptcy).  Section 8.1(ii) currently reads:

  Neither Party shall assign this Agreement or its rights hereunder without 
the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent may be withheld 
  in its sole discretion; provided, however, either Party may, without the 
consent of (but with notice to) the other Party (and without relieving itself 
from 
  liability hereunder), (i) transfer, sell, pledge, encumber or assign this 
Agreement and all Transactions hereunder as a whole or the accounts, 
  revenues or proceeds hereof as a whole in connection with any financing or 
other financial arrangements, (ii) transfer or assign this
  Agreement to an Affiliate of such Party; provided, that such Party's Credit 
Support Provider issues a Credit Support 
  Document substantially in the form provided in connection with the 
execution hereof,; 

8) The draft of the Confirmation does not make reference to any of the 3 
""Facilities"".  Does it have to for acct purposes even though the only time 
that it was used was in the sections deal with gas supply (which did not make 
it into the Confirmation) and Section 6.2 of the prior physical agreement 
which used to make ""Buyer responsible for charges imposed on the delivery of 
Energy from a given Facility but related to the operation of third party 
transmission"" (this provision is not reflected in the Master and I suspect 
that Merrill would object strongly to its incorporation);

9) Did we ever determine whether the draft of the Confidentiality Agreement 
that I prepared was executed by Merrill?; and

10) The Master currently defines Stranded Costs but does not contain the 
standard provision regarding the same (should this be introduced???)

Per Chris Gaffney's request, attached for your review are blacklines of all 
of the transaction documents.  With respect to these ""near final"" drafts, 
please note the following:  (i) the Enron Corp.  Guaranty and the form of UIL 
Guaranty are being sent separately as well as part of the WPSA to highlight 
changes made to those documents from the prior drafts (they will appear 
completely underlined as Schedules to the WPSA); (ii) we have incorporated 
much of the comments from Wiggin & Dana with respect to Section 2.2 of the 
PPA Entitlements Transfer Agreement and Schedule 4 to the WPSA, but the new 
text may still need some tinkering with, particularly since the retention of 
the power entitlements by UI (coupled with the payment of the sale proceeds 
to EPMI) required a flow through of some conforming changes throughout the 
PETA; and (iii) the attached side letter relating to the RESCO Power pricing 
has not been reviewed by Enron as of this e-mail.  If you have any questions, 
please do not hesitate to contact Stephen Polakoff at 212-424-8350.

Attached please find the latest credit worksheets for the physical and 
financial transactions between EPMI and Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc.  
The credit worksheet for the physical transaction is in the form of a 
specific confirmation that will be confirmed under the existing Master Energy 
Purchase and Sale Agreement between EPMI and Merrill Lynch Capital Services.  
The credit worksheet for the financial transaction is in the form of a new 
ISDA Master Swap Agreement.  Per Bill Bradford, please note that Credit 
approval for both worksheets are contingent upon legal approval by Mark 
Haedicke of the physical and financial setoff/netting assumption.

I have requested and am waiting approval from Jeff McMahon to accept the 
counterparty's request to set the third party cross-default amount of 
$50,000,000.  For the purposes of these credit worksheets, the amount 
proposed remains at $100,000,000 for both parties.

Please call should you have any questions, x3-0554.

Enclosed are those documents I believe would be impacted if we elect to use 
separate Credit Support Annexes, one for the new EPMI ISDA and one for the 
Power Master (already in existence (""Old CSA"")).  

 1. New Credit Support Annex - to be attached to EPMI/ML ISDA (""New CSA"").  
Draft enclosed, including one marked to show changes from CSA currently in 
place between ENA and ML.

 2. Schedule to ISDA - Part 4(F) would reflect New CSA rather than Old CSA.  
Revised Schedule attached.

 3. No Amendment to Power Agreement would be required.  (Delete document 
named ""Power Amendment 1).

Subject: Project Moosehead - Revised Terms

Pursuant to my recent conversation with Rodney Malcolm, I am detailing below 
newly negotiated terms that have been accepted by Credit in regards to the 
contracts/confirms for the Merrill Lynch physical and financial transactions:

on behalf of EPMI, Enron Corp. will provide a $60MM guaranty to Merrill Lynch 
Capital Services covering exposures under both Master contracts (either amend 
existing $30MM physical guaranty or supersede existing guaranty with a new 
guaranty)
usage of the the stair-step Threshold that is currently in the Credit Support 
Annex (Paragraphe 13) of the existing Master power contract will remain 
effective for the specific power confirmation.  However, the valuation of the 
parties' exposure will be defined as exposures under the existing physical 
power Master agreement as well as the new financial ISDA Master.  [both the 
physical confirmation and the ISDA Master will need to reference this 
stair-step Threshold provision that will govern margin calls under both 
transactions]
deletion of the investment grade MAC for both credit worksheets (replaced by 
stair-step Threshold discussed above)
third party cross-default amounts:  Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. is $100MM and 
Enron Corp. is $50MM (contingent upon approval by Andy Fastow or Jeff 
McMahon.  I have left a voice message and an email for Jeff McMahon 
requesting approval of the third-party cross-default exception.)

Hi

Give me a call about Duke's changes.  I also disagree w (ii) and really think 
even (i) is wrong since an Option can either be in the money or out of the 
money and in either case the full value should be taken and netted against 
other Gains and Losses.

Happy New Year

Jim,
I wanted to confirm that you had received the copy of the NDA that I sent
12/29.

Tomorrow (Wed. 1/5) will be the last day that I am in the office and
available to interact with your legal guys before our meeting on 1/7.  I
will assume, if I have not heard from Enron before 1/6, that the agreement
is acceptable as sent and that we can execute the document when I arrive on
Friday.

Regards,
Trent

At 10:45 am today, Jan 6th, we sent a notice to TVA advising them that a 
Triggering Event under the MOPA had occurred.  As a result of the Triggering 
Event, EPMI has the right to suspend deliveries and/or to terminate the 
MOPA.  At this point, we have not elected to suspend deliveries or to 
terminate the MOPA.  Accordingly, our performance under the MOPA at this 
point will not be impacted and we will continue to perform under the terms of 
the MOPA. 

 The letter also sets forth a proposal to TVA pursuant to which EPMI would be 
willing to continue performing under the MOPA.  This proposal is conditioned 
on  TVA allowing EPMI to seek a judicial determination of its rights and  TVA 
paying market-based rates for the energy delivered by EPMI to TVA under the 
MOPA  pending the judicial proceedings.

If you have any questions, please call me at 36349."

Attached is a memo from Julia about a meeting going over some of the deals, 
including power deals, that were closed last year.  Background information on 
the deals could be helpful as several of these deals are likely to be 
administered by power trading.  Let LindaNoske  know if you can make it

Subject: FREE LUNCH!

There IS such a thing as a free lunch (but you have to come to this meeting 
to get it).

On Tuesday, January 11, Chris Gaffney, Stuart Zisman, Dan Lyons and Karen 
Jones will discuss their experiences with some recently completed  
transactions.  These structured commodity deals were unique and interesting 
transactions, and transactions similar to these are expected to represent a 
growing portion of ENA's business.  This will be a good opportunity to find 
out more about this part of ENA's business, and to find out what our 
colleagues have been working on so hard over the past several months.

The transactions that we will discuss on Tuesday are only a few of the many 
deals that have been closed or are in the works, and additional meetings will 
be scheduled to learn more about some of these other transactions.  If there 
is a particular transaction that you would like to know more about, please 
let me know.      

On the agenda for Tuesday:

Chris Gaffney  -- United Illuminating
Stuart Zisman -- Project Doyle
Dan Lyons -- Project Saguaro
Karen Jones -- Project Big Horn (subject to Karen's availability)

The meeting will be held from 11:30 to 1:30 in EB30C1.

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE

The following is the current schedule for certain actions EPMI has taken or 
is contemplating taking relating to TVA:

Jan 6 -  MOPA- Sent notice to TVA by fax stating that a Triggering Event 
occurred and asking TVA to consider our  proposal in order to continue the 
MOPA in  effect (to date, there has been no response from TVA) 

Jan 24 - Operations - Cut transmission line for 2000 peaker

Jan 26 - MOPA - Notify TVA that EPMI is suspending deliveries under the MOPA  
effective Jan 27 and terminating the  MOPA by selecting an Early Termination  
Date ( which date may be no earlier than 10 Business Days after delivery of 
notice)

Feb 4 - Control Area - File complaint  relating to TVA's actions against 
EPMI's control areas, which lawsuit would be filed in the Eastern District of 
Tenn. (Judge  Edgar) as part of the already filed lawsuit on the interface 
issues

If you have any questions or concerns with this schedule, please notify me 
immediately.  

Unless there are any objections, we will proceed on this basis; provided, 
however, if we hear from Mike Miller that the target operations date of Jan 
24th can not be met, we would then propose to expedite this schedule.  If we 
move up any of these actions, we will notify everybody,

John and Sam


It would be great if you would follow this for us.  Please forward things to 
me.  Just FYI, PCA has sued us in the bankruptcy, for among other things, 
wrongful termination.  

Call with any questions.

Shelly Mansfield has drafted the attached Q&A and timeline in anticipation of 
our lawsuit against TVA regarding our control area.  Please review these 
materials and let me know if this is the approach we want to take if and when 
we receive inquiries.  Also attached is a standby statement if we receive 
inquiries about EPMI's letter to TVA about the MOPA.   We will probably want 
to revise this statement if the situation escalates.  

Thank you.

Subject: TVA - Time schedule for EPMI's actions  


	

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE

The following is the current schedule for certain actions EPMI has taken or 
is contemplating taking relating to TVA:

Jan 6 -  MOPA- Sent notice to TVA by fax stating that a Triggering Event 
occurred and asking TVA to consider our  proposal in order to continue the 
MOPA in  effect (to date, there has been no response from TVA) 

Jan 24 - Operations - Cut transmission line for 2000 peaker

Jan 26 - MOPA - Notify TVA that EPMI is suspending deliveries under the MOPA  
effective Jan 27 and terminating the  MOPA by selecting an Early Termination  
Date ( which date may be no earlier than 10 Business Days after delivery of 
notice)

Feb 4 - Control Area - File complaint  relating to TVA's actions against 
EPMI's control areas, which lawsuit would be filed in the Eastern District of 
Tenn. (Judge  Edgar) as part of the already filed lawsuit on the interface 
issues

If you have any questions or concerns with this schedule, please notify me 
immediately.  

Unless there are any objections, we will proceed on this basis; provided, 
however, if we hear from Mike Miller that the target operations date of Jan 
24th can not be met, we would then propose to expedite this schedule.  If we 
move up any of these actions, we will notify everybody,

Also, date of filing is wrong.  We want to file this Friday, the 21st.

Let me know if you have any thoughts/changes.

Jim, Christi-

I thought that at some point this might come up again.  So, I went through 
all of the PUC/PSC websites and pulled Enron's licenses (both EPMI and EES) 
to do business in certain states.  I have attached this to you.




Thanks.

Subject: Maine retail license for EPMI

Here are comments on the draft:

12.  ""Location, if any, of any office available to the general public or 
Maine customers:""  The draft says ""N/A"".  Shouldn't we put in Houston 
office?  Dan A's office?

13.  Customer rep. --Ramona in Dublin is EES customer rep.  Who will be ENA's?

15.  Should EPMI's response be limited to supplied RETAIL electricity in 
these jurisdictions?  Otherwise, all 48 states should be listed for EPMI.  
Also, the current EES sales in NEPOOL (New Hampshire and Rhode Island, I 
think) are made by EPMI.  There was/is also a retail sale in the MAPP area by 
EPMI, I think.

21.  EES' response is not exactly true with regard to EPMI, since it has been 
involved in civil legal actions.  However, does this really request any civil 
cases?  Can we answer by saying ""no enforcement proceedings by any state in 
which EPMI is providing retail sales of electricity?"" 

Tom, The application says ""Q"" is attached as other supporting material, but I 
can't find Q.  Also, you marked the Annual Electric Utility Report for 1998 
as ""A"", but I am not sure where it should go (""A"" is already answered.)

Thanks for the information.

Tom has answered some questions:

12.  EES answered ""NA""; however, Dan, is this OK?

13.. Ramona Richards checked with someone and told Tom that she should be 
listed for EPMI.

15.  The Rhode Island web site only lists ""ECT"" as a retail seller, not 
EPMI.  Is this OK?

The A attachment is now inserted with the annual report and Jeff Hodge is

these jurisdictions?  Otherwise, all 48 states should be listed for EPMI.  
Also, the current EES sales in NEPOOL (New Hampshire and Rhode Island, I 
think) are made by EPMI.  There was/is also a retail sale in the MAPP area by 
EPMI, I think.

21.  EES' response is not exactly true with regard to EPMI, since it has been 
involved in civil legal actions.  However, does this really request any civil 
cases?  Can we answer by saying ""no enforcement proceedings by any state in 
which EPMI is providing retail sales of electricity?"" 

Tom, The application says ""Q"" is attached as other supporting material, but I 
can't find Q.  Also, you marked the Annual Electric Utility Report for 1998 
as ""A"", but I am not sure where it should go (""A"" is already answered.)

Thanks for the information.

Attached is a re-write of Product B, based on a general agreement between
Harlan and myself.  I apologize but I had a tremendous amount of problems
with redlining, and so have sent you a document that accepted all changes.
Hopefully someone has a comparerite program.  Andy would you please
circulate this product.  I will be glad to write up a summary in plain
English if you think that would be helpful.   All errors are my
responsibility alone, not Harlan's!  Look forward to seeing you on Wed.
Marji

PS: My email was wiped out since 1/3, what time do we meet, and would you
please provide Reliant's address.  Thanks.  M.

The EES application states that EES will not be serving residential customers 
so it is OK not to have a local office.

I don't know why RI lists ECT, not EPMI.

Here are comments on the draft:

12.  ""Location, if any, of any office available to the general public or 
Maine customers:""  The draft says ""N/A"".  Shouldn't we put in Houston 
office?  Dan A's office?

13.  Customer rep. --Ramona in Dublin is EES customer rep.  Who will be ENA's?

15.  Should EPMI's response be limited to supplied RETAIL electricity in 
these jurisdictions?  Otherwise, all 48 states should be listed for EPMI.  
Also, the current EES sales in NEPOOL (New Hampshire and Rhode Island, I 
think) are made by EPMI.  There was/is also a retail sale in the MAPP area by

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE

 By letter dated January 24th, TVA rejected  EPMI's offer to continue 
performance under the MOPA at market prices.   Accordingly, we sent a letter 
to TVA today, January 25th, at 4:00 notifying TVA that (1) EPMI was 
suspending deliveries under the MOPA effective Thursday, January 27th and (2) 
EPMI intended to exercise its termination rights unless TVA agreed to our 
proposal to continue performance under the MOPA pending a judicial 
determination of whether a Triggering Event occurred under the MOPA.

 Please call me if you have any questions. 

  Copies of the letter will be distributed later today.

Greg, I am not sure where we are on finalizing the Power (Physical) Master, 
but I read it again on the plane and have some minor clean-up matters.  I 
think you should set up a meeting next week b/w Milly, me and you to take 
Milly's comments and discuss and some business points with him.  You should 
also set up a meeting with Hemstock and Dadson to take their comments re: 
market operations.  Lastly you should set up a call with Hodge and Sager to 
get there comments.  I would like to have the Master signed off by end of 
next week.

Subject: Short Form (GTC) Physical Power Trading Document

Does ENA have a short form physical power trading document or GTC that it 
uses for short term power transactions for counterparties with whom it does 
not have a master?  As ECC is preparing its physical power trading documents 
right now, we need to also prepare a form of GTC and I thought that, since 
the EEI master was so helpful in my preparation of ECC's form of master, your 
form of GTC would be helpful as well.  If possible, could you e-mail the 
document to me?  I am hoping to put our form together next week.

Cheers

Greg

 EPMI filed an amended petition with the court in Tennessee where EPMI's 
current declaratory judgment action (interface issue) is pending alleging 
that TVA violated NERC rules as a result of TVA's actions during the summer 
of 99.  In order to amend the current petition to include this additional 
claim, EPMI needs the courts approval. 

 Please call me if you have any questions.

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE

 Pursuant to a letter faxed to TVA today, January 27th, we notified TVA that 
EPMI was terminating the MOPA effective February 11, 2000 (earliest date 
permitted under the MOPA).  At the same time, we filed an amended petition 
with the court in Tennessee where EPMI's current claim against TVA (interface 
issue) is pending seeking a declaratory judgment that EPMI had the right to 
terminate the MOPA.  In order to include this additional claim in the already 
filed petition, we will need the approval of the court.

   Copies of the letter will be distributed later .

Hi Andy

I read through all of your Article this weekend . 

 What a job!  

I will forward to you this afternoon or first thing tomorrow an electronic 
copy of my suggested changes, which also attempts to pick up those given to 
me by Dede.  After you receive it, I thought it might be helpful to talk over 
the changes so you can see where I was coming from.

Thanks

Subject: Southern Company RFP

Elizabeth, 
Could you please review Alabama Power's attached Terms and Conditions.  All 
bidders must clearly state exceptions to these T&Cs in their offer.  They say 
any exceptions will affect the value of the offer to Southern.

In addition, you should have received last week three summaries regarding 
interconnection structures with Southern at Caledonia.  That interconnection 
review you are doing and this review of the T&Cs are necessary for us to bid 
on the RFP on Feb. 24th.  So if you could get back to me on Feb. 18st, that 
will give me a few days to formulate a proposal.  Also, depending on what you 
think the feasibility of an interconnection is, I may not submit a proposal 
at all since it costs $10,000 to propose.

Thanks for your assistance, please do not hesitate to call me with your 
thoughts - Mike

Subject: Duke Info

David,  Sorry I had to jump off our conversation earlier, I had a guy on the 
other line that I having been trying to catch for a while.   I will meet you 
up at Elizabeth's office  at 3:30pm to talk.  Attached is the e-mail proposal 
I recently sent Duke.  Other verbal understandings that have been exchanged 
are:

1.  Duke would be allowed 50 starts per year (June through May each year).  
Each start after 50/yr will have a $1500 per start charge.
2.  Duke gets 1 start per day

Duke has asked for Force Majeure and Availability language, so I guess we 
need to write up a standard PPA contract with all the standard language to 
provide them.  Kevin Presto has provided me the following information on how 
we want to proceed with the Availability issue:

Monthly Availability Calc. = MWHs delivered by Seller(in Month) / MWHs 
Scheduled by Buyer (in Month)

Base Payment = 100% of Demand Payment (Availability = 93% to 95%)

Penalty Payment = 1% bonus for every 1% Availability above 95%
Bonus Payment = 1% penalty for every 1% Availability below 93%

Note: Force Majeure is excluded from Availability Calc. if < 90 days

Thanks for your assistance.  Give me a call if you have any questions, - Mike

Randy Petersen, VP in our Underwriting Group, is meeting with CanFibre 
tomorrow afternoon (Wed. Feb 9th).  He has asked if we can pull together the 
outstanding A/R amounts, date invoiced, and any other pertinent information 
he can take with him to the meeting.

Can you gather this information Wednesday morning and let me know when that 
will be available?

Kevin:

I work in Portland in West Power tradng and have day-to-day responsibility 
for managing the Can Fibre account.  Since this deal started in Sept. they 
have only paid one invoice and that was paid 16 days late.  They are 
currently 57 days late on one outstanding invoice and 29 days late on 
another.  They have failed to come up with $ despite two ""heart-to-heart"" 
discussions with Dale Hrcak about this issue.  Stone and Webster, the firm 
building their Riverside plant, I guess controls the cash during this 
start-up period and Dale cannot get them to release funds.  They seem 
disorganized and fail to give us straight answers on when we will be paid.  
If Enron did not own a piece of this company I would be talking to credit and 
legal about whether or not Can Fibre is in default and what steps we should 
take to require collateral and/or termiante this agreement.  Instead, Jake 
Thomas indicated that I should talk to you re: next steps. Could you give me 
a call at 503/464-3822 and give me uyour thoughts? 

Thanks!

Chris

Tuesday works great for me. 

 As we discussed at the last meeting in Houston, I have begun, but not yet 
finished, revisions to Product B.  I have several questions and will need 
input from others as how best to proceed on some issues.  I spoke w Harlan 
briefly but would appreciate further input, particularly on the ""one-time, 
good faith effort"" to find an ADI.  I will call Harlan and Marjie to further 
discuss.  A draft will be circulated before the Tuesday call.

Thanks

Liz,
 I've thought over the things we discussed this morning in my performance 
review and am concerned that my next review may be impacted.  I therefore 
feel it is very important for me to take a proactive role in order to assure 
that I will receive a good review from you and my other assignments at the 
end of the year.  Since I want to perform my job in a way that is totally 
satisfactory to all of my assignments, I would like to suggest you and I meet 
once a week between now and the end of the year to discuss any issues 
regarding my performance and regarding my work product  that has been brought 
to your attention.  I also plan to periodically discuss my performance with 
the other attorneys I am assigned to.  I feel that by staying completely on 
top of the situation, I will greatly improve my working relationship with you 
and my other assignments.  

 If you have any other suggestions that would be of help to me, I certainly 
would appreciate your immediate input.  "

Enclosed is a revised Term Sheet, one copy of which has been marked to show 
changes from Fred's last draft.  

The Term Sheet is intended to be in no way binding;  references to  the 
proposal being held  ""open"" have been deleted.  Also, I have not attempted to 
include any reference to SD Warren having the right to receive the financial 
benefits if EPMI resells the Power not used by SD Warren to NEPOOL at a price 
higher than the Contract Price (CFTC concerns).

Dan - Could you please help me fix the definition of ""Green Requirement"".

Fred - I wanted to stick to ""would"" instead of ""will""  as the operative verb 
in order to emphasize the non-binding nature of the proposal. 

If you have any questions or comments, please call me.  I will not be in the 
office on Friday.  In my absence, please call Leslie Hansen at 36121.

Shari and Elizabeth,

     We revised our CAISO language to address the 10 minute pricing
implemented recently.  See attached.  Do you plan to change your language
also?  As you can see, I took the easy way out and did not reference either
the 10 minute price or the Hourly Ex Post Price -- I just said the price
paid to CAISO by the Buyer.  Do you think this works?

Andy
 
As we discussed during  the last conference call, attached is a revised 
Article 8,  Credit Provisions, to the EEI Contract, along with a revised 
section for the Cover Page.  The changes were made to make Article 8 more 
user friendly and to incorporate the few comments that were agreed  to during 
the conference call.  I tried blacklining, but that proved not decipherable 
due to the extensive formatting changes.  Maybe you will have better 
success.  I have attempted to mark by hand the changes and will fax that to 
you in case you want to distribute it to the rest of the group.

The only changes that were not discussed on the call (other than those 
resulting from the global restructuring) that I made are as follows:

1.  Changed  the Section entitled ""Performance Assurance"" to ""Collateral 
Threshold"" - Use of PA seemed  misleading since PA is referenced in other 
sections dealing with collateral.

2. Added the words ""acceptable to Party ___"" in new Section 8.1(d) and 8.2(d) 
in order to clarify, as we did in Sections 8.1 (a) and 8.2(a)  that the 
security must be acceptable to the receiving party.

3. Added provisions in the Cover Sheet to provide expressly whether the 
options are ""Applicable"" or ""Not Applicable"".

As always thanks for your help.

Elizabeth -- This letter is excellent.  Attached I added several 
suggestions.  Primarily, I suggest adding to the begining paragraph a few 
words and a sentence to put into perspective what is going on for the quick 
reader.  Also, on the mention of FERC, I suggested a ( ) to place into 
context and lighten the sting.  Lastly, when you use ""Commercial"" I suggest 
using ""commercially reasonable"" if that would be the ultimate standard 
applied.  Just suggestions -- use as you like.  Later JOE

Dear Andy:

     I want to clarify a misunderstanding in your email to the group.  While 
it
is correct that the CFTC proposes to regulate commodities with exhaustible and
nearly inexhaustible supplies differently, it has not characterized power as
having an inexhaustible supply.  In fact, I would expect the CFTC to treat 
power
as having a finite supply at any given time.  This means, for example, that
power derivatives traded on a multilateral transaction execution facility 
would
not qualify for exemption from the Commodity Exchange Act under the current
proposal.  I think the EEI and other industry groups should consider 
attempting
to persuade the CFTC to exempt physical and derivative power contracts from
certain provisions of the CEA under the CFTC's proposal to consider exemptions
on a ""case-by-case basis.""  See, for example, the discussion of DTFs on pages 
9
and 10 of the proposal.  I hope this clarifies the CFTC's proposal.

     Regards, Paul

A huge debate has been ongoing in he battle whether to include language in 
the EEI Contract that would provide that a confirmation that contains 
""substantive"" terms not discussed by the traders is subject to the ""deemed 
accepted"" language.  I have been very vocal against  adding this language.  
The politics as you can tell from this email have been fierce, and as in much 
of successful politics, dirty.  I'm not sure where this will end up, but feel 
like it is important that we all are aware of the history here as well as 
Enron's position (Confirmation needs to be the final, best evidence unless 
objected to in a timely manner). I will keep everybody posted on the results 
of the vote.

Subject: FWD:  Today's Decision



I am passing on the following message from Patty expressing her concern with 
today's decision to limit the choice on the ballot to optional language or no 
language.  Cutting through the ""edge"" of her comments, no doubt brought on by 
the frustration of being outvoted, I believe she has some valid points on our 
process here.  I have avoided  taking a position on substantive questions 
regarding the contract, but I too have a process concern  which I have raised 
with some of you individually.  I apologize for not vocalizing these concerns 
this morning.  Nevertheless, this is what I intend to do .  Given that Mitch 
was not available for the discussion and knowing Mitch's position on this 
issue compels me to release the comments he wanted circulated before going on 
vacation.  If there is a consensus from the balloting that the language 
should be included, but not as an option or as an ""opt out"" provision, this 
drafting committee should respect that sentiment.



The attention of many members of the Drafting Committee has waned and
EEI members (electric utilities which conduct wholesale power
transactions) are no longer represented on the Drafting Committee.
Mitch, in his email, did not think EEI member views were considered on
the Tuesday call.  And today's call  by Constellation, Enron, EPMC (and
Jones, Day and Schiff) did not even include any EEI members...
     The language compromise I accept, and believe that Mitch would
accept, in the spirit of Drafting Committee give and take.  But let's
not kid ourselves.  Today, a few members of the Drafting Committee made
a decision that even Mitch (the only EEI member on the Tuesday call) did
not think we had made or would make.  Read his email.  Today's decision
was to not even ""allow"" the EEI members' vote to be heard  to choose
what they overwhelmingly chose in Houston --- that is, to have the
provision in Section 2.3 of the Contract --- not just an option on the
Cover sheet). Today's decision is just wrong.
      As the person who was standing in the front of the room in
Houston, I feel strongly  that I know what occurred, and what Comed,
Dynegy,  Cinergy, IPALCO, AEP, Ameren and Toni Frost's group of
utilities, among others, know they voted on.   I am the person that
folks are going to call to ask why their views were ignored.  I had
become comfortable with the explanation for the revote --- to either not
add the language at all, add to 2.3, or add as an option.  But now
Working Group is not being given the choice  to vote as they did, like
the result or not, in Houston.  Even Fritz's suggestion that three
choices be given on the ballot was ignored.  Those three choices, as I
understood it, would have included an even more aggressive elimination
of the 2 business day presumption that the confirm, as sent, controls.

     The question I asked...  why we are afraid of even giving the
Working Group the choice to express the same views they expressed in
Houston...was never answered.
     When  EEI members call me to ask about this, I intend to suggest
that they vote ""YES"" on the ballot, and then  add an admonition to their
ballot that the language be included in 2.3 and not just be an option on
the cover sheet.  I would hope that the Drafting Committee (or whoever
remains on it) would at least consider such added comments although,
again, after today I have my doubts.  I intend to call some of the EEI
members that I know will feel strongly about this.  Since I know Mitch
will not be around (and don't feel he should be disenfranchised), I also
intend to call AEP as a courtesy.  I no longer support the idea of not
forwarding Mitch's email to the whole group, as he obviously intended.

     Ironically or perhaps intentionally, the Drafting Committee's
failure to address this directly until almost a month after the Houston
meeting means people won't even have a 2 Business Day voting window.
Nonetheless, regardless of the vote, I intend to discuss this in the
implementation discussion in the Houston/New York seminars.

In what I'm sure is an oversight, EEI forgtot to send me a ballot. After 
appealing for my right to vote, a ballot was forthcoming.  I voted ""NO"" on 
the proposal.  We will see what happens from here.

The following Message was sent to members of Contract List Server, the EEI 
Contract Standization Mailing List.
To Members of the Working Group:

A proposal was considered at the meeting in Houston on January 26 to add 
language to Article 2.3 of the Master Agreement which would require an 
agreement of both parties before any contract terms not part of the oral 
Transaction (but added to the written Confirmation) could become binding.  
Those in favor of adding such language hope to avoid the ""long form 
confirmations"" which have proliferated in the marketplace in the absence of 
an underlying master agreement - those containing arbitration clauses, Y2K 
representations and other non-commercial terms.  Those who oppose adding such 
language believe it is critical to market participants to know at some point, 
relatively promptly after the oral trade call, that the confirm represents 
the commercial Transaction, and that trade tapes can be overwritten.  They 
ask only that counterparties accept or reject the commercial Transaction 
terms within two Business Days.  If there is a dispute about the terms of the 
Transaction as it appears in the Confirmation, they want to be notified so 
that tapes can be preserved and the issues can be addressed promptly.

After much discussion, the Drafting Committee has developed language that 
could be added.  Given the strong feelings on both sides of this issue, 
however, the Drafting Committee decided to poll each company in the Working 
Group as to whether such  additional language should be added at all.   If 
the Working Group votes ""yes"", the additional language below would be 
inserted in Article 2.3 as an option that only would apply if selected on the 
cover sheet.

The following wording was developed by the Drafting Committee:

""If a Confirmation contains provisions, other than those provisions relating 
to the commercial terms of the Transaction (e.g., price, special transmission 
conditions), which modify or supplement the general terms and conditions of 
this Master Agreement (e.g., arbitration provisions,  additional 
representations and warranties), then such provisions shall not be deemed to 
be accepted pursuant to this Article 2.3 unless agreed to either orally or in 
writing by the Parties; provided that the foregoing will not affect the 
validity and binding nature of the Transaction.""

Accordingly, would ONE representative from each company in the Working Group 
please respond using the REPLY function of your email program to the 
following questions by cob Tuesday, February 29:

 1. Should the language addressing this point be inserted into the Master 
Agreement?  (If  yes, the language will be an option selected on the Cover 
Sheet.)

Yes_____ No_____

Subject: March 7 Workshop



I'm attaching my proposed schedule and panel assignments for the March 7 
workshop.  I've already spoken with several of you about your assignments. 
The panel moderators should have a conference call with their panels either 
Thursday or Friday this week to discuss the timing and assignments I put in 
the schedule.  I'd be happy to participate with you.

Materials.  For most of the contract-specific panels, I think we should use 
an updated version of the slides we used in November.  I am attaching the 
original slides and updated versions I've used subsequently.  Please make any 
changes you feel are needed and FAX them to me by noon Eastern tommorow.  I 
am also attaching Fritz' flowchart (into product 2.ppt) of the Into Product A 
and Liz' hypotheticals (examples.ppt).  Liz or Fritz, in light of the latest 
changes to the Into product, do these need to change?

Anyone with separate presentations they want distributed at the workshop has 
two options:  they can email them no later than cob Thursday or, if you can't 
make that deadline, make arrangements to have 110 copies delivered to the 
conference hotel on Monday March 6.  Stapled, 3 hole punched, double sided 
copies would be preferable.

AV -  we will have a laptop, LCD, overhead and slide projector available.

Any speaker who can make it for 7 o'clock dinner at Molina's on Westheimer is 
welcome as EEI's guest.  Houston-based speakers are welcome to invite their 
colleagues to the reception.

Please contact me if you have any questions

Attached is a form of Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement.  I believe 
that the provisions that you are looking for are contained in Section 3.5.  
The only concern I have is that the attached may not be the latest and 
greatest EPMI trading form (although I am reasonably comfortable that the 
cover damage language will not need a substantial overhaul).  There have been 
numerous discussions about this form being revised.  By carbon copy of this 
email, I am requesting that Elizabeth Sager forward to each of us, the latest 
and greatest form if it has been finally agreed upon.

Andy / Fritz:
*Please forward this e-mail to Patty Dondanville as I did not have her e-mail
address*  THANKS!

DeDe and I spoke this afternoon regarding the ""Independent Amount"" term in the
EEI Agreement.

Just to provide some feedback from a ""users"" perspective, the ""Independent
Amount"" concept was something that Elizabeth Sager suggested we use as a proxy
for bilateral margining which I introduced at the Sept. EEI meeting in D.C.
This term was literally ""borrowed"" from the ISDA Agreement.

The definition used in the ISDA Credit Support Annex is as follows:
""Independent Amount"" means, with respect to a party, the amount specified as
such for that party in Paragraph 13; if no amount is specified, zero.
(The ISDA Paragraph 13 is synonymous with the EEI Cover Sheet)

There isn't a ""definition"" per se.  The term comes into play in 8.3 as it is
added to the Termination Payment and compared to the Collateral Threshold.  To
put it in another way, it acts as ""buffer"" Termination Payment to handle
additional potential credit exposure created by transactions valued against
extremely volatile price indices.

Please call me in Houston should you have additional questions (713) 207-1211.

Thanks,
Randy

Subject: Final Version 2-1 of Master Agreement



I am circulating the final of version 2-1 of the Master Agreement.  Those 
making presentations at the March 7 workshop should refer to this version in 
their presentations.  After the thorough going over by our reviewers the past 
two days, I can't imagine anything got missed.  Many thanks to the word 
processing dept. at Jones Day in NY and Fritz for getting the document 
formatted.   If something did not get picked up let me know asap.  No 
unilateral changes will be made unless it was an omission or overlooked 
typo.  Remember, I have all your faxes!

I am also attaching a new flowchart of the into product that Fritz prepared.

Remember, today is the last day we can accept presentations for reproduction 
and insertion in the March 7 conference binders.  Materials must be received 
by 4pm Eastern.  Otherwise, please arrange to have 110 copies of any material 
you want to hand out at the conference sent to the  hotel no later than 
Monday, March 6.

I made the following changes to these hypotheticals as I understand the 
changes made to the product:

Example #1

3. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission within 30 minutes of Seller's 
notification and request is accepted and purchased by Buyer.  Entergy is 
sinking in Cinergy.


Seller must move to another interface (either on  Cinergy's border (NIPSCO, 
LG&E, AEP. . .) or in Cinergy's control area (Wabash) at which Buyer can 
receive energy such that energy can sink in Cinergy.  Seller can require 
Buyer to purchase Non-Firm transmission (or Firm, if available) but each 
party will be responsible for any additional transmission costs incurred to 
reschedule to another delivery point.

Ex #2

3. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission within 30 minutes of Seller's 
notification and receives response that Firm is available.  Buyer purchases 
Non-Firm instead.  Entergy is sinking in Cinergy.

Ex #3

3. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission from Cinergy within 30 minutes 
of Seller's notification and request is accepted and purchased by Buyer.  
Buyer also secures Firm transmission from LG&E to sink energy in LG&E.


There are references to specific sections in the product definition, I don't 
know if they are still valid in light of the latest changes.

Could someone help me out before 4pm Eastern?  Thanks.

Good morning, Elizabeth.  I wonder if I could impose upon you to send me a
copy of the most current definitions of the Into products?  I didn't make
the meeting yesterday.  Hope everything went well.  Thank you.

Subject: PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT



 Elizabeth & Janet:

Attached is a draft of the memo we spoke about the other day.  We tried to 
come up with as many arguments as possible, recognizing the strong commercial 
desire to put in the second interconnect.  As we have discussed, certain 
language in the Interconnect Agreement is troublesome, generally due to the 
fact that it does not appear that a second interconnect was contemplated at 
the time the project was initially developed.  Nonetheless, we believe that 
Caledonia does have a number of arguments in favor of the position that it 
should be able to build the second interconnect without a contractual block.  
The strength of some of these arguments will turn in large part on further 
factual development with the commercial group, as noted in a number of places 
in the memo.

Please let me know when you wish to follow up.  And, as I noted in my 
conversation with Elizabeth this morning, there is a possibility I may be in 
Houston next week and perhaps we could meet with the commercial folks at that 
time.  I think it would be advisable to walk through the various possible 
scenarios/strategies with them so that we have the benefit of the TVA 
""history"" and likely responses of TVA to some of the arguments noted in the 
memo.

Thanks  John

Per Paul Racicot's voicemail to you, please find attached a draft power 
supply agrreement between Enron and New Hampshire Electric Coop.  (Reference

credit check on them and found they have been running a deficit, but didn't 
see that as a problem since we are purchasing non-LD unit contingent power 
from them.

We need to have comments to them by noon Eastern, 11 Am Houston time.   
Thanks very much for your help, and I'll need to swing by and introduce 
myself next time I'm down in Houston.  I can be reached today, over the

Subject: Markup of Power Sale Agreement

Elizabeth/Paul:

Please find attached my markup of the Draft Power Sale Agreement with New 
Hampshire Electric Coop.  I have added some important language in Article 
14.2 to reflect that Installed Capability will still be credited by ISO-NE 
even during an outage at Seabrook (i.e., they should have full liability for 
providing ICAP regardless of whether the plant is operating).  The rest of my 
comments should be pretty clear.

We need to have comments to NHEC by noon eastern time, Monday March 13th.  
Please call me at 978-449-9936 to discuss.  Thanks much.

John

We will use this as a starting point and if Formosa insists on a sharing

Subject: Kaiser One Month Melodrama

A number of parts of the deal making process are flying around at the same 
time and for the purpose of communicating to the team where legal sees the 
matter at this point I offer the following:

Apparently Greg Whalley has not yet signed the one month DASH.
Credit has requested that legal put a MAC clause in the one month confirm 
before the DASH is resubmitted to Whalley.
West Desk traders (Greg Wolfe and Mike Etringer) report that Kaiser's power 
guys in Spokane are saying that we can ""sleeve""  the power to them through 
Bonneville.  To legal, this means we sell power to BPA no strings attached  
and assume nothing about who they resell it too.

Obviously a clean one month sale to BPA is attractive.  But can it be 
detached from the larger call spread transaction?  I don't know.  Given this 
quandry, Greg Wolfe has advised me to hold off temporarily on preparing the 
one off confirmation  until the BPA option is sorted out.  I am following 
this sensible guidance and if anybody has a thought to the contrary please 
give me a call:  503-464-7845.  ----cgy

Michael:

The Electric Power Board has authorized NES to participate in TVA's
Wholesale to Market Test Program.  Due to the specific requirements of the
TVA program, NES has determined that it is in NES' best interests to enter
into standardized agreements with power suppliers.  To that end, NES has
prepared the attached document as a contract draft for your consideration.
Please contact Eugene Ward, General Counsel, or Laura Smith, Attorney, at
(615) 747-3701 to discuss the agreement.

Thanks.

Attached are the documents Mike and I discussed.

1) Fact Sheet provided by TVA
2) Draft Master Purchase Agreement between Valley Energy and your company
3) Sample Confirmation Letter for Transactions under the Agreement

Valley Energy Corporation will be acting as purchase agent for an
aggregated group of TVA power distributors totaling about 400 MW.  We will
be purchasing blocks of 5 x 16 liquidated damages firm energy each week.
The minimum block size will be 25 MW delivered to the TVA control area.

The Draft Master Purchase Agreement reflects the requirements and
constraints placed on us as a participant in the TVA program.

Valley energy is in the process of obtaining a Line of Credit to satisfy
the credit requirements of our supplier counterparties.  We are also
interested in similar protection for situations where liquidated damages
may be due from our suppliers.

Please review the attached documents and provide me with feedback as soon
as possible.

Our objective is to be able to conduct business by April 6, 2000, which is
the first day TVA will allow us to participate.  Power purchased on April 6
would be for delivery beginning April 10, 2000.

Call if you have questions.

Thank you very much,

Subject: Lockbox documents

,

Elizabeth:

Here is a set of documents which might be useful as a starting point for your 
situation.  The idea in the transaction for which they were tailored was that 
the California Energy Commission (""CEC"") and three California UDC's would 
divert payments they were otherwise  required to make to a blackballed ESP 
into the infamous ""Lockbox.""  The bank-administrator of the Lockbox was to 
swear in blood to send money coming into the lockbox to our account first and 
dribble any leftovers to the blackballed ESP as they saw fit.  Also,  the 
mili-second that the funds plunked into the Lockbox a virulent ""Security 
Interest"" attached itself like a vampire to the juggler vein of these funds 
and this security interest was for our benefit.  

 Although I am proud to have the  name Yoder associated with the Lockbox 
concept,  I must in all modesty confess I have never closed out a real deal 
using the damn thing.  Stewart Rosman, an innovative trader who is well known 
for his patience with the legal process,  and later,  John ""Big Sky"" 
Malowney,   tried valiantly to get Legal to implement this sturcture but 
alas, I cannot yet put it on my resume as a triumph.  Good luck and let me 
know if I can help out in any way with your project.----cgy

I,m jealous of your beautiful dog, but do you have any pictures of family?
Lunch tommorrow is out (standing in line at post office to get passport for 
trip to Paris).  Next week I'm mostly out (trip to NY with daughter Ella for 
wedding of girlfriend I've known since I was Ella's age) but call me anyway 
or I'll try to call you.
PS As you can tell, work is a low priority right now, so .... let's go!"

Subject: NHEC ICAP and Energy Sale

All:

I wanted to give you a heads-up that we have been shortlisted to negotiate 
with New Hampshire Electric Coop (NHEC) on supplying their load requirements 
from Sep-00 through May-01.   Attached is a table that sets forth the monthly 
quantities and our indicative pricing (will be refreshing pricing based on 
updated forwards).  They have decided not to go with the purchase for Jul-Aug 
at this time.  They seem to have gotten their act a little better together 
this time around with pre-approvals internally, but any deal they do would 
still need to be approved by the NHPUC.

Here's the scoop on timeline:

They will send to us a draft contract this Friday for review/comment.  We 
need to have our comments back to them by Weds Apr 5th.  Elizabeth, does this 
fit your schedule OK?
They plan to hold negotiations with us and other parties via phone on Monday 
Apr 10th, and hope to close  a deal that same day.  Again, this deal would be 
subject to NHPUC approval, so we need to get a feel for the risk of NHPUC 
disapproval.
Tracy - as you know, they are not so attractive from a credit standpoint.   
Is letter of credit sufficient in their case?  Can we talk about what we need 
to put in place for the transaction.

I will be in Houston on Weds-Fri of this week (Elizabeth and Tracy -- I'll be 
sure to swing by and introduce myself).  Thanks much and I'll forward the 
contract when I get it.

Regards,
John

Hi Dede 

I got your email about NY seminar. Great idea but sorry we can't be of much 
help - I haven't touched EEI since the Houston seminar.  I know its time to 
start trying to use it.  Oh well, next week's project.

On a more important note, do you want to try and hit this Tuesday (the 4th) 
at lunch?  Let me know.

Hope you have fun on Friday night.

I got your email regarding our sale to NHEC.  I will be out of the office 
March 31, and April 3, 6, 7.  When you get the draft contract, please forward 
it ASAP to Brenda Whitehead, my assistant, and Leslie Hansen.  Depending upon 
the timing and the extent of the comments either me, Leslie or another lawyer 
will be able to help you with this.  The timing may be awkward because all 
Enron lawyers will in San Antonio next week, but we will work it out.  Once I 
see the draft, I will have a better feel for the timing.

Talk to you soon

Got your message - I would have loved to go; instead I was stuck on a

according to the pilot.

See you at 11:00 unless I hear from you.

Hi

Just FYI - A collection of racquets is more than just a luxury.  On Friday, 
after the matches, I was keen to assert my new found tennis prowess.   I 
thought I could do it too.  I was playing like a spring chicken until my 
first big overhead.  I set up well, ready to bounce that ball right over 
Grant's head.  I thought I was so cool.  Up I  went to find the ball and out 
came flying my  racquet.  On the other side of the net.  Cracked.  Everybody 
stood to stare to see if it was anger or incompetence that created such a 
mess.  I think I better work on that shot.

Tennis on Wed.?

Oops forgot to respond to this request. It would be absolutely fine to use 
our arbitration language as an example for the Cover Sheet.  My only 
suggestion would be to leave blank the place for the arbitration (I've gotten 
untold grief for using HOUSTON).

Subject: Master Contract Available in Word Format



The latest version of the EEI-NEM Master Contract now can be downloaded from 
EEI's website at  http://www.eei.org/issues/contract/.  We only ask that a 
short registration form be filled out first so that we can better serve the 
community interested in using the contract.  We are making the contract 
freely available, multiple copies may be made, our only restriction is that 
the contract not be resold.  We also request that attribution to EEI and NEM 
be given in all copies of the contract.

Our intention is to use the EEI website and listserver as tools to help 
promote dissemination and use of the contract.  For instance, we could make a 
listing of companies using the contract on the website.  Also, we are 
considering posting on a periodic basis responses to requests for 
clarification or interpretation of the contract terms that would be of 
interest to the user community.  Please let me know if there are other 
enhancements that you would find helpful

I will probably sign the Agreement.

We need to send a letter to TVA appointing the Operating Representatives for 
the 4 Interconnection Agreements.   I recommend yourself and Lloyd Will be 
the Enron representatives for the respective Agreements.  I have a previous 
letter in the file (get from Felicia) that you can use a template to create 
the new letter appointing our Operating Reps.  In that letter, we should also 
include the new Enron Contact List (Plants Ops and Control Center Ops).

circulation to NSP . 

Please note that the presence of indexed pricing tied to a monthly average 
may in certain circumstances slow down a party's calculation and invoicing of 
liquidated damages payable under Confirmation 3.   Also note that, if the 
terms of the 3 confirmations are accepted, the ""draft"" and ""not an offer"" 
notations will need to be deleted from the top of each page.

There are several items worth noting regarding the ERCOT's methodology:

Regulation Reserve Requirements (RGRS).  ERCOT has determined that 600 MW o=
f=20
Reg up and down will be adequate for 95% of the hours during the year, if=
=20
historic patterns hold and if balancing energy is deployed properly.  Durin=
g=20
what ERCOT considers to be ""high stress"" periods, they will increase their=
=20
normal RGRS requirement by a multiple of 2-3.  The initial start-up of the=
=20
single control area will  be considered ""high stress"" and ERCOT will purcha=
se=20
2-3 what is necessary to cover the inexperience of the operators.  This wil=
l=20
be the practice until ERCOT is comfortable with the single control area (or=
=20
until market participants complain about the high cost of A/S).  The high=
=20
stress option will remain available for the first year of operations.
Non-Spinning Reserve Requirements (NSRS).  ERCOT proposes to a methodology =
of=20
purchasing NSRS only when projected risk of insufficiency is higher than=20
normal, or large amounts of spinning reserve are not projected to be=20
available online based on resource plans..  This boils down to where the=20
temperature is projected to be greater than 92 degrees, less than 32 degree=
s=20
Fahrenheit or uncertain and when spinning reserves less than 4600 MW are=20
projected.  Here is the process:
  1. Review the weather forecast for the next day and see if it differs=20
significantly from the current day.
  2. If the next day forecast is =01&similar=018 to the current day forecas=
t, and=20
the current day forecast high temperature is <92, and the current    day lo=
w=20
temperature is greater than 32 degrees, and the current day generation plan=
=20
shows >4600 MW of spinning reserve online    all day long, and the current=
=20
month is not April, May, or October, THEN no NSRS is considered to be=20
required all day for the next    day.
  3. Else: Purchase NSRS using the following:
  ? If the current month is April, May or October, then purchase NSRS in=20
amounts equal to the largest unit online for the hours     projected within=
=20
80% of peak hour.
  ? If today=01,s and tomorrow=01,s ERCOT high temperature is projected abo=
ve 92=20
degrees, then purchase NSRS in amounts equal to the    largest unit online=
=20
for the hours projected warmer than 92 degrees.
  ? If tomorrow=01,s low temperature forecast is projected below 30 degrees=
,=20
then purchase NSRS in amounts equal to the largest unit    online for the=
=20
projected morning load pickup hours and hours projected within 80% of peak=
=20
hour.
   Purchase amounts of NSRS equal to the largest unit online for hours in=
=20
which the Day Ahead operator estimates spinning reserves    online will dro=
p=20
lower than 4600 MW.
Replacement Reserve Requirements (RPRS).  The requirement will be set at th=
e=20
amount of RPRS required to resolve supply inadequacy, CSC, and OC (local)=
=20
congestion simultaneously.  There will be procurement of RPRS if the resour=
ce=20
plans indicate capacity inadequacy based on the QSE scheduled load  with th=
e=20
ERCOT projected load.  If the ERCOT projected load is greater than the QSE=
=20
scheduled load and capacity available in the resource plan does not cover t=
he=20
difference, then there is a capacity inadequacy problem.  If the CSC flows=
=20
based on the QSE schedules are greater than the limits, then the CSC proble=
ms=20
are recorded.  Then a transmission contingency analysis will be run to=20
identify OC constraints.  If the flows are greater than the limits, the OC=
=20
flow values are recorded.  When there are insufficient RPRS bids for ERCOT =
to=20
resolve its reliability and security concerns, ERCOT may choose to request=
=20
OOM capacity or to use RMR units.  ERCOT will use the scheduling pricing=20
dispatch (SPD) to determine which OOM and RMR units should be selected and=
=20
when to discontinue OOM/RMR service.
Balancing Energy Requirement.  ERCOT's goal for balancing energy is (1) to=
=20
use BES so that regulation service in either direction is not depleted, (2)=
=20
to minimize net energy in regulation, and (3) to provide frequency control=
=20
when frequency is high, especially during minimum load intervals.  ERCOT wi=
ll=20
use a two-step approach to calculate balancing energy service needs.  Step=
=20
one will be to clear the balancing energy service market resolving=20
load-generation balances and Zonal congestion (local congestion is ignored)=
. =20
Step two is to determine the balance energy service needs to resolve local=
=20
congestion as well as generation-load balance and zonal congestion.   The=
=20
desired result of step two is to minimize the cost of local congestion whic=
h=20
will be an uplift to the market.
Balancing Energy Down Bid Percentage Requirement.  This will be used for=20
congestion management and frequency control (to correct for high frequency)=
. =20
ERCOT will evaluate the export amount of each congestion management zone an=
d=20
transmission transfer capability between CM Zones.  If the export amount is=
=20
greater than the calculated transfer capability of a CM Zone, then the=20
difference between these two values is the potential congested MW, or the=
=20
total MW of DES Down bids needed for clearing Zonal Congestion.  Also=20
sufficient down bid percentage requirement will be determined by ERCOT. =20
Market rules dictate that by 0600 of the day ahead QSEs will be notified of=
=20
this percentage requirement for BES down bids by Congestion Zone.
Responsive Reserve Requirement (RRS).  The RRS requirement is set at 2300 M=
W=20
for all hours under normal conditions.  Interruptible responsive reserve=20
cannot exceed 25% of the QSE total requirement.=20

For the initial start-up period of the market, ERCOT will have the tendency=
=20
to over buy ancillary services while the are ""adjusting"" to the single=20
control area.

Sevil and others,

I have attached a detailed map of the ERCOT system, 69, 138 and 345 KV line 
and buses (*.pwd).   The map is based on the 2001 Summer peak load flow case. 
(Enron paid about $12,000 for this map so we do not need to disclose it to 
outside personnel.)

I also have a detailed map of the eastern interconnect, I believe it is down 
to the 138 KV level.

I have also attached a 2001 contingency file (*.ctg) for ease of importing a 
standard list of line contingencies that I obtained from the ISO.

I have also attached an ERCOT injection group (*.aux) , which is valuable for 
the years after 2001 because of one constrol group.

The actual mwh growth from Q12000 to Q1 2001 was 3.56% (59,426,845 mwh to 
61,543,268 mwh).  Through my calculations, which I will describe below, I 
arrived at a weather-normalized growth of 4.28% (59,114,067 mwh to 61,646,157 
mwh).  While I would not say that load growth exactly matches my figure, I 
feel confident that load growth in ERCOT was in the range of 3.5% to 4%, year 
over year.

Methodology

To arrive at the 2000 typical loads, I estimated the model using two and one 
half years of data (7/1/97 through 12/31/99) and inserted typical ERCOT 
weather for the period of January 1 through March 31, 2000.  I used the 
resulting loads in my analysis for typical first quarter 2000 loads.  The 
amount of data I used to estimate the ERCOT model in this example is standard 
for each of the load forecasting models I have developed (when that amount of 
data is available). 

To arrive at the 2001 typical loads, I estimated the model using two and one 
half years of data (7/1/98 through 12/31/00) and inserted typical ERCOT 
weather for the period of January 1 through March 31, 2001.   I used the 
resulting loads in my analysis for typical first quarter 2001 loads.

I then compared the results, which I have summarized above.

Let me know if you have any questions."

Subject:        Meeting on Dynamic Schedules and Responsibility transfers (RTs) 

This is to invite you to a meeting on dynamic schedules and responsibility transfers that will be conducted by ERCOT on Wednesday, July 6, 2001. ERCOT will present the ways in which dynamic schedules and RTs will be accomplished per the current system design and protocols with examples of various scenarios to walk through the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved. A document on the ERCOT system design regarding these issues will be e-mailed to market participants by Monday June 4, 2001. The examples presented in the document will be the basis for discussions and time will be allocated for questions and answers on each topic.

Here is a tentative agenda for the meeting: 

9:30 a.m. to 12:00 noon - Dynamic Schedules (Examples and Q&A) 
12:00 noon to 1:00 p.m. - Lunch (will be provided) 
1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m.   - Responsibility transfers (Examples and Q&A) 

The discussion on RTs may start before lunch if time allows and continue after lunch.  There may also be a discussion of system design and protocol changes needed to implement RTs for balancing energy and capacity auctions.

The meeting will be held at the Austin Airport Hilton, 9515 New Airport Drive: Telephone (512) 385-6767. A conference call line will be set up for those unable to attend and the number to call in will be communicated along with the document mentioned above.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

There are several items worth noting regarding the ERCOT's methodology:

Regulation Reserve Requirements (RGRS).  ERCOT has determined that 600 MW o=
f=20
Reg up and down will be adequate for 95% of the hours during the year, if=
=20
historic patterns hold and if balancing energy is deployed properly.  Durin=
g=20
what ERCOT considers to be ""high stress"" periods, they will increase their=
=20
normal RGRS requirement by a multiple of 2-3.  The initial start-up of the=
=20
single control area will  be considered ""high stress"" and ERCOT will purcha=
se=20
2-3 what is necessary to cover the inexperience of the operators.  This wil=
l=20
be the practice until ERCOT is comfortable with the single control area (or=
=20
until market participants complain about the high cost of A/S).  The high=
=20
stress option will remain available for the first year of operations.
Non-Spinning Reserve Requirements (NSRS).  ERCOT proposes to a methodology =
of=20
purchasing NSRS only when projected risk of insufficiency is higher than=20
normal, or large amounts of spinning reserve are not projected to be=20
available online based on resource plans..  This boils down to where the=20
temperature is projected to be greater than 92 degrees, less than 32 degree=
s=20
Fahrenheit or uncertain and when spinning reserves less than 4600 MW are=20
projected.  Here is the process:
  1. Review the weather forecast for the next day and see if it differs=20
significantly from the current day.
  2. If the next day forecast is =01&similar=018 to the current day forecas=
t, and=20
the current day forecast high temperature is <92, and the current    day lo=
w=20
temperature is greater than 32 degrees, and the current day generation plan=
=20
shows >4600 MW of spinning reserve online    all day long, and the current=
=20
month is not April, May, or October, THEN no NSRS is considered to be=20
required all day for the next    day.
  3. Else: Purchase NSRS using the following:
  ? If the current month is April, May or October, then purchase NSRS in=20
amounts equal to the largest unit online for the hours     projected within=
=20
80% of peak hour.
  ? If today=01,s and tomorrow=01,s ERCOT high temperature is projected abo=
ve 92=20
degrees, then purchase NSRS in amounts equal to the    largest unit online=
=20
for the hours projected warmer than 92 degrees.
  ? If tomorrow=01,s low temperature forecast is projected below 30 degrees=
,=20
then purchase NSRS in amounts equal to the largest unit    online for the=
=20
projected morning load pickup hours and hours projected within 80% of peak=
=20
hour.
   Purchase amounts of NSRS equal to the largest unit online for hours in=
=20
which the Day Ahead operator estimates spinning reserves    online will dro=
p=20
lower than 4600 MW.
Replacement Reserve Requirements (RPRS).  The requirement will be set at th=
e=20
amount of RPRS required to resolve supply inadequacy, CSC, and OC (local)=
=20
congestion simultaneously.  There will be procurement of RPRS if the resour=
ce=20
plans indicate capacity inadequacy based on the QSE scheduled load  with th=
e=20
ERCOT projected load.  If the ERCOT projected load is greater than the QSE=
=20
scheduled load and capacity available in the resource plan does not cover t=
he=20
difference, then there is a capacity inadequacy problem.  If the CSC flows=
=20
based on the QSE schedules are greater than the limits, then the CSC proble=
ms=20
are recorded.  Then a transmission contingency analysis will be run to=20
identify OC constraints.  If the flows are greater than the limits, the OC=
=20
flow values are recorded.  When there are insufficient RPRS bids for ERCOT =
to=20
resolve its reliability and security concerns, ERCOT may choose to request=
=20
OOM capacity or to use RMR units.  ERCOT will use the scheduling pricing=20
dispatch (SPD) to determine which OOM and RMR units should be selected and=
=20
when to discontinue OOM/RMR service.
Balancing Energy Requirement.  ERCOT's goal for balancing energy is (1) to=
=20
use BES so that regulation service in either direction is not depleted, (2)=
=20
to minimize net energy in regulation, and (3) to provide frequency control=
=20
when frequency is high, especially during minimum load intervals.  ERCOT wi=
ll=20
use a two-step approach to calculate balancing energy service needs.  Step=
=20
one will be to clear the balancing energy service market resolving=20
load-generation balances and Zonal congestion (local congestion is ignored)=
. =20
Step two is to determine the balance energy service needs to resolve local=
=20
congestion as well as generation-load balance and zonal congestion.   The=
=20
desired result of step two is to minimize the cost of local congestion whic=
h=20
will be an uplift to the market.
Balancing Energy Down Bid Percentage Requirement.  This will be used for=20
congestion management and frequency control (to correct for high frequency)=
. =20
ERCOT will evaluate the export amount of each congestion management zone an=
d=20
transmission transfer capability between CM Zones.  If the export amount is=
=20
greater than the calculated transfer capability of a CM Zone, then the=20
difference between these two values is the potential congested MW, or the=
=20
total MW of DES Down bids needed for clearing Zonal Congestion.  Also=20
sufficient down bid percentage requirement will be determined by ERCOT. =20
Market rules dictate that by 0600 of the day ahead QSEs will be notified of=
=20
this percentage requirement for BES down bids by Congestion Zone.
Responsive Reserve Requirement (RRS).  The RRS requirement is set at 2300 M=
W=20
for all hours under normal conditions.  Interruptible responsive reserve=20
cannot exceed 25% of the QSE total requirement.=20

For the initial start-up period of the market, ERCOT will have the tendency=
=20
to over buy ancillary services while the are ""adjusting"" to the single=20
control area.

Sevil and others,

I have attached a detailed map of the ERCOT system, 69, 138 and 345 KV line 
and buses (*.pwd).   The map is based on the 2001 Summer peak load flow case. 
(Enron paid about $12,000 for this map so we do not need to disclose it to 
outside personnel.)

I also have a detailed map of the eastern interconnect, I believe it is down 
to the 138 KV level.

I have also attached a 2001 contingency file (*.ctg) for ease of importing a 
standard list of line contingencies that I obtained from the ISO.

I have also attached an ERCOT injection group (*.aux) , which is valuable for 
the years after 2001 because of one constrol group.

Subject: ERCOT load growth: Q12000 to Q12001

The actual mwh growth from Q12000 to Q1 2001 was 3.56% (59,426,845 mwh to 
61,543,268 mwh).  Through my calculations, which I will describe below, I 
arrived at a weather-normalized growth of 4.28% (59,114,067 mwh to 61,646,157 
mwh).  While I would not say that load growth exactly matches my figure, I 
feel confident that load growth in ERCOT was in the range of 3.5% to 4%, year 
over year.

Methodology

To arrive at the 2000 typical loads, I estimated the model using two and one 
half years of data (7/1/97 through 12/31/99) and inserted typical ERCOT 
weather for the period of January 1 through March 31, 2000.  I used the 
resulting loads in my analysis for typical first quarter 2000 loads.  The 
amount of data I used to estimate the ERCOT model in this example is standard 
for each of the load forecasting models I have developed (when that amount of 
data is available). 

To arrive at the 2001 typical loads, I estimated the model using two and one 
half years of data (7/1/98 through 12/31/00) and inserted typical ERCOT 
weather for the period of January 1 through March 31, 2001.   I used the 
resulting loads in my analysis for typical first quarter 2001 loads.

I then compared the results, which I have summarized above.

Let me know if you have any questions."

Once again this year, I am leading the BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser.  BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children.  This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the ""BEARing Gifts"" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.  Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.  BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.

Please visit the Enron Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes.  For more information, contact Margaret Doucette at (713) 345-7892 or Janette Elbertson at (713) 853-7906.  

Thank you very much for your support.

I am in the process of restructuring the Ercot Region in Enpower to align with the current Ercot zones (as well as the zones that will come into play in 2002).  I have made a few initial changes today that will impact the delivery points you choose as you book deals in the North and South....

Old Delivery Point		New Delivery Point
North 2001			Ercot North
South 2001			Ercot South

I will be making additional changes later this week and will let you know what impact it has on you.  Let me know if you have any questions...

Thanks!

I think my dad is planning a trip to the Chicago Food  Show sometime in May=

My parents and I are going to China in March, and I was  surprised that the=
y're asking my girlfriend to go along with us.  The Wash  U International A=
dvisory Council Meeting will be held in China in March and I  will just cat=
ch them for their last leg. =20
=20
Business in the Philippines is really bad, and it's not  going anywhere in =
the near future.  I had this deal with Adnan last  December to January.  He=
 wanted me to sell used hard disks to prospective  buyers in the Philippine=
s.  I found one group and it took a long time to  get the goods here and ou=
t of customs.  Finally, during the first week of  January, the goods were r=
eleased and shit turned worse.  The buyer claimed  that we shipped him 95% =
defective items.  Out of the 400+ hard drives,  around 200 had bad sectors =
(which were deemed to be good drives by most people),  21 were good, and th=
e balance were either not detected or had this knocking  sound.  Anyway, I =
think Adnan was willing to give him some sort of refund  on the balance, bu=
t the guy kept on insisting for Adnan not to negotiate the  letter of credi=
t.  The whole thing was so fucked up, and the guy was  implying that he was=
 going to sue me for intentionally scamming him off  US$6,800.  I couldn't =
believe that he would think that I would destroy my  credibility for such a=
 small amount of money.  Anyway, the problem seems to  be hanging out there=
, but the buyer had some fishy stuff going.  He called  me to go to his pla=
ce and, when I arrived, they have finished testing all the  drives.  I mean=
, they should have waited for me to get there before testing  at least half=
 of the drives for their own protection.  Now, we could not  tell whether t=
he drives that were displayed (and they were displayed in an  extremely org=
anized manner) were actually ours or not.  Second, his  unwillingness to ta=
ke a refund instead of stopping the LC negotiation is  somewhat irregular. =
 We were thinking that maybe he doesn't have enough  funds in the bank or s=
omething to cover his line.  Third, he wanted to send  back all goods and c=
harge it to us.  That way, if he indeed changed our  good drives with defec=
tive ones, he would have gotten 400 good drives and gotten  rid of his bad =
ones free of charge.  Adnan shipped 200 drives from the same  lot to his da=
d in Pakistan, and they came out around 12% defective.  Even  at that level=
, 50% seems to be too far away.  So, there, since we haven't  negotiated th=
e letter of credit yet (it should be done within this week), I  haven't hea=
rd from the buyer.  I would not be surprised if I receive some  subpoena or=
 something from the bastard after we negotiate the LC.  Anyway,  I asked my=
 lawyer, and he said that there is really not much of a case on his  side. =
 Besides, all documents were made by Adnan and him.  He cannot  sue Adnan, =
so his only choice is to sue me ... if that's what he wants.   Well, let's =
see how it goes.

I got a bunch of financial consultancy work on the  side.  I arrange financ=
ing for some people with our bank contacts.   It's very tedious and time co=
nsuming to complete a deal.  Sometimes, the  odds of getting a good deal ar=
e very slim that I can't really depend on these  things for regular income.=
  I can't spend that much anymore.  I'm  saving up for my future.  I may ac=
tually get married in a year or  two.  I don't know yet, but this relations=
hip is getting pretty serious and  I think that she's the one.  She's study=

of internship before taking the  boards next year.  She wants to go to the =
US for her residency, but we'll  see how things go.  Any good medical schoo=

If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

Subject:	Change of Ercot Delivery Points

I am in the process of restructuring the Ercot Region in Enpower to align with the current Ercot zones (as well as the zones that will come into play in 2002).  I have made a few initial changes today that will impact the delivery points you choose as you book deals in the North and South....

Old Delivery Point		New Delivery Point
North 2001			Ercot North
South 2001			Ercot South

I will be making additional changes later this week and will let you know what impact it has on you.  Let me know if you have any questions...

Thanks!

As you have heard,  we are working with creditors to shore up our creditworthiness due to the recent cash crunch.  We have been successful in addressing most of the fears of certain counterparties who were reluctant to trade with us.    The Power and Gas Trading floors have been supporting the profitability of the entire company for the last three years at least,  so it is my personal belief that we will still have plenty of opportunity in this department,  ie courting new service customers and continuing to build the Teco/Frontera relationship.  I have been working  with the physical RT traders and selling/buying  the financial swap;   this has held great interest in the market.
I realize and understand that it is tough to read the papers and wonder what is happening - but,  for the new employees, this means getting in on the ground floor.
This is a huge business and we expect to get back to our roots:  TRADING.    We will have to tough this one out.  

We are,  however,  avoiding expenditures as evidenced by the food service being cancelled.     All personal cell phone expenses that had been previously turned in on an expense report will no longer be honored for Real time workers.     Additionally,  expenses related to happy hours,  etc will not be honored unless previously approved.

I also have to mention:

The chairs for the traders (and myself)  have been moving around.   Some of these chairs have been acquired specifically for employees with lower back issues,  etc.
Dont borrow chairs from the traders because they are not being returned.   If other RT groups are borrowing them,  this must stop.
Some chairs are never to be seen again.   This defies logic.   It sounds a bit petty,  but when you come in for work at  5:30 am,  the last thing you want to do is find your chair or at least one that is not broken.    

We are soon to have a meeting to discuss the Hourly QSE MOS system.    We are revising it again to make it simpler.

Also,   on Sunday November 18th,  we are to be testing the computers in the new building.   The Sunday day shift trader will trade in this building.    I will be at the new building, testing paralell until the night shift arrives.   The night shift will report to the new building on the 18th.  We will be cleaning up around our workspace starting this Friday. 

Additionally,   a new schedule has been implemented.   The changes affect only George Phillips and Isaac Wong.   We need to delete all other test versions of the schedule.



Thanks for hanging in there,
JMF

Item One
The Frontera Plant is scheduled to sell 450 mw's for tomorrow.   I sold them a financial swap @ $24 for the whole day.   For the first part of the day we will be running extremely short.   We will just  that we are having problems coming up.
This is the amount that will be short:

he7 - 420 mw's
he 8 - 420 mw's
he 9 - 420 mw's
he 10 - 315 mw's
he 11 - 230 mw's 
he 12 - 22    100 mw's


I would like you to buy power for 7-11 for alot less than $24.    If you cant,  then we will take the imbalance price.   If you do buy,  purchase under the Ercot Asset book and schedule to South Zone load for the Ercot Asset book.   If you have questions,  call me.



Item Two

I purchased 99 mw's from City of Austin for tomorrow,  hours ending 7-22 under the Ercot Asset book.  I sold this power to the ST ERCOT desk for $28.75.
This power can be rescinded intraday.    WE NEED TO CALL CITY OF AUSTIN TOMORROW WELL BEFORE FLOW AND TELL THEM WE ARE NOT TAKING THESE MW'S.   THEY SUPPOSEDLEY KNOW ABOUT THIS DEAL.   THEY ARE NOT TO GENERATE.     CUT DEAL # 849947 IN ENPOWER SCHEDULING AND REPLACE WITH PURCHASES UNDER ERCOT ASSET.
We will either purchase 100 mw's balday (well below $28.75) or take the pool price.
For the hours that are filled by the pool,  I need a purchase from Ercot Imbalance (under Ercot Asset book),  zero price and mk-mkt flag set to ""no.""


Obviously,   the market will be short tomorro, especially in the morning.   Purchase at least some megawatts for tomorrow,   but dont give away our position.
Maybe we could import from the East.  That would be great.    If you left us short for  100 mw's 12-22,  that would be cool.   We can take care of that.

FRONTERA NEEDS TO BUY 50 mw for hour ending 2300 to cover Mirant sale for the last hour.     Purchase under the Teco Service book and sell to Frontera under Teco Services book.   In Portal,  we would enter a purchase from X  and we should balance against an existing Mirant sale for hour ending 2300.   Cut the Frontera 50mw in the Portal so we will balance.

Call if you have questions,

 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

Dear Power Outage Database Customer,

Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within
are forced or rescheduled outages. Your daily delivery will still

In addition to the two excel documents, there is a dbf file that is

Thanks.

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you."

The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.  Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.

No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.  The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.  In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.

We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.  In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.  We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information."

Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you."

The Hrly Ercot book is 30 mw's long for Sat and Sund.   This pwr has been schedule to the North Zone. 

The Ercot Offpeak desk has floated 50 mw's for the same time period.   If the pool starts to tank,  then sell out to a bilateral counterparty.

FYI,  the purchase price was $26.25.

We have had a major scheduling mishap.    When trading for the position listed below,  we cut or increased EPMI  resource to balance the pool, rather than taking length that you purchased to load.      I wasnt aware that this was a point of confusion.  Also,   City of Austin was adjusted each hour, even though it was to be a mismatch schedule.
Mismatches dont consider volume,  it is essentially zero.
We purchased a sizeable qty of mw's yesterday and because we didnt schedule it all to load,  we wont be paid the balancing energy price,  which was large.
If no EPMI load exists on the obligation side,  then create it.

The EPMI resource represents Frontera's generation- dont play with it, unless directed to do so.

If you have questions,  please dont hesitate to ask.   

Also,  dont wait until after your shift to reconstruct Enpower.   It is not going to be accurate because it wont be fresh on your mind.    It takes twice as long after the shift to enter your deals because you are tired.

Please ask me questions about the financial swap and how we are going to work together to make some serious money.

Subject:	VERY IMPORTANT POSITIONS FOR TOMORROW!!!




Item One
The Frontera Plant is scheduled to sell 450 mw's for tomorrow.   I sold them a financial swap @ $24 for the whole day.   For the first part of the day we will be running extremely short.   We will just  that we are having problems coming up.
This is the amount that will be short:

he7 - 420 mw's
he 8 - 420 mw's
he 9 - 420 mw's
he 10 - 315 mw's
he 11 - 230 mw's 
he 12 - 22    100 mw's


I would like you to buy power for 7-11 for alot less than $24.    If you cant,  then we will take the imbalance price.   If you do buy,  purchase under the Ercot Asset book and schedule to South Zone load for the Ercot Asset book.   If you have questions,  call me.



Item Two

I purchased 99 mw's from City of Austin for tomorrow,  hours ending 7-22 under the Ercot Asset book.  I sold this power to the ST ERCOT desk for $28.75.
This power can be rescinded intraday.    WE NEED TO CALL CITY OF AUSTIN TOMORROW WELL BEFORE FLOW AND TELL THEM WE ARE NOT TAKING THESE MW'S.   THEY SUPPOSEDLEY KNOW ABOUT THIS DEAL.   THEY ARE NOT TO GENERATE.     CUT DEAL # 849947 IN ENPOWER SCHEDULING AND REPLACE WITH PURCHASES UNDER ERCOT ASSET.
We will either purchase 100 mw's balday (well below $28.75) or take the pool price.
For the hours that are filled by the pool,  I need a purchase from Ercot Imbalance (under Ercot Asset book),  zero price and mk-mkt flag set to ""no.""


Obviously,   the market will be short tomorro, especially in the morning.   Purchase at least some megawatts for tomorrow,   but dont give away our position.
Maybe we could import from the East.  That would be great.    If you left us short for  100 mw's 12-22,  that would be cool.   We can take care of that.

FRONTERA NEEDS TO BUY 50 mw for hour ending 2300 to cover Mirant sale for the last hour.     Purchase under the Teco Service book and sell to Frontera under Teco Services book.   In Portal,  we would enter a purchase from X  and we should balance against an existing Mirant sale for hour ending 2300.   Cut the Frontera 50mw in the Portal so we will balance.

Call if you have questions,

JForney"

Ercot Traders-

We will be going live in the Curve Manager for Ercot on Monday, November 5th.  Ercot South (R6) will be your primary curve that you mark, and all others will be dependent upon that curve. 

I know the first few days will be a learning experience, so when you are ready to mark the curves just let me know and I'll come sit with you guys.

Thanks!

Subject:	FW: FERC Meeting on November 7

TJ and Claude-please send to your groups. thanks.

 

FERC's meeting scheduled for Wednesday, November 7, does not have any RTO dockets on the agenda.  The generic docket ""Electricity Market Design and Structure,"" which is the docket FERC is using for its ""RTO Week"" proceeding, is included on the agenda, but we do not expect any significant actions in this docket because FERC is still taking comments from the industry on the outcome of RTO Week.  However, this new Commission has surprised us before, so if anything of import happens at next week's meeting, we'll notify you immediately. 

Please let us know if you have any questions.

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other."

In preparation for the upcoming move to Enron Center South we are moving your Home Directories to a new trading cluster.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
This will occur for you this EVENING after 6:30PM.  
We will need to restart your computer in order to complete this action.  
Please log out or your computer by 6:30PM, if the machine is not logged off we will reboot the machine in order to complete these actions.  
Save your data before going home this evening.
If you have outstanding circumstances and cannot be down, please speak to the tech when he comes to your desk.



HERE ARE A FEW OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS ACTION:
Newer, more stable environment
More disk space available for common data
Faster network connections



HOW THIS WILL EFFECT YOU:
If you are a laptop user and have to work at home, you should save any work to your 'C:' drive on the laptop.  DO NOT use the ""My Documents"" folder.  When you return to work and reconnect to the network, any changes made to files/folders in the ""My Documents"" folder may be deleted from the laptop.
Laptops reconnecting to the network for the first time will receive a synchronization error. 



RESOLUTION:
Please call the Resolution Center (x3-1411) and they will correct the problem ASAP.
We will have additional Technicians available on the floor if the Resolution Center has any problems."

Hi Eric! 
This is Maylynn (Adnan's Fianc?).  I just thought I'd write and ""introduce"" myself to Adnan's best friend.  I also want to tell you that I was thrilled when Adnan told me you'd be able to make it to our wedding.  It really means a lot to both of us that you're coming.  I can't wait to meet you!  We'll definitely have to hang out and share Adnan stories when you get here :-)  Especially since you'll stay at my place (If Adnan's parents are still here). 
Adnan mentioned your single status, and I happen to have one girlfriend who is coming to our wedding by herself.  Please don't get the wrong idea... i just want everyone to enjoy themselves, and you two are the only ones who won't know anyone except myself and Adnan. 
Her name is Jane Lee.  I've known her since I was 14.  We went to high school together, and managed to keep in touch through our collegiate years (She went to UCSD).  She's a very attractive-pretty-energetic-not-your-run-of-the-mill-korean girl.  She's very positive, and lots of fun to hang out with.  She's one of the brightest people I know (Next to my good-looking' fiance of course! - I love embarrassing him:-), outgoing and very humorous.  I just thought I'd give you a quick synopsis of Jane (It's hard to fully describe her in a paragraph though).  And yes! She's attractive. 
If you're interested, please write and I'll be more than happy to tell her about you, or tell you more about her.  If you'd rather stay solo for the evening, that's totally fine as well :-)  Don't worry, I'm not trying to play matchmaker.  But you two are the only ones that don't have another half (All of my attractive girlfriends that are coming are taken [except Jane], and most of our friends are couples) and I don't want you to feel awkward by yourselves.  Like I said, we both want everyone to fully enjoy themselves and have a memorable evening.  So I thought it would be nice if you kept each other company.   
Anyways, I hope to hear from you soon.  Please don't be shy, I'm quite open and very verbal (As you may have heard :-)  So please feel free to write anytime!  Here's my work e-mail (day time 8-5 PST) mmorales@arnel.com 
Ciao!   :-) 
Maylynn 
PS: Adnan said to write: 
""Hey dude, told 'ya i'd hook you up!!! (and she's Asian to boot - who's the man?)"""

George,  was it you that created a counterparty list?   We need to distribute to the new traders asap. 
We are to have a meeting this week to discuss expectations and immediate goals (making money). 

give me a call when you get the chance. 

Thanks,

Please make sure you do the following before you leave tonight....Thanks for your help.  Tjae
 
Subject:	IMPORTANT!  Actions needed Tuesday.

In preparation for the upcoming move to Enron Center South we are moving your Home Directories to a new trading cluster.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
This will occur for you this EVENING after 6:30PM.  
We will need to restart your computer in order to complete this action.  
Please log out or your computer by 6:30PM, if the machine is not logged off we will reboot the machine in order to complete these actions.  
Save your data before going home this evening.
If you have outstanding circumstances and cannot be down, please speak to the tech when he comes to your desk.



HERE ARE A FEW OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS ACTION:
Newer, more stable environment
More disk space available for common data
Faster network connections



HOW THIS WILL EFFECT YOU:
If you are a laptop user and have to work at home, you should save any work to your 'C:' drive on the laptop.  DO NOT use the ""My Documents"" folder.  When you return to work and reconnect to the network, any changes made to files/folders in the ""My Documents"" folder may be deleted from the laptop.
Laptops reconnecting to the network for the first time will receive a synchronization error. 



RESOLUTION:
Please call the Resolution Center (x3-1411) and they will correct the problem ASAP.
We will have additional Technicians available on the floor if the Resolution Center has any problems."

Frontera is not scheduled to run tomorrow.   However all units should be available,  but offline with the following exception:

He 10 -  some gas line work is being done and Frontera can only run in a 1/1 config,   meaninig a max of 220.    The steamer, #3 and CT #1
will be the only units available.  For this hour.    

Late word:   If Ercot doesnt OOM us,   the entire plant will be unavailable and offline for he 1, as well.

In this scenario,  only hour ending 1 and 10 would be affected.


Any questions?

Dear Power Outage Database Customer, 
Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within are forced or rescheduled outages. Your daily delivery will still contain these outages. 
In addition to the two excel documents, there is a dbf file that is formatted like your daily deliveries you receive nightly. This will enable you to load the data into your regular database. Any questions please let me know. Thanks.

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur."

Eric, 
Nice to hear back from you, and nice talking to you earlier.   
It seems like days ago that Adnan and I were hanging out in Saint Louis with  
nothing to do but drinking, smoking, and gambling.  (I did most of the smoking, and Khan the gambling).  But this December it will have been three years since we finished our college careers.  Where does the time go?
That's very interesting, Adnan never mentioned the gambling.  But it doesnt surprise me after seeing him in our last trip to Vegas. 
Sure I wouldn't mind hanging out with your friend if she is similarly 
inclined.  It can be a bit awkward at times being around so many people who 
you do not know, and I am by nature a quiet person.  I'm not looking for 
anything more than just good company.  As you may know I just broke up with 
my girlfriend of two years, and I'm just getting used to being on my own so 
to speak.
Yes, I totally understand.  Like I said, i'm not trying to play matchmaker, I just wanted both of you to have good company.  I know how you must feel.  In a way, I'm all of my friends' ""councelor.""  I'm the one they usually come to when they have relationship problems and need advice, or plainly vent.  So I know these past few weeks have probably not been easy for you... and all I can really tell you is that time and self realization will heal the pain.  We've all been there.  
Although I have every intention of attending your wedding, I should let you 
know that my father has been ill, and that there may be matters which might 
require my attention in San Francisco.  Hopefully, this will not be the 
case.  And if so I promise to make a trip out to visit both of you in the 
near future. 
Not a problem.  Family is always first.   
Like I was saying earlier... Friday night is when my best guy friend, Mike, was thinking of taking Adnan out with all the other guys.  Alllll the guys know that anything to do with stripping is out of the question.  So Mike suggested going out to a bar or something like that and just drinking, and do the ""guy thing"".  whatever that may be.  I thought maybe you could get in contact with him and see what you guys want to do.  But keep in mind, that the wedding rehearsal is the next morning (sat 12/01/01) at 11:30am.  So I need my fiance to be ""okay"" by that time :-)  
Here's mike's e-mail... 
eyebal7@yahoo.com 
Make sure you tell him you're the best man, and you'll be coming in for the wedding on friday, and see what you guys can plan.  I know it will be hard since you're so far away, but Mike knows the ropes pretty well around here :-)  
So tell me something Adnan has probably not told me :-)  Like when he went out with ""Juggles/Jiggles"" and what he was like back when you guys were in college.  Did he tell you i almost went to Wash U?  I visited the campus w/ my dad back in august of 1996, and I loved it.  I had just returned from Europe that year, and I started to get into the groove of the whole college app thing, so my dad took me to see a bunch of places I might consider going to.  I got into Wash U, but I didn't go obviously... I always wonder... what if??  :-) 
Anyways... it's near my bed time, so I must depart.  I hope we can get to know each other a bit better within the next few weeks, and definitely into the future. 
714-457-1701 cell  (I'm never home) 
Talk to you soon, 
Maylynn"

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur."

Today,  we were both OOMC'd and OOME'd  for 135mw's for the entire day.      The OOME instruction was a category 4,  which means operate AT this level.
We sold an additional 85 mw's from the plant,  bringing the total to 220.
Ercot called to tell us to drop the output of the plant to 135.     I hesitated because of the confusion we have previously experienced with this product.

I contacted Mark Patterson and discussed the category 4 requirements and I agreed to take the plant down.
Colleen at Ercot said that she was going to ""report me"" for not immediately complying.    Am I in trouble?

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

After several very difficult weeks, Enron announced on Friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with Dynegy.  

I know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the Associate / Analyst Program.  We are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the Program.  As the merger points on the Enron homepage indicate (<http://home.enron.com/>), Dynegy has a similar program called ""PACE"", and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs.  

Today, all of the business units within Enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it's implications for Enron.  I encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings.  

The announcement of the deal with Dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we've all dealt with over the past several weeks.  As decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units, we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the Program.

New opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring.  The very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top, and our Associates and Analysts will be a key part of our future success.

I appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time.

Billy Lemmons
Vice President,  Associate / Analyst Program"

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Dear MetrixND Users,

Based on the results of our recent user survey regarding what Windows
platforms you are using, we have decided to eliminate testing and support of
MetrixND version 3.0 on Windows 95.  The small fraction of you that are
currently running a Windows 95 environment will need to upgrade to at least
Windows 98 to run MetrixND version 3.0.  RER will still support previous
versions of MetrixND that run on Windows 95, however we encourage all users
to run the most current version.

MetrixND version 3.0 will be tested on the following platforms:

  -Windows 98
  -Windows 2000
  -Windows NT version 4.0 or higher
  -Windows ME
  -Windows XP

If you have any questions, please contact Frank Monforte or me.

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd

Dear Power Outage Database Customer, 
Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within are forced or rescheduled outages. Your daily delivery will still contain these outages. 
In addition to the two excel documents, there is a dbf file that is formatted like your daily deliveries you receive nightly. This will enable you to load the data into your regular database. Any questions please let me know. Thanks.

 =09 =09    Dear Eric,  Another Congressional hearing into the Enron collap=

e Energy Committee will look into what impact Enron's demise has had on ene=
rgy markets.  The Washington bureau will have complete coverage of Enron de=
velopments on Capitol Hill.   The White House could find a lawsuit on its d=
oorstep next week.  General Accounting Office Comptroller General David Wal=
ker says he could decide as early as Wednesday whether to sue Vice Presiden=
t Cheney over the administration's decision not to turn over more informati=
on regarding the work of his energy task force.  The GAO has never filed a =
similar lawsuit in its history, but Vice President Cheney maintains the req=
uest is inappropriate.     FERC Chairman Pat Wood addresses a meeting of th=
e American Public Power Association in Washington on Monday.  The Washingto=
n bureau will have details on the APPA meeting and coverage of the regular =
FERC meeting on Wednesday.  The FERC meeting includes a closed-door session=
 on the start of a possible FERC investigation.    There's another whistleb=
lower in the Enron case - on Monday, the Houston bureau will speak with the=
 attorney for a woman who says she knew there were problems at Enron.  We'l=
l also have updates on the investigation into the death of a former Enron e=
xecutive.    On Monday, ENL's Kym McNicholas talks to Phoenix Consulting's =
Susan Schneider about some recent California ISO filings with the Federal E=
nergy Regulatory Commission.  Schneider will also discuss the California Po=
wer Authority's Energy Resource Investment Plan.   Williams Energy Partners=

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

Dear Power Outage Database Customer,

Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within
are forced or rescheduled outages. Your daily delivery will still
contain these outages.

In addition to the two excel documents, there is a dbf file that is
formatted like your daily deliveries you receive nightly. This will
enable you to load the data into your regular database. Any questions
please let me know. Thanks.

 =09 =09    Dear Eric,  The Department of Energy is hosting a conference on=
 Clean Coal Technology on Monday in Washington.  The conference will take a=
 look at where coal-fired generation could be headed in the future.  U.S. E=
nergy Association Chairman John Derrick, the Chairman and CEO of Pepco, is =
among those scheduled to speak.   Look for energy legislation to move to th=
e forefront when lawmakers return from Thanksgiving break.  Republicans in =
the Senate say they want to take action on energy legislation in December, =
while Democrats aren't as sure of the time frame. Next week, the Washington=
 bureau will bring us an update on where legislation stands and what the ch=
ances are that we'll see a comprehensive energy bill before the end of the =
year.   The North American Electric Reliability Council will release its 20=
01/2002 Winter Assessment on Tuesday; our Washington bureau will bring us c=
overage.   If MTBE is banned, the gasoline industry will have to drasticall=
y increase production of ethanol.  On Monday, the Houston bureau's  Gale Sm=
ith will have a report on some companies looking at alternative ways of mak=
ing ethanol.  We'll find out which products have a chance at becoming a sub=
stitute for MTBE.   A recent poll taken by Deloitte & Touche says power der=
egulation in Texas won't mean an immediate rate reduction for consumers.  T=
he Houston bureau will have more from Deloitte & Touche's Branko Terzic on =
Monday.   ENL's Kym McNicholas reports the California Power Authority is me=
eting over the weekend to discuss the scope and direction of its Energy Res=
ource Investment Plan.  The plan is due to the legislature and to the gover=
nor by February 15, 2002.  Kym will bring us the latest on Monday from the =
weekend meeting.   Also on Monday, the California Energy Commission will he=
ar a petition for reconsideration of its decision on Calpine's proposed Met=
calf Energy Center.  After the meeting we'll have comments from the counsel=
 to the petitioners Stephan Volker.    Jolen Operating Company President Da=
vid Fleischaker will speak with us from Oklahoma City on Monday.  He'll giv=
e us a status check of energy legislation and discuss what he feels is the =
real problem behind Enron.  We'll hear from Fleischaker during the 2:00 p.m=
. ET newscast.   From Dallas on Monday, RBC Capital Markets Director  Mark =
Easterbrook is joining us.  Easterbrook will talk about the performance and=
 outlook for Master Limited Partnerships in the energy industry and which i=
nvestors are suited to buy MLPs.  Catch him during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscas=
t.   Broadcasting Note: I just want to give you a heads up on the schedule =
for next week.  ENL will be dark on Thursday and Friday for the Thanksgivin=
g market holiday.     Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment=
's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll =
continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events=
. Have a wonderful and relaxing weekend!   Be sure to watch our newscasts e=

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com"

Ryan-

This product is now in the active status.  Unfortunately, the 7x8 loadshape is out of our hands until the EnPower guys can come up with a solution.  I'll keep our testing/bridging team on it..  Also,  send an email to Stephanie Sever and Karen O'day requesting Execute access for Product Manager (all products you currently have read access for) and Read access for all Nat. Gas.  Be sure to copy your desk head on the email.  Call me with any questions.

Chris-

Can you please approve the following product for Eric Saibi (EOL Product # 66296).  Any news on the 7X8 product?  Eric wants to roll it out as quickly as possible.    
Additionally, when log into Product Manager.....I am unable to create any products as my access is ""read only.""  What do I need to do to have this changed and have read only access to gas products added?  

Thanks,

Ryan

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay"

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Eric,

I just want you to know what I feel now, whether or not it matters.  Never
before have I felt more regret for anything I've done as I have about
breaking up with you, and then engaging in a relationship that has made you
not think highly of me anymore.  I believe that the questions that you ask
me and the reaction that you have are all justified and fair and
reasonable.  I wish I could take it all back or forget about it, but of
course that won't happen.  I have no excuses.  If I were you, I wouldn't
like me either.

One of the things that I really like about you is how well you know
yourself and how consistently your actions are in-line with your beliefs.
I have always had a problem with who I think I should be.  This is one of
the problems I mentioned as needing to be resolved.  I don't know how to
resolve this problem or whether or not it will ever be resolved, but am
aware that I have this problem.  I guess periodically throughout my life so
far, when I think things aren't working, I will try to be a different
person.  I don't know.  I can't really explain it because I don't
understand it.  I always try to be a good person, but as you said, how I
act is a reflection of who I am.  In that light, what I've done to you,
undermining your trust in me, shows that I'm not a very good person.  This
is what I regret most about this whole situation, the fact that I have lost
your trust.

Unfortunately, as I realize in hindsight, there are so many things about
you that I love, that I value so highly, that so many times over outweigh
the things about you that I would complain about before.  Your trust,
patience, kindness, realism, strong sense of self, intelligence,
objectiveness, values, appreciation of me, care for things that were yours,
the care with which you would eat are all things that I miss so much and
hate myself for causing the loss of.

Anyway, thanks for being a forgiving enough person to still talk to me.

Jennifer

ing action on energy legislation before the end of the year.  Washington Bu=
reau Chief Peter Cook says there's a long list of legislation ahead of ener=

ibuster any energy bill containing a provision to open Alaska's Arctic Nati=
onal Wildlife Refuge to drilling.  The legislation battle continues next we=
ek.   Peter also says the Washington bureau will continue to follow the FER=
C's major decisions regarding how it assesses market power.  The Commission=
 announced a major change this week that will impact many of the large and =
small utilities across the country.   Also next week, we'll see what Energy=

n a Louisiana company that uses rice hulls to create power.  Agrilectric In=
corporated consumes some of this power, but most of the electricity is sold=
 to an area utility company.  We'll have details next week.   Also, Houston=
 Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us coverage from the Alaska Resour=
ces Conference taking place next Thursday and Friday.  We'll also bring you=
 details on the final report regarding the chosen route of the Arctic natur=
al gas pipeline.  The report is due to Alaska's Governor on November 30.   =
We'll hear from Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies Exe=

Came across this deal while balancing the books Weds pm.  It looks like a preschedule for Weds that was booked into the EPMI-HRLY-SE book.  Just making sure this is correct?

Hello everyone!

I hope you're all as excited as we are!  We're very
anxious to see everyone :-)

We have pondered the idea of the Bachelor/Bachelorette
party, and we both would rather have all our friends
together, rather than seperate.  So we hope you will
all join us on
Friday November 30th at 8:00 PM
655 Baker St. #BB103
Costa Mesa 92626
We will meet there, then carpool/tailgate to the Four
Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach for an evening of
drinks, desserts, and jazz.

Please reply and let us know you'll be coming.  We
hope to see everyone there!  :-)

Adnan & Maylynn

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay"

Dear Power Outage Database Customer, 
Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within are forced or rescheduled outages. Your daily delivery will still contain these outages.

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

Hey there, I got a call from Marta in your HR about some type of ""Financial
Portfolio Managment"" deal.  The VP is TIm Kramer.  It sounded like some
type of Risk and Control, analytical position as opposed to trading.  So I
told here I was not interested for now.  Anyway just wondering if you knew
anything about this group, if it's something I should look at.  Thanks
buddy.

We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly."

Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,
UBSWenergy.com

> Just wanted to let you know that while I have the highest bidding item,
you have what I believe to be the most valuable.  I was interviewed by CNN
yesterday and they asked me my perspective on all of these items.  I said
flat out that your item for the Chewy was MUCH more valuable than mine given
an insider's perspective...  That story is set to air on CNN sometime
between 6am and 9am tomorrow, Friday.  Hopefully they'll quote me correctly.
If so, your item should take off...

All,

Here is the schedule for TDS databases on Netco: (as confirmed by Diana Allen)

TDSP	:	Will be a copy from esttdsp as of Thursday, January 17 2002 at 4:00pm (the day before Netco goes live on Friday)
TDST	:	Will be a copy from tds8itst. As requested, whenever the Netco production migration is completed, this will be refreshed from tape as of prior Dec 19 2001. 
TDSD	:	Will be a copy from tds8idev. I have moved this database into a netco server.  As soon as Clement pushed the tnsnames.ora change, you will be able to connect to TDSD


Please let me know if you have question or modification.

Tantra."

Dear Power Outage Database Customer, 
Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within are forced or rescheduled outages. Your daily delivery will still contain these outages. 
In addition to the two excel documents, there is a dbf file that is formatted like your daily deliveries you receive nightly. This will enable you to load the data into your regular database. Any questions please let me know. Thanks.

As you are all aware, Enron and UBS have entered into an agreement for the sale of certain assets of the wholesale gas and power trading organization.  As part of that agreement, the management of UBS may speak to you over the next several days about an opportunity in that new organization.  If so, we encourage you to consider such an offer. However, if you are not employed by UBS, you remain an Enron employee.  If you have specific questions regarding your employment arrangements and job responsibilities please contact Anne Labbe in Human Resources at 5-7809, or feel free to contact either Jim Fallon or Dave Delainey directly."

Dear Power Outage Database Customer, 
Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within are forced or rescheduled outages. Your daily delivery will still contain these outages. 
In addition to the two excel documents, there is a dbf file that is formatted like your daily deliveries you receive nightly. This will enable you to load the data into your regular database. Any questions please let me know. Thanks.

Expand your business! Make it easy for your customers to
pay using Visa, Master Card, Discover, American Express,
Debit Card and Checks via Phone/Fax/Internet. How? Through
a business Merchant Account!

By providing multiple methods of acceptable payment you
automatically help ensure that it will be easier for them
to pay you and build up trust. People DON'T want to send
cash or checks via mail, because it is dangerous and gives
them absolutely no guarantees whatsoever.

So make it easier for your customers and setup a Merchant
Account for your business. There are NO setup fees, and
the monthly costs are very low. To obtain more information,
please reply to this email with your name, phone number
with area code, and a good time to call. You will be
contacted within 10 business days by one of our staff.
Thank you for your time.




To be removed from our contact list, send us an email

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522."

Former Enron execs launch energy company 

PHILADELPHIA (CBS.MW) - A group of former Enron executives, who left the now-bankrupt energy merchant in July, announced Monday that they've launched a new company to deliver energy risk management services.

Celeren will cater to small and medium-sized businesses and institutions, which the company said are often overlooked by the larger energy firms.

The Philadelphia-based company will offer risk management through the sale of energy outsource products and independent power generation services. Celeren also will offer long-term, fixed-energy related costs in contrast to the saving guarantees traditionally offered in the market.

""We took the concept of outsourcing for the Fortune 100 companies and privatized it and made it something available to smaller businesses,"" said Celeren President Thomas Brigger in an interview. 

For its customers, Celeren factors in the total cost of energy to the business: the gas or electricity; improvements to infrastructure; the operation and maintenance of the systems; and the financing.

""We charge the customer a flat rate, and the risk that's involved becomes our problem at that point,"" he said. Celeren manages its risk through trading operations.

Celeren is looking for an equity partner to help expand the business in short order. The company expects to close its first deal by the end of next week.

Brigger, who was a regional manager at Enron Energy Services, is president and chief executive. Donald Parker, formerly regional director, asset risk management at Enron Energy Services, is chief operating officer. Mark Wood, James Creighton, and Ram Nathan make up the rest of the executive team. All three worked at Enron ( ENE <http://cbs.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/detail.asp?view=detail&symb=ENE>) in Enron Energy Services.

""Enron treated us very well, but they were making changes...that we didn't quite agree with,"" Brigger said. ""We presented this idea to Enron, but they wanted to focus the business on larger companies. So, we moved on.""

Celeren had hopes of having Enron as a trading partner, he said.

""The unfortunate part of Enron is that a lot of good things went down the drain with the bad,"" Brigger said. Among the bad was arrogance at the highest level of management, the difficulty in understanding the company's accounting practices - now under fire from federal agencies - and a lack of clear leadership, he said.

We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of ""NetcoOnline""

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, ""NetcoOnline"" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


NetcoOnline Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Kara Boudreau (30570) - Gas
Jennifer McQuade (53614) - Power
Dan Diamond (39673) - Gas


Definitions:
	
Password Application (PA) - Only document where a physical signature is required  by an authorized person (Master User)

Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) - Must be accepted online by the Master User before they can proceed into NetcoOnline

Master User - Typically the company authorized signatory that signed the Password Application. Establishes transaction rights for each trader (sub-users)

Sub-User - Trader, assigned either execute or read only status 

General Terms & Conditions (GTC) - Document that governs online trades unless a Master Agreement is in place

Master Agreement - Document that governs online and offline trades and supersedes the GTC

Dear Power Outage Database Customer,

Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within
are forced or  scheduled outages. Your daily delivery will still contain
these outages.

In addition to the two excel documents, there is a dbf file that is
formatted like your daily deliveries you receive nightly. This will
enable you to load the data into your regular database. Any questions
please let me know. Thanks.

 =09 =09    Dear Eric,  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham is recommending to=
 the President that the government open the Yucca Mountain Facility in Neva=
da to store the nation's high-level nuclear waste.  On Friday from the Wash=
ington bureau, we'll have reaction to Abraham's decision and where the Yucc=
a project goes from here.     On Friday, we'll bring you more comments from=
 our interviews with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission members William M=
assey and Nora Mead Brownell.  Both Commissioners will give us a look at wh=
at's in store for the FERC in the upcoming year.   The White House faces a =
greater number of questions after Thursday regarding Enron's collapse.  The=
 Department of Justice announced the start of a criminal investigation and =
Andersen employees admitted shredding Enron documents.  We'll keep you abre=

No... I think that is all that can be done. You could give hime a partial
refund for the shipping amount or something.

Hey I sent this guy a food processor for about $30 that apparently got
damaged in the mail. He admittedthat it was packed well, but asked me what
""suggestions"" I had.  I did not offer him insurance nor did he request it.
So I don't feel I am responsible.  He probably agrees although he is not
happy about getting a useless item.  I was going to write him back saying
sorry, but I don't feel responsible.  The USPS damaged the product and we
did not agree to have it shiupped insured.  Would you suggest something
different?

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00"

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	
Allen Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 3rd Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

ston.  We'll keep you informed on the situation from the Houston bureau nex=
t week.   Also from Houston, we'll discuss a cleaner-burning diesel replace=
ment fuel made from natural sources such as vegetable oils and animal fats =
- Biodiesel.  On Monday, Industrialinfo.com Synthetic Fuels Manager Jay Bru=
nson joins us to discuss the replacement fuel.   The California State Legis=
lature is back to work on Monday and there are many energy issues expected =
to pop up in 2002.  West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says restructur=
ing California's energy markets and the future direction of the new Califor=
nia Power Authority are a few topics the legislature will address.   The Ca=

Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan"

 =09 =09    Dear Eric,  Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay will not testify at ei=
ther Congressional hearing this week.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook s=
ays because of Lay's decision not to appear, the Senate Commerce Committee =
is expected to authorize the issuance of a subpoena to Lay as early as Tues=
day morning.  Two House subcommittees could soon issue their own subpoenas =
as well.  A subpoena would compel Lay to appear, but it does not guarantee =
he will testify - he could invoke his constitutional right not to speak.   =
Other hearings involving Enron will proceed as planned, with three hearings=
 scheduled for Tuesday morning.  One of the hearings involves Enron board m=
ember William Powers, who will testify in front of the House Energy and Com=
merce Committee's Oversight Subcommittee. Powers led the internal investiga=
tion at Enron, resulting in a report released this weekend that was highly =
critical of the company's management team.  We'll have highlights from Powe=
rs' testimony on Tuesday from Washington.   Unsecured creditors can help en=
sure a better rate of return on what they're owed by Enron through claims t=
rading.  That's according to Haynes and Boone LLP Attorney Lenny Parkins.  =
He'll join us during the noon ET newscast from the Houston bureau to discus=
s the process of claims trading and how creditors can assure they will rece=
ive some sort of payment.   Also from Houston on Tuesday, Williams Gas Pipe=
line CEO Doug Whisenant talks about pipeline safety following September 11.=
 He'll also discuss the future of Williams Gas Pipelines.   We'll have more=

Good news for Body Shop members! The Body Shop will reopen Monday, January 7, 2002. While we recognize that the Body Shop is a tremendous asset to all of our employees' health and wellness, we must reopen it without an Enron subsidy. Therefore, the membership fee will increase from $25 to $30 per month for all Enron employees and contractors. Spouse memberships will remain at $15 per month. Locker fees will remain at $10 per month and members may keep their current locker. (If you emptied your locker after the Body Shop closed in December, please notify the Body Shop reception desk that you would like to reoccupy it.)
The overall price increase, coupled with reduced expenses, will enable the Body Shop to reopen and remain open on a cash-neutral basis to meet creditors' requirements. Payroll deductions will be reactivated with the January 15th payroll and will include the increased fee. If you do not wish to continue your membership, please contact the Body Shop to cancel your membership via email only at <mailto:Body.Shop@enron.com>.  Membership information and enrollment forms can be accessed below:  

	   

The Body Shop's new hours will be 6:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and 6:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. on Friday. Saturday hours are not offered at this time. 
Although laundry service has been discontinued, towels will continue to be available for your convenience. Once the ongoing membership base and associated revenues have been stabilized to support staffing and housekeeping, exercise classes will be scheduled. We anticipate exercise classes to be available within a few weeks. Massage therapy services will continue and are available by appointment by calling extension 3-3047.  
Whether you are a continuing member or considering new membership, there is no better time for you to take advantage of the Body Shop and to take care of your personal health and well being than right now, at the beginning of 2002.
Your continued support is greatly appreciated. "

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, ""I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal.""

He added, ""My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."""

TO:  All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan


Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the ""Personal Data"" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

Dear Power Outage Database Customer, 
Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within are forced or rescheduled outages. Your daily delivery will still contain these outages. 
In addition to the two excel documents, there is a dbf file that is formatted like your daily deliveries you receive nightly. This will enable you to load the data into your regular database. Any questions please let me know. Thanks.

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

	Firm						Relationship

	Bankruptcy court (i.e. motions, etc.)		
	Creditors' Committee
	U.S. Trustee
	Ernst & Young					Accountants for the Creditor's Committee
	Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin		Financial advisors for the Creditors' Committee
Blackstone					Financial advisors for Enron
Batchelder and Partners				Financial advisors for Enron
Weil, Gotshal and Manges			Bankruptcy attorneys for Enron
Milbank Tweed					Attorneys for the Creditors' Committee
Andrews and Kurth				Attorneys for Enron Corp



The following are the members of the Bankruptcy Management Committee:

Ray Bowen - Chairman
Bob Butts
Jim Fallon
Dave Glassford
Dave Gorte
Mark Muller
Julia Murray
Lou Stoler

Initially, this committee will meet on a daily basis to organize all the bankruptcy related activities as well as to prioritize requests going to the Creditors' Committee and the court.  It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors.  Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee."

As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO."" This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal."

To:		All Enron Employees

From:	Raymond Bowen, Jr.
		EVP, Finance & Treasurer

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

- Just a Reminder - 


""Help restore a child's hope and imagination through reading. . . . Donate a book to a child affected by America's tragedy.""

Yesterday morning, you were invited to a social gathering on Wednesday, September 19, at Bossa.  In light of this week's tragedy, we would like to use our time together to help support those individuals whose lives have been torn apart.  Most importantly, the children of families affected by this tragedy.  

First Lady Laura Bush stated in a letter written to the nation's schoolchildren on Thursday, ""Our nation is strong, and our people resilient.  We have a well-earned reputation for pulling together in the worst of times to help each other.""  

All of us gain comfort from different things.  Think about what gave you comfort as a child - a special toy, a teddy bear, a favorite book.  When you come to our Quarterly Event next week, we ask that you bring a children's book to donate to a child to help comfort him or her. Please take the time to inscribe a personal note inside of your book, showing a child that you care.  By doing so, each child will know that your thoughts and prayers are with him or her during this difficult time.  

We have changed the focus of our event to support those affected by this tragedy and will kick off a week long children's book drive.  Please join us at Bossa on Wednesday from 5:30 PM - 9:00 PM and take the opportunity to touch the life of someone directly affected by this tragedy.   

If you would like to make a cash donation to help with Enron's relief effort, matching gift forms will be available at the gathering , and Enron will match your contribution 2 to 1.

We look forward to seeing you.

Sincerely, 

Traci Warner
Director

Welcome to Advantage, the new monthly newsletter from the Associate & Analyst Program. We're a big family - we have close to 850 associates and analysts working all over the globe - and we want to keep you current on what's going on. We have new programs, perspectives and opportunities to tell you about, as well as births, marriages and social events. We know you don't have much time, so we will use this newsletter as a quick way to stay in touch.

We're welcoming our latest class of 200 or so Associates and Analysts who have recently joined Enron. Newcomers and ""old-timers"" will find that the A&A Program is a great foundation for their careers at Enron. Some of our activities are learning experiences, and some are just plain fun. But they all help to build your network within Enron, which you will draw on frequently in the years ahead.

So here's to a great Fall. I look forward to seeing some of you this month at our pizza and brown-bag lunches and at other occasions. Let me know how things are going. And let's stay in touch.

Regards,
Billy Lemmons 
VP/ A&A Program

Fall Recruiting Season Kick-off
It's a great time to be recruiting new Associates and Analysts to Enron. While other organizations have cut back on new hires, Enron's appetite for new talent remains robust. In this environment, we expect to recruit the best of the best. We're visiting a broader list of universities than ever before. In the past we may have preferred hiring students from only a select group of schools.  The reality is that we value diversity and top performers come from many different schools.  As such, we think it is best to cast a wider, shallower net, rather than go too deep into the talent pool in only a few places.  

We need your help. The A&A program is introducing a more targeted approach to recruiting, so we can focus on the best prospects. We would like to use you, and others like you - alumni, former residents of the state and people who are just excited to be at Enron - to ""close the deal"" by communicating our story. Nothing's better than personal experience to prove that the opportunities here truly are limitless. If you are interested in helping out, e-mail Traci Warner at traci.warner@enron.com <mailto:traci.warner@enron.com>. 


The Quarterly Event Is Now a Chance to Help
Wednesday, Sept. 19, was supposed to be a night of joy, a chance for everyone to welcome our new Associates and Analysts at our first Houston Quarterly Event at Bossa. In light of last week's terror and destruction, we are turning the occasion into a kick-off of a week-long book drive. We are asking pool members to purchase a children's book and inscribe a special message to a child who has been touched by this tragedy. We hope this small act of hope and caring gives emotional support to families during this time of need.

If you would like to make a cash donation to help with Enron's relief effort, matching gift forms will be available at the gathering, and Enron will match your contribution 2 to 1.

For more information or to reserve your place, please RSVP to Donna Jones at ext. 3-3175 or Jackie Coleman at ext. 5-4070.

Dear Power Outage Database Customer,

Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within are forced or rescheduled outages. Your daily delivery will still contain
these outages.

In addition to the two excel documents, there is a dbf file that is formatted like your daily deliveries you receive nightly. This will enable
you to load the data into your regular database. Any questions please let me know. Thanks.

Everyone,

As we stated earlier, this particular virus that is on the internet is causing a lot of issues for Corporations.  As a result, the companies who write anti-virus software are continuously updating their software.  As of this morning, another update has been made available to us.  This update does a better job of protecting your PC than the update we received last night.

At this time, it is extremely important that you again go through one of the procedures listed below to get the latest update.  

1.  Logout of the network and log back in or

2.  Click on START>PROGRAMS>ACCESSORIES>Norton AntiVirus Corporate Edition and then click the Live Update button.  This will pop up a screen where you will have to click the ""Next"" button and then a ""Finish"" button.  - If you are an EES user, this option is not available to you.  Please use option 1.

The proper version of the update pattern you need is:   (9/18/2001, version 30918BL) - You may need to restart the Norton Anti-Virus client if you want to visually insure that you have the latest update.

If you have questions or concerns, please direct them to your Resolution Center.

Dear Power Outage Database Customer,

Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within are forced or rescheduled outages. Your daily delivery will still contain
these outages.

In addition to the two excel documents, there is a dbf file that is formatted like your daily deliveries you receive nightly. This will enable
you to load the data into your regular database. Any questions please let me know. Thanks.

As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov. "

In light of the tragic events that occurred on September 11, 2001, our concern is to support our employees through this difficult time.  We would like to take this opportunity to remind you of a resource available to you, Enron's Employee Assistance Program.  This service is available to you or any member of your immediate family to provide counseling services.  To talk to a counselor, simply call (713) 853-6057 during business hours in Houston or the 24 hour service line at (800) 345-1391.  If you are outside the US, please contact your Human Resources Representative for further details.  Please also be aware of any colleagues who may require assistance during this time and may not be able to seek help for themselves.

Dear Power Outage Database Customer,

Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within are forced/resched/derated outages. Your daily delivery will still

For tomorrow, see the attached schedule.     This is what is communicated to Frontera.     The mw value at the top of the page indicates what their total generation should be by hour.   The Resource Plan shuold be identical to this row.       Row 5 mirrors the purchase from Frontera in Enpower.     The Mirant call and Enron's call (Ercot Asset Book - 100 mw's) are listed as well as any daily trades executed on behalf of Frontera.    Please familiarize yourself with this report    

The top line will indicate how much power is available for bal-day sales,  etc.    Additionally,   the Resource Plan needs to accurately reflect to Ercot what the plant is capable of.  For example,   if we are generating at the maximum of 450 mw's,  we need to reflect that the combined maximums on units 1-3   do not exceed this amount.

Otherwise,  Ercot thinks they can OOM you up.


Specifically for tomorrow,   please note that we are going from 135 mw hour ending 6 to 250 mw's hour ending 7.     The plant doesnt like to do this.  A 200 mw schedule would be much more preferrable for this ramp.
So either :
1.  purchase 50 mw's from RT market for he 7.    Change Resource Plan to 200 mw's for hour ending 7 only.  Put purchase from  in  Teco Services book.
Make another corresponding sale to Frontera counterparty in the Teco Services book.   If you dont make the second entry in Enpower the Teco Services book will be long for hour ending 7.
2. have plant drag  and buy imbalance - they will call to make this decision.  No entries will be needed.

Call if you have questions.

Last night's kick-off for the Children's Book Drive was a huge success.  We had a fantastic turn-out, raised $970 and collected three boxes full of books.  Many people wrote personal inscriptions in the books to the children reminding them that they were in our thoughts and prayers.  Enron Corp has offered to match our contributions 2 to 1, making the total contribution from the pool $2,910.  

The drive is not over yet!  We will accept books and cash until September 28th.  You can come by and visit us on the 35th floor to make a donation.  

We are looking forward to seeing everyone in October for our Halloween Social!  This event is going to be hosted by EGM.  Stay tuned for more details.

Thanks again for a fantastic evening.

As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.  "

Enron Principal Investments (EPI), which was formed in the 2nd quarter, has completed its integration and the development of its new strategy.  This group will be responsible for identifying, closing, managing and exiting all non-E&P equity investments for Enron worldwide.  Kevin Garland will lead EPI, which includes Barbara Paige, Andrew Marsden, Kevin Kuykendall, Steven Sheldon, Michele Nezi Marvin and Mark Gandy.  Additionally, Dick Lydecker and the Special Asset Group will continue to report to Kevin.

EPI will pursue investments related to Enron's core businesses, where Enron has a unique insight into the market, company or technology.  Initially, this will be geographically focused in North America and Europe.  This group will rely heavily on the support and cooperation of the core business units to provide information and market insight.  

EPI may make investments in the form of venture capital, leverage buyouts, growth equity, or private equity in public companies.  The group will not make investments in seed stage companies, other funds, subsidiaries of larger corporations, or project equity.

Please join me in supporting the efforts of Enron Principal Investments.  "

You are invited to attend the 3rd Annual Urban Business Initiative Volunteer
Kickoff on Wednesday, September 26, 2001 at Slainte Irish Pub (509 Main
Street) at 6:00 p.m.

The Urban Business Initiative is a group of young professional volunteers
who are committed to the economic revitalization of Houston's inner city.
UBI was founded by a group of Enron analysts in 1996, and has since grown to
include volunteers from more than 15 corporations in Houston.

UBI volunteers work on consulting teams with small business owners and
entrepreneurs in Houston's inner city on projects such as developing
business and marketing plans, conducting financial analyses, and providing
technology assessments.  They also develop and conduct business education
seminars to promote business literacy in Houston.

Please join us if you would like to learn more about the Urban Business
Initiative and the impact we are having on Houston's inner-city businesses.

Sincerely,
Mary Messick

For Monday,   it is necessary that we sell the following for Frontera:

he 4 -30mw's
he 5 - 30 mw's
he 7 - 30 mw's
he 23 - 85 mw's 
he 24 - 85 mw's


Also,   we need  to buy 15 mw's for hour ending 7 to assist with Frontera's ramp.

We are not running the plant this weekend.    The Resource Plan should reflect that we are available but offline.
We need to ensure that the minimums and maximums accurately reflect what the plant is capable of.
Also,  please make sure that the OOM premiums (up & down) are input as $50 and $40 respectively.

FYI - for OOM up,  we receive a 14.1 heat rate multiplied by the Houston Ship Channel price.   For this weekend assume $2.05.   IF you can make hourly,  bal-day sales in excess of this,  check with Jerry or Ken at Frontera.

Steve Olinde is notifying Ercot that we are coming down this weekend  for economics.   We have given them this notice so that they can effectively manage their system.


I will be out of town this weekend.   I can be reached by my cell if you have an important issue.

Thanks,
JMF

The position for Monday is currently scheduled into imbalance in both the QSE MOS and Enpower.
Make sure that both are modified when you make sales/purchases.


Attached are the spreadsheets that reflect what Frontera is doing for the next three days.   Again,  look to the top line to know what generation output should be.  

Know it,  learn it,   live it.

 =09 =09    Dear Eric,  I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in f=
or Jay Rickerts.    Next week from the Washington bureau, we'll keep you up=
dated on a new effort on Capitol Hill to rush energy legislation through Co=
ngress.  Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma is one of many making the push wi=
th hopes of attaching the comprehensive energy bill that has already cleare=
d the House to a Defense Appropriations bill in the Senate.  If successful,=
 the energy bill could be voted on as early as next week.   Next Wednesday =
marks the first FERC meeting for new Chairman  Pat Wood.  The Commission's =
last meeting was canceled due to terrorist attacks on Washington, D.C. and =
New York City.  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will also=
 meet on Wednesday to discuss possible legislation on securing the nation's=
 energy infrastructure.  We'll have updates on these events from the Washin=
gton bureau next week.    Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will be cove=
ring the Houston Energy Dialogue 2001 Conference that begins on Monday.  Th=
e Indonesian Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources is expected to be the=
re along with other delegates from Indonesia.  Kim will bring us updates fr=
om the conference next week.   The Houston bureau will also bring us a repo=
rt on U.S. rigs and how their numbers are down.  Raymond James & Associates=
 John Tasdemir talks about the reasons for the low rig count next week.   A=
lso next week from Houston, Stolt Offshore Vice President  Gordon Barksdale=
 is penciled in to join us.  Barksdale will talk about the company's achiev=
ement of a high ""lay rate"" for a large diameter pipe on the Williams East B=
reaks pipelay project.    Finally from Houston, ENL's Gale Smith will bring=
 us a report on a  Rice University program dedicated to studying solar weat=
her.  Join us for these reports and interviews from Houston next week.   Sp=
okesperson for CAL ISO Greg Fishman will talk about new agreements between =
the grid operator and renewable energy resources.  ENL's Kym McNicholas als=
o says Fishman is expected to give a load and supply forecast for the month=
 of October.   Also on Monday, the California Energy Commission is expected=
 to vote on possible changes to the power plant siting process.  The change=
s could potentially give applicants a greater opportunity to communicate wi=
th the staff.  Kym will follow any progress from the Commission next week. =
  Kym will talk more with Phoenix Consulting Principal Susan Schneider next=
 Tuesday.  Schneider will join us from the West Coast bureau to discuss her=
 concerns with PG?Corporation and Pacific Gas & Electric Company's reorgani=
zation plan.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's noti=
ce.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do=
 our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure =

Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International
?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS
?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.
