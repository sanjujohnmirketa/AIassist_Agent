What's going on?  Nothing is happening down here.  I know I whine when I'm 
too busy, but frankly I'm having trouble thinking of things to do today.  Are 
you guys busy?  Is your boss freaking out today?  I just got a call from AA, 
so I guess that'll keep me busy for a while. 

Do you have lunch plans?  I'm thinking about just a trip to the cafeteria.  
Let me know if you want to join me.

a tuneup Monday.  Now that I'm thinking about it I'm going to be spending a

I'm planning to get out of here around 4:30ish if nothing goes wrong.  So

going to change 2000.  So she fired off an email to Jeff and made him mad.  I 
told him they wouldn't listen to me and his comment was ""They'll listen to

Kathy,

The 2000 DPR is closed.  Therefore no more changes can be made.  As I stated 
in my earlier email, either the 4.1 million adjustment was never actually 
made to the DPR or it is included in our number because the trading and 
origination p&l that I am reporting ties with what the DPR is reporting.

Robin

Robin,
$4.1 M was to have been reduced from our Q1 trading income to break out the 
origination correctly.  It looks like this was never done in your report.  I 
thought it had been based on previous Emails.  I don't think the p&l in your 
report is correct as it is $4.1M too high.  This is what our trading income 
at Dec 31 should be.  Note:  the DPR was never adjusted because the LTD and 
YTD numbers do not exclude orgination income.  It also looks like the break 
out by trader is not quite right

Subject: Re: Canada p&l  

Kathy,

I am attaching a copy of the NGPL that was reported as of this morning.  If 
you look at the by Trader P&L, we are off from your spreadsheet by 
approximately $3.6 million USD for December and approximately $7.6million 
year to date.  The $7.6 consists of the December variance and the $4 million 
variance that we discussed earlier (originations).  However, I spoke with the 
Chris Able from the Controls group, what we are reporting for originations 
and for Canadian p&l ties to the DPR.   This leads me to believe that either 
our number already includes the origination adjustment or the origination 
adjustment was never made to the DPR.  To help resolve the December variance, 
I have added a tab to your file to show what we have reported each day for 
December.  

Remember the p&l we are reporting by trader excludes originations.  Give me a 
call when you have time and we can try to resolve these variances.


 

Thanks,
Robin

Here a quick summation of my morning...CANADA SUCKS!!!!  First they 
rearranged their P&L file and moved the order that the traders appear and 
don't bother to tell us, but here's the fun part they didn't rename the 
columns.  So they had McKay's P&L reported in a  column that was titled 
Lambie.  Makes perfect sense right?  Then they call me and tell me that they 
need to move Disturnal's position and VAR under John Arnold, but they want to 
keep his p&l in Canada.  Another fun bit of Canadian ""logic.""

And here my favorite.  I got an email from Kathy this morning in reply to an 
email I sent her on December 8.  She told me that the p&l we reported for the 
first quarter of 2000 was wrong and we need to change our numbers by 4 
million to match was she thinks it should be!!!  She said that they adjusted 
the DPR in the summer to move 4 million from trading to originations.   As if 
that isn't bad enough, consider the fact that I've already explained to her 
at least twice that she's completely high b/c I tie to the DPR for Canadian 
p&l and for the originations total.  

Excluding canada (I've decided they don't deserve to have their country 
capitalized) my day's been good.   I'll have to fill you in on all the EMT 
stories my friend told me.  They were really funny.

I'll whine more later,
Robin

 I appreciate everyone's help in making sure that all the information for 
Lagrasta's originated is deals is accurate.  He is now receiving a daily 
report with all originated deals.  

 He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has 
done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to 
put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if 
his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put 
all the relevant information into the origination file and just put a $0 for 
the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help.

You crack me up...I think I only know one person who has worse luck at work 
than you do, and that would be my EMT friend that broke someone's glass eye.  
I can't believe your boss is making you work on Monday...even we don't have 
to work Monday.  

I'll talk to ya later,

Oohhh that is fine. Not a problem.  I love biiiiigggg breakfasts in NIICE 
restaurants. 

What is up with me in this group. They are definitely going to fire me. We 
were in a conference call with  the CEO of the Transportation company. His 
counselors, his tax lawyer, his investment bank, my boss, our counselor, our 
tax expert, and other very important people. Actually the conference was very 
very interesting. We (they, I just listened)basically talked about what to do 
with the unvested options of all the employees from the transport company, we 
talked about how the deal was going to change from a Stock purchase to a 
Merger. We talked about tax strategies, etc. It was very interesting.  HERE 
is the funny part. When we were discussing about all these things, I decided 
to stretch my leg  and guess what? ""I unplugged the phone line"".  Yeahh we 
missed some of the conversation.   My boss was like ""ohhh sh....."".  I 
thought it was funny, but obviously he did not think so. 

Oohhh you know what. I actually work Monday. My boss decided to veto our 
holiday Monday.   I am going to come in just to sort out all the due 
dilligence paperwork. It will be for a couple of hours only. YOu can take my 
car, and when the car is ready, you can probably pick me up and we'll go and 
pick it up.

 I couldn't schedule my car appointment for Sat.  They were booked.  So I had 
to schedule it for Monday, and you'll love this.  I need to have it there by 
9am!!  So, if you're still willing to take me to drop it off I'll buy you 
breakfast and then we can go home and take naps.  

I'm leaving now.   Goodnight.

Subject: Lagrasta Origination

 I appreciate everyone's help in making sure that all the information for 
Lagrasta's originated is deals is accurate.  He is now receiving a daily 
report with all originated deals.  

 He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has 
done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to 
put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if 
his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put 
all the relevant information into the origination file and just put a $0 for 
the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help.

Canada officializes one calc that includes both their price and basis 
positions.  Risktrac only recognizes the book id to which it assigns the post 
id.  Since the Canada post id includes two books ids,  we manually assign the 
same post id to the basis book so that both books are picked up.

Robin,
I have to get this email out and I'm looking for your help. Can you proof 
read what I wrote and ""correct"" things that are wrong...

Thanks,

Frank



Debbie,


I spoke with Robin and she confirmed that:
One post id for both price and basis books
She overrides the price book

The reason is that Risktrac needs unique book id/post id combo's.  However, 
the price book comes in no matter what, so she overrides the price book in 
order to pull in the basis book...She added that she also did not understand 
why they use one post id..

Hey,

How's your day going?  Mine's been really good...I probably shouldn't have 
said that.  I've actually felt like I'm accomplishing something today.  Isn't 
that novel?  We have Treebeard's for lunch today, YUCK.  It was actually 
pretty funny.  We weren't supposed to have food today, but the Treebeards 
delivered for the traders on the wrong day, so we get a free lunch.  

What are you doing for lunch?  I don't think I can handle Treebeards, so I 
was thinking of going to Subway.  Wanna go?

Bye.

Hey,

What's going on?  I've had a fabulous day...at least it hasn't been boring.  
Anything interesting in your world?  

It's the first night and I already want to skip my GMAT class.  I may come 
visit you before I go to my class.  I don't want to hang around down here 
until 6.   That is if you aren't too busy today.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin"

Great.  We're never going to get to eat are we?  I was actually thinking of 
taking a long lunch and then dropping you off back here and I'd disappear for 
another couple of hours.  However, Lavo just called and wanted Jeff in his 
office, so I'm not sure I'm going to get to leave at all.  I'll let you know

Subject: Enron ends exclusive agreement with Blockbuster

As you are aware, Enron signed an agreement with Blockbuster Inc. last summer 
to launch an entertainment on-demand service.  We announced today that we are 
discontinuing our exclusive relationship with Blockbuster in order to expand 
the offering by developing direct relationships with content providers and 
distribution partners.

We have made tremendous progress toward our goal of becoming the leading 
provider of entertainment on-demand over a digital platform.  We rolled out 
the trial service in Seattle, Portland, Salt Lake City and New York in 
December, and today subscribers are buying movies on-demand using the service 
we created.

However, the exclusive relationship with Blockbuster has not yielded the 
quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting, new 
on-demand service.  Now that we have proven the concept, we want to take our 
service to the next level by adding content and subscribers on an accelerated 
basis.  We feel that this can be best achieved by pursuing entertainment 
on-demand independently.

We intend to initiate discussions with various content providers for 
delivering their content over the Enron platform.  We remain very positive 
about the potential of this business for EBS and Enron and will keep you 
apprised of our progress."

I definitely want them.  We had several questions last month about why some 
curves where included where they were.  So it'd be nice to be able to blame 
someone else!  How's your day going?  How long did it take you to get up the 
elevator?  I made it in before the crowd backed up.  But apparently one of 
the elevators got stuck.  You know Dave Delainey's admin, Beverely.  She said 
she was stuck in the elevator for about 45 minutes this morning!!  She didn't 
seem too excited about it either.

Talk to ya later,
Robin
PS I think I'm going to take a nap for lunch today...for some reason I'm

Hey,  I have the original list of physical curves for the basis report that 
we divided up in  East, West, Central and Canada.  Remeber? It is the one 
that Gossett helped us divide into all these regions.  I also have the one 
where all the desk leads wrote their physical curves on.  If you want them 
I'll keep them, if not, they will be autodestroyed in 5 seconds.

But then there's still plenty of hours left in this day.  Could you send the

Several books were set up in Risktrac will incorrect names.  Is it possible 
to simply change the names of the books already set up or do we need to have 
new books set up?

I saw the article but it wouldn't load the picture of the volcano.  You 
better be careful.  

We just passed out the reports.  That should tell you how my day's going.  
I'll see you for lunch.

he is and what a great job he does.  I don't think I can stay quiet much

Yeah, I know...I'm a grown woman I don't you telling me what to do! Just 
kididng.  I just completely forgot about it this weekend.  I meant to drop it 
off Sat. and then us go shopping.  Oh well.  If I don't get to it I'll have 
it done as soon as I get to Lake Charles.  The other stuff shouldn't take 
that long.  It's just a matter of actually making myself go do it.  

Call me when you get out of French.  I'll probably still be packing, so you 
can stop by and visit.

I was just thinking about emailing you...no I really was.  It's scary, we 
think alike.  I can't believe I'm leaving tomorrow.  I have soooooo much to 
do today.  Well a lot of it probably won't get done at this point.  I've 
pretty much given up on most of it getting done before I leave.   After work 
I'm going to find a notary so I can drop all this ticket stuff off.  And I 
have to get my oil changed, and if I have time I'm going to go get my 
brother's cd.  Oh and I have to pack...can't exactly put that one off any 
more.  But other than that I'm free this evening.  Do you have French?  

I'll call you later.

you'll make it to Veracruz for New Year's Eve.

Are you inviting me or just asking if the boat will make it on time?  If you 
invitingme I'd love to come but....I have to be back here the day after 
Christmas.  And Rock's off that week so there's no chance I could take off.   
I'll just have to stay here all by myself.  

If we go to lunch today, it'll have to be kind of quick.  I have my meeting 
with the analyst people at 11:30 and another meeting at 1:00.  

Bye.

Sorry for kind of cutting you off earlier, but Gossett was hoovering.  It's 
not exactly career enhancing to make your boss wait.

What  you talking about, Willis?  I thought you were in Chicago.  Last I 
heard it was a little bigger than most college campuses.  For sure bigger 
than Tech.  Well I'd write more but I have to go home for my nap.  I'm 
working a double shift so I'm leaving for a nap from about 10-2.  It makes 
the day pass much faster.  

Good night.

This is like a little college campus. Once you're
here, you're here. If I had a car, I'd drive into town
and explore a bit.

Hopefully there won't be too many delays tomorrow when
I am leaving.

Hey Becky,

I haven't heard from you in a while.  I know, I know, you haven't heard from 
me either.  I wanted to check in and see how you're doing.  I talked to 
Shannon and she filled me in on how Megan's doing.  I want you to know my 
family and I are praying for you guys.  I know everyone says this but if 
there is anything I can do I'd love to help out.  I'm going Christmas 
shopping this weekend if you need me to pick up anything for you.  I've got 
to finish all my shopping and buy something for my mom from my dad.  He had a 
hip replacement in October and is still hobbling around.  He's actually doing 
really well considering he had major surgery.   I think he expected to be 
running marathons by now.  

I'd love to tell you at lot of interesting things going on in my life right 
now, but unfortunately my life can be summed up in one word right 
now...WORK.  I think my other group members are trying to kill me this 
month.  We have a group of three people and at least two have to be here each 
day.  Well, I have to work a double shift to cover for someone all but one 
week this month.  So that's pretty much all I have time to do now.  In fact 
I'm headed home pretty soon to take a nap before my next shift this 
afternoon.  That is the one bonus of this split shift day.  

Let me know how you're doing when you get a chance.

Robin,
As of the end of the 13th Clark had a Sumas Intramonth Position of 2 
contracts.  

Regarding prompt physical and gas daily positions I don't think that the risk 
is being correctly reflected on the basis reports for Canada given the way 
our market trades (despite what Lavo says he wants).

Kathy,

I added Clark's Aeco position, however I don't show a Sumas Basis position.  
Let me know how much of a sumas basis position he should have and I'll try to 
find it.   As for the prompt physical and gas daily positions, Lavorato 
requested that those positions be shown for intramonth only.  We have other 
traders in Houston that have prompt physical and gas daily positions that are 
not shown on this report.  

Brian,

I adjusted McKay and Lambie's positions, so they should be correct now.  Let 
me know if we are still off.   I have attached a copy of the report 
containing December 12th basis positions.  

Thank you for your help.

Robin,
I have reconciled the positions for Clark and Cowan.  Brian Gillis will do 
Disturnal, Lambie & McKay



I believe that Clark & Cowan's positions were incorrect because of the 
following:
1)  Clark has positions at Sumas and Aeco/Stn2.  This is not reflected in the 
spreadsheet.
2)   Our basis positions for the prompt month in our Intramonth books are not 
being picked up any where.  Because our IM traders actually trade for this 
month AND the prompt month their physical and gas daily positions should be 
picked up as basis positions for the prompt month as well as intramonth.  For 
example, Cowan is long 189 contracts physically Aeco for January.   Our IM 
traders trade prompt and well as intramonth because of the way our Aeco 
prices settle (ie:  during the month preceding, not during bidweek).

Kathy

Brian/Kathy,

I have attached a copy of a report that is given to John Lavorato every 
morning.  This report shows basis positions by trader for specific points.  
Please let me know if the positions we are reporting for the Canadian traders 
are correct.  If you unhide columns C-S you will find the curves that are 
added in each section.  The curves highlighted in green are used for 
intramonth positions and the white are the basis curves.   The intra-month 
position that shows is a combination of  physical and gas daily.  All other 
time periods are only basis notional.  If you have any questions give me a 
call.  

Thanks,
Robin

I thought of maybe doing something else.  Now, I don't know anything.  Why 
do  you need to know if we do something else?   Do you worry you might go to 
bed a little late?   I do not want you to not get a good sleep just because

I'm finally finished with Defensive Driving.  What a complete waste of my 
time!!  I passed though.  Can you imagine failing and having to take it 
again?!!  I think I'd rather just pay the extra insurance than sit through 
that again.   It turns out that I only had about 20 minutes left to watch.  
If I'd known that I would have finished it yesterday.  

Have you decided what you want to do tonight?  I had a great nap, so I'm up 
for whatever you want to do (within reason that is). 

Gotta go Canada's calling.

I thought about giving you a personal Happy Birthday wake up call this 
morning when I got up, but I thought after the night before you probably 
needed all the sleep you could get.  So see here I was being nice...there's 
just no pleasing some people.  

I got home about 10 last night which I was pretty excited about.  But no 
sooner did I get comfortable as I got a call from Rock.  AAAAAAHHHHHHHH.  
Sorry that just slipped out.  I'll have to vent later.

I'll give you a birthday call later.

Kathy,

I added Clark's Aeco position, however I don't show a Sumas Basis position.  
Let me know how much of a sumas basis position he should have and I'll try to 
find it.   As for the prompt physical and gas daily positions, Lavorato 
requested that those positions be shown for intramonth only.  We have other 
traders in Houston that have prompt physical and gas daily positions that are 
not shown on this report.  

Brian,

I adjusted McKay and Lambie's positions, so they should be correct now.  Let 
me know if we are still off.   I have attached a copy of the report 
containing December 12th basis positions.  

Thank you for your help.
Robin

Robin,
I have reconciled the positions for Clark and Cowan.  Brian Gillis will do 
Disturnal, Lambie & McKay



I believe that Clark & Cowan's positions were incorrect because of the 
following:
1)  Clark has positions at Sumas and Aeco/Stn2.  This is not reflected in the 
spreadsheet.
2)   Our basis positions for the prompt month in our Intramonth books are not 
being picked up any where.  Because our IM traders actually trade for this 
month AND the prompt month their physical and gas daily positions should be 
picked up as basis positions for the prompt month as well as intramonth.  For 
example, Cowan is long 189 contracts physically Aeco for January.   Our IM 
traders trade prompt and well as intramonth because of the way our Aeco 
prices settle (ie:  during the month preceding, not during bidweek).

Kathy

Brian/Kathy,

I have attached a copy of a report that is given to John Lavorato every 
morning.  This report shows basis positions by trader for specific points.  
Please let me know if the positions we are reporting for the Canadian traders 
are correct.  If you unhide columns C-S you will find the curves that are 
added in each section.  The curves highlighted in green are used for 
intramonth positions and the white are the basis curves.   The intra-month 
position that shows is a combination of  physical and gas daily.  All other 
time periods are only basis notional.  If you have any questions give me a 
call.  

Thanks,
Robin

I didn't make it to the final test.  I didn't get out of here until after 
11:30.   So I only wasted two hours of my life this afternoon.  I still have 
one section left.  If I can get out of here at a decent time I'll finish it 
tonight.  Otherwise I'll finish it tomorrow at lunch.  I have to finish it by 
tomorrow or I'll have to pay another $40!  So it's not safe to ride with me 
yet.  Not that my car ever really leaves the Enron garage!  

I'm glad you'll be getting out of here early.

No.  That's not the gossip.  I probably have you more excited than you should 
be now.  It's not as interesting as you're probably thinking now.  I spent 
three hours dozing through defensive driving this afternoon.  It's horrible.  
They just keep saying the same things over and over.  

What time do you think you'll get out of here tonight?  At the rate we're 
going I'm never going home.  No one is finished yet.  Talk to ya later.

it. Did you start watching Defensive Driving?

Just hoping I guess.   B/c mom already told me I wasn't getting anything from 
them, and I haven't picked out anything from the Grandmas, so even if I do 
get something it just means I'm going to have to find some corner of the 
closet to hide it in!!  How was that for a run on sentence!  I'm not sure I 
believe we're going to have sleet here tomorrow.  It's still hot and muggy 
outside now.

Talk to ya later,

Before you go mail me your house keys and tell me where you've hidden my 
Christmas presents.  Sorry we won't get to see you for Christmas.  Hope you 
like Chicago.  Maybe you'll make it back by Easter.  

Ruston was good.  The game was awesome!!  It was so loud in there my ears 
were ringing when I left.  We lost but it was a much closer game than I 
expected.  My favorite part was when Pat Summitt was whining and the crowd 
starting chanting ""Sit down, Pat!"" 

Keith and Susan was crazy as usual.  I had a blast over there.  

Talk to ya later.  Good luck with your trip.

So how is Ruston? Anything exciting going on?

I'm heading to Chicogo this week. (St. Charles
actually) I'm hoping that I will even make it. The
weather is so bad up there that they are cancelling
flights now. And what am I supposed to do once I'm
there? Do you think that this poor little Texas boy
has ice and snow clothes? What use would I have for a
wool coat down here. I'm going to freeze my tushy off.

Brian/Kathy,

I have attached a copy of a report that is given to John Lavorato every 
morning.  This report shows basis positions by trader for specific points.  
Please let me know if the positions we are reporting for the Canadian traders 
are correct.  If you unhide columns C-S you will find the curves that are 
added in each section.  The curves highlighted in green are used for 
intramonth positions and the white are the basis curves.   The intra-month 
position that shows is a combination of  physical and gas daily.  All other 
time periods are only basis notional.  If you have any questions give me a 
call.  

Thanks,
Robin

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the ""Pulp & Paper P&L"", ""Pulp & Paper Position"", ""Pulp 
& Paper Price"", ""Emissions Summary"", and ""Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)"" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the ""Add-Ins available"" list, look for ""Websave.""  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a ""Websave2"" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  



Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

Kathy,

I am attaching a copy of the NGPL that was reported as of this morning.  If 
you look at the by Trader P&L, we are off from your spreadsheet by 
approximately $3.6 million USD for December and approximately $7.6million 
year to date.  The $7.6 consists of the December variance and the $4 million 
variance that we discussed earlier (originations).  However, I spoke with the 
Chris Able from the Controls group, what we are reporting for originations 
and for Canadian p&l ties to the DPR.   This leads me to believe that either 
our number already includes the origination adjustment or the origination 
adjustment was never made to the DPR.  To help resolve the December variance, 
I have added a tab to your file to show what we have reported each day for 
December.  

Remember the p&l we are reporting by trader excludes originations.  Give me a 
call when you have time and we can try to resolve these variances.


 

Thanks,
Robin

Most of the time we meet these deadlines.  Several days the P&L hasn't been 
exported by 7:20 b/c I was waiting for the Management p&l changes, so that 
there wouldn't be such large changes between our preliminary and final 
p&l's.  If you rather I didn't wait let me know.  There have been a couple of 
days I've just forgotten, but that's not a regular occurance.

Subject: timing of submitting information to Risk Controls

Over the past few weeks, we have not been receiving information from the risk 
management groups on a timely basis.    This memo serves to convey our 
deadlines to you and to reiterate deadlines for the risk management group.

Our reporting is as follows (Houston time):

7:45 - posting of preliminary DPR to website (needed to be done prior to RAC 
8am meeting)
7:45 - 2:00 - preparation of the violation/notification memos
2:00 - finalization of the DPR & memos

In order to meet these deadlines we need the risk management departments to 
meet the following deadlines (Houston time):

before leaving to go home (Houston): officialization of books (to ensure 
information is captured in VAR engine and Credit AGG)
4:00 (London):  officialization and sending of feeds to IT
7:20 (all): export of preliminary information
7:20-3:00: support on explanations of violations/notification memos
11:00 (London only): export of final information (needed at that time for 
Merchant Asset group)
12:00 (Houston only): export of final information
 
Everyday at least one group misses the deadline, which is unacceptable.  
Please ensure deadlines are met going forward.  Remember, the DPR cannot go 
out until all information is received and final so one group holds up the 
whole process.

Thank you,

Shona Wilson

Yeah, I'm still here.  Still trying to tie out the basis.  I'll let you 
know.  I'm beginning to think I'll just tell them I haven't accomplished 
anything and be done with it.  There's no chance I'll get promoted 
anyway...my PRC rep doesn't even know I'm a girl.  In the email he sent 
Gossett he kept saying summarize ""his"" accomplishments, and ""his"" strengths, 
etc.  Goss thought it was hilarious.

I'll let you know how everything's going, or I'll call you when I leave.

What did you charge $1,000 for?  I haven't gotten anywhere on my 
accomplishments.  Right after I emailed you we discovered some major issues 
with the basis report, so it looks like I'll be doing accomplishments 
tonight.  I'm still hoping I can come to your game though.  It doesn't start 
until 8:45 right?

Yeah you're gonna have to explain that one...I'm confused.  I didn't go last 
year so I don't know how they check everyone at the door.  

I know what you meant in your earlier email.  That was kind of strange.  
Hopefully I'll get out of here at a decent time.  And if I can get my 
accomplishments done during the day today that would be fabulous.  Maybe I 
could even come watch you play soccer.   But all that hinges on my 
accomplishments.  And of course since I put it off until today, we violated 
every limit we have this morning!  Well we didn't violate p&l, just VAR and 
positions.  So I'm sure I'll spend most of the day answering questions.

See you at lunch.
Robin

you and your invitee- then your invitee shows up without you? Do you think 
they'll let him/her get in?

I'll explain what I am trying to do at lunch or Brown Bag.

Subject: Executive Reports Add-In

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the ""Pulp & Paper P&L"", ""Pulp & Paper Position"", ""Pulp 
& Paper Price"", ""Emissions Summary"", and ""Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)"" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the ""Add-Ins available"" list, look for ""Websave.""  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a ""Websave2"" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  



Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

Dawn,

I can't believe it...I just saw Phillip Allen laugh!!!  Like laugh out loud!  
Shocking isn't it?  I don't know what caused this phenomenon but I thought 
you'd like to know about it.

Later,

Gossett officially asked me for my accomplishments today.  I have to have 
them done by tomorrow night.  So I guess that's what I'll be doing the rest 
of the day(not that I've had that many accomplishments just that it'll take 
me that long to think of something.)  I knew I might as well add that last 
crack b/c if I didn't you would have!

I wish you would have sent me this BEFORE I ran into her today.  I had no 
idea if you'd talked to her or not so I wasn't going to say anything and make 
her made at you.  Anyway, I guess she's going to be good at keeping in quiet 
b/c I didn't know if she knew or not.  And as for the admitting in front of 
other people, I did tell you about this.  She asked me if you had left for 
Austin yet and I said no.  And then someone asked me what I was doing for the 
weekend and I said I was going Christmas shopping in San Marcos.  No mention 
of you or Austin.   Oh well, I guess we'll see how long the ""secret"" lasts.  
Was she mad at you?

Talk to ya later,

You really want to leave badly, don't you?  I don't think I have anything you 
can do though.  I packed when I went home for my nap, so as soon as I can get 
out of here I'm ready to go.  So go home and watch a couple of movies and 
then I should be ready to go.

You don't have me beat.  We have them delivered at least a couple times a 
year.  The first time I saw the lobby filled with Krispy Kreme's I thought I 
must have died and that was heaven.  They were handing out boxes to people as 
they got of the elevators.  If they did that everyday I would be more excited 
to get here. of course then I'd have to take the freight elevator b/c 
anything else would be too small.  I got to work at 3:45 this morning, so I'm 
actually going to leave pretty soon.  Unfortunately I'll be back later.  One 
of our people is on vacation so I'm covering the night shift tonight.  So it 
should be a nice 20 hour day today. 

I'm going Christmas shopping this weekend, so let me know if you still need 
something for mom.  Not that I have any great ideas, but I'm hoping I can 
find her some clothes.  If all else fails I'll get her blue earrings!!  I'm 
tempted to find somewhere where I can buy blue and red earrings in bulk and 
give her a couple dozen pairs of each.  

Are you watching CNN right now?  One of the protestors is holding a sign that 
has Gore's name written with the communist sickle as the G.  It's pretty 
funny.  I also like the Sore Loserman signs.  

Enjoy a doughnut for me.
Robin

I am now responsible for publishing the EES Gas Position Report.   It seems 
that the websave version that I received in the attached email is not updated 
to publish the EES report.  Could you please send me an updated version or 
let me know what I need to do so that I can publish this report?

Thank you,

Subject: Executive Reports Add-In

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the ""Pulp & Paper P&L"", ""Pulp & Paper Position"", ""Pulp 
& Paper Price"", ""Emissions Summary"", and ""Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)"" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the ""Add-Ins available"" list, look for ""Websave.""  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a ""Websave2"" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  



Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

Thank you for returning my call.  I went to the eRequest to submit a request

Therefore, I did not submit an eRequest.  Please let me know what I need to

it.  But this afternoon has been a little hectic.  Oh, well, it's making time 
go much faster.  Well except for the meeting with disable...that dragged on 
and on.  I'm so excited about getting out of here at a decent time.  If 
people will quit asking me questions so I can finish changing formulas on the

My day has been great. Well, more and more I realize that my stress is all my

with many of the assumptions needed for the project we are working on....... 
and I thought it was all my lack of knowledge.  Anyways, I think I just need

Don't make the changes to the portfolios yet. We have been looking at these 
books already- for we need to actually take Enovate out of Agg-gas IV as 
opposed to adding it in Agg-Gas...
Lets talk about it before we add these books!

Brooklyn,

What's going on?  How was your holiday?  I thought about you this weekend.  
We had fried turkey.  It was sooo yummy.  I was going to bring you some, but 
there weren't even crums left.  

Well, I just wanted to brag.  So I'll leave you alone.

By the way, how was your trip to Kinder?  Did you have trouble finding the 
hotel or resturant?

Sorry to hear you're being hazed today.  I'm glad to know he thinks you are 
worth something.  You can be pretty certain I won't be coming to join your 
new group when I rotate.  I think I'm going to rotate to the Controls group 
so I don't have to do anything.

Yeah, I was way too excited to sleep last night.  Just thinking about all the 
fun I'd have this week.  Oh, here a highlight for your day.  I was excited 
today b/c I'd only have to work one shift this week.  I forgot Binh has today 
off too.  She won't be back until tomorrow, so I have another two shift 
day...YUCK!!!  And to top it off Irena just came by with the December 
calendar.  Binh has a week off and Rock has the last week of Dec through the 
first week of Jan off.  I'm sooo excited.  

Enough whining for now.  Are we having Spanish class today?

Bye-bye.

I am glad everything is fine on your side.  I am sorry you did not get much 
sleep.  It is a mistery why sometimes you have those nights where you wake up 
looking at the clock. I am sure your problem was due to your  excitement to 
come back to work. You could not wait any longer. Well, I am definitely not 
glad... the hazing started again, and I think it doubled.  If we look at it 
in an optimistic way, having me do these exercises that are really hard mean

something.

It was not even worth carrying that heavy book. Just kidding, thank you very

Don't make the changes to the portfolios yet. We have been looking at these

opposed to adding it in Agg-Gas...
Lets talk about it before we add these books!

Kathy/Brian,

As I'm sure you know we are trying to determine what is causing the Canadian 
VAR to be so high.  One possible cause that we would like your help 
investigating is the Curve Codes that are being loaded in the position files 
that are manually loaded into the system each night.  It is my understanding 
that positions will be correct even if the curves loaded are spelled  
incorrectly. However, incorrect curve names will result in the positions not 
being captured in the VAR calculation.  Please verify that all the curves are 
spelled correctly in all position files.  

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Robin"

I compared the different portfolios in RisktRac and came up with the 
following changes. Hopefully this would help eliminate some of the 
differences amongst the different portfolios ....

FT-Peoples needs to be removed from P Keavey - Currently it is being double 
counted in P Keavey and J Williams.

The following books to be added to AGG-GASII
FT-CAND-EGSC-OPT-BAS 
FT-CAND-EGSC-OPT-PRC 
FT-HPLC-BAS 
FT-HPLC-PRC
FT-INT-CEN-MKT-GDL


These books to be added to AGG-GASIV, AGG-GASIII and Canada
FT-US/CAND-ERMS-GDL (Under J_McKay - Robin please confirm)


Please let me know if you have any other suggestions/comments to help solve 
this problem as soon as possible.

I spoke with Annemieke and she said that you would be the person to contact 
about adding a report to the executive viewer.  We need to add a gas report.  
The title of the Report will be Natural Gas Basis by Trader.  I am attaching 
a copy of the report that will be published.  Please let me know if you need 
any additional information.  

Thank you for your help,

Subject: Canadian VaR


I spoke with Bilal.  It is our understanding that the morning VaR report 
regarding Canada represents how we are capturing positions right now.  We are 
currently decomposing/reconstructing Disturnal's book to capture by region 
code (overall positions would remain the same).  This would impact Disturnal 
positions which will be moved to either McKay or Lambie.   From our side we 
are waiting on  the  IT resolution..  We have set a deadline of the last week 
in November to get this in motion.   On Monday, Bilal will give you a detail 
breakout of the deadline for Canada.

Regarding the the Canadian P&L report, I left a message for Gillis to get the 
numbers out there.

Additionally, last week we resolved the Canadian derived curve problem 
(derived curves were improperly mapped and position was not be captured....)  
We re-ran VaR and the e-mail below summarizes the breakout.  Overall, desk 
VaR decreased because Canadian VaR increased (hedges out portfilio).

Hope this gives you an idea of our progress.
Frank
PS. We will be moving Enovate out of Hunter Shively's VaR and give it is own 
place on the bench. This will probably impact the Central Desk VaR by approx. 
200K

Jeff,

I took care of the Executive Viewer.  I talked to Frank and apparently 
Lavorato wants to see the Canadian breakout next week.  I already have 
everything set up to do the positions, but we need to work on Canada to get 
the P&L.  Intra-Canada has a breakout but it's only in Canadian dollars.  I 
left a message for Kathy to call me.  Just wanted to give you a heads up.

Talk to you Monday.
Robin

Don't worry there's no rush.  Take your time and exhaust all your other 
options...don't worry it doesn't hurt my feelings that you are trying 
desparately to get out of spending the holidays with me.  Just kidding.  

Have a good weekend.

Me polite??  I think you have me confused with someone else.  You  are 
definitely invited.  And as for my family and friends, if you think you can 
stand them you're welcome to come along.  Some of my friends usually end up 
at my parents house anyway.  There's only one friend that'll I'll probably 
try to catch up with over Thanksgiving and we usually just go to dinner and 
catch a movie, so you are welcome to come.  

What'cha doing for lunch?

Robin, 

I thought you were just being polite and you felt bad because it was going to 
be a lonely Thanksgiving for me.  So, you were serious about it?   I really 
appreciate that you still keep me in mind, and I apologize for not having 
told you anything. I am sure you probably need to know to plan ahead. 
Ok, here is the plan. Let me make a few phone calls b/c  my best friend  from 
Cd. Juarez (border with El Paso, TX) said he  was going to Austin for that 
weekend  but nothing is for sure. Also, Ramiro was planning a trip, but I 
don't feel that bad If I decline b/c you know he loves finding foreigners to 
travel with. He actually already found somebody.   

Honestly, I did think about it, and I was a little worried that maybe you 
want to spend quality time with family and friends and I will be a perfect 
stranger there. (Ok, here is your chance to say ""yeahh,  maybe you are right"" 
""I want to spend time with my F & F)  Or if you are still being polite, then 
let me get bactk to you on that after I make those phone calls. 

THank you.

Gabriel

Time spent actually typing, procrastinating, or staring blankly into space??  
I spent the most of the morning Wed. on evaluations.  Of course I had five to 
do and plenty of little tasks thrown in the middle.  So it probably took me 
about 20 minutes per evaluation.  Some I had to think about a little harder 
than others.  It all depends on how many comments you write.  Mine took me 
the longest and I'm still not happy with it.  

Have fun bowling.  I'd love to see your shirt!!

Sounds like you have a wild night planned.  I don't think I'm up to that kind 
of partying tonight.  I've actually finished the evaluations, but I haven't 
submitted them yet.  I'll do that today.  Thanks for the warning though.  

How late were you here last night?  How did everything turn out with your

Outside of moving the deals to another book, I don't think you can avoid 
liquidating at the end of the month.  So I'm going to leave these in the 
portfolio.

Thanks for the info.

Robin, the book for Todd Richardson is technically dead.  We are the deals 
that are in there monthly.  Is there a better way to do this?  We hate having 
to remember to liquidate it at the end of the month.  I think it deals in 
there until Aug 2001.

Here's a mental picture for you of me when I got to the chafing part of your 
email...thumbs in ears, remaining fingers covering eyes, and repetitive 
chanting of la,la,la,la,la,la........  

I'm so disappointed but I won't be able to join you for the ""fun run"" on 
Thanksgiving.  I'm headed home to see the family.   I really wish you were 
here right now.  You are one of the few people that would truly appreciate 
how irritating this guy that sits next to me is!!!  He just asked someone how 
Chi-COG-OOOO was.  How do you accent every syllable (and then really drag out 
the last)???  Unfortunately that isn't nearly the most irritating thing that 
he does.  I'll update you as he provides me with more stories.

As for the food in Australia...it's really not all that different from here.  
I mean Sydney is a big city so they have just about every type of food.  They 
have a lot of American fast food chains.  The one that surprised me though 
was KFC...it's everywhere.  It's a lot more popular there than it is here.  I 
guess some of the biggest differences are that they eat pumpkin as a 
vegetable, and they put beets on their hamburgers, and they eat a lot of 
lamb.  Lamb is about as cheap and common as chicken is here.  And they eat 
meat pies....yuck.  The pastry is good on the pies but there's no flavor to 
the meat...it's just greasy ground beef.  I think they still have a little 
too much of a British influence in their food...they don't believe in 
seasoning.  

I saw quite a few good looking guys.  There was a lifesaver training course 
going on at Bondi while I was there.  That provided some great scenery!!  But 
then the problem is that the men don't realize when to stop wearing the 
speedos!!  The young guys look good in them, but after 30 they shouldn't be 
worn in public...and after 60 they shouldn't even be considered as underwear 
under six layers of clothing, but they especially shouldn't be worn on the 
beach!!!!  I saw one old man whose belly hung so low that I wasn't even sure 
he had a suit on, and I was scared to look too close for fear of what I might 
see and for fear he'd think I was interested.

Gotta go to a meeting.
Robin

Wow, what a trip.  Wish I could have been there to be with all those old
people.  I do have specific questions about Australia though.
How is the food?  Weird, good or just not worth eating?  What do they eat?
What did you eat?
See any good looking guys?
Did you make them speak just to hear the accent?  Did they make you speak
just to hear your accent?
Going back?
Megan enjoyed your email  message.  Needless to say so did I.
Ann and I ran a 25 K (15.5 miles) yesterday morning.  Got a T-shirt and a
banana for the run.  Neat, huh?  I was nine minutes slower this year than
last year but it doesn't bother me.  I had fun but at about mile 13 I was
definitely ready to cross the finish line.  I just had a couple more miles.
 My shorts chaffed the inside of my inner thighs and that was/is painful.
Is that too much information?  I can walk this morning but my legs are
fatigued.  I couldn't run from the front door to pick the newspaper off of
the front lawn this morning.  Pitiful.  Too bad you can't see and hear me
moan.  I'll just write it a couple of times.  Moan, moan.  There, that's
better.
Plans for Turkey Day?  Want to run a 5 K with Ann and I?  It'll be fun.
Let me know.  You know, I think Ann is going to Michigan, so it'll just be
me.  Maybe I'll just stay home and stuff my face.
Megan is very weak.  I sure do love that kid.
Well, don't work too hard.
See ya, Becky

Thought ya'll would like this....

Subject: [1_Bakery_Madness] A CHANGE IN PLANS


Couldn't resist sending this!!!!!!!!!!! Sandy
Hopefully no food list will be unhappy with this

A CHANGE IN PLANS

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. I'm telling you
in advance, so don't act surprised. Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming, I've
made a few small changes:

Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries. After a
trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of flaming
lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.

The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china or
crystal goblets. If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone
will
get a fork. Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the
plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas.

Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I
promised. Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration
hand-crafted from the finest construction paper. The artist assures me it is
a turkey.

We will be dining fashionably late. The children will entertain you while
you
wait. I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I have made
regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims and the turkey hotline. Please remember
that
most of these comments were made at 5:00 AM upon discovering that the turkey
was still hard enough to cut diamonds. As accompaniment to the children's
recital, I will play a recording of tribal drumming. If the children should
mention that I don't own a recording of tribal drumming, or that tribal
drumming sounds suspiciously like a frozen turkey in a clothes dryer, ignore
them. They are lying.

We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start
of our feast. In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method. We've
also
decided against a formal seating arrangement. When the smoke alarm sounds,
please gather around the table and sit where you like. In the spirit of
harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate table. In a separate
room. Next door.

Now I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in
front
of a crowd of appreciative onlookers. This will not be happening at our
dinner. For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private ceremony.
I stress ""private"" meaning: Do not, under any circumstances, enter the
kitchen to laugh at me. Do not send small, unsuspecting children to check on
my progress. I have an electric knife. The turkey is unarmed. It stands to
reason that I will eventually win. When I do, we will eat.

Before I forget, there is one last change. Instead of offering a choice
between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the
traditional
pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small fingerprints. You will
still have a choice: take it or leave it.

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. She probably
won't come next year either.

I am thankful.

Hey Becky,

What's going on?  Things are completely crazy as usual around here.  I need 
another vacation!  I never told you about my trip did I?  I've told everyone 
else that stood still for more than 10 seconds.  It was so much fun.  The 
olympics were so awesome.  I got to see the US women's basketball team play 
Australia for the gold medal.  The crowd was soooo wild...that is until we 
won.  And I got to see Cathy Freeman and Marion Jones run.  The whole first 
week of my trip was spent at the olympics everyday.  And the second week I 
spent touring all the beaches that I could find.  Oh, here's a funny story 
for you.  Okay I'm halfway across the world in a country known for bronze, 
muscular sufers, right?  So I take a day cruise around the Brisbane waters 
one day.  These cruises are scheduled everyday and each ship holds about 
80-100 people.  As we board the captain tells us that there will be 85 people 
on the cruise.  Here's the fun part....80 of the 85 people were from a WWII 
veterans reunion!!!  I was on a boat full of grandpa's.  Actually it was 
pretty funny.  This one old man sat next to me and started telling me why 
they were having the reunion and what thier batallion had done during the 
war.  Then he tells me (keep in mind this man's at least 70) that he was a 
lifesaver (lifeguard) on one of the local beaches until the year before when 
an injury forced him to retire!!!   Then he starts telling me about the war.  
He said, ""Yeah, I was a POW for about 9 days but they weren't feeding me very 
well so I left.""  He had escaped from a Nazi POW camp and fled to Greece 
where he joined the Greek reserve forces.  Because he fought with Greece in 
the war he's now a Greek citizen.  Then after the war he and some friends 
bought a van and traveled all over Europe and Asia.  When they ran out of 
money they'd just stop and get jobs until they could save some money and then 
they'd start again.  I hope one day I have stories even half that 
interesting!!  But leave it to me to go halfway around the world and hang out 
with old people!!  

How's everything going at your house?  What's up with this election?  That's 
all anyone's talking about around here.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin"

Jeff Gossett has indicated to me that you are the person responsible for the 
Benchmark and NGP&L cost center (cc107074). I left you a voice mail 
indicating that I would send you a copy of energy operation's activities.  We 
are still in a phase-in process where we are trying to make this process as 
efficient and easy for you as possible. 

For now, if you could:
Identify the activities being performed by your team (cc107074), and the 
hours worked during the month of October
Identify drivers for your activities. This would be things that affect your 
workload, for example, in RM Texas the driver is # of deals; please call me 
if you need further clarification
Identify the commercial teams that you guys support



Our goal is to have this information by Wednesday, Nov. 8, if this is going 
to be a problem, please let us know.  Next month, you will be able to access 
cc107074 through the normal survey, which is through MS Access.

Please call either myself, x3-597, or Shari Mao for further information.

Thanks,
Jen Reside

I paid about $94 Austalian which is around $50.  It was a pretty big, and 
definitely awkward (that word doesn't look right) that's why it flew home on 
it's own.  Besides I already had my luggage allotment.  My box wasn't nearly 
as heavy as yours is.  What kind of tree did you buy???  What is it an iron 
statue of a tree?  

Are you leaving tomorrow?  I know I've asked you this before but I can't 
remember.  If you don't have any plans let's go to lunch.

Thanks,  I'll send this to Ibrahim and he will then send that to the guy in 
EBS.  I have a few  questions for you.  How much did you pay for the box that 
was sent to you from Australia?  Why did you not take it with you? 

Ok, this is the story. My mom asked me if I could buy a Christmas tree,and of 
course, being a super duper nice son as I am, I was stupid enough to buy it. 
Well the box is about 63 lbs. and 57 x 14 inches . I called Continental and 
they said they would accept it.  Well, I am not sure about the whole thing. 
First, it is so big that it doesn't even fit in my car. I had to take it home 
with the trunk open. I'll see how I can figure this out, but I just wanted to 
ask you about the box from Australia. 

Anyways, I hope I can see you before I leave for Mexico. I probably just drop 
by and say bye. Of course I have not packed and still have to buy a few 
things. Have a nice day. I'll let you know about the whole EBS thing. 

Gabriel

Sorry to hear about your airport travels.  Has Alejandra found a place to 
live yet?  When is she starting on the east desk...they need help!!  They 
screwed their position up again today.  

My weekend was really good.  Of course it could have been better without the 
rain.  Saturday my friend and I sat around and gossiped most of the afternoon 
and then went out to eat and to a movie.  Then Sunday we went to visit some 
friends of ours in Sugarland that just had a baby.  So we spent most of 
Sunday afternoon playing with the baby.  The dad is hilarious.  He's the type 
that seems really quite but when he says something he just cracks you up.  He 
was talking about the baby monitors they got.  He said he was going to put a 
message on it that said, ""Hi, Brianna.  This is your parents.  We aren't 
available right now, but it you leave a message we'll get back to you.""  

Are we having Spanish class today?  

Robin

PS My forearms are a little sore, but that's all.

  Rest of Saturday was good I went out with some friends to this place I 
really like. However, Sunday was  not so good. I went to IAH (airport) twice. 
So, that was almost like going to Austin, plus on the way back rain was very 
very bad (The 10:30 pm. rain).  For the second time, Alejandra's plane was 
delayed, but this time it was more than 5 hours delayed. She got stuck in 
Dallas and of course I knew once I was already at IAH.  How about you? 
Hey, My right shoulder is a little sore (Golf). Is your's sore? or am I just 
a little rusty.

new person if you are really busy. Personally I do not like the idea.  

Ok, I'll ask Ibrahim about this friend of his.  

As for golf practice, we'll see if the weather turns out to be ok. I'll send

Frank,
Please find enclosed the PL/SQL scripts that are called from the two C 
programs below. The ERMS packages handle all of ERMS positions, with specific 
handling of Canadian and Intra month positions. The power package handles all 
of ENPOWER databases(Australia, Europe and US) and EXPOWER(US only). The 
spreadsheet handling is an entirely different process which specifically 
handles text files extracted from spreadsheets.

The 'C' programs control the calls to the PL/SQL packages. The ERMS package 
also decides on the strip flag for intra month positions.

Regards,
Ramesh

Subject: 'NG' positions roll-off logic

Jeremy,

Here is the roll-off logic for 'NG':

1.  For regular ERMS books (not Intra Month book),  first we get the promptDt,

 promptDt := TO_DATE('01'||TO_CHAR(ADD_MONTHS(TO_DATE(p_effDt,'J'),1), 
'MONYYYY'), 'DDMONYYYY');

 Then if p_commodity_cd = 'NG', we go get the cutOff date,
  SELECT exp_dt
           INTO expDate
           FROM egs_expiration_dates
         WHERE expiration_rule_cd = 'Natural Gas Futures'
             AND ref_period_dt = promptDt;

 IF (TO_DATE(p_effDt, 'J') > expDate) THEN
        cutOff := ADD_MONTHS(promptDt,1);
      ELSE
        cutOff := promptDt;
      END IF;

 The strip flag, when populated into rms_deal_legs table, is computed using 
the following DECODE statement,

 DECODE(SIGN(TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(ref_period_dt,'J')) - 
TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(cutOff,'J'))),-1,-2,NULL).

 Positions with strip flag as -2 will be rolled off by V@R program.

2.  For Intra Month books, first we get the nextMonthDt,
 nextMonthDt := 
TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(TO_DATE('01'||TO_CHAR(ADD_MONTHS(TO_DATE(p_effDt,'J'),1),'MM
')||
        TO_CHAR(ADD_MONTHS(TO_DATE(p_effDt,'J'),1),'YYYY'), 'DDMMYYYY'),'J'));

 Then if book flag is 'P', the strip flag, when populated into rms_deal_legs 
table, is computed using the 
 following DECODE statement,

     if pub cd starts with 'GD', then the positions are taken in as 
'FLOATVSFLOAT', and strip flags for
  two legs are,
  DECODE(SIGN(TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(ref_period_dt,'J')) - nextMonthDt), 1, -1, 0, 
-1, -1, -2, NULL) and
  DECODE(SIGN(TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(ref_period_dt,'J')) - nextMonthDt), 1, 1, 0, 
1, -1, -2, NULL),
  respectively.

     else if pub cd does not start with 'GD', then only positions with 
swap_cd as 'S' are captured as    'SWAP'.  The strip flag is,
  DECODE(SIGN(TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(ref_period_dt,'J')) - nextMonthDt), 1, 1, 0, 
1, -1, -2, NULL)

 Else if book flag is 'G', the strip flag in rms_deal_legs is hard coded as 1.


Thanks,

Wei

What do I think about what...the fact that you're now the one that's a little 
stressed?  I think that's kind of funny!!  Just kidding.  I have a friend 
coming in town this weekend, but she's not coming until sometime Sat. 
afternoon probably around 3-4ish.  So if you want to go to the driving range 
around noonish on Sat. we could do that.  Although I think it's supposed to 
rain all weekend so we might just end up back at the movies.  

As for the rotation, I wouldn't exactly say I know Brian but I met him at the 
Morton's dinner.   I guess I'd be as well off starting with him as to call 
Ibrahim's friend, since I don't know Ibrahim or his friend.  Well actually, I 
might know Ibrahim's friend.  Ask Ibrahim his friend's name and if I don't 
know him I'll call Brian on Monday and see exactly what it is that they do.  
Thanks for the help with this.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Well, We can go different routes. Do you know Brian Hoskins?  If not, I know 
him well. Well, he works in that group. He can tell us what it is about. The 
last time I talked to him, he did mention something about customers (big 
customers); but honestly I am not sure exactly what it is. Then what we can 
do is ask Ibrahim the name of his friend. We'll ask Brian if he knows him ( 
Brian, by the way, loves to help people. but only good people : ( 
 and we can go from there. 

If not, we can just go trhough Ibrahim. Once that is done, We'll figure what 
to tell Gossett (ouchhhh) . Uppsss, I do not want any oart during this stage. 
He will probably kill me if he knows I told you about this group.

Ibrahim is leaving next week. He had told me that he was going to stay about 
3 more weeks, but his new group wants him. Uppsss  I feel I have SOOOOO Much 
to learn. I really feel behind. There will be a lot of reading this weekend 
but of course I might take a break and go to the drive range if you want to 
go. You never responded me. Ok, ok, maybe you do not want to go. I'll go on 
my own and hit the ball with my tennis raquet.

Anyways. who said there was no stress level here. I am getting kind of 
nervous because it is a little complicated.  Tell me what you think. 

Gabriel

So what you're telling me is that you're intentionally trying to bait me.  
Apparently you haven't figured out yet that it can be hazardous to your 
health to make me mad!!  And I know you well enough to know that my last 
statement will only serve as a challenge to you.  You're going to spend the 
rest of the day trying to irritate me.  Don't deny it.  I know you too well.  
So where are we going to watch the game?  If I understood soccer a little 
better I'd be more involved in the trash-talking.  But I'll just leave it at 
this...the US could kick Mexico's butt at anything!!  Mexican men can't even 
knock down an American girl even when they are given 13 whole seconds to 
try!!  How could you possibly expect a group of these weaklings to beat a 
group of top quality American athletes.

Bye.

PS Have fun in all those meetings.  Pretty soon you'll be going to more than 
Gossett.

I didn't want this just popping up on your screen.  

So far it's just getting worse!!!  I've already been up there three times 
today and of course each extra trip lowers the P&L.  He must think I'm the 
biggest idiot in the world.  I'm going to have to change my name to get 
another job after he fires me.  When he saw me standing outside his office 
this last time he just spread his hands like what could possible be wrong 
now!!  

If you want to make a lot of money and are willing to take this job back 
now's your chance.  I think John would pay you $100,000 to take back over.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin"

The Nymex book granted $9,600 of Middle Market Northeast Originations and  
$7,460 of Middle Market East Origination that the East desk did not recognize 
on their P&L.

Subject: Executive Reports Add-In

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the ""Pulp & Paper P&L"", ""Pulp & Paper Position"", ""Pulp 
& Paper Price"", ""Emissions Summary"", and ""Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)"" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the ""Add-Ins available"" list, look for ""Websave.""  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a ""Websave2"" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  



Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

For those tired of the usual ""friend"" poems, a touch of truth!


When you are sad,.............I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge
against the scum sucking bastard who made you sad.
When you are scared,.........I will laugh at you and tease you about it
every chance I get.
When you are worried,.........I will tell you how much worse it could be and
to quit complaining.
When you are confused,........I will use little words to explain it to your
dumb butt.
When you are sick.........I will hold your hair while you pay homage to the
porcelain god.
When you fall......I will point and laugh at your clumsy butt.
This is my oath...............I pledge this till the end.
Why you may ask?...............Because you're my friend.

Hope it made you laugh - but you know I got your back!!!!!!!!

Chris,

Here is our explanation of the 5 Day loss violation.  Let me know if you need 
any more information.

Due to a forecast for mild November weather, futures prices have fallen 
sharply over the last five days.   Nymex futures prices have fallen a total 
of $0.68 over the last five days.  The Gas desk's loss is primarily driven by 
a long price position held by the Financial desk, which averaged 7, 295 
contracts over the same period.

For those tired of the usual ""friend"" poems, a touch of truth!


When you are sad,.............I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge
against the scum sucking bastard who made you sad.
When you are scared,.........I will laugh at you and tease you about it
every chance I get.
When you are worried,.........I will tell you how much worse it could be and
to quit complaining.
When you are confused,........I will use little words to explain it to your
dumb butt.
When you are sick.........I will hold your hair while you pay homage to the
porcelain god.
When you fall......I will point and laugh at your clumsy butt.
This is my oath...............I pledge this till the end.
Why you may ask?...............Because you're my friend.

Hope it made you laugh - but you know I got your back!!!!!!!!

See you in two weeks.

Dawn,

Doesn't it suck to be at work and know that someone else is out of the 
country?  I just want to let you know how much I suffered while you were 
gone.  I realize now just how bad you must want out of this group.  Without 
you or Jennifer there was no real conversation the whole week!!  Chris just 
works quietly.  Jason interrupts the quiet with inane comments that I have no 
idea how to respond to.  And Anne...well I can't even explain that.  

Let me digress for just a moment to talk about work.  Nothing really 
happened.  All was quiet.   If anyone was upset about anything they didn't 
tell me about it.   I did get an email from Frank Cernseck(or how ever you 
spell his name).  It seems we took too much as broker fees in July.  I 
haven't researched it, but from what Victor tells me that's an adjustment 
that needs to be made on last day P&L.  I'm sure I'm not telling you anything 
you don't know.   

Just wanted to let you know I'm glad you're here and I'm not.  

Hope you enjoyed your trip.

Robin"

in for $20.  I'll bring the money down in the morning.  Where are you located

today.  We need to plan on going to lunch sometime soon.  My last day is next

Sorry I missed you guys for lunch yesterday.  I didn't get your email until 
yesterday afternoon.  I've been in class for two days...Derivatives I.  It's 
really hard to sit still and think about swaps and options when I'd rather 
think about Sydney!  But I guess it's better than being at my desk all day.  
The days are pretty slow.  It doesn't really get busy here until 3:30 or so.  

Bye,
Robin

PS If I forget my bras, I'm just not going to bother!!

Okay, here's a trivia question for you.   There are two siblings.  One's an 
engineer and one's an accountant.  One works for a natural gas company and 
the other works for an accounting firm.  Which one works for the accounting 
firm?  

Do you see the absurdity of our lives???  Level III, huh?  I don't know 
anyone over level II.  Well, except Mr. Kirkpatrick's friend that's a partner 
in New Orleans.  

I dreamed the other night that I was outside the Swimming venue in Australia 
and the American coach heard me talking and realized I was an American.  He 
told me I had to swim an event b/c all the swimmers were either sick or 
injured.  I never did get to swim, though.  The alarm went off before I even 
found out what event I was swimming.  I hope it's not butterfly...I wouldn't 
be very competitive if I had to swim butterfly.  Not that I'd even be 
competitive if I was swimming freestyle at the olympics, unless it was the 
special olympics...then I might stand a chance!

Congrats on the job.  
Robin

We actually got some significant rain...up to 8 inches in some areas. Of 
course there was none at the airport, so officially it didn't rain yesterday. 
I was in FortWorth while it was raining here, so all I got was the spray from 
the wet roads making my car dirty.

When do you leave for Australia. Bring me back something nice.

I'll be an Experienced Consultant Level III in the Supply Chain service line 
with Arthur Andersen. It sounds like a really fun job, and they made an offer 
I can't turn down.

>>> <Robin.Rodrigue@enron.com> 9/12/2000 3:33:27 PM >>>

Glad to hear you haven't dried up and blown away.   They said we got rain
here, but being from LA I say we got a little drizzle.  Just enough to make
my car look like I went driving through mud puddles.

What kind of job did Aruthur offer?  Once again let me point out that I
enjoy the fact that this is on your company email.

I'm spending my time these days checking the official Olympics website and
dreaming.  I'm trying to get fired so I can just stay in Australia.  I
don't think it's working though b/c I just keep getting more jobs.  I have
two right now.

Be nice and I might at least think about you while I'm in Australia.

Talk to ya later,
Robin

I leave for Sydney a week from Saturday.  I already have orders to email my 
parents while I'm there to let them know what's going on.  And you're right 
there's no hope for keeping me in line!  I think I'll just retire early and 
stay over there.  I would make a very good beach bum.  Of course with my 
complexion I'd look like a tomato in a matter of hours (plus I already have 
the soft and squishy part down).   I went shopping and spent way too much 
money this weekend buying things for my trip.  I'm having to buy clothes.   I 
don't seem to own casual clothes anymore...especially not spring clothes.  
I'm used to only two seasons, summer and suedo-winter.  It'll be spring over 
there and I've been checking the temperature.  It's been between the mid 40's 
and the low 70's.  I'm going to have to pack everything I own.  

I'm really sorry to hear about Megan's prognosis.  I know you hear this all 
the time but seriously, if there's anything at all I can do let me know.   
And I want you to know you guys are always in my prayers.

We should go to lunch sometime now that I'm working daylight hours.

I'm hoping they have good movies on the flight!  But I'm also bringing a good 
book, and I'll probably bring a pair of headphones...even if I don't plug 
them into anything.  I think I'll have them as a decoy in case I end up with 
an annoying neighbor for the flight.  Everyone around me knows my travel 
plans as well as I do.  I think I must have become a little annoying myself.  

Well back to work.

It's nice to know I have good tastes. I think I did a good job picking out 
both b-day presents. Do you want me to mail a check or do you take Visa?

I decided to let you use them. It's too hot up here to use them. Maybe if it 
ever rains. If you like them, I got them at a store up here for a really good 
price, but you probably have such places down there too. You won't become a 
golf junkie after you find out how much they want to actually let you play 
golf on one of those nice green courses. It's a little more than the driving 
range.

Glad to hear that you're really not a vampire.

My company was named one of the 100 Best managed manufacturing companies by 
Industry Week. It's been a real joke around here. We're not sure what they 
were smoking when they made that decision. (Note the irony in using company 
email to say this...BTW...I have an interview with Arthur Anderson on the 8th)

You got her a $100 gift certificate to Talbot's (a women's clothing store).
You did a very good job picking it out.

Thanks for the golf clubs by the way.  I thought you weren't going to send
them, so I was surprised when Karon told me she had them.  I'll hold them
for ransom until I get paid back for the birthdays!!  I actually went to
the driving range this weekend.  I definitely think I could get hooked on
this sport.  Hopefully I won't become one of the ""golf junkies"" but I'm not
sure you can avoid it.  I was watching a golf infomercial the other day
thinking ""I need that!""

Well back to work.  Did I tell you I'm working daylight hours again?

Talk to ya later,
Robin

I thought you'd appreciate this email from my brother.  It's the best family 
email I've gotten lately.  I'm such a great sister...I bought the present, 
wrapped the present (or at least watched while the clerk wrapped it), and 
delivered it to my mom for her birthday, and I was nice enough to put my 
brother's name on the gift.

How much did you pay for your clubs?  By the way, I thought using company 
email was a nice touch.  We were named one of the top 100 companies to work 
for...number 24 to be exact.  They are pushing for #1 next year.   I think 
it's the Analyst program that's holding them back right now!!!  

Well back to pretending to work.  Right now I'm training and there's nothing 
to do in the middle of the day with this job, so there are two of us trying 
to stay busy doing nothing right now!

Gabriel,

I'm not sure if Binh sent an email to you and to Controls to explain the 
Canadian origination variance.  You may already be aware, but on the Orig 
Sched the originations are converted to $US using the spot rate for the day.  
However when the originations are calculated for the Report tab the rate 
applied is the average rate for the month.  Therefore these values will never 
be the same.  Nicole is going to talk to Kathy when she gets back to Canada 
on Monday.  Nicole says she has found a way to modify their spreadsheet so 
that both values are calculated using the daily spot rate.   If you haven't 
recieved an email from Binh explaining this issue you might want to forward 
the attached message from Nicole to Michael and Chris.  

Thanks,
Robin

Subject: Origination Problem

Robin,
I spoke with Kathy regarding the problem we are having with origination. Her 
explanation is as follows:
This is an fx issue. Because origination is denominated in a currency (USD) 
which is different than our functional currency (CAD), origination expense 
will be comprised of not only origination but also currency gains and losses 
on origination. Everyday orig. is retranslated in C$ using the current rate 
and any fx gains or losses relating to that is added to origination.  
Therefore, the total origination as per the ""origination"" tab will NOT equal 
the origination as per the ""report"" tab. Robin should add in the translation 
gains/losses to get it to reconcile. 
I hope this explanation makes sense and is acceptable. I know you're used to 
the two numbers reconciling but since we were asked to denominate our 
origination in US dollars (about 2 months ago) these two numbers will never 
again be the same.
Please call if you have any questions,
Nicole

How scandulous of your mother!!  My mother would never use sucks...but my dad 
told me something pissed him off one time.  I was completely shocked...I 
didn't even know what to say.  I know it's hard to imagine me speechless, but 
I was.  

You should know by now that I'm heartless and that my grandmother will have 
to go the hospital all alone.  I had to listen to her last time whine about 
how no one respects her.  It took everything I had not to say, ""Of course we 
don't respect you.  We all know you're crazy.""  

What are you doing for lunch Friday (as in probably the day you're reading 
this)?  I'm going to come in early b/c I've been bombarded as soon as I walk 
in the door the last two days.  

Let me know if you want to go to lunch.  I'll call you when I get in.  

I'll be praying for Megan.

Yeah,my family's pretty entertaining!!  I went home last weekend for my mom's 
birthday.  We had all gone somewhere and when we were about to turn the 
corner on our street we were all praying and holding our breath hoping my 
grandmother wasn't at our house!!  She's been driving my mother crazy (it's 
my dad's mom by the way).  She's now determined that there's something 
terribly wrong with her.  She has a doctor's appt this week and says she's 
going to convince the dr to send her to the diagnostic center of houston.  My 
dad informed me that she told him she'd just fly here...so I'm guessing she 
actually thinks I'm going to take off work for a week to shuttle her back and 
forth to the dr.   She's wrong of course!  

Well enough rambling for now.  If I get any good family emails I'll let you 
know!

I thought you'd appreciate the humor in these.  Actually the first one's kind 
of scary!!  Just in case you think I made this stuff up the web site's at the 
bottom.  

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is actively proposing that animal 
carcasses with cancers,
     tumors or open sores be regarded merely as unaesthetic but safe for 
human consumption as
        long as the offending part is cut away. The proposal is part of a 
general loosening of
     slaughterhouse inspection standards, whose public comment period ends 
Aug. 29. One critic
    already weighed in, saying she did not want to ""eat pus from a chicken 
that has pneumonia,"" but
    also included as benign by the proposal are glandular swellings, 
infectious arthritis and diseases
                             caused by intestinal worms.



                               In Their Own Words

     Hubert Penrod Jr., on why the May promotion he had scheduled for his 
Huge Hooter Haven
     strip club in Nashville had failed to attract men who had come to town 
for the Billy Graham
    Crusade that weekend: ""I know all the porn stars, but I don't exactly 
keep up with preachers.
     Hell, I thought Billy Graham was some singer or something. It never 
entered my mind that (it
                was) some preacher (who) was filling up the football stadium.""

A Charlotte, NC man, having purchased a box of very rare and expensive
   cigars, insured them against fire, among other hazards. Within a month,
   having smoked his entire stockpile of cigars and without having made
   even
   his first premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against
   the
   insurance company. In his claim, the man stated that the cigars were
   lost
   ""in a series of small fires"".
   The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason: that
   the
   man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion. The man sued ... and
   won! The ruling judge agreed that the claim was frivolous. He stated,
   nevertheless, that the man held a valid policy from the company in which

   it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that

   it would insure against fire, without further defining what would be
   considered to be an ""unacceptable fire,"" and was obligated to pay the
   claim. Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the
   insurance company accepted the ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the
   rare cigars he had lost in the ""fires"".
   And now the good part...After the man cashed the check, the insurance
   company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson. With his own insurance
   claim and testimony from the previous case being used against him, the
   man was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and
   sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000.00 fine."

You guys should submit an eRequest to get access to all the Gas Reports on 
the Executive Viewer.  Here's a list of the reports you'll want.

Origination Schedule
Natural Gas Prices
Natural Gas Basis Positions
Natural Gas Profit & Loss by Book
Natural Gas Net Fixed Price Positions by Book
Natural Gas Basis by Trader

Also, Brad you need to request access to the O:/Bench directory so that 
you'll be able to save a copy of the NGPL in this directory each night.  

Bilal, you'll need access to the O:/Gas_Trad and O:/Bench directories.

Hey Brian,

I'm having to plug your positions again.  I checked the conversion factors 
and I have the same ones that you have on the IM Positions tab of your excel 
file.  Let me know if you have any ideas as to what the problem might be.

You mean she talks like that ALL the time or just when she talks to babies?  
Let me guess, all the time.  Have you tried talking that way to her?  Let me 
know what happens.  B

Me bored??  I think you must be more bored than me to talk about ear 
cleaning.  There's this new person that sits down the row from me and she 
baby talks...what's up with that!  It's so irritating.  Well now that I've 
gossipped about someone 10ft from me I better send this email before someone 
walks by and reads it.  I think I'll skip the run this week.

separate portfolio named trader under the Lavorato Other region.  

Please let me know when this book is set up.

Thanks,

It sounds pretty good, but I'd rather talk to mom and see if there's 
something specific he wants before we get that.  B/c for all his talk about 
using the computer he usually ends up using his books instead.  

I'll call mom either tonight or in the morning.  I'll let you know what I 
find out.

Hey,

I did think of something Dad might want.  He was really excited when mom gave 
him the Biblical reference book for Father's day, so maybe we could get him 
something like that.  Call mom and ask her what he wants.  

Authur Anderson, huh??  You do know they are slave drivers, right??  Of 
course I'm sure it's no worse than my current job!!  I find it pretty funny 
that you wrote that to my from your work email.   

Well it's about time I got started working today.

Yeah, like this week.  And no I have no ideas...not even bad ones.  And I 
can't seem to find my catalog to order mom something.  I requested a new one 
but I don't know if we'll get it in time.  You need to just go wander around 
a home depot and find Dad some useless gadget.  

Later,

Brian,

Well, we're a lot closer, but we're not exact.  I'm attaching a copy of what 
I pulled when I loaded the new files.  




Thanks for your help,

Brian,

Just a couple of things.  First the risk type on the spreadsheets needs to be 
the same as on the files I sent to you.  Second, I am attaching a copy of the 
positions that I queried out of GRMS after I loaded your text files.  The 
positions aren't even close to the IM Positions file you save out to our 
directory.  I have also included the detail that supports the GRMS position.  
Our goal with the text files is to eliminate the need for plugging your 
positions and to ensure that your correct position is included in the VAR 
calculation.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you resolve 
this variance.  

Thanks,
Robin

Brian,

Everything was fine with the file.  From now on could you please divide it 
into three separate files?  I've attached the files that I loaded for the 
17th, so if you just keep the same name (just update the date everyday) that 
would help me a lot.   As for the master deal id, as long as they are all 
unique what you had was fine.

If you have any more questions just give me a call.



Thanks,

Kathy,

Please review the spreadsheet guidelines I sent.  I am having to recreate 
your text files every night.  Specifically, the master deal id should be a 
unique number (an NA is not acceptable here), the date must be in the d-mm-yy 
format not a julian date format, and there can be NO commas in any numbers.

Thanks,
Robin

I think we should park at Samy's again.  What have you been up to today?  
I've been ""training"" Bilal.  It's really hard to be patient answering 
questions when you are trying to get something done quickly.  He asked me who 
knew the reports besides me.  I told him it was going to be up to him and 
Binh to know all the reports.  I told him I wasn't going to leave my new 
phone number.  

Talk to ya later,

We need to set up a new Intra-Central Physical Book.

There are already Intra-Cnt-Trans Price, Basis, GD, and IDX books set up.  
The region code for the physical book should be CENTRLTRSP.

I just spoke with Gary Stadler and he said the number doesn't really matter

make it a consecutive numbering down the file.

Mac&Cheese huh?  Eating a light lunch?  When I was at Tech I complained about

the food was overpriced and the quality was pathetic.  And he told me they 
were actually losing money.  All I had to say to that was if you can charge 
$6.50 for Beanie Weenies (actual price of an actual dish passed off as an

Kathy,

I spoke with the system administrators today and they gave me several more 
guidelines for the text files.  

1) The Book ID must be an existing book (Please use the same book id every 
day).  Also please Sort the Book Id by risk type (ie IMCan-Erms-xl-GDL, then 
IMCAN-ERMS-XL-PHY, then IMCAN-ERMS-XL-PRC.)

2) The Master Deal Id must be a unique number per line.

3) The reference date must be in the following format D-MMM-YY.

4) MTM Value Amount must be a NUMBER.  If there is no position please use a 
zero.  

5) The GROSS POSITION and DELTA POSITION must be a value.  No commas, no 
dashes, no links, and no #REF errors.  Again if there is no position please 
use a zero.  

The guidelines apply to all text files that must be loaded into GRMS.  If you 
have any question, please give me a call.

Thanks,
Robin"

Kathy,

Here is the FT Can Position including the Exotics file.  Let me know how it 
looks.  I'm having trouble getting the IM position to pull in, so if I don't 
send you a file soon just assume I'll plug the numbers to match the excel

That sounds fine to me.  If I'm reading it correctly, we are actually 
changing the other Gas Daily books to have the same logic as the Gas Daily 
Options book currently has.  If my understanding isn't correct please let me 
know.  But I think everything thing should be okay to implement tomorrow.

Subject: GAS-DAILY-OPT-GDL

Robin,

The current logic for processing Gas Daily books is as the following:

 If it is a Swap deal (swap_cd is 'S' in ERMS), we check two date conditions 
(ref_dt > eff_dt and ref_dt < nextMonthDt);
 If it is a Option deal (opt_cd is 'O' in ERMS), we only check one date 
condition (ref_dt > eff_dt).

That's why you saw prompt month positions for 'GAS-DAILY-OPT-GDL', those are 
all from Option deals.  Other Gas Daily books either don't have prompt month 
positions or the delta position is zero, so you don't see it.

The proposed logic change is even for the Swap deals, we only check one date 
condition (ref_dt > eff_dt).  I don't think there will be any double counting 
for books like GAS-DAILY-OPT-GDL after the change.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,

Wei

Chris,

The Power Book shows a MTD origination variance of $17.5.  This is shown on 
the origination file(Power Tab) and will be picked up on the NGP&L today.  
However it is still not being added into the MTD tab because the book 
administrator added the originator's name to the same cell as the origination 
category.  It is just a concatenate problem, but I don't have access to that 
file.  If you or Michael could fix that I would appreciate it.

Thanks,
Robin

The Gas Spec (Oil NG Hedge) book will show a MTD variance of $819,000 today.  
When the Power p&l was added to this book last week the formulas did not 
divide by 1,000.  Therefore the incorrect p&l was reported.  However, John 
Lavorato was given a corrected report, so this variance will not be included 
in today's daily p&l on the NGP&L.  

If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.

Hey guys,

Here are your positions for tonight.  We are off on FT CAN, but remember I 
included the Exotics text file in that position.  I am also attaching IM 
Canada.  

Please let me know how it looks as soon as possible so we can resolve 
variances before the system is shut down.

I'm working hard as usual.   I saw you call...don't start screaming yet...I 
had an IT guy and several other people at my desk at the time.   I saw Me, 
Myself, and Irene too.  It was pretty good as long as you're in the mood for 
stupid humor, which I was.  However the language and the ""sons"" got on my 
nerves.  Usually language doesn't bother me at all , but that was a little 
excessive.  Especially the marriage proposal!!  

Well I better get busy.  Bye.

We still need to go to lunch sometime.

I just wanted to let you know that the INTRA-TEXAS-GDL booked pulled in a 
July fixed price gas daily position last night.  Maybe you could apply the 
same logic that is used to pull this position to the Gas Daily books that are 
not currently pulling in the fixed price gas daily positions.  The books that 
had fixed price position for 6/26 that did not pull in are listed below.  

BOOK ID  POST ID  JULY FIXED PRICE POSITION(in contracts)

GD-MARKET-GDL 819207   92.9

GD-CENTRAL-GDL 819212   263.3

GD-TEXAS-GDL 819657   (15.5)

If there is any more information that will help you develop the correct logic 
please let me know.

David,

Here is a short list of what it takes to pull positions into the benchmark.  

1)  Once a book is officialized it must be loaded into GRMS BEFORE the 
positions can be pulled into the benchmark.  

2) With everyone officializing books around the same time the GRMS que is 
overloaded and positions are very slow to be loaded into GRMS.  

3)  GRMS processes books in the order that they are officialized.  If one of 
your books is officialized behind either the Nymex, Power, or Canadian books 
your book will not  be loaded into GRMS until these books are finished.  This 
process can take up to 45 minutes to complete.  

4)  I have to manually create text files for deals that they system is not 
designed to handle.  These files must then be loaded into GRMS.

4)  I have to manually override Post-IDs that for one reason or another do 
not come in automatically or that come in incorrectly.  

5)  The benchmark query takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.  The more 
books that are officialized, the longer the query takes.  

6)  When books are unofficialized and reofficialized, this effectively sends 
that book to the back of the GRMS que.  This means that the entire process 
must be started over.

7)  Now that plugging positions is no longer an option, I have to spend time 
researching any variances that arise between the GRMS position and the ERMS 
position.

8)  If the book admin and I cannot solve the problem, then I have to contact 
the GRMS support team.  Since this usually occurs after their regular hours 
it takes a while before they can get back in touch with me.  

9)  I cannot query new data while I'm researching variances or on the phone 
with GRMS support because I need access to  the information that is currently 
in the bench.  

10)  Finally, this is a massive file therefore we frequently get errors and 
have to shut down.  Even if the spreadsheet has been saved and no data is 
lost it still take about 10 minutes just to shut this file down and reopen 
it. 

If you have any more questions let me know.

 Virendra,

Let me know when you are available to discuss the Gas Daily GRMS logic.  It 
is my understanding that GRMS currently will only include those gas daily 
deals that are intramonth deals with an effective date greater than the 
current date.  However, we should also include any deals in out months that 
are fixed price gas daily deals.  

Thanks,
Robin

Hey Guys,

We are still not pulling the Intra-Cand-West-Phy book into the benchmark.  I 
have talked to the systems administrator and he thinks it might be in how the 
book is set up in the system.  I have attached below a copy of the screen 
that shows how we have desigated the various codes for this book.  Please 
look at this and verify that we have it set up properly.  If you have any 
questions feel free to give me a call.

I am also attaching the detail that I pulled out of the GRMS system.  Please 
take a look at it and help me identify what is causing our variances.  For 
instance I am pulling a position of (245) contracts for July Price and you 
show a position of long 241 contracts.  




Thanks,
Robin

Kathy,

As you know we are trying to eliminate all the plugs on the Gas Benchmark.  
Therefore we would like to begin pulling your positions from the GRMS 
system.  I have attached a file that shows the position that I got when I 
queried GRMS for the June 14 position.  I have also included the detail and a 
copy of what you reported.  

As you will see these positions are significantly different.  Please look at 
the detail and let me know if you see the reason for the descrepancy (ie 
books that we have omitted).  Let me know if you need more information.

I've dragged you to two country concerts, so you can pick this one.  Either 
is fine with me.  I promise.  Mom and I did have a good weekend.  We were 
laughing last night b/c we really didn't do anything.  We just sat around and 
talked and watched movies all weekend.  She said to tell you she's sorry she 
ruined your weekend.  I told her you didn't mind that she was here.  

What'd you end up doing last night?

Talk to ya later,

1.  I have learned how to prepare the NGP&L.

2.  I have gained an understanding of the originations process in order to 
properly represent originations on the NGP&L.

3.  I have learned how to prepare the Benchmark.

4.  I have reduced the time spent at night running the Basis reports by 
consolidating the Shankman, Fletch, and Lavorato reports into one file so 
that the information                need only be queried once.  This was 
accomplished by creating multiple Date Bucket designations in a single file.  

5.  I updated the Greg Pos. Report, so that it ties to the Benchmark in total 
and reflects the Lavorato time buckets.

6.  I updated the Gas Detail Tab of the Benchmark to include new books that 
have been added to the Benchmark.  This enabled me to tie the Greg Pos Report 
to the Benchmark.

7.  I created an additional section of the Gas Detail Tab to calculate the 
fixed price positions.  This section is used to report the total fixed price 
position by seasonal buckets on the Lavorato Basis report.  

I have not included any accomplishments from my former group.  If you would 
like to see them also please let me know.

Thanks,
Robin"

Mary Lynne was calling Stacey B. from Carla's desk (I don't know why) but he 
chose not to answer.  She's standing there going ""he's at his desk, pick up"" 
which was aggravating to her.  Oh well.
Eric is putting his storage entries in today.  Shannon has to manually key 
them in the matrix.  She's not happy.  I wouldn't be either.
Tony has put in a million entries and so have I.
It is still a zoo here.  What's up with all this chaos?  It's more than 
usual.  B
PS The candy idea is the best.  A nice sample of chocolates and sugar.

GOING????!!!  How about completely gone!  I've only been here an hour and a 
half and already we've had two major crisises!  Doesn't that sound like fun?  
Have you thought of a gift I could give to my friends in Australia yet?  You 
really need to get on that.  I'm going shopping this weekend.  I have to buy 
a mother's day gift for my mom (I know a little late, but I haven't seen her 
yet) and a birthday gift for my younger brother (can't call him little 
anymore, he's as big as me) and I think I'm going to go ahead and get a 
father's day gift for my dad.  

Well, have fun.  Talk to ya later.

I hate to complain but the lunch was greasy and the garlic in the fettuccini 
was crunchy and there was a ton of it.  Can you smell the garlic from there?  
At least the cheese cake was good.

What were you doing here Sunday???  There's no reason to have to be here on 
Sunday in that group. And I definitely agree that food is not payment for 
overtime! We played our softball tournament yesterday.  I'm so sore today I 
can barely walk...and it hurts to take a deep breath!  I'm really out of 
shape.  And yesterday they had me batting in front of a guy that would hit 
these great hits and runs really, REALLY fast.  So I ran most of the day it 
felt like.  

Let me know how the MRI comes out.  I do want you to keep me informed with 
how she's doing, but I'm not going to be one of those people that's always 
asking and driving you crazy.  

Don't work too hard.  And tell what's her name now (wedding girl) I said hi.

These are revised schedules for Jan, Mar, &  Apr 2000 and the estimate 
(scheduled) volumes for May.
The prices were revised to capture Texas General storage revenue (fuel 
retention) in Jan, Mar, & Apr.  The fuel volumes are shown as a zero buy 
price for the storage book.
The April also has volume true-ups due to actual metered volumes. (Schedule 
6).  Another adjustment was made in April to true up the cumulative facility 
balance, (4,295 mmbtu).

Thanks,
Kenny

Ivonne,

Thanks for the information.  Will I receive the $3,500 automatically on my 
paycheck, or do I need to submit an expense report to be reimbursed for any 
expenses I incur?  If I do need to submit an expense report, who should I 
turn it in to?

Thanks,
Robin

Kathy,

I discussed the $35K variance with Brian yesterday, and the adjustment will 
be made on the last day of March.  That will ensure that we tie to your 
number for the rest of the month.  Then we'll do a top level adjustment on 
the last day P&L to clear the variance from last month.  I've talked with 
Brad Jones (the person preparing the NGP&L) and Brian Gillis is supposed to 
remind him at the end of the month.

I start my new job in Chicago next week.  Bilal Bajwa will assume my 
responsibilities.  Here are everyone's numbers.


Bilal Bajwa x713-853-3409

P&L-  Bradley Jones  x713-345-8960

Positions- Binh Pham x713-853-5791

Thanks,

My day sucks so far...how about yours?  I caught a million dollar mistake 
this morning and was feeling pretty proud of myself.  That is until John 
called and said there's something wrong with the P&L.  It was only an $87 
million mistake.  I don't know what the big deal was.  Anyway, things are 
calming down a little now.  I'm just still irritated.  That mistake was 
something I should have caught.  Oh well I'm leaving soon.  

That's enough whining.  So what are you up to today?  I'm looking forward to 
actually being able to go home at a decent time today and having nothing that 
has to be done tonight.  I'm just going to kick back and watch TV.  I might 
call Ragini and Sabina and see if they want to come over for king cake.  
You'll be invited too of course.  

I'm starving.  Do you have any calzones this morning?

I think we've finally gotten an answer out of the analyst program.  I'm just

March 12th start date.  Let me know if that date's okay for you.

You may have told Laura, but I haven't spoken to her much in the last couple

Kathy,

I am attaching a revised P&L by Trader.  I moved the Term_GD p&l from Lambie 
to McKay.  We are, however, still off $35,000 on McKay.  It looks like the 
file got updated after we pulled in the final Feb. p&l.  Since we've already 
reported Feb, I can't restate something that would change the total p&l.  An 
adjustment will just need to be made in March to correct the Feb. variance.

Now that that lady is irritating you maybe you'll finally miss me.  Well, I 
might finally be getting somewhere on my move.   I now have an informal offer 
that is acceptable.  I just need it in writing now.  But it looks like I'll 
be in Chicago by March 12th.  Yikes...I have a lot to do before then.  We 
need to all go to lunch before I leave.  

Good luck ignoring your neighbor.  RR

Subject: To Do

Need something to do?  The lady that sits in your old spot is helping her 
brother with his divorce.  In fact he may not have to anything but show up in 
court!  The details I don't care to hear, but I can't help it.  I can hear 
everything and every day there is some new personal matter that needs to be 
taken care of.  Maybe if she stuck to just her own business she wouldn't be 
on the phone so much and I wouldn't have to hear all the junk.  Gag.  B.

Susan,

The NG-PRICE-PRC book will now be calculated using two post ids.  Therefore, 
we need an additional RisktRAC book id for the Price book so that we can 
capture both post ids.  Please set up an NG-PRICE2-PRC book with the same 
attributes as the NG-PRICE-PRC book.  The new books needs to be added to the 
AGG-GAS, AGG-GASIII and AGG-GASIV portfolios.  In AGGIII and IV, please set 
up a separate portfolio for the new book.  The new portfolio should be named 
M_Maggi.  

If you have any questions, give me a call.
Thanks,
Robin"

Here are the answers to your questions.
With regards to the air permit to construct application, Jinsung will send it 
to you by email today, if he hasn't already;
The Petition for Alternate testing, has been sent to you;
3.     This is a one time report to the State's emergency planning committee, 
the local emergency response department, and the local fire department 
declaring the presence of sulfuric acid and lead in quantities greater than 
500 lb and 10,000 lb, respectively.  These notifications are being mailed out 
today. 
4.     We are in the process of tracking down the analytical data associated 
with the Lake Acquisition property and will hopefully have that to you later 
today.

I hope this helps and please give us a call if you have any more questions.  
Thanks!

With regards to the Demin water system, there are no capitalized charges in 
these cost figures - everything is expensed.  With respects to the 
Electricity, there is a Demand Charge included in this numer, which makes up 
approximately 50% of the cost.  The rest is attributable to energy costs.  
These costs are levelized for the full 12 months of the year.  Please let me 
know if you have any other comments.  Thanks!

Don:

To confirm that we have scheduled a nominal two hour call on Monday (10/30)
at 1:30 CST to warp up the Peaker operational due diligence.  Duke has
arranged for a call in number  800/473-8492.  The conference host is Joe
Synnott.

Our focus on this call will be to review the status of our outstanding
requests and open questions.  An example of the former category are the
inspection reports at Gleason and the gas questions.  In the latter
category we still have some confusion about the units actual vs. guaranteed
performance data, status of the warranty items, historic transmission
performance, and relationship between the facility operations team and the
asset management function in Houston.    In addition our insurance staff
will be participating and will have some questions about the casualty loss
histories at the facilities.

Organizationally: please make available people on your team knowledgeable
in the operation and asset management of the facilities.  I would suggest
Ross, the plant managers, Mitch, and your environmental team.

Any questions, please don't hesitate to give me a call at 713-627-6579.

Thanks for the response.  We had previously received the response regarding
the SPCC plan issue but I had not seen the responses for the Lincoln
facility (although I had received Gleason last week).  Just to confirm what
is outstanding:  The questions relating to all facilities sent on 10/23,
the questions relating to Wheatland sent on 10/23, the questions relating
to LV Cogen I and II sent on 10/23, and the questions relating to the LV
Cogen I and II schedules sent on 10/25.  Please let me know if this is not
consistent with your understanding of what is outstanding.  Thanks.

P.S.  You had also indicated in your 10/25 email that the letter from TDEC
regarding the Subpart GG variance would be faxed to me.  To date, I have
not yet received it.  Thanks.

_______________________________________________________________

The following questions were raised by our review of the draft
environmental schedules on Dealbench.

LV Cogen I and II

1.  Schedule 4.1(i) references an annual audit of the CEM system in May
2000.  Is this audit on Dealbench and/or can we get a copy of it?

2.  Please provide a copy and/or reference to a Dealbench document for the
Phase I referenced on Schedule 4.1(n).

3.  Please provide copies and/or references to Dealbench documents for the
items listed as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 on Schedule 4.1(u).  [Note that we have
reviewed the 1995 storm water permit, but did not see an indication that it
is automatically renewed.  Is this reflected elsewhere?]

Wheatland, Gleason and Lincoln

1.  We noticed that Schedule 4.1(u) for each facility indicates that an
SPCC is needed but not currently in place.  What is stored that triggers
the SPCC requirement?  How long have these materials been stored at the
facilities?

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions or if you would like
to discuss these issues in further detail.  Thanks.

Sorry for the delay with the e-mail, I just got back into the office from 
traveling.  We are working hard to sell these assets before year-end - 
they're a beast.  This Friday does not look good for lunch, but I think 
Tuesday or Wednesday of next week works.  I hope this works for you as well.  
Talk to you soon.

Was that your harse realities of life speech.  I thought you were aa optimist 
just like myself.  I belive I actually should get a lot of credit and not 
just contribution for this deal.  It's not often an Associate helps crate 
$200 MM of value.  Have you checked out how much snow B.C. has gotten 
recently and how much there about to get - its incredible.  This is going to 
be a great ski season.

Just wanted to say congratulations on the close.  I hope you had a good trip 
back to Cincy.  Again, I think that both companies are getting a very good 
deal, with you guys getting excellent assets at a very good price.  Hope to 
talk to you soon and I look forward to seeing the press release.

Hey Dan:
It was good to see you the other day.  It's funny because I had tried to send 
you an e-mail, after talking to Andrew about the paper.  It's great eveything 
is going well.  I'm running the NYC Marathon in two weeks so my weekends are 
mostly about running, but after that I would like to get together for some 
golf.  Talk to you soon.

Thanks for sending this e-mail so quickly.  I would like to suggest a couple 
of changes to your resume just to ""tighten"" it up a little bit.  These are 
just minor changes that will make it look more consistent.  I also talked to 
a women who sits two seats down from me, who is a recruiter for another 
group.  She wanted to take a look at your resume once it was ready.  Let's 
try and talk about this later today or this weekend, so you can make these 
changes. Once we get things going internally, I know we can get you over here 
at Enron pretty quickly.  If I don't hear from you later today, please try me 
at home which is (713) 355-8738.  Talk to you soon.

Subject: Questions regarding PSD permit for Lincoln


Don,

As a result of our review of the information and documents on Lincoln we
are requesting additional documents which are not in the data room.

1.   Relating to the plant's PSD:

     The Mostardi & Platt emissions test protocol for the May 2000
     emissions test
      A report to Illlinois EPA containing the emission test data
     Continuous Emission Monitoring ("" CEM"") Data ( all data
     developed since start-up)
     Any reports to IEPA required under the permit pertaining to
     exceedances, or
     start-up, breakdown & malfunction ( we have internal memos indicating
     that there
     was a breakdown at # 7 on July 5,2000)

2. Also, we don't have any permits for wastewater discharge. We have been
told that there is no wastewater discharged except
sewage/office wastewater which is going to a septic field. But we have no
verification of this at this point.

Thank you for your attention to these items.

Thanks for the quick reply.  I live within inside the loop on Buffalo 
Speedway near 59.  I think lunch next week sometime would be great.  I can 
come up to the Woodlands and we can meet up for lunch.  Let me check to see 
what day is best and I will send you an e-mail later today to confirm.  Hope 
that works and I'll talk to you soon.

Charlie:
 It was a pleasure meeting you yesterday afternoon at the Columbia Business 
School information session.  As you probably noticed through my enthusiasm, I 
really enjoy working in the energy-finance industry, especially with Enron.  
Working in this sector, at this time, has created many new opportunities.  I 
am interested in talking with you to see if we can do some type of 
transaction with you guys.  It sounds like you have a lot going in areas that 
we might be interested in.  If you could send me a business proposal or 
summary of what your doing, that would be helpful.  
 With regards to Columbia Business School, I applied last year and did not 
get in due to my GMAT score.  I decided to take a graduate level finance 
class this summer, which I received an A.  I am currently taking another 
graduate finance class this semester.  I am also retaking the GMAT, with the 
hopes of increasing my quantitative score.  
 Last year, I was asked back for an interview, which I felt was a good sign.  
I heard from one of my recommenders that the only thing that I needed to 
improve on was my GMAT score.  Recently, I wrote a brief letter to the Dean 
of Admissions, Linda Meehan, informing her of my recent actions as well as my 
continued interest with Columbia.  I hope that these actions will help me get 
into Columbia this year.  My desire to go to Columbia, stems from their 
network, location, reputation and curriculum.  Since growing up in Pelham,  
it would be nice to get back to New York for a little while.
 As you can see, my desire to go to Columbia is very strong.  I hope this 
brief e-mail has provided some insight into what I'm doing to get into 
Columbia.  I hope we can meet for lunch sometime soon either up in the 
Woodlands or downtown.  Again, thank you for your interest and I look forward 
to talking with you about Columbia and future energy transactions.
Regards,

Ben Rogers"

Gentlemen,

Attached is a list of due diligence questions for the Enron generation
assets (Wheatland, Lincoln, Gleason and LV Cogen).  We would very much
appreciate your help is getting answers for by Friday, 10/20 if possible.

Unfortunately, we are still having significant difficulty in accessing
documents on DealBench.  The download time is usually several minutes to a
half hour per document and often the larger documents will not fully print
out on our systems.  Two of our consultants have experienced similar
difficulties which suggests that whatever problems we are facing are not
unique to systems at PECO.

We are concerned that the limited information will impact our ability to
bid on the assets.  Would it be possible to receive from you either a print
out of the documents or the documents on CD ROM?

Mike Cazaubon

I wanted to reply, even though I have called recently.  Work has slowed down 
a little bit, but will probably pick up in a week or two.  I have traded 
calls with Kara the past two days, so I haven't talked to her in some time.  
Anyway, I hope your figuring out where we should go for a trip this sping.  
We will have to know whether Megan and I need to work on our golf games or 
not.  We have been thinking maybe you guys are thinking about going to 
Ireland or England to play some of the old courses of this world.  Or maybe 
you have been thinking about going to Paris to visit the city of love.   
Anyway, these are just some of the thinks we have been thinking about.  Talk 
to you soon.
Love

Thanks for the reply.  I can understand your position.  I am looking more for 
a refresher course.  I am planning on taking it around mid December or as 
late as mid January.  I am beginning to start studying again on my own, but I 
wanted to get a little more help.  Thanks for your call!

Jinsung and Don,

We are continuing to have difficulties accessing data from DealBench.  The
response times from PECO, PricewaterhouseCoopers and other high speed
internet connections have been very slow (sometimes 5 minutes or more to
retrieve a single 10-15 page text document).  It would help us greatly in
our due diligence efforts if this material could be made available on CD
ROM as has often been done with other deals we have been involved with.
Please advise if this is possible and if so, when the CD's would be
available.

Mike Cazaubon

The following is an update on Enron's sales process, including several
additions to DealBench.

1.  The Purchase and Sale Agreement (""PSA"") for each asset has now been
posted to DealBench under the New Document section.  Please review the
instructions attached to each PSA.

2. The Management Presentations (with audio) have now been posted to
DealBench under the Management Presentation(strikethrough: s) section.
When attempting to view the presentation, please log onto DealBench using
Microsoft Internet Explorer. Once in DealBench, you will most likely need
to download ""Flash Player"" (free download).  You can do this by clicking
""Macromedia Flash Player download center"" in the Linked Documents section
of DealBench.  The download usually takes less than 30 seconds.  After the
download, return to the Management Presentation section of DealBench and
click on the Management Presentation (with audio).   A power point
presentation has also been included in the Management Presentation section
of DealBench.   A detailed instruction guide ""Instruction for Viewing
Management Presentation"" has been posted in New Document section of
DealBench.

3.  Please be sure to consistently review the New Documents section on
DealBench for any new documents that have been added to DealBench.  Also, a
running black line Due Diligence Index is posted in the Due Diligence Index
/ Plant Pictures section of DealBench.

4. Any drawings or CDs that you need from the Due Diligence Indices may be
requested by sending an email to don.miller@enron.com or jhoff2@enron.com.

5.  Any problems or issues that you may be encountering need to  be
directed to Jinsung Myung at 713-853-7330.

6.  We are prepared to schedule Q&A sessions.  Please contact Don Miller at
713-853-0492.

Regards,

Don Miller

Amy:
I called a while back to get into the Enron class which you helped me get 
into and I just recently left you a message to take private sessions from the 
Princeton Review.  I have realized that I need  one on one  sessions to help 
me really prepare for the GMAT.  If you can point me in the right direction, 
I would greatly appreciate it.  I was looking to start sessions as soon as 
possible. Again, thanks for your help with this issue.

Good Morning!
Wanted to see how this quarters earnings report was going to look like.  Many 
of analyst are reporting that its going to be around $.57 for the qtr.  Hope 
you guys beat that estimate.  By the way, how did that deal go that you were 
working on with the company down here?  I saw that Convergent was bought by 
an independent oil and gas company from Houston.  It's up big today.  Hope 
all is going well and that you might give me a call before the end of the 
year.  Thanks!

I wanted to send out an e-mail to everyone who is involved with the site 
visits.  We started the site visits this past Friday with a company going to 
Wheatland.  The site visits will begin tomorrow and run through the the 27th 
of Ocotber.  Here is the schedule for this weeks site visits:

Dave Kristich will be covering Gleason from tonight/tomorrow morning till 
Friday afternoon (17th-20th)

Ross and Fred will be covering Lincoln from Tuesday night to Friday afternoon 
( 18th-20th)

Chris and Jeff will be covering Wheatland from tonight through Friday 
afternnon (17th-20th)

If you have any conflicts with this schedule for this week, please let me 
know as soon as possible so I can arrange someone else to cover for you.  

Next week, the Gleason and Wheatland plants will have a company visiting the 
sites everyday and for Lincoln, Wednesday and Thursday are currently booked, 
so please plan accordingly to be at the site during that time period.  
Currently, these dates are NOT subject to change, but we are still waiting to 
hear from two more companies.  I will let you know ASAP when they call and 
confirm their times to visit the sites. 
Please give me a call if you have any questions or need anymore information.  
Again, thank you for all your help with the site visits.

Regards,
Ben"

Hey Mike:
Marlon and Marissa's wedding was alot of fun.  Megan and I sat at the married 
table, which had Pete and Amy Fullem, Kit and her husband, Marc, Sammy and 
her husband, Jon and Dana Corpina, Dana Schuster and her husband - so as you 
can see it was pretty interesting.  The other table was Mike, OB, Choby, 
Tina, and Patty Donahue.  Mike, OB, Choby, Patty, Megan and I took a limo 
from the city to the wedding and had the limo tell 12:00, then went out till 
5:00am.  I love going to that evil city, but I love leaving it even better.  
Overall, it was fun and seems like everyone is doing well.  Dana and Jon just 
had their baby, its a girl.  I also ended up seeing Alan Waugh and Tim 
Hurley.  Hurley has gained about 200 pounds - the man is huge.  Anyway, I 
hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.

 Just wanted to give everyone a update on where we were with all the site 
visits to the plants.  As you already know, site visits begin this Thursday 
and runs through the 27th of October, so its a pretty tight schedule.  In 
terms of who will be specifically covering which plants, this is the 
following: Gleason will be Dave Kristich; Lincoln will be Fred Mitro; and 
Wheatland will be Ross Newlin.  These guys will cover the site visits the 
next two weeks, but everyone else may be asked to fill in for them if needed.
  While on the site visit, please make sure that the companies do not take 
any pictures and they are only allowed to talk to you or the plant manager.  
Most of the companies will probably be there for only a couple of hours per 
day.
 I hope all of this is clear and if you have any questions about scheduling 
please give me a call.  Again, thank you for your help with these issues.
Regards,

Ben"

Duke is presenting their final bid this Sunday, so I think its even more 
important to get the PSA signed by tomorrow, so that there is no chance to 
try and retrade the deal.  I don't know how things ended up yesterday, but I 
think things need to come together very fast.

The industry is getting beat up a little bit, but I hope this isn't slowing 
you guys down at all.  I talked with Mike M the yesterday, he said that his 
meetings with you guys seem to go well.  I think that doing that deal would 
be quite beneficial to both companies over all strategies, regarding power, 
gas and cash flow.  Megan and I will be in NYC this weekend for a wedding.  I 
would like to talk to you pretty soon anout a couple of things.  I have 
decided to stay at Enron at least till this project is over, which will be 
early next year.  The more experience I have with another company, like Enron 
the better.  I am also going to reapply to just The Texas Business School.  
Things are going well with my communication with them this year.  I have 
already talked to one of their professors that I talked to last year and have 
gotten an e-mail from the director of the admissions program.  The both feel 
I have and are currently doing the right things to get into the school next 
year.  So things are going well so far.  I am contining with my other class 
and going to take the GMAT one more time.  
I have said a little more than I would have liked but I just wanted to give 
you the laod down of what I have been thinking.

Ben"

 Thanks for your quick reply.  With regards to the classes, I looked into U 
of H for summer classes and they did not provide graduate level summer 
classes.  The only school that provided graduate level summer classes was the 
University of St. Thomas.  It would have been nice to take these classes at U 
of H, because our Chairman and CEO and my recommender to The Texas Business 
School, Ken Lay, received his PhD from there.  
 Thanks again for your response and advice and hope all is going well.

Regards,
Ben "

Dr. Harris:
 I hope you had an enjoyable summer and it did not go too quickly, as I felt 
mine did.  I wanted to let you know that I am still very much interested in 
attending the Business School.  
 I took your advice this summer and took a graduate level finance class 
(Financial Management), which I received an A.  I was very pleased with 
myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time.  I 
have also decided to take another graduate level finance class 
(Macroeconomics), which I am currently taking.  
 I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into GMAC to try 
and receive a ""special testing status"" for the GMAT.   I am currently waiting 
to hear back from them with their decision.  When I hear back from GMAC, I am 
planning on re-taking the GMAT to try and increase my score.
 As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the Business 
School for next year and I'm in the process of doing whatever I can to 
increase my application profile. 
 Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do to 
enhance my application profile.   Again, I hope all is going well and I look 
forward to hearing from you soon. 

Regards,

Ben Rogers

Yes you have passed the test - Congratualations.  We have been working very 
hard on our sale and wanted to let you know that your guys came back with a 
very good bid.  We will inform you probably this afternoon or tomorrow that 
you will be making the short list.   We will probably have a short list of 
about 5-7 companies.   You guys are in the top three! I think you guys have a 
very good chance at getting these plants, which I think is an excellent 
opportunity.  Hope all is going well and your other talks are going in the 
right direction.  On a side note, from what I've heard from my parents in 
Boston, Kara seems to be doing pretty poorly.  She is clearly going through 
some very difficult times.  Talk to you soon.

This is a test to see if you are checking your e-mail these days.  I have a 
feeling that you have not been, due to your board presentation last week.  
Mike M. tells me he will be up there today - hope that goes well for you 
guys.  I really think there could be something there.  Please give me a call 
sometime soon.  Things are going well here and we have been quite busy.  Give 
me a call sometime.  The number is (713) 853-7998. See ya!

Professor Titman:
 I hope you had an enjoyable summer and it didn't go too quickly.   I hope 
you remember who I am from last years application process.  I enjoyed meeting 
you last year and talking with  you regarding the curriculum and admissions 
process.  I wanted to let you know that I am still very much interested in 
attending the Business School.  
 I took your advice this summer and took a graduate level finance class 
(Financial Management), which I received an A.  I was very pleased with 
myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time.  I 
have decided to take another graduate level finance class (Macroeconomics), 
which I am currently taking and runs through December.  
 I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into GMAC to try 
and receive a ""special testing status"" for the GMAT.   I am currently waiting 
to hear back from them with their decision.
 As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the Business 
School for next year and I'm in the process of doing whatever I can to 
increase my application profile.  I am also sending an e-mail to Carl Harris, 
who heads up the admissions process  to inform him of these recent 
developments. 
 Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do to 
enhance my application profile.   Again, I hope all is going well and I look 
forward to hearing from you soon 

Regards,

Ben Rogers

Good to hear from you.  Yes, it was a wonderful weekend to work all weekend.  
Were very busy at work and will continue to be so through the rest of the 
year.  It is very upsetting to hear about Kara.  Seems like she has a long 
way to go to recovery, but I'm optimistic that she can get to where she needs 
to be.  I talked to her Sunday morning.  She seemed upbeat.  I hope the place 
she is staying at is giving her a glance at how bad it could be so that its 
kind of a wake up call.  Let me know how Megan and I can help.  Megan is 
going to get this really good book on Manic Depression.  Hope we can talk 
about this soon.
Love,
 Your Son  "

Sorry to hear that.  I called Patty again to ask her brother if he knew 
anybody running the marathon.  I also called Megan's sister, Deirdre to see 
if she knows of anyone not going to run, but signed up.  I hope this helps.  
It would great for you to be in it, running it.

Just wanted to remind you about the call I received from Paul Cavicchi with 
Tractebel.  He was calling to ask about an extention to the bidding on the 
assets.  I basically said that there are no extentions except for bids that 
are strong bids that come in on Monday or Tuesday of next week.  He sounded a 
little disappointed that they got the book so late, but still seemed 
interested in the assets.  Hope this helps.

Don Miller and I would like to set some time up with you, today if possible, 
to talk about state and local tax issues for the 2000 peakers.  I will talk 
with Don about a good time to meet and let you know.  But let me know what is

Just wanted to let you know that I just talked to Don Miller, the lead guy 
from our side, regarding a different matter, but he mentioned to me that 
things seemed to be not going so well in the PSA discussions.  I didn't have 
time to see what the issues were, but I will when he calls back.  As you 
already know, these assets are yours to lose and I would hate to see you guys 
lose these assets to legal issues.  I know we both can come to some middle 
ground before people lose their patience.  My only advice, for what its 
worth, is to keep talking with Delainey and to make sure the lawyers don't 
run away with the issues and forget whats at stake on the commercial side.  
Hope this helps.

It wasn't like I was neglecting you.  You must understand that e-mail is 
faster than sending a letter and its slower than calling someone, but there 
is not always an immediate return.  Some people are lazy with returning 
e-mail.  It has been really busy here.  We are working long hours and this 
project is trying to close by the end of the year.  It's a $1 Billion 
project, so it takes alot of work.  Talk to you soon.

I know how e-mail is suppose to work, but its been so crazy here that I 
haven't even been able to do that.  We were here last night till 10:00 and it 
looks to be the same tonight and potentially for the rest of the year.  This 
project is going to kill me.  I glad to see that you are active on the net.   
I'll keep in touch a little better. Love

Subject: Additional PG&E Question and an Aquila Question - all on Pastoria


I spoke to Aquila again today.  They are planning to submit bids on Friday
for Gleason, Wheatland and Pastoria.  They already have a tolling agreement
in the Lincoln area and don't want more capacity there.

Aquila's question:

They questioned the development costs for Pastoria - look very high.  I
noted that it includes the ERC's.  They would like a breakout of the
development costs


PG&E's question is below.  Are you comfortable disclosing this at this stage
or is this a phase II due diligence item?

Since we do not have to accept the NEPCO contract, can you break out the
cost and scope of equipment (Enron uses the term ""power islands"")?  Can we
get this information tomorrow?  Both cost and scope of this is important to
be able to assess the ""EPC"" price and determine bid price.

I talked with Theresa Voss about the insurance on the peakers and she said 
that they have been making payments on the peakers and that this ""billing 
separately plan"" on the peakers will last until March of 2001.  At that 
point, an umbrella plan will cover the turbines.  Regarding the balance 
sheet, they have been accounting for it under prepaid insurance and have been 
amortizing it each month as its been paid.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

1) do the capital cost of linears (gas, transmission and system upgrades)
include tax gross ups relating thereto?

2) Is the cost of backup power (for startup and station service) included in
the variable O&M estimate, or is it included in one of the fixed charges.
Please tell us where it is and how much it is expected to be annually?

David Parquet asked me to forward these answers to you:
Question:
Is the major maintenance reserve estimate based on a negotiated Long Term
Services Agreement (LTSA)?  If so, will it be in place and transfer with
PEF?
Answer:  We have not negotiated an LTSA with anyone at this time, and we do 
not expect to have one in place to transfer with PEF.  The maintenance 
reserve is our estimate based on industry data and information from GE.

Question: Are spare parts for the first major overhaul included anywhere in 
the
capital cost estimate or are they assumed to be purchased through the
maintenance reserve estimate (i.e. the LTSA) charge?

Answer:  The maintenance reserve is intended to include parts and labor for 
the overhaul.

Miller/HOU/ECT@ECT 
Subject: PG&E Questions


My responses to one set of PG&E questions would be as follows.  Dean is 
answering the other one and will send back to you directly.

* What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is
concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to
either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.

RESPONSE: Enron is very flexible re continuing involvement:  scheduling 
coordination, fuel supply, power marketing, etc.  We are also flexible re the 
time period and the terms of the continuing involvement.  Whatever 
arrangement is developed would be mutually beneficial.



* What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to engage
NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control over the
turbines?

RESPONSE: o EPC negotiations are complete with NEPCO.  Contract has not been 
executed, but has been ""put on the shelf"" awaiting decision on successful 
bidder for the purchase of the Pastoria project from ENA.  Successful bidder 
and NEPCO will each have the option of executing the EPC agreement.

  o Successful bidder is under no obligation to engage NEPCO.

  o West LB has control of the turbines.  They can be assigned either to the 
LLC or to ENA.  (If assigned to ENA, it was because the successful bidder for 
the Pastoria project did not want the turbines with the acquisition.)  If 
assigned to the LLC as part of the acquisition, the LLC can then assign the 
turbines to the ultimate EPC contractor.   



* They also questioned whether there would be any ""agricultural
restrictions""?

RESPONSE: The project site is presently under a Williamson Act contract to 
maintain agricultural use in exchange for lower taxes.  Last week, the Kern 
County Board of Supervisors voted to cancel the Williamson Act contract to 
allow for industrial use, which started a 180 day public comment period.  
However, the Governor has on his desk a bill for signature that would reduce 
the public comment period for the cancellation to the same time frame as the 
request for rehearing period for the CEC Final Decision.  (The Governor has 
until 9/30 sign the bill and is expected to do so because of the overwhelming 
support of the bill in the Assembly and the Senate.)  The cancellation will 
be contingent upon a successful CEC decision and a payment of a Williamson 
Act cancellation fee.

Subject: Additional Questions


I received a call from Tom Favinger at PG&E today.  He is looking for the
responses to his questions from last week and also has a new question.  He
would like to get a breakout of the $10.25 million item in the Pastoria
capital budget labeled Pre-Commercial Operations Costs.

I also spoke to Darryn O Llegas from PECO today.  They are planning to bid
on the peakers and LV Cogen on Friday.  His questions are:

Peakers

* Will Enron's control area dispatching/scheduling software be
included in the property conveyed with the peakers?
* Do the Peaker's permits make any allowance for combined cycle
operation or would they need to re-start the permitting process?
* They would like clarification concerning the joint ownership of gas
interconnects - what is owned, cost to maintain, etc.

LV Cogen

* Update on status of Phase II permitting?
* Update on status of development process?
* Are there any tax abatements of any type for the Phase II project?

Additional Comments from PECO:

* Don't have price curves yet for all of the peakers markets - will
need to develop prior to final bid.
* May have a concern re: market power for the peakers as a result of
the PECO/Unicom merger.  They will be comfortable enough to bid this week
and don't expect it to be a concern for the final bid.
* They will probably submit a bid with separate values for: Wheatland;
other peakers together; LV Cogen.
* They are working their bid from two perspectives: replacement cost
plus a premium and discounted cash flow.  DCF will obviously change as they
get their price curves updated.

Jon: 
Here is the first of six e-mails regarding the inventories of the peakers.  
Regarding, the output and heat rates on the turbines, we copied for you the 
performance tests, which should have summary information on the output and 
heat rates at the end of each of the performance tests.  Please let me know 
if you do not find them.  Thanks!

Subject: Additional Questions


I received a call from Tom Favinger at PG&E today.  He is looking for the
responses to his questions from last week and also has a new question.  He
would like to get a breakout of the $10.25 million item in the Pastoria
capital budget labeled Pre-Commercial Operations Costs.

I also spoke to Darryn O Llegas from PECO today.  They are planning to bid
on the peakers and LV Cogen on Friday.  His questions are:

Peakers

* Will Enron's control area dispatching/scheduling software be
included in the property conveyed with the peakers?
* Do the Peaker's permits make any allowance for combined cycle
operation or would they need to re-start the permitting process?
* They would like clarification concerning the joint ownership of gas
interconnects - what is owned, cost to maintain, etc.

LV Cogen

* Update on status of Phase II permitting?
* Update on status of development process?
* Are there any tax abatements of any type for the Phase II project?

Additional Comments from PECO:

* Don't have price curves yet for all of the peakers markets - will
need to develop prior to final bid.
* May have a concern re: market power for the peakers as a result of
the PECO/Unicom merger.  They will be comfortable enough to bid this week
and don't expect it to be a concern for the final bid.
* They will probably submit a bid with separate values for: Wheatland;
other peakers together; LV Cogen.
* They are working their bid from two perspectives: replacement cost
plus a premium and discounted cash flow.  DCF will obviously change as they
get their price curves updated.

Quick comments.  Mike, what are your thoughts on my answer in O5?

I'll provide start numbers for O5 later today.

E2.  No; however, CFR60 subpart GG short term limits still apply 
(approximately 90 ppm NOx) which are well above the turbine emissions.

T1.  ""on any asset"" should read ""of any asset""

O5. Since commercial operations, the Wheatland facility has averaged xx 
starts per machine, and the Lincoln facility has averaged yy starts per 
machine.  The start-up and commissioning process followed a normal startup 
progression.  The Lincoln facility experienced a generator failure in unit #7 
during the first run season.  General Electric replaced the generator under 
warranty provisions.  Sratification of gas flows was observed in the stacks 
at the Wheatland facility during CEMS certification.  The CEMS certification 
was then postponed until Summer '01.

O6.  Wasn't it a strip mine?  I didn't think it was a coal mine.

Mitch

Subject: PG&E Questions


PG&E Gen is most interested in Pastoria and had several questions/concerns
that they asked about during my discussion with them:

* What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is
concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to
either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.
* What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to engage
NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control over the
turbines?
* They also questioned whether there would be any ""agricultural
restrictions""?

Is the major maintenance reserve estimate based on a negotiated Long Term
Services Agreement (LTSA)?  If so, will it be in place and transfer with
PEF?

Are spare parts for the first major overhaul included anywhere in the
capital cost estimate or are they assumed to be purchased through the
maintenance reserve estimate (i.e. the LTSA) charge?

Don:
I put in a call to Kinder/Morgan this morning.  I have not heard back from 
Anthony Lannie, who will be heading up this process for them.  Again, I think 
they will be interested, but probably through a joint bid with Southern.    I 
will continue to follow up with these guys to measure there interest.

How are ya?  How is the DC area these days?  Houston is still fucking hot and 
Enron is still doing well and the price is still screaming so things are 
good.  In response to your inquiry regarding Homecoming.  Megan and I are 
actually, if you can believe it, going to Marlon and Marissa's wedding the 
first weekend in October in NJ.  Also, OB, Chobu, Mike, Corpina and Danny, 
Patty D, Sammy, Amy, etc. are going as well - should be interesting.  I 
haven't seen some of those people for quite awhile.  I was trying to set 
something up, but that came up as well as I'm running in this year's NYC 
Marathon, which is the first Sunday in Novemebr, so trying to arrange 
something became even harder.  I still want to get together with you guys, 
but trying to figure out when and where.  Suggestions are welcomed.  Hope all 
is going well and talk to you soon.

Hey Mike:
You won't believe whose wedding Megan and I are going to in early Oct. - 
Marlon and Marissa's.  As well as OB, Choby, Mike and like Patty Donahue, 
Sammy, Amy, etc.  It should be pretty interesting to say the least.  I am 
also running in this year's NYC Marathon which falls on the first Sunday in 
November.  So trying to get to the east coast for a third time has been tough 
to arrange.  How was Patty's wedding -it looked like alot of fun.  I still 
want to meet up with you guys somewhere, but I'm just not sure where at this 
point - I still think DC.  Let me know what you think.

How the hell are ya?  Wanted to drop you a line and see how you were doing 
and let you know that Brandon and I continued the tradition and went to the 
DMB concert last night.  Must say that it wasn't the same as being with you 
in a limo, but we still had fun.  Wanted to get your number up there, b/c I 
will be up in Chicago for Thanksgiving and was hoping to meet you in Chicago 
then.  Gotta run, but I hope all is going well and I'll talk to you soon.

There is only one quarterly report required for Brownsville. This is the EPA

Mitchell - Since you are generating the 3rd quarter reports to the EPA today, 
would you please copy Ben on the submittal. Thanks.

James:
I talked with Thomas Favinger and Tom Boren is the CEO of PG&E, which is not 
the best guy to send the books to.  The better person is Thomas Favinger and 
his address is:

Thomas Favinger
PG&E National Energy Group
7500 Old Georgetown Road
Bethesda, Maryland 20814

Phone: (301) 280-6231
Fax: (301) 280-6911

National Energy Group is the sub of PG&E.
So please send out 2 books to Thomas tonight.  Thanks!

We are not going to send back this investor list anymore.  I am going to send 
both you and James an update each night that we send something out, but only 
you guys make changes to the Investor List.  Also make sure that you still 
send the signed CA down to us even if there are not any changes to the CA, we 
need to have our legal team go through it first.  Thanks!

Thanks for the note, except of course for the last comment, why don't you 
just go seat in row 100 - alright.  Megan and I had a great time and enjoyed 
having you guys come out..  I love going out there during the summer.  We are 
going to arrange a ski weekend on President Day Weekend this February - so 
make plans to be laughed at while skiing.  I didn't mean laughed at - I meant 
having a fun time.  Talk to you soon.

Just wanted to keep you all informed of my recent discussions with Kinder 
Morgan regarding potentially selling them 4 LM 6000's.  At first they were 
interested in some of the development sites, but became more interested in 
the equipment.  They are trying to get their hands on as many LM 6000's as 
possible, because of their plant configuration utilizing 6 LM 6000's per 
plant.  With my last dicussion as of yesterday (Tuesday the 5th), I gave them 
the approximate price at which they could buy the turbines for - $15,000,000 
per turbine.  Their comment was it was a little on the high side, but they 
still sounded interested because of the quick time frame of receiving them - 
1st Qtr. '01.  If they are still interested they will get back with me with a 
non-binding term sheet within the next couple of weeks.  Please let me know 
if you have any comments.  Thank you!

Enron news release

FYI

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
-----------------------

Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement
said to be worth an estimated $666 Trillion.  In the deal, Enron will
provide
both gas and electric commodities to Hades' facilities throughout and
under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former CEO of energy monopolist
Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy management division.  Said
Rockefeller, ""Obviously Hell has significant heating demands.  While
eternal flames are a great idea in concept, they require vast and reliable
fuel
resources.  Enron was the only supplier willing to make a deal with my
boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just like the way they do business.""

A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
together during negotiations.  According to the company, ""The deal fits
both companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and
retain new customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for
millennia to come.""  According to several energy industry insiders,
Hades' high heating demand with very little need for summer air conditioning
make it a very attractive energy portfolio addition.

Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained
high growth rates over the last two thousand years.

Enron is one of the world's leading energy and communications
companies. The company owns approximately $37 billion in energy and
communications assets.  Enron ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's ""Best
100
Companies
to Work For if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A
Week,"" and is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked
by customers with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply
contracts.

Doc 01.07.02  - Talks about a 15% assessment for as valorem taxes.
Doc 01.07.02.01 - Property tax estimates - estimates from 2001-2019  (tax +
pilot payments) are $1M a year till 2009 and then to ~$1.4 M for next few
years beg 2010, dropping back down to $700K level.

In 2000, the property tax was just $500K, as there seems to be no pilot
payment until Jan 2001.

My questions are -
   Confirm that the 15% assessment in first doc is included in the estimate
   The schdule of estimated payments is all inclusive of the payments
   relating to property taxes
   Refer me to doc that talks about the pilot agreement or any other tax
   abatement docs

Thanks.

I just wanted to touch base with you and let you know I am still with Enron 
and still enjoying the experience and currently working on selling some of 
our power plants with the Generation Investments Group.  I also wanted to say 
congratulations on the birth of your twins - thats great!  If there is any 
chance to have lunch I would greatly look forward to having lunch with you.  
By the way, I had a really good conversation with Rocky Storie the other 
day.  He was my representative for my performance review and I felt he did a 
great job and I greatly appreciated it.  Hope all is going well and I look 
forward to talking to you soon.

I got your message this morning.  Since we were so successful in selling some 
of our peaking plant last time, we have decided to some some more - so we are 
running like crazy to close these deals this year.  I want to let you know 
that I talked to both people at KinderMorgan and Cinergy about your company 
and the types of transactions that you guys are doing.  I have not had the 
chance to follow up, but plan to real soon.  I just tried to call you about 
10 minutes ago, thus the e-mail response.  I will try again in a little bit.  
Hope all is going well and I'll talk to you soon.

Hey man - good to hear from you.  It must be rough house sitting in River

Next week would be great to get some brews.  My wife and I are moving this

this move!  How's Chase?  I'll talk to you soon.

My shares are just as worthless as the next guys...After announcing 27% 
increase in earnings, but on the same day overshadowed by the REI deal, they 
are certainly needing some deals to do.  My advice...execution, execution, 
execution, of DEALS. that is.

How's your summer?  Are you in Delaware now?  I am going to set up a weekend 
in DC in the Fall and I will probably do it around homecoming weekend.  I 
want to try and set it up for most of the people will huge out with, but will 
take other suggestions.  I will be sending out e-mails to everyone informing 
them of the weekend.  Choby is going to set up a bar to rent out for Saturday 
night.  In the past, you have sent me e-mails with a bunch of different 
e-mail addresses attached to it.  If you could send me a list of the e-mails 
you have for our friends that would be great.  Thanks for the help and lets 
talk about this further.  Talk to you soon.

Professor Ueng:
Hope all is going well and you have either finished or are almost finished 
your Phd.  I was wondering if I could be able to find out my grade for the 
Financial Mgmt. class (MBA-5318 A) I took with you this summer.  Is there a 
website we can go to or something?  Thanks!

More Questions:

Both Plants

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?

Caledonia

3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

Brownsville

4.  What is the agency's response to the Enron letter regarding the 2nd
stormwater NOV?

5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwater
NOV was never responded to?

6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was that
during construction only or is it ongoing?

7.  Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping
issue?

Amy:
Here are my answers  to your questions:
1.  Yes I think its a good idea, because you are able to reach a wide 
audience with this advertisement.  
2.  I don't think the contest should be limited to just these 
schools/conferences.  You probably should open it up to all schools to get an 
even wider reach of potential candidates.
3.  I would think that if you had a certain amount for the cash prize that 
people would take it seriously to try and win the cash.
4.  Please let me know if I can support you in any way.
Thanks

Dr. Ueng:
I wanted to mention this to you yesterday after the test, but didn't have 
time.  I was taking this course because I am applying to another business 
school and since I have been out of school for six years I wanted to provide 
the other schools with a recent academic record.  I was trying to get an A in 
the class, but my first test was not my best work. I feel that I did much 
better on the second test and that Brandon and mines case studies and my 
class participation were good enough to get me close to the A level.  That 
said if I am also able to get a recommendation from you I would greatly 
appreciate it.  I know that you are extremely busy now, so if I could get in 
touch with you at your earliest convenience that would be great.  Thanks for 
making the class educational and quite enjoyable.  Hope to talk to you soon 
and hope you can enjoy the rest of the summer.  

Regards,
Ben Rogers

Randy:
I have a couple of items I am working and wanted to know from you.
1.  How will the annoucement of the 55 MW plant in R.I. and the potential 
stake in the 1,650 MW plant in Texas effect the current asset portfolio?
2.  I am working on a spreadsheet identifying all the current and the coming 
on-line merchant MW's in detail.  Can you provide me a detail list of which 
plant assets are merchant or are going to be merchant.  
Thanks,

Here are the two CA's we are currently working off of.  The first one is 
Enron's latest draft and the second one is Cinergy's latest draft.  Enron 
usually does not get into stand-still agreements, but we decided to in this 
case.  We have been exchanging comments for two weeks and now we need to sit 
down and discuss these points from a commercial stand-point to get over these 
differences.  Please give me a call when you get this so we can go through 
these issues.  Thanks for your time with this issue.

Here is the latest ""CA"" with everyone's changes.  I feel that this is pretty 
close to the best we can offer in terms of the stand-still and 
non-solicitation agreements.  Enron usually does not get into stand-still 
agreements, so doing this one was a big step for Enron.  Look forward to 
talking to you tomorrow morning.  Thanks for your patience.  Again, this is a 
draft copy for discussions purposes only.

I talked with the legal guys at Cinergy and after further discussions with 
Mike Cyrus, they felt that since these discussions were at a high level and 
very early in discussions that a ""CA"" at this time was not needed.  There 
were two sticking points that I was trying to get them to backdown from: 1) a 
stand-still agreement and 2) a solicitation agreement.  They were not willing 
to back down from these, thus they concluded with suggesting no ""CA"".  Let me 
know if this is your thoughts as well.  Thanks!

Hey Jon;
Just e-mailing to see how everyone is doing.  Megan and I are going over to 
Austin to a resort to celebrate our 1st anniversary - I can't believe it.  
I've been trying to work on the golf game, but I'm taking a couple of 
graduate business courses at night so that keeps me pretty busy on the 
weekends as well.  Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.

Mike:
Just a thought regarding Kinder/Morgan.  These guys mainly care about the gas 
pipelines and that some of there projects are actually put on there lines to 
increase throughput.  These plants that they want on their lines are 
currently in construction or development.  Their only operational plants are 
in Colorado.  They have a good generation team, but I fell that they do not 
want to be in the business of operating and maintaining the plants, just as 
long as somebody wants to put them along their lines.  If you guys offered to 
buy their plants and projects, they would mainly care about price (cash and 
stock in the new company) and to put contracts in place for some of their 
projects to put on their lines.  Hope this helps.

Mike:

Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last week.  I left you Rich 
Kinder's number on Thursday with your assistant, Sheilla - hope you got it.  
Again, I think a deal between or three companies is something to really look 
at.  I think it creates a great story to the street.  Kinder/Morgan brings 
the growth story, the gas pipelines for the convergence play and the 
development team, Enron brings the MW's and trading and Cinergy brings MW's, 
trading and operating expertise.  I feel that Enron and Cinergy can work 
togther with regards to the trading.  I am sending you an anayst report I 
just finish reading regarding generation spinoffs - I think it will be 
helpful.   Also, Kay Chapman, Dave's assistant informed me that you were 
coming up next week, and I wanted to know if you wanted me to be there or not 
or if you wanted me to prepare anything for you for the meeting.  

Hope you had a good weekend and I look forward to talking to you soon.
Regards,
Ben

Regarding my conversation with John Garrison on the GE 7FA costs.

Delivery:  '00-'01  Cost:  $36.0 MM
Delivery:  '98-'99  Cost:  $34.250 MM
Delivery:  '96-'97  Cost:  $32.0 MM 
Delivery:  '95-'97  Cost:  $30.0 MM

It looks like that for every year and a half the costs go up approx. $2.0 
MM.  The next available order for GE 7FA's is 3rd qtr. 2003.

Megan will be at the wedding that weekend, but I will not be able to make 
it.  Megan is going to spend most of July up in New York.  How is the 
fundraising business going?  I heard that Clinton's fundraiser tonight will 
bring in $23 million which will be $2 Mil. more than George W., which would

Great PICS.  When do you get back?  I want to see if we can get together up 
in NYC or DC with OB and Mike.  I will be in the Hamptons for July 4th 
weekend.  It's starting to get hot down here in Houston.  Things are going 
well.  I have moveed into a new group (Enron's M&A Group) - were looking at 
some interesting deals.  We are looking at taking a company public which I 
may go work for if I can get enough equity in the deal.  The other thing that 
might happen is finally going to my pops company at a much higher position 
than I am at now, which would be great, but I would be in Ohio, booooooo.  
That way Megan and I could buy a house and potential go and get an executive 
MBA from Kellog, but these are all scenarios and if any of these play out I 
would be amazed.  My golf game is ok, but my training is starting to get 
better.  I did see that none of us made the NYC Marathon on the first go 
around.  Did you see that Jon and Kati had their baby-I didn't even know she 
was pregnant.  Shit were getting old!!!!!!!!!!   Hope all is going well and 
I'll see ya.

how they should look at running the model, based on what Thomas found out and 
what you have said in the past.  I also gave them the numbers that the desk 
has given based on the simple cycle case (5 year number) and combine-cycle 
case (5 year number).  From this they have modeled and graphed these 
different scenarios.  I also worked on getting a bid and ask from the desk, 
but you may need to talk to Berney because they are not giving out the ask at 
this time.  
Hope this helps and please give me a call if you have any questions. Thanks

Here is the FPL presentation.  If your able to change the graph on page 7, 
where it just shows the total on the table and not on the graph, that would 
be great otherwise I will change it in the morning.  Thanks

Just wanted reiterate my comments on Raul and his skills fitting in with what 
you guys are looking for.  I really think he would be a good long term in the 
corp. dev area and/or investor relations.  Let me know if your around for 
lunch this week at Ninfa's.  I'm meeting up with Andrew sometime this week as 
well, maybe we can make it the same day.  Let me know.

Work number is 713-853-7998.  How is the fundraising going?  I went to go see 
former President George Bush at a cocktail party/fundraiser the other night.  
We  heard both the former Pres. and Barbara - it was great to hear both of 
them speak.  Talk to you soon.

Question 1

Case 1 at 20F and 60% RH CTG would have net unit output of 46,726 kW at a 
heat rate of 10,183 Btu/kWhr HHV new & clean
Case 2 at 90F and 54% RH CTG would have net unit output of 43,220 kW at a 
heat rate of 10,804 Btu/kWhr HHV new & clean

Case 1 has gas compression, no chilling/heating, Case 2 has gas compression 
and chilling. Both cases include simple cycle CTG aux and expected steup 
transformer losses. Back pressure is based on 14"" HRSG.

Question 2

For case 2, Sprint water injection is 1915 lb/hr +/1 20%, we are also water 
injecting for NOx control 21,981 lb/hr so total is 23,896 lb/hr. Currently 
cannot Sprint with DLE combustor.

Hey:
Sorry about not getting back sooner - I have been traveling and was away for 
Thanksgiving.  Megan and I went up to Chicago to visit one of her 5 sisters.  
M&M's wedding was fun, saw some people I haven't seen since college - pretty 
scary.  If ""W"" wins this election Megan and I are coming to DC to watch the 
Inaugeration and maybe go to a ball or two, so we should diffinently get 
together.  I will work on that when the time comes.  Besides, this election 
is absolutely crazy - Gore he working himself into complete retirement with 
all this contesting.  How is everything going?  What are you guys doing for 
the holiday?  Megan and I are going out west to do some skiing in Beaver 
Creek - I'm praying for powder.  Again, I hope all is going well and I'll be 
better next time about getting back to you.  Good to hear from you!

Dave:
 I was talking with my brother-in-law who is Kinder/Morgan's VP of Corp 
Development and they would be interested in talking with us about 
contributing their 5,000 MW's of generation into a JV/Partnership to lead 
into a public offering.  We are still under several different CA's with them, 
due to our past conversation's regarding generation.  
 With our previous discussions, Rich Kinder had suggested to Kevin Hannon if 
Enron would be interested in buying the whole Orion  Project, but at that 
time ENA was only interested in the first couple of projects, due to the 
delivery of the turbines.  
 In light of our past discussions and KMI's desire to exit the generation 
business, this JV would give them the perfect ""exit strategy"".  Also, it 
would give us a better growth strategy, with respects to our talks with other 
parties.  I know that bringing in a potential third party would complicate 
the deal structure, but I think that it would build a much better growth 
story to Wall Street.
 If you think this would be a good idea, I can begin to set up a meeting as 
soon as possible with Kinder/Morgan.  Thanks!

Hey, sorry its been a little while but I've been traveling and keeping some 
late hours on these generation projects.  With regards to UT, I am going to 
stay at Enron for another year.  I feel that the thing that hurt me from 
getting in the schools I wanted to get into were my undergraduate grades.  So 
I have decided to take a couple of graduate level finance courses this summer 
and re-apply next year.  Actually, I'll apply to Columbia this Sept to get 
into their January program, which goes for a year and half.  

So lets get together for lunch before you head off for B-school this summer.  
Talk to you soon.

Subject: Plano vs Homestead

Ben



This is a revised Plano we did late yesterday. It was adjusted from Lowell, 
Mass Nepco estimate and we changed format to more closely match  Homestead 
form.

Biggest differences 'tween original Plano and original Homestead were:

Homestead had dual fuel     +4M
Homestead had additional piling and foundation bulks  +1.8M
Homestead was connecting to a complicated t-line config +1.5M
Homestead had an FPL substation    +5M
Homestead did not need as much gas pipeline    -2.1M
Homestead used 6% margin     +4.4M
Homestead had lower capacity due to additional chilling  +1.5% (not capital 
cost but does change $/kW)

Differences from original Plano to new Plano is that Nepco has estimated a 
union job for Lowell. This impacts indirects upward by about $5M and 
construction up above my earlier guesstimate by about $4M. I had doubled the 
cost per manhour which Nepco also did but additionally they added manhours 
for productivity loss. Additionally I moved new Plano margin to 6%.

New Homestead went up due to raw water pretreatment and first stage RO but we 
dropped the substation cost so total estimated cost went down by a coupla of 
million.

Numbers still just should be used for screening, no commitment. 

These summaries should not be passed around.

We are still looking for capital costs for a 730 MW plant in Texas, which 
comprises of 4 FA's and 2 STG's.  We are currently using $450 MM for a total 
project cost number, which comes out to be $616/Kw.
Thanks

I thought that was probably a mistake, because you haven't mentioned it and I 
don't see why you would sell it while you were away.  See ya

Basic summary for Teco:

Still working with Finance Group to come up with different finance structures.
Working with Insurance group (weather desk) to wear the risk of the project, 
since the Power desk will not wear that type of risk.
Pricing of the put, call and spread option values is still not finalized, 
because Kevin Presto has said that he does not put much value into these 
plants in Eastern PJM
Don Black is beginning to look at other companies for his price risk 
management product.  
He feels he will not be able to get a deal done with Teco at this point in 
time.

Let me know if this is suffient for your analysis.

Good to hear from you!  It's been a while.  I am also going to work for 
another year.  My undergrad grades were what held me back.  I have already 
enrolled in a summer graduate finance course for the summer.  How Fun!  I am 
also retaking the GMAT.  But what I am looking forward to is kicking your ass 
in the NYC Marathon since I signed up and will hopefully get in.  Megan will 
is almost done with school and will be spending most of July in NY.  So I 
will be coming up to NYC quite a bit this summer.  Would you be interested in 
going out to Colorado this summer to play some great golf.  They have some 
fantastic courses.  Other than that - work is going really well and Enron 
stock and company culture is really getting noticed by Wall Street, which is 
great for future job opportunities.  I'm playing a lot of tennis, golf anf 
basketball as of late and its been quite fun.  Hope all is going well and 
lets get together when you get back.  See ya soon.

Jim:
Scott and I are working with Kinder/Morgan on pricing a 3 year deal off of 
one of their facilities.  These are the facilities that we looked at late 
last year for buying 2 of their plants.  The plants have a configuration of: 
6 LM 6000's, 2 GE 7EA's and steam turbine.  They are able to run in at peak, 
swing and base load levels very easily.  They are looking for a 3 year  term 
deal for 510 MW's, with $1.00 VOM and Heat Rate of 8,531 located in Little 
Rock, ARK..  Pricing starts June 02 and goes to Cal. 04.  Anyway, I want to 
know if you guys are able to meet tomorrow at 2:00pm to talk about pricing up 
this deal.   It should only take about 15-25 minutes.  Thanks for your time.

Regards,
Ben

Congrats on the press release.  People that found out about it were amazed 
that we did it so quickly.  I was thinking, if you could call Ken, that would 
be great.  I know Michael is talking to Dave, but talking to Ken would really 
help my cause.  Let me know what you think.  I also am sending you a

My thoughts on the Central Iowa Power Cooperative RFP

Let me know what you think

1.  We will develop two GE 7 EA's.  Unit 1 operational 5/1/01.  Unit 2 
operational 5/1/02

2.  We will use the Ogden/Boone County Site being secured by John Moore.  The 
site is 1/4 mile from Northern Natural Gas Mainline.  Also, Ameren 345 Kv and 
Alliant 115Kv line onsite.  Assume interconnects to both of these systems.  
Please break out cost for each.

3.  Assume no fuel oil back-up

4.  Assume no black start

5.  Design the units to be later converted to combined cycle.

6.  Assume water injection for nox control.

7.  Assume portable de-min water facilities

8.  Assume Enron does EPC

9.  Assume CIPCO will finance and own the plant  through ther term of the PSA 
and thereafter

10.  Assume CIPCO will execute a power sales agreement (PSA) with Enron from 
5/1/01 through 10/31/07

Dr. Harris:
 In my pursuit to strengthen my application profile for next year I have 
explored taking two graduate level night courses this summer and I wanted to 
know what courses the admissions committee would suggest that I take this 
summer.  I wanted to make sure that I was taking the courses that were most 
appropriate with regards to my application. Just to let you know, I was 
planning on taking two finance courses.  Thanks in advance for your 
suggestion with this matter.  
 I was in Austin yesterday for the completion of the MS 150 Bike ride, but 
was not able to stick around.  Hope all is going well and hope to hear from 
you soon.  

Regards,
Ben Rogers"

perform the same function as I did in CTG, but now from the IPP group.

The Teco meeting will be held Monday at 2:00 pm in room 3125.  If you have 
any questions please give me a call.  The main issue will be the current 
assumptions in the models and the output prices from those models.  Thanks!

Subject: TECO-Answer to Chris Smith questions

Chris,


Hopefully the following points should answer your questions. Feel free to=
=20
call me (34292) if you still have any question.

Yvan




1_  We will value Teco as a series of hourly Spread options.=20
Legitimate points of concern:=20
a) Are we valuing an index deal or a physical deal?
  b) If it is a physical deal can the plant realistically react on an hourl=
y=20
basis?

Answer: The deal Enron enters into is based on an spread between PJM index=
=20
and the appropriate OIL curve (New York Harbor + basis). However, the trigg=
er=20
for the default of the contract (which is really what we are concerned with=
)=20
is a function of the plant cash flows compared to the debt level. The plant=
=20
cash flows depend on the physical operations of the plant and its capacity =
to=20
dispatch during the most expensive hours of the year. Therefore the questio=
n=20
of whether the plant can or cannot ramp up quickly enough to dispatch=20
economically is very pertinent to our valuation.=20
I would argue that the plant will always (or almost always) be able to=20
dispatch economically for the following 2 reasons. In the first place, its=
=20
operational ramp up time is only 10 minutes. Secondly, the scalar curve we=
=20
use is fairly well behaved and doesn=01,t swing around a mean position (see=
=20
graph below), hence allowing sufficient preparation for the dispatchers. Th=
e=20
chances of dispatchers being caught by surprise when prices spike up or dow=
n=20
should therefore be relatively small, and the plant should be able to follo=
w=20
the real time prices pretty well.





2_ The power curve we use is PJM west. Even though the plant is located in=
=20
the south east end of PJM (i.e. the del Marva peninsula), we prefer not to=
=20
use the east curve which is too thinly traded to be meaningful.=20

4_ So far we have only used monthly vol for power. Should we start using=20
daily vol as well, then the blending formula would be:
'fvol =3D Sqr((dblMvol * dblMvol * (jDate - jToday) + dblDvol * dblDvol * 1=
5) /=20
(jDate - jToday + 15))

with  jDate the first of the considered month of dispatch
 dblMvol the monthly vol
 dblDvol the daily vol

6_ We are assuming 50% flat correlation for 20 years (a much more=20
conservative assumption than 15%). However we run sensitivities where the=
=20
correlation goes from 30% to 70%.

7_ Yes, we are deducting all operative expenses from the valuation.=20
Origination is currently trying to reconcile the differences in operations=
=20
expenses between their numbers and those used by credits.

8_ The valuation model (coded by Alex Huang, Research) is based on a=20
bidimensional tree, and therefore doesn=01,t use the SPRDOPT function. Howe=
ver,=20
we checked that the SPRDOPT function from the structuring model and the tre=
e=20
based model yielded the same values for the spread option.

9_ The strike for the spread option is the sum of the OIL price + the VOM.

Please send me an excel spreadsheet which depicts the value that you see=20
associated with the heat rate spread option.  I want to make sure that I=20
understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this val=
ue=20
would be booked.  As such, please provide the following detail:

Will we be valuing/booking a series of monthly call options or a series of=
=20
daily call options?
What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub?
Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/MWh to=
=20
value the deal?
What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities=
=20
or intra-day volatilities or a blend of the two (if blending please show me=
=20
what formula you using to blend the two vols)?
What expiration date are you using, i.e.: for monthly call options the 15th=
=20
of the relevant month, and for daily options?
What correlation are you assuming, 15% flat for twenty years?
Are you deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option?
Are you using the ""SPRDOPT"" Exotic Options function to value the option?
Are you using the $/MWh VOM dollar amount as your strike?
Has Don provided the fixed payment stream?  This stream should be covering=
=20
both P&I and not just principal.

Yvan, and Ben, please provide answers to these question via written=20
correspondence so that their is limited probability of misunderstanding. =
=20
Thank you both very much for your time and help thus far.  Furthermore, I=
=20
would like to reiterate that RAC's goal, prior to quoting any credit reserv=
e,=20
is to be 100% confident that: (i) the methodology that is being employed is=
=20
consistent among the internal groups; and (ii) the inherent value of the=20
price risk management contracts matches.  This enables RAC to manage the=20
associated risk during the life of the transaction both effectively and=20
appropriately.

Regards,

Christopher

 The meeting Don and I had with Kinder/Morgan to discuss his Price Risk 
Management Product went really well.  We met with Park Schaper (CFO), Anthony 
Lannie (President of Power Group) and Jay Hopper (VP and General Manager) was 
on the phone from Denver.  They were very interested with regards to 
potentially replacing long term tolling agreements with this product.  Enron 
could provide a five year toll and the product would begin in the sixth year 
through year 15 or 20.  
 We talked very little about their existing projects; Little Rock and 
Michigan.  They do have all the permits for the Little Rock site and are 
moving forward with the Michigan site and still do not have any tolling 
agreements in place for those projects. 
 The ball is currently in their court and were going to get back with Scot 
with respects to the projects and with Tom on the PRM Product.  Please let me 
know if you have any questions with this matter.  Thanks!

Basically, having chillers in the project (running at full load) will 
increase the Heat Rate by approximately 50 degrees (ie. if HR is 10,465 w/o 
chillers to 10,409 w chillers).  Let me know if you have any questions.

I talked to Tom Swank this morning on UAE and he feels that we need to have 
Nepco still send out their best EPC number to UAE.  Tom said he can buy some 
time from UAE, so that Nepco can send out the number the middle of next 
week.  I talked to Bruce this morning and he was having Nepco continue to put 
information together on UAE.  Thanks!

First of all, I am going to run the NYC Marathon and kick both of your 
asses.  Lets put a little wager on this.  I headed to the Final Four this 
weekend and for a little opening day at Cinergy Field to see Ken G. knock 
some homers.  A lot is going on with work and I'm also trying to figure out 
about grad school.  I potentially have an offer to go work at an investment 
bank in NYC (Merrill and CSFB)  Need to figure this out soon.  Those pictures 
looked great from Bahrain and those other places.  Hope all is going well and 
keep in touch.  See ya

have alot of generation and are under pressure to get several projects done 
soon.  I also think that your price risk management structure would be a good

I spoke to Jay Hopper again at KN.  Here are the results of my conversation:

1.  Entergy Project--I told Jay that our immediate interest would be to 
purchase the Jackson project with the outside tolling bid in place.  Given 
their immediate focus is to finalize the tolling agreement for the project, 
he suggested that we revisit this topic in 3 months.  He sounded a bit 
nervous.  Perhaps there is an opportunity to swoop in later.

2.  ECAR Projects--Because these projects are 4th and 5th in their cue, he 
would like to discuss our involvement at a later date.

3.  7FA versus 7EA turbines--It turbines out that KN's Illinois turbines are 
7EAs (six of them).  I told him that we would still be interested in making a 
joint venture proposal for the turbines to them.  He is going to have Chuck 
Walker from his Chicago office call me.

First of all you may be skinny, but your a skinny geek - oh does that sound?  
I am sending in my application in this week.  Regarding grad school, I have 
gotten a couple of no's, but haven't heard from all the school's, but I am 
considering a position with an investment bank in NYC in their global power 
M&A Group.  Good money but I would put off grad school a couple of years and 
by that time who knows, maybe night school at that time.  I am training for 
the MS 150, which is th 170 mile bike race to Austin.  And you call me 
fatty!!  I'm heading the the Final Four next week - I ended up getting Mike 
Gioffre's Dad a couple of tickets, so he will in Indy.  OB and I went out to 
dinner in NYC when I was up their last week.  We went to a really expensive 
sushi place - it was awesome.  He seams to be doing well - he is considering 
going to a dot.com.  Gotta go!  I'll talk to you soon.

My Dad has the tickets and is going to keep them with him.  He doesn't want 
them to get lost in the mail.  We are staying in Cincinatti and are driving 
over Sat and Monday for the games.  The best thing to do is meet at a certain 
gate # or the ""will call window"".  I will call your Dad next week and set 
things up on a meeting place before the game.  Leave me your Dad's home 
number so I can call him next week.  These guys are going to have a great 
time that weekend.  Talk to you soon.

Dr. Harris:
 I would like to thank you for personally taking the time to closely review 
my application. Though I am disappointed with the results I am still 
determined to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of Business next year.  I 
understand how competitive the process has become, but I felt that with my 
work experiences, recommendations, personality, extracurricular activities, 
etc. that this would compensate for my disability.  After talking with 
Professors Titman, Ronn, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that the School was 
the right place to get the education I was looking for.  
  I am still certain that the School is the best place for getting a great 
graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do 
whatever it takes to get in next year.  I plan on taking two or three 
graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and 
Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions committee that I can compete at the 
graduate level. I also plan on retaking the GMAT test.  Due to my disability, 
this will be a monumental task; but I am determined to prove to the Committee 
that I can be successful at The TEXAS Graduate School of Business.  I would 
like to come down to Austin this spring to meet with you to further discuss 
my application file and to personally meet you.   
  If you think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall application 
file for next year, please let me know.  Take care and hope to hear from you 
soon.

Sincerely,

Ben Rogers

Professor Ronn: 
 I would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the MBA 
Program.  In the end, the results were not favorable.  I understand that it 
is a competitive process, but I felt that with my work experiences, 
recommendations, extracurricular activities, etc., that this would help my 
chances and possibly compensate for my disability.  After talking with you 
and Professors Titman, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that UT was the right 
place to continue learning about energy-finance.  
  I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent 
graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do 
whatever it takes to get in next year.  I plan on taking two or three 
graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and

this will be a monumental task, but I am determined to prove to the 
Admissions commitee that I can excel with the work at The Texas University 
Graduate School of Business.  
 Thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me.  It has been a 
pleasure meeting you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and 
finance in the future.  Also, if you can think of anything else I can do to 
strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know.

Please send me an excel spreadsheet which depicts the value that you see 
associated with the heat rate spread option.  I want to make sure that I 
understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this value 
would be booked.  As such, please provide the following detail:

Will we be valuing/booking a series of monthly call options or a series of 
daily call options?
What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub?
Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/MWh to 
value the deal?
What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities 
or intra-day volatilities or a blend of the two (if blending please show me 
what formula you using to blend the two vols)?
What expiration date are you using, i.e.: for monthly call options the 15th 
of the relevant month, and for daily options?
What correlation are you assuming, 15% flat for twenty years?
Are you deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option?
Are you using the ""SPRDOPT"" Exotic Options function to value the option?
Are you using the $/MWh VOM dollar amount as your strike?
Has Don provided the fixed payment stream?  This stream should be covering 
both P&I and not just principal.

Yvan, and Ben, please provide answers to these question via written 
correspondence so that their is limited probability of misunderstanding.  
Thank you both very much for your time and help thus far.  Furthermore, I 
would like to reiterate that RAC's goal, prior to quoting any credit reserve, 
is to be 100% confident that: (i) the methodology that is being employed is 
consistent among the internal groups; and (ii) the inherent value of the 
price risk management contracts matches.  This enables RAC to manage the 
associated risk during the life of the transaction both effectively and 
appropriately.

Regards,

Christopher

Hey!  How was DC?  Did JV get to meet the woman of his dreams?  Megan went to 
NYC for the week - its her spring break.  I am finding out whether I can send 
your parents the tickets early or if we will meet them at the ""will call 
window"" at the RCA Dome.  These are box seats so I don't know if we can get 
them earlier or not.  Looks like it going to be a very interesting Final

Dr. Harris:
Since I am a eternal optimist, I always feel I can strengthen my skills in 
most everything I do, but under these circumstances with the GMAT (timed 
exam) combined with my disability, I feel this is my best representation for 
this exam.  Also, I know that you would not what me to take the exam just to 
retake it, but due to my strong desire to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of 
Business, I would try to provide any additional information you needed to 
help strengthen my overall application file.  Again, thanks for the fast

Sorry for the delay, I have been traveling with work and I just got back an 
hour ago.  I can try and retake the GMAT exam if this will help my overall 
application file.  I must say, due to my disability, I don't think my score 
would improve dramatically.  I can also send you a summary (or the whole 
report) on my disability from the professional examiner to further explain my 
disability.  I can also provide addition recommendations from my colleagues I 
work with to further demonstrate my achievements at work.  If you could let 
me know what information would help best  explain my disability, I would 
appreciate it.  Thanks again for your e-mail and sorry for the delay.

Sorry for the late reply, I was in NYC and Boston on one of my deals.  The 
two companies I talked about was Relient and Entergy.  Relient ended up 
buying 19 LM 6000 turbines and Entergy ended up buying 28 LM 6000 turbines.  
They both plan to put them into customer deals, just as we are doing - so 
there is a little competition.  The delivery dates are a little further out 
than ours but they all are probably delivered by 2003.  Hope this helps. Talk 
to you soon.

Just to give you an update, I reeived an e-mail from Dr. Carl Harris, who is 
currently in charge of my application in the admission's office.  He wants me 
to answer a few questions to make sure I can handle the coursework.  That is 
why I wanted to meet with you and Professors' Titman and Brown, to discuss 
the coursework and to talk to you about my strengths and weaknesses.  I know 
that with my financial modeling and accounting skills, energy-finance 
background, and the Business' School's team-oriented approach to learning, 
that I will excel in this type of learning environment.  I hope things work 
out and thanks again for your help.

Ben:  Because of the short time frame I am just forwarding the questions from 
our broker (representing the surety) concerning your request for bid bond.   
Very valid questions and also will impact your performance bond should you 
win and need one.  Please try and get back to me asap as this is a very short 
time frame for the bond.  Thanks.

Subject: Enron North America/Rochester Generator Project 



Teddy-We are preparing the bid bond based on the request received yesterday 
evening.  The bid specifications indicate liquidated damages in the amount of 
$2,375,000 PER DAY.  I assume Enron will not accept damages at this level.  
Please check to determine if the bid will be qualified in this area-and what 
alternative damages may be offered.  Due to the unusual size of the penalty 
relative to the contract value, this could have an impact on reinsurance.

The contract indicates a normal one year warrenty from the contractor.  The 
charge for this warrenty is included in our standard performance bond rate.  
I have bonded a number of generator contracts similar to this, and frequently 
there is an option for the contractor to offer an extended warrenty up to 5 
years.  Since this would impact the premium charged, you may want to check to 
see if this option exist so we can get the pricing correct in your estimate.

Thanks.

Meg:
I would like to make sure that I have fully explained the reason for my GMAT 
score.  If the admissions office needs me to provide documentation on this 
disability I can do that.  Due to this disability, the GMAT score is not a 
good indicator of how I will do at UT.  Through what I have learned in my 
work experiences with State Street Bank and Enron, I know that I will be able 
to successfully do the work that UT requires.  If you could let me know what 
I can do to further explain my GMAT score I would greatly appreciate it.  If 
you think it would be better to talk to Dr. Harris-I will do that.  Thanks 
again for taking the time to help me with this issue.

Thank you for talking with the people in the admissions office.  I wanted to 
ask you what you think I could do at this point to help the admission's 
people understand the reason for my GMAT score.  I know that this is a poor 
reflection of what I can actually achieve and I know that I will do well and 
be successful in the learning environment at UT.  If I need to, I can provide 
the admissions office the documents stating the disability.  If you can let 
me know what you think I can do, I would appreciate it.  Thanks agin!

Press release looked good.  You probably haven't had a chance to talk to 
Dave.  Yesterday he was in the PRC meetings all day and today is the Enron 
board meeting, where he is giving a presentation.  I did talk to Kay, his 
assistant, and he was planning on returning your call today.  Again, congrats

DO YOU THINK HE WOULD??
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
 Al Gore and 
Constitution 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
, 2000 WorldNetDaily.com 

Ever since I saw Al Gore give that uncharacteristically statesman-like speech 
defending the integrity of the Electoral College system under the 
Constitution of the United States, I've been scratching my head trying to 
figure it out. 

Who was this guy? Was this the same Al Gore who has demonstrated -- time and 
time again -- so little respect for the Constitution during the last eight 
years? Why was he giving up on the idea of a challenge to the Electoral 
College, when it seemed many in his camp were banking on that as their last 
line of defense? 

Well, I think I have figured it out. Actually, there are two possibilities. 

The first thought that came to me was that this was Al Gore's 
""Don't-watch-the-man-behind-the-curtain speech."" While he was extolling the 
virtues of the Constitution, his minions in Florida -- from Bill Daley to 
Jesse Jackson -- were busy subverting it by any means necessary. It was Al 
Gore's way of establishing public plausible deniability. He stood above the 
fray, while his cohorts did the dirty work. 

But, more recently, another thought has occurred to me -- a darker, more 
sinister thought. I hope I am wrong. I pray that, this time, I am 
overestimating the deviousness of Al Gore. But that, of course, is always a 
difficult task. 

Think, for a moment, why Al Gore would suddenly be reading and citing the 
Constitution. 

The answer is that, in this instance, it gives him all the power. What do I 
mean? 

Who is it, under the Constitution, that is specifically charged with 
certifying the Electoral College votes of each state? You guessed it. The 
president of the U.S. Senate, which also happens to be the vice president of 
the United States. That's right. The day those Electoral College votes go to 
the Senate to be counted and certified to choose the next president of these 
United States, Al Gore will be holding all the cards. 

""Oh, Farah,"" you say, ""you don't think Al Gore would tamper with the results 
in any way with the whole world watching, do you?"" 

Well, let's think about what has been happening in Florida for the last 
several days. Al Gore's campaign managers have been whipping up hysteria 
stating that the will of the people in that state is being subverted. 

They are filing lawsuits. They are organizing marches. They are all but 
accusing the Bush campaign of voter fraud. 

Listen to what Bill Daley has to say: ""More than 100 million Americans voted 
on Tuesday and more voted for Al Gore than George Bush. Here in Florida it 
also seems very likely that more voters went to the polls believing that they 
were voting for Al Gore than for George Bush. If the will of the people is to 
prevail Al Gore should be awarded a victory in Florida, and be our next 
president of the United States."" 

They've decided that no matter what the actual vote count shows, Gore wins. 

Now, all Gore has to do on that fateful day in the U.S. Senate is reject for 
certification the Electoral College votes of Florida, and he wins the 
majority and becomes president. Sorry, Bush fans. I don't think there's a 
thing you can do about it other than protest, complain and stomp your feet. 
Better start planning your legal strategy now. I'll bet Al Gore's transition 
team is already hard at work. Barbra Streisand is probably making plans to 
sing at the Inauguration. Alec Baldwin is unpacking his bags. This could be a 
fait accompli. I guarantee you a counter to this bold move is not in the Bush 
campaign's playbook. 

The Gore campaign, still working overtime, has laid the groundwork for the 
challenge. The Florida vote is tainted, they say. It's too close to call. Too 
many irregularities. The vote can simply be dismissed by the constitutional 
authority -- Vice President Al Gore. 

Would you put it past him? I sure wouldn't.

Things are going well here in the States.  Work is very busy right now and i 
am actually training to  do the MS 150 Bike race.  It a race from Houston to 
Austin.  It's a 170 mile, two day ride with about 5,000 bikers.  It's on 
April 16th and 17th.  I rode this weekend only 40 miles.  Yes I am going todo 
the NYC Marathon and for you virgins, I will kick your fat asses.  Darnit, I 
wanted a pet Camel for our apartment.  Yes I got your message last week - I 
had just stepped away from my desk and just missed you.  When do you get 
back?  Sometime in the Summer.  By the summer I hope to be in the 185 range, 
currently I'm right at 200!!!  Not very good.  I have been talking with Mike 
Gioffre lately and were trying to get people together this spring or summer.  
I'll let you know when.  Gotta go, but I'll talk to you soon.

I talked to Bruce on Friday around 5:00pm and they are getting us, as well as 
Nepco, the scope document on Wednesday.  Nepco will take till the following 
Monday to turn the doc. around.  I told him we need it sooner than that, but 
he seems to think that is the standard time of return.  We need to find out 
from Reed more information regardin the configuration, noise, water, etc.  We 
will meet with Bruce on Wednesday.  We also may want to think about going up 
there with an Engineer to visit the site.  We can talk more on Monday.

DO YOU THINK HE WOULD??
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
 Al Gore and 
Constitution 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
, 2000 WorldNetDaily.com 

Ever since I saw Al Gore give that uncharacteristically statesman-like speech 
defending the integrity of the Electoral College system under the 
Constitution of the United States, I've been scratching my head trying to 
figure it out. 

Who was this guy? Was this the same Al Gore who has demonstrated -- time and 
time again -- so little respect for the Constitution during the last eight 
years? Why was he giving up on the idea of a challenge to the Electoral 
College, when it seemed many in his camp were banking on that as their last 
line of defense? 

Well, I think I have figured it out. Actually, there are two possibilities. 

The first thought that came to me was that this was Al Gore's 
""Don't-watch-the-man-behind-the-curtain speech."" While he was extolling the 
virtues of the Constitution, his minions in Florida -- from Bill Daley to 
Jesse Jackson -- were busy subverting it by any means necessary. It was Al 
Gore's way of establishing public plausible deniability. He stood above the 
fray, while his cohorts did the dirty work. 

But, more recently, another thought has occurred to me -- a darker, more 
sinister thought. I hope I am wrong. I pray that, this time, I am 
overestimating the deviousness of Al Gore. But that, of course, is always a 
difficult task. 

Think, for a moment, why Al Gore would suddenly be reading and citing the 
Constitution. 

The answer is that, in this instance, it gives him all the power. What do I 
mean? 

Who is it, under the Constitution, that is specifically charged with 
certifying the Electoral College votes of each state? You guessed it. The 
president of the U.S. Senate, which also happens to be the vice president of 
the United States. That's right. The day those Electoral College votes go to 
the Senate to be counted and certified to choose the next president of these 
United States, Al Gore will be holding all the cards. 

""Oh, Farah,"" you say, ""you don't think Al Gore would tamper with the results 
in any way with the whole world watching, do you?"" 

Well, let's think about what has been happening in Florida for the last 
several days. Al Gore's campaign managers have been whipping up hysteria 
stating that the will of the people in that state is being subverted. 

They are filing lawsuits. They are organizing marches. They are all but 
accusing the Bush campaign of voter fraud. 

Listen to what Bill Daley has to say: ""More than 100 million Americans voted 
on Tuesday and more voted for Al Gore than George Bush. Here in Florida it 
also seems very likely that more voters went to the polls believing that they 
were voting for Al Gore than for George Bush. If the will of the people is to 
prevail Al Gore should be awarded a victory in Florida, and be our next 
president of the United States."" 

They've decided that no matter what the actual vote count shows, Gore wins. 

Now, all Gore has to do on that fateful day in the U.S. Senate is reject for 
certification the Electoral College votes of Florida, and he wins the 
majority and becomes president. Sorry, Bush fans. I don't think there's a 
thing you can do about it other than protest, complain and stomp your feet. 
Better start planning your legal strategy now. I'll bet Al Gore's transition 
team is already hard at work. Barbra Streisand is probably making plans to 
sing at the Inauguration. Alec Baldwin is unpacking his bags. This could be a 
fait accompli. I guarantee you a counter to this bold move is not in the Bush 
campaign's playbook. 

The Gore campaign, still working overtime, has laid the groundwork for the 
challenge. The Florida vote is tainted, they say. It's too close to call. Too 
many irregularities. The vote can simply be dismissed by the constitutional 
authority -- Vice President Al Gore. 

Would you put it past him? I sure wouldn't.

Were all set.  You and your dad should fly into Indianapolis Saturday morning 
or early afternoon.  You need to look on a Website for when the games begin 
that day.  We are actually flying into Cinci and driving over.   Again, look 
at a website to see what time the Final game is on Monday night.  Give me a 
call so when can go over meeting before the game to get you the tickets.  
Talk to you soon.  Work number is (713) 853-7998.

Here is a presentation I need by 12:00 this morning.  I need 1 set of 
transparencies and 40 color copies, where these copies are stapled and 
three-holed punched at the top.  If graphics can ""clean it"" up a little bit 
that would be great..  I am trying to finish one more slide in this

I will have property taxes for Gleason tomorrow and I will be talking with 
Jody Pierce regarding the Fixed Operating #'s and cost numbers as well.  When 
I talked with Kevin Presto he thought that trying to use the 99 actual 
numbers and then escalting them was NOT a good idea, due to the fact that 
these are not ""normal"" operating assumptions.  Please give me a call if you 
have any questions.

 Thanks for the informative infomation session this past Friday.  Also, thank 
you for taking the time to listen to my situation regarding my application 
and talking to Dr. Harris for me.  After meeting with many of the faculty and 
staff (Professors Brown, Titman, Jemison & Ronn) at the School, my desire to 
attend the School is quite strong.  The School is a perfect fit for the 
career I am trying to pursue in energy and is a institution where I would be 
able to contribute to and learn from the energy-finance program due to my 
experiences with Enron.  Eventhough I have tested poorly on tests such as the 
GMAT, I feel that the rest of my application is quite strong and that I have 
proven that I can successfully compete in a competitive environment (ie. 
Enron).  I excel in environments (team-oriented) such as described by the 
many people I talked with at the Texas B-School.  
 Again, thanks for taking the time to talk with me about my application and 
it was good to see someone from Boston, who lived in DC and was now living in 
Texas, such as myself.  

Regards,

Ben Rogers"

It was good to see a fellow Yankee down in these here parts.  I got some 
really good feedback from all the people I talked with.  I think that UT 
would be a good fit for what I'm trying to do afterwards - with there 
energy-finance concentration and investment fund.  Plus it would be fun 
living in Austin for a couple of years.  When your in Houston next time wh 
can grab some drinks and go to dinner.  Talk to you soon.

I will let you know by tomorrow what the exact times of the games begin on 
Saturday so when can fly in on Sat.  We ended up working around the apartment 
and getting things in order.  Pretty boring but nice.  I ran this morning and 
played outdoor b-ball, it was really nice outside.  Hope we can get together 
soon b/c it was good to see you and Susan for dinner last week.  Talk to you 
this week.

We can respond outside of the formal RFP if we get something to them soon.  
They want to see if we have anything to offer.  In the meantime, they will go 
forward with their RFP.

Do not factor in any cost for the gas pipeline.  The local distribution 
company will absorbe the cost and go at risk for new incremental load.

The cost to go through the LDC is 15 cents/mmbtu on a variable or usage 
basis.  10 cents for transport and 5 cents for service fee.  Peoples gas 
aggregates gas purchases for a number of customers in the region and 
purchases gas month to month.  RPU pays a fixed gas price that changes month 
to month.

We would need to add 15 cents/mmbtu to gas price from our curves.

Substation work should be approximately $5.8MM and no higher than $6mm.

As a point of reference, RPU's estimate for a fully installed LM-2500 is 
$17MM.  They break this out to $11.8MM for turbine and generator, $1.2 MM 
engineering cost, $400k winter package and $3.6MM other stuff.

RPU will have a gas pressure guarantee of 300# so we need to have a 
calculation done on the cost of compression to step up from 300 to 600.  My 
guess is that it will be around $1mm.

I would like to have something to Rochester by mid next week.  We can use the 
routine 2 page proposal format.

information session, meeting with other Professors (Titman, Ronn and Jemison) 
and an Admissions interview.  I would appreciate it if you could send me your 
office location, so I can meet you at 9:00am on Friday.  Thanks again for 
taking the time to meet with me.  Look forward to meeting you.

haven't heard already.  My time was a little slower (4:27: 53), but I 
finished and my goal of not walking was kept.  I now want you to focus in on 
is the MS150 in April.  We are both doing it and yes, I will give you your

Ben, I have a reference document called Gas Turbine World Handbook in which I 
look up these type of answers as well for ballpark info. They are the 
""preliminary answer"" to your question and should be treated as so. Please 
keep in mind that these are numbers from a magazine, not from our internal 
Performance/Cycles group under Gary Bush (within EECC). They are the dept 
that the Dev Engineer typically consults with to arrive at a project's 
capacity and efficiency, both from a new & clean standpoint and an average 
degradation standpoint. The depts within EECC/NEPCO also come up with the 
total installed costs. It is their numbers that are the ones that we 
typically bid in a proforma, as such, they are a part of the deal approval 
process (DASH). Their buy in is important because in addition to the numbers 
that OEM's provide us, they factor in experience, judgement, unique project 
characteristics, design basis, intake/exhaust losses, etc. They also look at 
the net power for the Plant, not just the equipment itself. Having caveat'ed 
these numbers, I would respond to your questions below as follows:

1. PG7241FA Capacity: 171,700 kW each @ generator terminals (ISO conditions, 
gas fired @ baseload) -- does not include auxiliaries usage, duct losses
2. 1,060 MW Net Plant @ ISO, gas fired
3. 6,040 Btu/kWh LHV @ ISO, gas fired
4. Plug figure for GTG may be $32,500,000 each. No idea on the ST, swag at 
$175/kW. Power island turnkey for 2x1 may be $375/kW (does not include alot 
of stuff such as add'l options, development costs, tie-ins, permitting, 
spares, etc, etc, etc)

Hope this is useful to you somehow, but please go to the source (described 
above) for anything that we are going to hang our hat on.

With regards to our conversation yesterday, I am loking for basic economics 
regarding GE 7FA's.  Such as, 1. output per turbine; 2. output for 4 7FA and 
2 steam turbines; 3.  Heat Rates; and 4. cost per turbine and steam turbine.  
Total plant output will need to be 1000 MW's and will be run as a combined 
cycle facility.  If you could get me these numbers by the end of the day or 
call me to discuss what you currently have that would be great.  This project 
is not due till Wednesday.  Thanks

Back when, Susan transfered all the files to me and we went through the 
entire reg.risk process.  For the year I was in ISG, I never had to adjust 
the reg.risk book.  I did not hand over the files to anyone else because the 
group was breaking up and figured it was better that I keep them. I was in 
yesterday going through all my files and the boxes under my desk and did not 
come up  with them.  In rotating down to East Orig. I lost a box of stuff, 
but I didn't think it had those files in it, but it looks like that was the 
case.  Let me know what you want me to do, if anything at this point.  Again,

72 hours until G-Day.  I will be in Vegas at 7:30 on Thursday - let me know 
when you are going to arrive so we can be at the tables at our hotel.   I am 
going to get a tee time for Friday around 12 or 1.   I'll call tomorrow while 
I am glued to CNN watching the election.  Martin, make sure you vote for GW, 
your the only one whose vote is going to matter here.   The rooms are going 
to be around $100 per person.

The only planned activity is golf on Friday afternoon, the rest will be up to 
our collective wisdom.

With regards to our conversation yesterday, I am loking for basic economics 
regarding GE 7FA's.  Such as, 1. output per turbine; 2. output for 4 7FA and 
2 steam turbines; 3.  Heat Rates; and 4. cost per turbine and steam turbine.  
Total plant output will need to be 1000 MW's and will be run as a combined 
cycle facility.  If you could get me these numbers by the end of the day or 
call me to discuss what you currently have that would be great.  This project 
is not due till Wednesday.  Thanks

I just got back from NYC - I ran in the NYC Marathon yesterday.  It was a lot

have wanted (4:27).  If Wednesday or Thursday works for you, I would like to 
come up to the Woodlands and meet with you over lunch.  I hope all is going 
well and I'll talk to you soon.

Subject: Lincoln, Nebraska Preliminary O&M Estimate

Ben, please find attached the preliminary O&M estimate for the Lincoln, NE 
project that we discussed. It shows O&M cost estimates for a 20 year period 
assuming a stand alone plant with Availability required Monday - Friday, 6 am 
to 10 pm during the peak seasons (hence 2 operating shifts of staff). The GT 
major maintenance accrual is also shown assuming no membership in the Lease 
Engine Membership program. Since we will be buying the output of the plant 
from the Owner & Operator (LES) during a contract period, we may consider not 
showing them these numbers. Before tipping our hand, I'd like to see what 
they plan to ""charge"" us for the O&M portion of the power they provide us 
during the agreement period. Please review these and the other assumptions to 
ensure that I understand the project correctly at this point (especially the 
water treatment part). 


Since its preliminary in nature, please consider its accuracy +/- 25% for our 
proforma purposes.

If LES is to provide what they feel the O&M would be, please let me in on 
their numbers so we can provide our experience.

thanks, Scot

I just wanted to let you know that I got out UT Business School's application 
on Thursday, so they received it on Friday.  Megan and I are thinking about 
going down to Austin some time soon to see the school and see Austin.  Megan 
has never been down there, so if you guys would be interested in going down 
to Austin with maybe Brandon and Allison, that would be alot of fun.  Let me 
know.  If you could send an e-mail or a letter to the person you know at 
Texas that would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks

I talked to Greg Penman in Chicago and he was looking for some infomation on 
LM 6000's, but I need to leave for the airport.  His number is 312.357.8872.  
If you could go through this RFP or call him to see what other info he needs 
that I haven't given him already.  Thanks

This is the model from KN regarding their 4 LM 6000 Plant and their other 
plant which has 6 LM 6000's and I EA.  These numbers are hard to follow so 
they probably won't make a lot of since, without me going through them with 
you, which we can do when I get back.  I will be back tomorrow night and will 
be checking my messages.

I can't believe it -those Hoosiers actually beat a good team.  I'll admit 
that UK is not a real team this year- they need better point guards and a 
deeper bench, but lets get back to the real story.  Look at those Hoosiers

The guy you are talking about left CIN under a ""cloud of suspicion"" sort of 
speak.  He was the one who got into several bad deals and PPA's in California 
for CIN, thus he left on a bad note.  Let me know if you need more detail

Subject: Organizational Changes


To:  Enron North America Corp.

From:  Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon


In July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, the=20
implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the=20
continued growth of ENA including: 1) accelerate the development of our=20
people, 2) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets=
,=20
and 3) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups, both=20
within ENA and across Enron. Consistent with these objectives and with the=
=20
corporate goal of fostering =01&One Enron=018, we would like to announce th=
e=20
following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the=
=20
Commercial Transactions Group within ENA.

1) Coverage/Origination:

To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product=
=20
technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream=20
businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated=
=20
under the leadership of Dave Delainey :
a) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals,=
=20
co-ops, energy service companies and IPP=01,s;
b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a=
=20
broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers=20
including  pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals an=
d=20
mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation,=
=20
textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream=20
Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries.

Downstream Coverage/Origination

As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha=
t=20
the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both=
=20
ENA and Enron Corp.  Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand=
=20
its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20
solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron=
=20
Corp.  Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function=
=20
will expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener=
gy=20
commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti=
es=20
but also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic=
als,=20
plastics and refined products risk management capability.  These additional=
=20
capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels=
=20
groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper=
=20
will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg=01,s=20
leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three=
=20
sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering:
a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage=
=20
activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible f=
or=20
the provision of innovative=20
products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio=
n=20
of paper risk management products;
b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello t=
o=20
lead the coverage activities in this business.  This group will be=20
responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the=20
chemicals and refined products industries;
c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers=
=20
Trust=01,s global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to lead=
 the=20
coverage activities in this business.  This group will be responsible for t=
he=20
provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining,=20
heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textile=
s=20
and glass manufacturing industries.




Midstream Coverage/Origination

a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01, activities will focus o=
n=20
energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern=
=20
Interconnect. We have asked  Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of thi=
s=20
group;
b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will focus =
on=20
energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. The=
y=20
will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring=20
opportunities in the Western U.S.  We have asked Chris Calger to assume the=
=20
leadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from=20
Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination effort=
s;
c) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will f=
ocus on=20
the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the=20
emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio=01,s of merc=
hant=20
power generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked =
=20
Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group.  In addition, Mike will=
=20
continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern=20
Interconnect;
d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructur=
ing=20
opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing=20
restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets.  We hav=
e=20
asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair,=20
formerly of Enron Asia=01,s development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of=
=20
Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join=
=20
this newly formed business.

2) Commercial Transactions:=20

The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20
Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of=
=20
transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex=
ecuting=20
transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity=
=20
of client coverage.  CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20
Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20
Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical=
=20
Analysis and Upstream Asset Management.

The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,=
=20
execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction=
=20
with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of=
=20
which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.  This=
=20
dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service=
=20
and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20
resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to=
=20
the highest value transactions across the coverage functions:

a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and=
=20
Western Coverage/Origination Groups.  The senior members of this group=20
include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy=
=20
Lemmons joined Enron in 1992.  Most recently, he was the Vice-President of=
=20
Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today=
=20
from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power=20
origination.
b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA=01,s industr=
ial=20
origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining,=20
Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is=
=20
established.  The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay=
=20
Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.  We anticipate announcing=
=20
two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks.
c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant=
=20
Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups.  The seni=
or=20
members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud a=
nd=20
John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the=
=20
Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix.  We=
=20
anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few=
=20
weeks.
d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20
Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.  The senior members of this team inclu=
de=20
Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.  We hope to announce the addition=
=20
of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.

Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and=
=20
Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary=
=20
responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.  Andrea Reed will=
=20
continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior=

Ben 

Attached is an Excel Spreadsheet, worksheet 1 is a list the documents I think 
maybe available in whole or part now - we should make a request at our 
earliest convenience to Delmarva/TECO/???? I would be glad to call (probably 
following an introduction call) to get this going.

Worksheet 2 is a start of the Table of Contents of the Due Diligence - I will 
try and finish it today - we are modeling this on some Stone & Webster 
efforts we have copies of - I can get you an example as a go-by.

I have also started on the tasking letter, deliverable list, schedule, 
resources and estimated cost.  I should have that available either tomorrow 
or Monday (I won't have complete buyin on the numbers but should be close 
enough to get going).

If you have a list of our team on this project, it would be helpful. Sounded 
like Lou had a fairly complete list of the Clients people.

Mr. Pushaw:
Whats up my friend.  It's been a long while-too long.  The last time I saw 
you was when I was in New York for the marathon and saw you at that Italian 
rest.  I've been keeping up with gioffre (sp) as of late and noticed your 
e-mail address, so I wanted to give you a shout.  How's everything at law 
school going?  Will you be staying in NYC after you graduate?  I may be in 
NYC next year going to B-School at Columbia.  I'm down here in Houston 
working with Enron.  It's been a great experience but I'm ready to go back to 
school to get my MBA.  Please give me a call when you have some time and lets 
catch up.  My work number is (713)853-7998 and home is (713) 355-8738.  Hope 
all is going well and talk to you soon.  See ya

Mr. Rogers,
Just to quickly address your questions in advance of our call in the
morning, I offer the following:

1.  The debt amount contemplated was based on assumptions given by Enron.
The rate given was $375 /kW or $120MM in debt.  This would be obtained via
a 144A Bond offering without any subdebt.

2.  There are three operating fees listed in the proforma currently:
Management fee ($600k/yr) to the Owners as contracted, O&M Fee ($300k/yr)
to the Operator contemplated to be TECO Power Services (""TPS"") and the TPS
Parts Company for a spare engine.  The TPS Spare engine may be eliminated
provided we can get comfort via other methods.  The financing fees were
estimates based on discussions with Enron and our engaging CSFB.

3.  The Maintenance Reserve account is accrued based on operating hours of
the plant and planned major maintenance, as estimated by TPS (the O&M
Operator).  This reserve may be eliminated as we currently are estimating
that this plant will never reach a major outage.

I look forward to discussing these issues with you in the morning.

Regards,
Patrick Smith
TM Power Ventures

Hey Mike,
Thanks for the pics.  Where were the ones from which  looks to be a wedding?  
Hey, how many tickets were you thinking about? Were you thinking two for you 
and your Dad?  That weekend is April 1 & 3, 2000.  I'm not sure whether that 
is Easter weekend or not.  One other way to get tics is to go to 
www.finalfourseats.com  Let me know your situation.  Where are you spending 
the New Year?  Talk to you later.

Here is the model that Delmarva sent to us, which needs to be run through a

to us to see what has changed.  I will be putting together questions on the 
model they sent over.  Let me know when you would like to sit down and go

assumptions.  Bruce, if you have any questions please give myself or Erin

Good to hear from you.  Have a good trip up in NYC and I will talk to you 
when you get back.  In the next couple of days pull up the Enron ticker and 
check out the other deal I have been working on.  We closed it this weekend.

This weekend is out of the question - the BIG race is on Sunday up in the Big 
Apple.  Megan and I leave for NYC on Friday afternoon.  We will be getting 
back on Monday.  Watch ABC between 10:00am and 3:00pm, they play it down 
here.  Good deal with KMI.  I sent Susan a congratulations email this

I wish I had taken the Bar with that special treatment - sign me up!  The big

afternoon and get back on Monday.  I will be walking very slow next week.

caledonia transmission model after I confirm line data with Tapscott at 10am 
and clean up subsequent pages.  Keep me informed of any developments on your 
end.  Thanks."

I have hard coded all volmes, prices and revenues related to merchant sales.  
A blend of Hennwood and our desk curves were used to price the merchant or 
excess sales.  I am also using a 9% discount rate which is what FPL had in 
the model they sent over to us.  We may want to take this out entirely and 
let them do their own.

Be prepared the model that I had to work with was 14 Mbs and a big mess.  I 
have cut it down to around 4 Mbs but the cash flow sheet is confusing 
at best.  It is manageable and should be sufficient.  Give me a call with any 
questions.

Here is an older project mode we used.  Please do not show this to anyone.  
You can pull out some of the Caledonia information from this model.  Let me 
know if you have any questions.

Subject: FINAL Reminder: Executive Impact & Influence Summary Report


Hello again.  We are now passed the published cutoff to complete feedback,
but have extended the deadline until this Friday, September 1.  This is one
last reminder for you to submit your Self assessment and/or for your
selected team of raters to return their survey score sheets.

The Summary Reports are shipping out late next week.  In order for any
additional data to be included in your report, FSD, our processing partner,
must receive those surveys by Friday.

A Summary Report requires feedback from at least 3 Direct Reports or 3
Peers, or 3 in a combination of the two perspectives.  It is equally
important to obtain your Manager's feedback, as well as for you to provide a
Self assessment.  If your Manager submits his/her feedback, but you do not
have a sufficient number of Direct Report and/or Peer responses, you will
only receive a report with your Manager's responses.

You may wish to send one final reminder to your raters that their data must
be received by September 1.

If you have any questions, please call me.

As we discussed, I would like you to get an indicative ""as is"" cash offer 
(without equipment) from KN Energy for the Stoddard and Pontiac sites.  I 
would hold on Plano until Fred is able to get more feedback from Com Ed on 
his PPA negotiations.  On the later, you can tell them that we are in the 
process of negotiating a three year tolling agreement with Com Ed which we 
believe will add incremental value to the project.

In terms of equipment, I think that we can muster up 2 LM-600's for certain 
and another 2 LM-6000's if we can demonstrate some profit component in the 
equipment portion of the deal.  As we discussed, if we include the equipment 
in the deal, KN's commitment with respect to purchasing the equipment has to 
be firm."

COMVERSE NETWORKS A GOOD QUARTER
Comverse Technology reported estimate-beating third-quarter
results after the bell yesterday.

By LouAnn Lofton

Comverse Technology (Nasdaq: CMVT) reported third-quarter
earnings yesterday after the bell. The company, which makes
systems and software for telecommunications, had an increase in
revenues of 37% and net income growth of 52% when compared to
the third quarter last year.

Comverse's sales improved to $317.97 million versus $232.89
million in the year-ago period. Comverse earned $68.41 million,
excluding one-time charges for acquisitions, up from last year's
$44.96 million. The company beat the consensus estimate
according to First Call by two cents with earnings per share of
$0.38. Comverse had earnings per share in last year's third
quarter of $0.28.

In the third quarter, Comverse acquired Exalink and Gaya
Software. The company took an after-tax charge of $4 million for
costs related to the purchases of those businesses.

Comverse improved gross margins to 62.6% from 61.4% in last
year's third quarter. The company also increased its net margins
from 19.3% to 21.5%.

Driving the results for Comverse was strong demand for the
company's products from wireless providers. A majority of
Comverse's sales are to wireless network operators.

WORMS IN APPLE'S HOLIDAY QUARTER
By John Del Vecchio and Dave Marino-Nachison
With Gateway warning of a poor start to the holiday season less
than a week ago, there was definitely reason to figure that
Apple wouldn't be far behind in warning about near-term profits.
But in its most-recent quarter, Apple was the victim of its own
poor execution. How low can this cash-rich company's shares go?

GREENSPAN SPEAKS, STOCKS ROCKET
By Bill Mann
In a New York speech, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
said he is convinced that the torrid pace of economic growth
fueled by access to easy money has slowed. Greenspan remarked on
the fact that technology advancements have given the country
nearly unprecedented ability to gain efficiency -- but many
players in the high-tech market got to the game too late. Should
the economy slow too much, the Fed may just drop rates next
year. For now, though, the tightening bias is a thing of the
past. FULL STORY>>

NEWS TO GO

Home Depot (NYSE: HD) and 3M (NYSE: MM) have new chiefs and
they're both from General Electric (NYSE: GE). Home Depot named
Robert L. Nardelli its new president and CEO effective
immediately. 3M picked W. James McNerney Jr. as the company's
new chairman and CEO. Nardelli had been president and CEO of GE
Power Systems, and McNerney was head of GE Aircraft Engines.
Both men were being considered as replacements for GE's chairman
Jack Welsh, but were passed over in favor of fellow GE-er
Jeffrey Immelt.

Car parts retailer AutoZone (NYSE: AZO) reported a drop in
first-quarter earnings yesterday. The company's net income was
$53.8 million, down from last year's $56 million. Sales grew 6%
to $1.06 billion. Buoyed by share repurchases, AutoZone
increased earnings per share to $0.46 from the year-ago period's
$0.40. The company blamed the net income shortfall on ""a
difficult sales environment.""

Data storage company EMC (NYSE: EMC) said this morning that it
expects fourth-quarter earnings to increase by at least 55% over
last year's Q4 results. The company also thinks revenues will
grow to $12 billion in 2001. CEO Michael Ruettgers said in an
interview with Reuters that his company is ""very comfortable""
with the current 2001 revenue projections, which are almost
double the company's 1999 levels.

Lante Group (Nasdaq: LNTE), an Internet consulting business, is
cutting its staff by 19%. This translates to about 120 jobs, and
the closure of the company's Singapore and Delhi offices. After
the cut-backs, Lante will have around 500 employees. Lante hopes
to save around $4 million with the reductions, starting in the
first quarter of 2001. The company is trying to become ""cash
break-even"" during the first half of 2001. Lante's president and
CEO, Rudy Puryear, said, ""We did not react as quickly as we
should have to the speed and magnitude of this dramatically
changing environment. As a result, we are disappointed with our
recent financial results. Moreover, the decision to reduce our
workforce was very difficult, but necessary. We are implementing
several steps to reposition the business to grow revenue and
achieve profitability in the coming year.""

of MD's, Smith Business School.  I will still have my PwC email address and
voicemail.  I will check these about once a week.  An easier way to get a hold

Attached is another redlined draft of the Pastoria IM.  It is much more close 
to completion because it now includes comments from all necessary parties. 

Please carefully review and send me any changes no later than Monday.  If you 
send them today (Sunday) send them via e-mail.  Beginning Monday (12 PM CDT) 
I'll be in SF, so if you fax them send them to 415.782.7827.

Please call me at 713.629.0929 or 713.398.6412 should you have any 
questions.  Thanks.


PS  for Dave Parquet:  Not all of your proposed changes were made simply 
because I could not ready many of them and the changes were too late at night 
to call you.  I was asked to get a draft out ASAP so I will call you today 
(Sunday) to discuss them.

I have placed a call to Bo Buchynsky of Diamond Energy (Mitsubishi's US 
subsidiary) to see if they are interested.  They tried to bid Pittsburg, but 
their partner Mission bagged them at the last minute so they backed out.  We 
tried to marry them to Avista, as they both seemed to lack partners at the 
time, but that did not work out.  Several months ago, Bo contacted me to 
indicate that they were in the market for projects and wanted to be kept on 
our lists for contact when opportunities were available. I will contact Bo 
and assess continued interest and get a current address.

I think you got all the rest of the companies I thought of.  I also asked 
David Kates, who also thought of no more.

The tab in the file titled 2000 Peakers is a consolidated list.  The other 
tabs are just tabs I used to gather information and are currently not used.  
I hope this clears things up.  Give me a call if you have any more 
questions.  Thanks

Hey ,
I checked on the tickets and she is sending them to me and I will send them 
to you.  She mention that they are for the 15th, which is a Friday, I guess a 
night game but I'm not sure.  I recall your most recent e-mail as stating the 
16th - is that right.  If so, I hope their wasn't a screwup on anyone's

Charlene,
Hope you do not mind a direct (email) solicitation, but I was referred to you 
by Ben Rogers who I have recently met in my new
position with Pulp & Paper on the 29th floor. I have a friend who is 
interested in a Finance-related
position with Enron.   I think you will find his resume to include a broad 
base of education and experience
that would fit in with this company.

If you have a need for someone of his background, please feel free to contact 
him directly.
I have attached his resume for your review.

Thanks very much,

Camille

Ben:

I am not sure that Swati from Duke understands what the payment schedule 
represents.  First of all, the property tax payments for assessment years 
2000 - 2009 range from a high of $590K to $490K and are not close to the 
numbers he feels are reflected by the schedule. 

 Property tax payments for any given assessment year in Mississippi are paid 
in January of the year following the year of assessment.  For example, the 
property taxes for the 2000 year assessment year are paid in January 2001 and 
the payment schedule reflects that ($591,200).  The other figure that shows 
in the column are property taxes for that year to be paid in the following 
year.

The 15% ratio of assessment has been taken into account in the calculation

I thought you might think this is pretty funny.  Mike sent it to me.  Who 
said Enron doesn't play well with others.

Enron news release

FYI

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
-----------------------

Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement
said to be worth an estimated $666 Trillion.  In the deal, Enron will
provide
both gas and electric commodities to Hades' facilities throughout and
under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former CEO of energy monopolist
Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy management division.  Said
Rockefeller, ""Obviously Hell has significant heating demands.  While
eternal flames are a great idea in concept, they require vast and reliable
fuel
resources.  Enron was the only supplier willing to make a deal with my
boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just like the way they do business.""

A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
together during negotiations.  According to the company, ""The deal fits
both companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and
retain new customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for
millennia to come.""  According to several energy industry insiders,
Hades' high heating demand with very little need for summer air conditioning
make it a very attractive energy portfolio addition.

Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained
high growth rates over the last two thousand years.

Enron is one of the world's leading energy and communications
companies. The company owns approximately $37 billion in energy and
communications assets.  Enron ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's ""Best
100
Companies
to Work For if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A
Week,"" and is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked
by customers with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply
contracts.

Elizabeth and I would like to thank everyone who came to our wedding and
shower.  It wouldn't have been the same without all of your participation.
We have returned from our honeymoon in Hawaii and are now moved into our new
apartment here in NYC.  We are now trying to move all of our wedding and
shower gifts into our little one bedroom apartment.  It's a good problem to
have, though.  If you are ever in town, please give us a call.  Thanks again
and we look forward to seeing you in the near future.

I would love to have lunch one day.  Call Cindy and get on my calendar.  It 
was nice to hear from you!  I am glad everything is going well.

Stan


P.S.   Hello, Ben!    This is Cindy.    I just wanted to let you know that 
Stan has recently decided to open up, print, and reply to all of his own 
e-mails.    He did receive your initial e-mail and had typed up this message 
but saved it as a 'draft' and never sent it to you.   I just so happened to 
look in his 'draft' folder yesterday and saw this message, asked him about 
it, and he said to forward it on to you.     So, he hasn't been ignoring you 
(ha)...he just forgot to send the draft message.   This is just between you 
and me, okay?    ha ha     Don't joke with him about this....he's trying to 
become more knowledgeable in the technical area.    I just hope he doesn't 
decide to get rid of me!  ha ha      Have a great day and call me to set up a 
lunch with Stan."

Ben -

 Here are my comments to the CA.  The only substantive comment has to
do with the procedure to follow in the event of a legal proceeding that
requires disclosure.  The procedure you proposed is a pretty tough standard
for us to follow, and I would prefer a procedure more along the lines I have
proposed.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

Of course, the bad people enjoy the waking hours much more.""

COMPAQ UNSURPRISINGLY WARNS
Computer maker Compaq became a member of the warnings club
yesterday.

By LouAnn Lofton

Compaq Computer (NYSE: CPQ) joined its PC-related brethren
yesterday on the warning train. Gateway Computer (NYSE: GTW),
Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), Intel (Nasdaq: INTC), and Advanced Micro
Devices (NYSE: AMD) have all warned the Street recently that
sales and earnings in their fourth quarters would be below expectations.

Compaq lowered guidance for the fourth quarter and for its next
fiscal year after the close of market yesterday. It also
announced that it will take a non-cash charge in the fourth
quarter related to the decline in value of some of its investments.

Compaq's revenues for the fourth quarter will now be between
$11.2 billion and $11.4 billion. That's below the expected $12.3
billion, but still above last year's $10.4 billion. Compaq
expects earnings, minus charges, to be in the range of
$0.28-$0.30 a share. Analysts were looking for $0.36 a share.
Compaq earned $0.19 a share last year.

The company blamed weak sales of its computers to U.S. consumers
and businesses, and softness in the demand for its servers.
Compaq is optimistic about the next fiscal year, but did lower
its guidance for results.

Chairman and CEO Michael Capellas said, ""Our current 2001 plan
calls for 10% revenue growth and 25% growth in earnings per
share over the revised estimates for the fiscal year 2000.
Although this is lower than our previous guidance, it still
reflects strong year-over-year improvement."" According to First
Call/Thompson Financial, analysts expected earnings to grow
about 40% in the next fiscal year.

Compaq also said that it will take a non-operating, non-cash
charge in the fourth quarter, related to the decline of some of
its investments. Internet incubator CMGI (Nasdaq: CMGI) and its
related assets are the main holdings that are causing this move.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Biotech company Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN) announced share repurchase
plans yesterday after the bell. The company plans to buy back up
to $2 billion in common stock between January 1, 2001 and
December 2002. Amgen also said that President and CEO Kevin
Sharer will be adding chairman to his title. The current
chairman, Gordon Binder, will retire December 31, as previously
announced.

Retailer Claire's Stores (NYSE: CLE) will miss fourth-quarter
earnings estimates. The company said yesterday that it sees
earnings per share for the fourth quarter of between $0.70 and
$0.80. Analysts had expected $1.12 a share. The company blamed
slow sales for the disappointing results.

Embedded computer maker Radisys (Nasdaq: RSYS) warned yesterday
that it will not meet current earnings and sales expectations.
Radisys is looking for fourth-quarter revenue of around $83
million, versus the $90.7 million it originally predicted.
Earnings per share for the fourth quarter will be between $0.20
and $0.24. Analysts, and the company itself, expected $0.41 a
share. The company also said that the first quarter of its new
fiscal year should return results about flat with the
fourth-quarter results. Analysts had expected Radisys to have
earnings per share in the first quarter of $0.42.

Internet consulting firm Razorfish (Nasdaq: RAZF) cut its
fourth-quarter outlook yesterday. This is the second time the
company has done so. Razorfish now expects to post a loss of
between $0.17 and $0.22 a share for the quarter, excluding
certain charges. Analysts were expecting a profit of $0.02 a
share.

After having conducted our first of several business reviews, Enron Global 
Markets - Office of the Chairman would like to outline the following 
organizational changes effective immediately.

The Global Risk Markets group under Jere Overdyke illustrates enormous 
opportunities given the size of those businesses.  To better focus on the 
different commercial functions and to capture market share and value, the 
group is being realigned.  Jere will continue to manage Global Risk Markets 
and build on our insurance capabilities.  Mark Tawney is responsible for our 
weather business and will now report to the EGM Office of the Chairman.  

Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President of 
Operations and Chief Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of 
the Chairman, and to Sally Beck, Vice President of Global Risk Management 
Operations.  In his role as Chief Accounting Officer, Brent will also report 
to Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for 
Enron Corp.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila Glover, 
business controller for Financial Products; Todd Hall, business controller 
for weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for global products and 
coal.  In addition, Tom Myers will join Brent's management team as Director 
of Accounting.  Brent and his team are responsible for all accounting, risk 
reporting and trading operations for all the businesses within EGM. 

Cindy Skinner will join the Enron Global Markets team with responsibility for 
Human Resources.  She will also report to David Oxley and the HR organization.

Attached please find the weekly cost report.  The only material change is a 
reduction in Gleason Start-up Fuel/Power.  A credit for the sale of power was 
not booked against the project until after closing.  I am working with Ben 
Jacoby, Fred Mitro, and Chris Booth to review Estimate to Complete and Total 
Projects.   We are focusing in on a couple of areas, one being the 
Westinghouse Turbines.  We have withheld money for Liquidated Damage claims 
for both Wheatland and Gleason.

Additionally, we have scheduled the final Nepco audit for August 28th - 
30th.  We will be reviewing actuals, estimate to complete and ultimately the 
final forecast.  


Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks Amy 3-7805

I ran a reconstruction macro on the 2000 peaker model.  There were some 
mysterious links to other files that made me nervous.  I managed to wipe 
these out and made the file about 25% smaller in the process.

I just wanted to touch base with you and let you know I am still with Enron 
and still enjoying the experience and currently working on selling some of 
our power plants with the Generation Investments Group.  I also wanted to say 
congratulations on the birth of your twins - thats great!  If there is any 
chance to have lunch I would greatly look forward to having lunch with you.  
By the way, I had a really good conversation with Rocky Storie the other 
day.  He was my representative for my performance review and I felt he did a 
great job and I greatly appreciated it.  Hope all is going well and I look 
forward to talking to you soon.

I reworked the debt section to eliminate tranche 1.  Tranche 2 now amortizes 
years 1-10 and pays 11% interest.  Tranche 3 amortizes years 11-20 with 
interest of 11.2%.  I re-solved for optimal amortization schedules and face 
amounts to get a minimum coverage ratio of 2.25x and an average coverage of 
3.25x.

I removed some references to the amortization of the power contract that 
Jinsung pointed out.  I also re-hardcoded the state franchise tax for Gleason.

Let me know what else needs re-working.

Subject: Revised Due Diligence Indices


Stuart,

Attached are a clean and a blackline version of each of the due diligence 
indices for the six plants.  As you know, I have recently made several 
additions to each of these indices based upon my time in the data room this 
past week.  This includes recent documents for the 2000 peakers as well as 
other previously unseen documents that came from the boxes that were given to 
me by Don Miller.

I understand that Jinsung and Ben Rogers had previously given the prior 
drafts to Ben Jacoby and others to review for redacting purposes.  It will be 
necessary and useful to give these blacklines to those persons doing that 
review to note the recent additions and review these as well.

I also understand from Carolyn Gilley that she will coordinate with Lorie 
Leigh regarding the creation of the due diligence files on Live Link.  It 
seems relevant that Jinsung and Ben Rogers are also aware of how this process 
would work.

My understanding, and I will confirm that this is done, is that Carolyn's 
scanning personnel are to be scanning in the additions into Live Link today 
per my request.  There is also some filing and re-filing that will need to be 
done in the data room and I have alerted Lorie Leigh to this fact via voice 
mail on Friday.

I seem to have left Don Miller's, as well as Ben Rogers' and Jinsung's, 
e-mail addresses at my home over the weekend.  By copy of this e-mail, I am 
asking Lorie to please forward it to Don, Ben, and Jinsung.  She has 
confirmed to me via telephone that she will do so.

If you or any of the others involved in this project have any further 
question, please do not hesitate to call me.  Thank you.

Best regards,

I think I have cleaned this one up.  I removed the PPA portion (2001-2003).  
I haven't played with the debt too much; I just reduced it to give us roughly 
the same coverages as we had in the previous model.  Please review and let me 
know what I missed -- I'm sure there are a lot of things.  I have to take off 
around 3:00 this afternoon to turn in the keys from my old apartment, so 
e-mail your changes, and I'll get on it first thing tomorrow morning.

Doc 01.07.02  - Talks about a 15% assessment for as valorem taxes.
Doc 01.07.02.01 - Property tax estimates - estimates from 2001-2019  (tax +
pilot payments) are $1M a year till 2009 and then to ~$1.4 M for next few
years beg 2010, dropping back down to $700K level.

In 2000, the property tax was just $500K, as there seems to be no pilot
payment until Jan 2001.

My questions are -
   Confirm that the 15% assessment in first doc is included in the estimate
   The schdule of estimated payments is all inclusive of the payments
   relating to property taxes
   Refer me to doc that talks about the pilot agreement or any other tax
   abatement docs

Thanks.

Hey man - good to hear from you.  It must be rough house sitting in River 
Oaks, just remember to leave the furniture before you go back to school.  
Next week would be great to get some brews.  My wife and I are moving this 
weekend so it is quite hectic this week.  I will need a lot of booze after 
this move!  How's Chase?  I'll talk to you soon.

Gents,

I made the following changes to this model:
I adjusted all the NPV functions to be as of 12/31/2000.
I incorporated the seasonal availabilities and capacities into revenue 
calculations.  Previous to this revision, all monthly merchant revenue was 
calculated using the Winter availability and Summer capacity.  All monthly 
PPA revenues were calculated using annual average availability and Summer 
capacity.
I cleaned up the update macro and added a nifty status bar progress indicator 
while the thing's running.

Let me know if you have any other revisions or corrections.

Jon

Some revisions.  Gus, please verify, paying particular attention to the

My shares are just as worthless as the next guys...After announcing 27% 
increase in earnings, but on the same day overshadowed by the REI deal, they 
are certainly needing some deals to do.  My advice...execution, execution, 
execution, of DEALS. that is.

How's your summer?  Are you in Delaware now?  I am going to set up a
weekend in DC in the Fall and I will probably do it around homecoming
weekend.  I want to try and set it up for most of the people will huge out
with, but will take other suggestions.  I will be sending out e-mails to
everyone informing them of the weekend.  Choby is going to set up a bar to
rent out for Saturday night.  In the past, you have sent me e-mails with a
bunch of different e-mail addresses attached to it.  If you could send me a
list of the e-mails you have for our friends that would be great.  Thanks
for the help and lets talk about this further.  Talk to you soon.

Gents - 

Here is your spreadsheet. There are comments at the bottom each sheet. Many 
of them bring up the same points and I stopped making specific comments at 
the older projects. Sky River and VG comments are more detailed because we 
are the project partner again as of last week (these were divested for QF 
reasons in 1997).On the EnronSumm sheet added are some recommended further 
info to request and a summary of the main points in the comments. On the 
EnronVal sheet I suggest an alternative valuation for your consideration 
although issues on which I've made comments will still need resolution. Let 
me know what I can do for you further and when/if you'd like to go over this.

Cheers - Eddie

Hey friends:

As most of you already know, I had left Enron recently to embark on my MBA
program this coming fall. Sorry I don't have the time to visit with all of
you individually to bid farewell, and I would like to take this opportunity
to thank each and everyone of you for all your help and support over the
past 3 years I had been at Enron.

I am currently visiting my family and friends in Singapore, before heading
back to Houston to drive up to Boston. You can reach me at this permanent
email address, or alternatively, the following after 8/23/00:

636 HBS Student Mail Center
Boston, MA 02163-7807
(617) 493-1816
klau@mba.hbs2002.edu

Hope everything is well with all of you. Please keep in touch and take great
care of yourselves!

Best regards.

-Clement


p.s. Look for me if you are going to be in Boston area!

The time has finally arrived for me to leave the working world - tomorrow 
(7/28) is my last day at Bank United - and I will soon be leaving for 
Evanston, so I thought I'd pass along some info if you need to reach me.

I'll be in Houston until around August 23rd or so.  My home # is (713) 
665-5792.  I can also be reached at the parents' house at (281) 920-3113.  No 
more cell phone for now - drat!  My email address (until I get up to school) 
is: cbmcwherter@yahoo.com .

My contact info in Evanston is:

1600 Hinman, Apt. 1M
Evanston, Illinois 60201

(847) 869-7988


I'll forward my Kellogg e-mail address when I get it in September.  If you 
ever want to come up and check out Chicago, catch a game at Wrigley, or 
donate money to the McWherter Scholarship Fund, please let me know.  I'll be 
more than happy to take a break from the world of academia and do whatever.

I'm sure I'll see most of you before I leave, but if not, take care and I 
wish you the best.

Professor Ueng:
Hope all is going well and you have either finished or are almost finished 
your Phd.  I was wondering if I could be able to find out my grade for the 
Financial Mgmt. class (MBA-5318 A) I took with you this summer.  Is there a 
website we can go to or something?  Thanks!

As you are all aware, EBS has grown to be a significant part of Enron.  The=

EBS/Blockbuster movies on-demand announcement this week, as Merrill Lynch p=

it, =01&confirms the tremendous inroads Enron has made in the telecommunica=
tions=20
business.=018  We expect this deal to be a springboard for enabling EBS to=
=20
accomplish even greater things.

Because we believe that EBS is integral to Enron=01,s success, it is becomi=
ng=20
increasingly important for greater interaction among EBS senior management,=
=20
corporate leadership and our Houston-based business units.   In short, we=
=20
determined that it is necessary for the CEO to be based in Houston, althoug=
h=20
the Portland office will remain an integral part of EBS.=20

Joe Hirko as CEO and Ken Rice as Chief Commercial Officer have accomplished=
=20
great things, and we believe that both are completely qualified to fill the=
=20
CEO role moving forward.  However, Joe has decided to stay in Portland for=
=20
family reasons, and as a result, Ken will assume the role of CEO for EBS,=
=20
effective immediately. =20

Joe, unfortunately, has decided to leave Enron.  We want to recognize Joe f=
or=20
his role in making EBS a success.  He started the business, demonstrated it=
s=20
value to Enron management, and brought the team together to create the EBS=
=20
vision.

We do believe that EBS will continue to grow and succeed under Ken=01,s=20
leadership.  Throughout his 19-year career with Enron, he has consistently=
=20
been a driving force in building businesses.

Please join us in wishing both Joe and Ken great success."

Amy:
Here are my answers  to your questions:
1.  Yes I think its a good idea, because you are able to reach a wide 
audience with this advertisement.  
2.  I don't think the contest should be limited to just these 
schools/conferences.  You probably should open it up to all schools to get an 
even wider reach of potential candidates.
3.  I would think that if you had a certain amount for the cash prize that 
people would take it seriously to try and win the cash.
4.  Please let me know if I can support you in any way.
Thanks

Introducing your first SAP Paycheck!

This is the first payroll processed in SAP for all employees paid out of=20
Corporate Payroll. You may notice some changes in the way information is=20
reflected on your pay advice, the most common are itemized below.

What=01,s Different?
? Your =01+home=01, cost center will be displayed at the top of the pay adv=
ice.=20
This is your department number as designated in the HR and financial module=
s=20
of SAP.

? Any earnings descriptions that start with a =01+P=01, represent earning t=
ypes=20
reported in the prior period. For instance, if you reported vacation time f=
or=20
the July 1st-15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay=20
advice as =01+PVacation=01,.

? Flex dollars will appear on the earnings section of the pay advice instea=
d=20
of as a credit in the deduction section. The various benefit deductions wil=
l=20
remain itemized in the deduction section.

? If you transfer between Enron companies during the year, your year=01)to-=
date=20
totals will carry forward to the new company pay advice. Previously, the=20
year-to-date totals started over when transferred to another company. This=
=20
change will provide your total Enron earnings and deduction amounts on your=
=20
pay advice throughout the year.  (Note that your W2 at the end of the year=
=20
will reflect your earnings by company).

? For salaried employees, any reported exception time (e.g. vacation, sick=
=20
day, etc.) will be reflected on the earnings section with hours only, the=
=20
related dollar amount will be included in the =01+Salary=01, earnings type.=
=20

? For any other information or further explanations regarding your payroll=
=20
contact the Payroll Call Center at 713-345-5555



Payroll FAQ=01,s

My paycheck has a line called =01&other deductions=018, what does that stan=
d for?
There is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck.  For=
=20
some employees, the number of deductions are more than we have room to=20
print.  In this circumstance, the system totals all remaining deductions an=
d=20
prints them on one line =01) titled =01&other deductions=018.  The detail o=
f all=20
deductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intrane=
t=20
at eHRonline.enron.com.

What do the earnings or deduction codes on my paycheck mean?
These definitions are listed on the Payroll webpage located at=20
hrweb.enron.com, select Enron Payroll  from the side index.

Why is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck?
Overtime is paid one pay period in arrears, therefore it will be reflected =
in=20
the next pay period. For example, if you reported overtime for the=20
July 1st =01)15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay ad=
vice=20
as =01+POvertime=01,.

What is the limit for Social Security (FICA)?
For year 2000 the limit is $4,724.40 on a wage base of $76,200. This limit =
is=20
applied to each Enron payroll tax company. Therefore, if you transfer to=20
another Enron company these limits will start over, however, the total amou=
nt=20
withheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub. Excess FIC=
A=20
will be credited to you by the IRS via your tax return.

What federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when I exercise stock=
=20
options?
There is a standard federal income tax rate of 28% for these earnings. This=
=20
can be higher if the employee has completed a Supplemental Tax form=20
requesting a higher rate (this form can be found at hrweb.enron.com , selec=
t=20
Enron Payroll  from the side index)."

Dr. Ueng:
I wanted to mention this to you yesterday after the test, but didn't have 
time.  I was taking this course because I am applying to another business 
school and since I have been out of school for six years I wanted to provide 
the other schools with a recent academic record.  I was trying to get an A in 
the class, but my first test was not my best work. I feel that I did much 
better on the second test and that Brandon and mines case studies and my 
class participation were good enough to get me close to the A level.  That 
said if I am also able to get a recommendation from you I would greatly 
appreciate it.  I know that you are extremely busy now, so if I could get in 
touch with you at your earliest convenience that would be great.  Thanks for 
making the class educational and quite enjoyable.  Hope to talk to you soon 
and hope you can enjoy the rest of the summer.  

Regards,
Ben Rogers

 Congratulations Benjamin C  Rogers !

 You are a 2000 New York City Marathon Lottery winner. Cheers!

 YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS, DON'T YOU??

 You have earned the right to run 26.2 brilliant miles through the streets of 
New York City on Sunday, November 5, 2000! (Only 115 days to go.)

 AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, DON'T YOU??

 It's time to start training!

 Start RIGHT NOW by outfitting yourself with the official ""Training for 2000"" 
t-shirt! Why train in silence?! Let the world know your goal and wear a 
t-shirt that keeps your training on track.

 AND . . . because today is your lucky day, we have a great deal for you: 
order your ""Training For 2000"" t-shirt before 11:59pm* on Sunday, July16th, 
and the shirt is your's for the special price of $15 (regularly $18), or the 
Training for 2000 tee shirt and cap for $29.95! (Just note code #332 in the

 *Hey, wait a minute! 11:59pm! What are you doing AWAKE? Get in bed and get 
some rest! You're a Marathoner in Training!

 **Also, now that your geared up, why not register for an NYRRC race and get 
acclimatized to the racing experience. Run with others, consume water on the 
go (not necessarily as easy as it looks), and start dress rehearsing for the 
big day. For information on our June favorites, visit www.nyrrc.org.

Attached is the latest weekly report.  You should notice a significant 
increase in forecast by the amount of the Acceleration for each project 
(previously shown as Unapproved trend changes, not included in forecast) 
totaling $21.5 million.   I am currently working with the developers to 
revise the forecast for the ENA expenses for such items as Spare Parts and 
Interconnect Costs.

The report does reflect Nepco payments through June with an Estimate to 
Complete.  However the report does not show actuals by budget line item for 
the NEPCO reimbursables for May (Gleason and Wheatland) or June.   Mike 
Miller and I are currently working with EECC trying to resolve three issues, 
one of which are timely accurate reports. 


Dave,

I did receive an invoice from EECC for the $9 million fee for the 2000 
projects, which I think Mike forwarded to you.  Let me know if I need to 
include the fee, previously pulled out, in the forecast.

Thanks Amy 3-7805"

Today is my last day with the company and with all sincerity, I want to thank 
everyone for making my last 2.5 years so much fun.  It really has been a 
blast and I hope we keep in touch.  As you know, I'll be at Northwestern next 
year so if you're in Chicago, please look me up.  Take care, I wish you guys 
all the best.  Here is my forwarding info, but first...

No Iaia email is complete without a cheesy, Italian quote:
And so I leave you with the immortal words of Francis Albert Sinatra:

""And now, the end is near;
and so I face the final curtin.
I ate it up and spit it out.  
I faced it all and I stood tall;
And did it my way.""  

God bless that guy, anyway, here it is:

iaia14@hotmail.com
518-869-2280

It's been fun. Y'all take care now, y'hear?"

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=

Doc 01.07.02  - Talks about a 15% assessment for as valorem taxes.
Doc 01.07.02.01 - Property tax estimates - estimates from 2001-2019  (tax +
pilot payments) are $1M a year till 2009 and then to ~$1.4 M for next few
years beg 2010, dropping back down to $700K level.

In 2000, the property tax was just $500K, as there seems to be no pilot
payment until Jan 2001.

My questions are -
   Confirm that the 15% assessment in first doc is included in the estimate
   The schdule of estimated payments is all inclusive of the payments
   relating to property taxes
   Refer me to doc that talks about the pilot agreement or any other tax
   abatement docs

Thanks.

I have a couple of items I am working and wanted to know from you.
1.  How will the annoucement of the 55 MW plant in R.I. and the potential 
stake in the 1,650 MW plant in Texas effect the current asset portfolio?
2.  I am working on a spreadsheet identifying all the current and the coming 
on-line merchant MW's in detail.  Can you provide me a detail list of which 
plant assets are merchant or are going to be merchant.

The use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past fe=

years.  As a result the Accounts Payable department has seen a rapid increa=
se=20
in the number of invoices and vendors.  With the higher volume, we have=20
reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle.

Although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual=20
employees, they often mail invoices directly to Accounts Payable.  At times=
=20
they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone.  In thes=
e=20
cases we return the invoice to the vendor.  If the employee is designated, =
we=20
try to track him/her down and forward the invoice.  The high level of=20
employee movement among jobs and locations at Enron has made this=20
increasingly challenging.  Either way, we end up doing something less=20
productive than paying invoices.

To maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessa=
ry=20
for research, we request that employees who have pagers, cell phones, and=
=20
other individually billed items such as licenses, subscriptions, etc., pay=
=20
for them by personal check or charge card (if applicable=01*payment instruc=
tions=20
are usually indicated on the invoice) and request reimbursement through=20
employee expense reports.=20

By submitting these charges on your expense report, you can help us reduce=
=20
the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices, the number of=
=20
checks generated by Treasury, the number of vendors in our database, and th=
e=20
turnaround time for payment of invoices. =20

Incidentally, Accounts Payable is currently installing a corporate-wide=20
web-based expense reporting system similar to what Enron International has=
=20
used for the past year.  This will make it even easier to file your expense=

report and receive quick reimbursement.

We=01,d like to make this effective immediately.  If you have any questions=

Subject: Comparison

My comparison stops at Operating Margin because our analysis is done on a 
pretax basis and the debt service schedule are identical.  The primary 
difference is due to their assumptions with regards to annual merchant sales 
of available capacity after meeting contractual requirements.  We tried to 
value the merchant sales and it dragged down the value of the plants so we 
left it at 0.  Not suprisingly they are more bullish about their ability to 
sale the available electrons.  Take a look at the attachment and if you have 
any questions my cell # is (713)503-3107.  Thanks!

I would add only one thing to the response from Gus.

In regards to #2, neither plant meets the definition of ""industrial activity"" 
under 40 CFR 122.  As a result, neither plant needs an industrial stormwater 
permit.  Both plants were required to obtain construction stormwater permits.

Answers to your Questions:

Both Plants

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

See answers provided by Mitch and Pat. In addition, I offer the following:

Caledonia - There is no specific exemption in the permit for startup and 
shutdown. We tried to request one when we modified the permit for peak firing 
in May. The state told us however, that there is no need to provide a 
specific exemption in the permit and that we can rely on the exemption 
provided in the general rules under (APC-S-1, Section 10.2)

Brownsville - Again, there is no specific exemption for startup and shutdown. 
We are relying on the exemption provided in the general rules under 
regulation 1200-3-20-0.02 which calls for implementation of good management 
practice to minimize emissions during startup and shutdown.

2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?

No. There is no wastewater discharge at either site

Caledonia

3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

We are implementing the recommended EPA protocol for natural gas sampling 
which calls for twice per month the first six months, then once per quarter 
the first six quarters, then semi-annually thereafter. However, since we are 
also required under Part 75 to analyze for the natural gas heat content on a 
monthly basis, I have asked the plant managers to analyze for the sulfur 
content monthly. 

Brownsville

4.  What is the agency's response to the Enron letter regarding the 2nd
stormwater NOV?

We have not received any written correspondence from the agency following the 
second NOV. However, the site was inspected after completion of the 
corrective measures (around June 15) and the state inspector was satisfied 
with the progress made to bring the site into compliance with the stormwater 
construction permit.

5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwater
NOV was never responded to?

I am not aware of any action

6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was that
during construction only or is it ongoing?

I am not aware of anything existing. I believe that this is during 
construction.
Mitchell -- any thoughts on that?

7.  Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping
issue?

Mitchell - Please respond to this question

Thank you for participating in the meeting/conference call yesterday 
afternoon.  I know it was helpful to go through the Synthetic Lease 
assumptions with everyone on board.  I met with Dave yesterday evening and 
briefly discussed his timing (ASAP) on meeting with Joe Sutton and his 
expectations (very high) on the Moore presentation.  I referenced oversizing 
the amount of the Synthetic Lease in order to keep the Canadian banks happy 
on the 90% Enron guarantee.  He agreed that the economics in the dash should 
still reflect the lower actual amount to be drawn down (currently U.S. 
$169MM).  Please note below his requests and delegated responsibilities in 
(brackets) below: 

Dave requested I revise the proposal (Adam) to show add'l NPV and IRR 
comparisons based on MAIN, ComEd and possibly ICF, and a 30 Yr, GENCO 
comparison (Kate).  Given the recent downward shift in some of the curves we 
may need to recompute our existing NPV and IRR #'s also (Kate).  Besides 
furnishing a graph for the referenced curves, I need to submit GENCO's 
capital cost comparison for peakers in the marketplace (Ben).  Further, based 
on the 30 year amortization, I need to show a graph of the build up of the 
components of capacity price and a break even earnings accrual price 
(Miguel).  I will need comparisons from GENCO of these two graphs as well as 
a chart comparing start costs, heat rate and Var. O&M contrasting the Moore 
Project with the GENCO peakers (Don and/or Jynsung or Clement or Ben).  In 
addition, Dave asked to get a Draft copy of the DASH ASAP (Chip).  Dave does 
not want to circulate the DASH for signature until he has met with Sutton. 

Thanks for your help.  
Thomas. "

Subject: Dave Delainey's Additional Requests

As per the presentation with Dave yesterday and a follow up conversation with 
him today, we need the following:

Kate:   Run the model based on the ""break even cost #'s"" in comparison to 
GENCO's #'s assuming a 6 1/2% fixed interest 
  rate. (As per Dave Don Miller's GENCO group should be able to supply us 
with their comparable #'s).
 Also run the model based on MAIN and ECAR curves ( we have already run the 
#'s on Cinergy and West NY).   
 Produce a graph showing the different curves, including ICF-Kaiser.  
 Also show a graph comparing Moore's tariff build up (based on the 30 yr 
curve) for Fixed and Variable O&M,    principal, interest. etc.  (Jonathan 
Hoff should be of great help here).

Miguel:  Get market comps from the Confidential-CSFB study that Don Miller 
has giving Asset Pricing comps for Power   Plants (GENCO related).  Also look 
to get any other market/asset sales info. we showed to Orion.
 Meet with the desk to get the MAIN and ECAR curves Dave has requested we 
run. (for Kate's proforma).  
 Since Miguel is out after Thursday, Adam  should coordinate and follow up in 
Miguel's absence.

He also gave us go ahead for the DASH and RAROC. Kate was cleaning up the 
DASH and the model to pass on to  Underwriting.

Joe D. and Lisa B. are following up on the Syn. Lease structure getting with 
the banks.  

Eric will of course address all the other issues including technical, 
transmission interface, turbine purchase, permitting, etc.

As you know, Dave wanted this done in tandem with all the other development 
projects, which means ASAP.

Thanks, Thomas.

Clement:  We have an add'l issue on the LM  6000's and that is on IDC.  My 
understanding is when we originally structured the sharing of the West LB 
interim interest, we were assuming the turbines would move out of the 
facility to Project Facilities.  Since we have turbines that do not have 
homes, but will continue to incur add'l IDC, we would like to agree on a new 
methodology for accruing IDC per turbine.  We look forward to meeting with 
you soon to discuss this.  Let me know when you are available.  

Thanks, Thomas.

As per my discussions with Billy, there is no problem with Austin being on

and will accrue income, not Fair Value it.  
As to the turbine/West L.B. structure moving forward, I have left a message 
with Bruce Golden recommending in our next meeting we include the 
Procurement/Purchasing agent from NEPCO who would be involved in any 
ancillary purchases.  Additionally, accounting should be represented.

Subject: LM6000 spending vs West LB budget

Ben,

I want to further discuss a few issues that arose from yesterday's LM6000 
budget meeting. When structuring the Acquisition and Development Agreement 
(ADA) for the LM6000s with West LB, a spending budget for major equipment 
purchases was put together and signed off by Mike Miller and Chris Booth 
which included ancillary equipment items, such as transformers but also 
chillers, stacks and compressors, etc, through November 12, 2000. What I 
heard in yesterday's meeting is that related to the LM6000's, NEPCO plans to 
order not just major equipment but smaller items too.   We need to ensure 
that  (1) the ADA as currently drafted allows for non-major items and (2) 
those items have been budgeted. We will get back to you related to (1).   

More generally, accounting has told us that NEPCO cannot pay directly for ANY 
(big or small) hard costs for which it is not reimbursed (this includes items 
for City of Austin until their units and associated ancillary equipment are 
removed from the West LB structure). Specifically, that means NEPCO must  (1) 
have a contract for all of the items (big or small) it plans to purchase on 
behalf of West LB as its acquisition agent (Kay please provide such language 
to Bruce Golden - he has informed me about an SCR LOI out there) and (2) have 
it in the West LB budget.  It would be helpful if CTG could coordinate with 
NEPCO so that all binding LOIs or contracts be reviewed ahead of time by 
accounting and finance to ensure off-balance sheet treatment. 

I will ask my assistant to put together another meeting to further discuss 
the purchase process and that the current West LB budget truly reflects what 
NEPCO plans to purchase on behalf of West LB.

Thanks,
Matt

Heat rates has no impact on numbers. Only increased start charge reduced IRR

""One hundred thousand lemmings can't be wrong."" -- Graffito


3COM DISAPPOINTS
Can a cash-rich balance sheet offset a slowdown in orders?

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

There was a time when 3Com (Nasdaq: COMS) networking equipment
and U.S. Robotics modems meant techie heaven. That time has long
since gone. Citing a shortage of parts and a slowdown in orders
from telco carriers, the company warned that third-quarter
results would come in softer than expected.

3Com is now projecting revenues for the period to come in
between $765 million and $780 million -- more than $100 million
below analyst estimates. A loss of $0.19 to $0.23 a share is
also nearly three times as wide as Wall Street's forecast for an
$0.08 deficit.

3Com had already begun to fade away from the investing community
radar. Once the company completed its spin-off of personal
desktop assistant maker Palm (Nasdaq: PALM) back in July, growth
investors had little reason to stick around. Standard & Poor's
felt the same way. It ditched the company in favor of its Palm
sprout for its S&P 500 Index.

While there are no guarantees, shareholders might take solace in
knowing that 3Com remains cash-rich. With $2.7 billion in cash
and short-term investments, the company is stacked with $7.75 a
share in greenbacks. In theory that should help limit the
downside not much farther below the $9.50 the stock was fetching
in after-hours trading yesterday. But even that may prove to be
knobby-kneed shelter if losses continue to widen. However, 3Com
believes that the carrier orders have simply been put on hold --
not hung up on the receiver. Shareholders better hope that 3Com
is making the right call this time.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

A slowdown in orders will also be taking a toll on Xilinx
(Nasdaq: XLNX) this quarter. The specialty chip maker warned
that it too would be reporting revenues short of analyst
expectations. Like its rival Altera (Nasdaq: ALTR), who had
warned just last week, an inventory backlog will not be a
painless fix.

It's time to pay for play at MP3.com (Nasdaq: MPPP). The popular
digital music site has now unveiled a ""Premier Service"" upgrade
to its existing My.MP3.com listening solution. For $49.95 a
year, users can beam up to 500 CDs to their account and stream
as many as 300 songs in a row without interruption. While the
free service never capped the allowable discs, it did have to be
restarted after playing every 50 selections. So much for the
free music revolution -- though the free basic My.MP3.com
service seems set to continue.

http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=227744

Finland's Nokia (NYSE: NOK) should give the wireless sector a
roaming charge this morning after the top dog announced that it
expects revenues to grow in the 25-35% range through at least
2003. Nokia controls nearly a third of the global wireless
handset market.

While weakness in online advertising is certainly not news
anymore, industry leader DoubleClick (Nasdaq: DCLK) confirmed
the malaise by sending out pink slips yesterday. The layoffs are
minor relative to other realignment sackings -- less than 10% of
its workforce -- but it does confirm the hard times in the realm of
Internet marketing. Brother, can you spare a banner ad click?

The thong throng? According to Bloomberg.com, News Corp. (NYSE:
NWS) and Disney (NYSE: DIS) have received European Council
approval to team up with Brazil's Globosat Programadora for a
joint venture in the latter's home turf. So an Australian media
giant teams up with a stateside titan and a local behemoth to
produce Brazilian television programming -- and Europe nods?
It's a small world after all.

I'm heading into a peaker meeting at 9:00, but will be out in 30 minutes or 
so.  I talked to Jerry this morning and the best time to talk with him is 
this morning before 10:00 our time.  Let's try and talk with him about the 
remaining issues this morning so we can work on them from our end to 
eventually talk with him later today.  Thanks!

Bill:
Here are the two CA's we are currently working off of.  The first one is 
Enron's latest draft and the second one is Cinergy's latest draft.  Enron 
usually does not get into stand-still agreements, but we decided to in this 
case.  We have been exchanging comments for two weeks and now we need to sit 
down and discuss these points from a commercial stand-point to get over these 
differences.  Please give me a call when you get this so we can go through 
these issues.  Thanks for your time with this issue.

Answers to your Questions:

Both Plants

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

See answers provided by Mitch and Pat. In addition, I offer the following:

Caledonia - There is no specific exemption in the permit for startup and 
shutdown. We tried to request one when we modified the permit for peak firing 
in May. The state told us however, that there is no need to provide a 
specific exemption in the permit and that we can rely on the exemption 
provided in the general rules under (APC-S-1, Section 10.2)

Brownsville - Again, there is no specific exemption for startup and shutdown. 
We are relying on the exemption provided in the general rules under 
regulation 1200-3-20-0.02 which calls for implementation of good management 
practice to minimize emissions during startup and shutdown.

2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?

No. There is no wastewater discharge at either site

Caledonia

3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

We are implementing the recommended EPA protocol for natural gas sampling 
which calls for twice per month the first six months, then once per quarter 
the first six quarters, then semi-annually thereafter. However, since we are 
also required under Part 75 to analyze for the natural gas heat content on a 
monthly basis, I have asked the plant managers to analyze for the sulfur 
content monthly. 

Brownsville

4.  What is the agency's response to the Enron letter regarding the 2nd
stormwater NOV?

We have not received any written correspondence from the agency following the 
second NOV. However, the site was inspected after completion of the 
corrective measures (around June 15) and the state inspector was satisfied 
with the progress made to bring the site into compliance with the stormwater 
construction permit.

5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwater
NOV was never responded to?

I am not aware of any action

6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was that
during construction only or is it ongoing?

I am not aware of anything existing. I believe that this is during 
construction.
Mitchell -- any thoughts on that?

7.  Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping
issue?

Mitchell - Please respond to this question"

Ben,
Attached is a revised Confidentiality Agreement which incorporates many of
your suggested changes.  Several additional changes are being made to
address issues associated with the inadvertent erosion of key provisions
benefiting both Enron and Cinergy that resulted from other changes in your
latest drafts.  I assure you that this document with your changes
incorporated is less than what Cinergy has been willing to agree to in the
past.  I look forward to a favorable response so the pressing need for
exchange of documents and further business discussions can proceed
expeditiously.

Attached for your review and approval is the confidentiality agreement 
referenced above.  In accordance with internal policies, I must seek and 
obtain approval from Mark Metts, Mark Haedicke (Lance Schuler has already 
approved of this form on his behalf), and the President of ENA (either Jeff 
Donahue or Tim Detmering may approve on behalf of the President) because the 
attached draft contains both a non-solicitation provision and a standstill 
agreement.  If the attached is acceptable, please indicate your approval in a 
reply to this email.  It is imperative that any approval from Jeff or Tim 
indicate that such approval is given pursuant to their authority to act on 
behalf of the President in these matters.  Should you have any questions, 
please feel free to call (x37493).

Here is the latest ""CA"" with everyone's changes.  I feel that this is pretty 
close to the best we can offer in terms of the stand-still and 
non-solicitation agreements.  Enron usually does not get into stand-still 
agreements, so doing this one was a big step for Enron.  Look forward to

Lance raised a very good point about the value of the standstill to Enron if 
ENA is a signatory to the agreement.  I will call Mark directly to discuss 
this issue but have attempted to highlight it for you in the revised draft.

Please feel free to call with any questions.

Ben,

Per your request, attached is a draft of the above-referenced confidentiality 
agreement.  Be advised that I do not have the authority to sign off on this 
document unless and until I have received approval from Tim Detmering 
(pursuant to his ability to sign off on standstill and non-solicitation 
provisions on behalf of the President of ENA), Mark Metts and Lance Schuler.

Attached is the weekly GenCo model. You might want to start getting familiar 
with it before things get heated up for FPL. We can sit down early next week 
so that I can walk thru with you how the model works and how to update it 
weekly.

Thanks.

Dave:
I talked with the legal guys at Cinergy and after further discussions with 
Mike Cyrus, they felt that since these discussions were at a high level and 
very early in discussions that a ""CA"" at this time was not needed.  There 
were two sticking points that I was trying to get them to backdown from: 1) a 
stand-still agreement and 2) a solicitation agreement.  They were not willing 
to back down from these, thus they concluded with suggesting no ""CA"".  Let me 
know if this is your thoughts as well.  Thanks!

Good to hear from you.  Happy Anniversary.  Arianna is growing everyday.  I
have been working long hours,
so she looks different every time I come home to her and Kati.  Kati is
well, trying to adjust to motherhood and
constantly watching over the baby.  She is off until September 1.  No major
plans for the summer.  Going to
Boston the third week in July for 5 days.  My golf game is barely treading
above water.  Don't play enough.  Such
is life.  Say hello to Megan and your family for me.  I hope we can get
together when you are in town. Until then, go sox.

Jon

Hey Jon;
Just e-mailing to see how everyone is doing.  Megan and I are going over to
Austin to a resort to celebrate our 1st anniversary - I can't believe it.
I've been trying to work on the golf game, but I'm taking a couple of
graduate business courses at night so that keeps me pretty busy on the
weekends as well.  Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.
Go Sox!
Ben

Not sure how you can actualize these prices but here is what I think you were 
asking for...



So if you have 50MW then 50 times $ per MW available for sale.

Mike:
Just a thought regarding Kinder/Morgan.  These guys mainly care about the gas 
pipelines and that some of there projects are actually put on there lines to 
increase throughput.  These plants that they want on their lines are 
currently in construction or development.  Their only operational plants are 
in Colorado.  They have a good generation team, but I fell that they do not 
want to be in the business of operating and maintaining the plants, just as 
long as somebody wants to put them along their lines.  If you guys offered to 
buy their plants and projects, they would mainly care about price (cash and 
stock in the new company) and to put contracts in place for some of their 
projects to put on their lines.  Hope this helps.

Happily situated in London trying to recover from the additional lack of sleep
post flight - all I have to say to y'all (no I don't use that turn of phrase 
in
regular conversation) is that I hope you get some more training in prior to 
the
wedding - after all, losing the second half of July to recovering is not
amenable.  Many thanks for the pics Mark - can't wait to see the rest.

I'm having some issues sleeping.  I've been having the worst nightmares I've
had in years and I wake up about 5 times a night sweating.  I think it's
from those damn pig lips.

Subject: Outstanding Pricing for AES Wolf Hollow

The power option premium pricing was done on 30 MW's, apparently a standard 
product amount. What is the effect on pricing, if any,  for the actual 730 
MW's? Or do we just take 24 of the 30 MW products?
Have we priced the 60/40 split scenario where we can call on the plant 25% of 
the year (effectectively it is a 25 capacity factor), at our option as to 
when we call? We would assume that we'd exercise this in periods/months when 
prices are highest.
For the scenario where the summer hourly power call on-peak is $85 and the 
off-peak summer power call is $25, I came up with a daily, summer-only, 
blended on and off-peak gas call of $7.64/MMBtu. Gas would be at 
index/floating in the winter. The premium for this summer gas call was 
$38,128/month. Bruce, does that seem within the right range?
AES said they need 2 1/2 times more value than the $850,000/month they'd have 
recieved under our initial proposed power premum. Ben is running the model to 
give us a check as to their debt service and FOM costs.

Ben, Bruce, what else do you have outstanding that needs to be run?

Thanks,

Michelle"

Junell,

Thanks for the pictures.  You are the man.  I'll be waiting for the rest of
them.  Make sure to add Ben Rogers to your email distribution.  I cc'ed him
on this so you'd have his address.  I look forward to seeing you at the
wedding shower and the wedding if you can make it.  Thanks again, buddy.

- Bryan

What the hell happened this weekend?  All I can say right now is thank you
to everybody who showed up and made this weekend one of the most fun
memories ever.  And thanks to Miguel and Blake again for organizing
everything; I couldn't have done it without y'all.  Once I can put more full
sentences together, I'll write more.  Thanks again.

I have a meeting with Dave on Monday at 8:30am. We will be bringing the deal
guys (Bill Grealis, Chuck Winger, Art Vivar, myself and possibly one other)
so we're ready to listen and make something shake loose. I am also going to
contact Rich Kinder this week to talk about the possibilities.

I very much appreciate your input and your insight and would welcome your
help when the time is right. As a side note you may have heard that
Madeleine Ludlow has left to pursue other business interests and we are in
the hunt for a corporate CFO and talent as I mentioned is my number one
priority. As to your inclusion in this meeting I will inquire with Dave as
to the attendees and mention your name as a good participant. (Dave's call
obviously). Thanks again....

Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last week.  I left you Rich
Kinder's number on Thursday with your assistant, Sheilla - hope you got it.
Again, I think a deal between or three companies is something to really look
at.
I think it creates a great story to the street.  Kinder/Morgan brings the
growth
story, the gas pipelines for the convergence play and the development team,
Enron brings the MW's and trading and Cinergy brings MW's, trading and
operating
expertise.  I feel that Enron and Cinergy can work togther with regards to
the
trading.  I am sending you an anayst report I just finish reading regarding
generation spinoffs - I think it will be helpful.   Also, Kay Chapman,
Dave's
assistant informed me that you were coming up next week, and I wanted to
know if
you wanted me to be there or not or if you wanted me to prepare anything for
you
for the meeting.

Hope you had a good weekend and I look forward to talking to you soon.

Excellent time! Look forward to keeping it going at the wedding, Elizabeth
will be so impressed. Speaking of keeping it going, our good friend, Mr.
Kimzey, called me last night drunk as rodeo goat at about 10 PM asking me to
go out and party a little bit more. Did I miss something or did we not get
our share this weekend?

Apparently the weekend only caused Bryan to reflect on his current state of
affairs. By chance it was just the welts on his forehead from crushing cans
that caused him to start boozing all by his lonesome yesterday. Or perhaps
he just wanted to enjoy the perks of first class. Let's hope it was the
latter and had nothing to do with the frightful prospect of being a married
man in just 6 weeks.

Oh, by the way, I can assure you all Kimzey has not read a single one of
these emails yet, and likely won't till about noon. Damn slackers over there
at CSFB!

I lost the camera - hopefully you're referring to the silver one in the blue
case? - thanks L.B.!  I had a great time as well, and I still have the
shakes to prove it.

Great weekend - thanks to Miquel for getting us all there and hopefully
Kimzey
will now not miss the wonders of bachelorhood too much.

Found a camera - digital one in 317 - also have the elvis sun glasses - if
the
rightful owner would like to step forward - and yes we know who you are.

Cheers
Nick

I am currently in the process of updating the actuals for May.  At this stage 
in the process the only material changes would be the Nepco reimbursable 
portion of the report.  As some of you know Jody Pierce and Theresa Vos 
performed a review of actuals to date.  Hence, I have been waiting for a 
revised invoices that would true-up actuals and forecast for the projects, 
before updating the projects reports.  As of today, I still have not received 
Invoices and therefore the May cash curve forecasted payment was not made.  

As I am currently going though the month end close process I am having to 
update the report.  I should have updates by early next week.   If you have 
any questions, please call.  Thanks Amy 3-7805

Subject: Question 2


More Questions:

Both Plants

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

Start-up emissions vary and can not accurately be measured due to the 
inherent delay time in the CEMS system.  Additionally, start-up emissions are 
not required to be and in fact were not measured during the stack testing.  
There are no limitations on emissions during start-up evolutions, since the 
permits at both plants allow exceptions to exceedences during start-ups and 
shutdowns.

2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?


Caledonia

3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?


Brownsville

4.  What is the agency's response to the Enron letter regarding the 2nd
stormwater NOV?



5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwater
NOV was never responded to?

6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was that
during construction only or is it ongoing?

7.  Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping
issue?

Regarding my conversation with John Garrison on the GE 7FA costs.

Delivery:  '00-'01  Cost:  $36.0 MM
Delivery:  '98-'99  Cost:  $34.250 MM
Delivery:  '96-'97  Cost:  $32.0 MM 
Delivery:  '95-'97  Cost:  $30.0 MM

It looks like that for every year and a half the costs go up approx. $2.0 
MM.  The next available order for GE 7FA's is 3rd qtr. 2003.

On second thought, please forward this, along with the gas volume info., to 
the appropriate parties at Cinergy.  Please send the below as opposed to the 
previous version.  I've made changes pursuant to my conversation with Zisman.

Responses to Cinergy's Gas Transport Questions

Brownsville
1)  Verify Type of Transportation Service and Identify location of 2 hour 
notice.
Transportation is provided  under  ITS Service Agreement Contract No. 10290 
.  This contract  is ANR's  pro forma ITS Agreement from its FERC Gas 
Tariff.  Changes to the pro forma  are included in the various rate letters 
(most recent dated September 20, 2000), the Operating Agreement (dated March 
31, 1999) and the Additional ANR Transportation Service letter (dated March 
30, 1999).  These three agreements were assigned to Brownsville Power I, LLC 
per the Assignment Agreement dated December 1, 1999.  

Specific to the question of the two hour notice, Brownsville's rights are 
identified in the Operating Agreement under Article 1 on page 2 of the 
agreement (See Articles 1.01, 1.02 and 1.03).  ANR's two hour notice rights 
are also identified under Article 1 (See 1.05).  Please note that ANR's two 
hour notice right is subject to the plant having taken delivery of gas 
volumes per Articles 1.01, 1.02 and 1.03.

2)  On ETS Conversion right, is ETS service seasonal or annual?
The seasonality of the conversion is not addressed under the Additional 
Transportation Letter dated March 30, 1999.  ANR's FERC Gas Tariff does not 
preclude a seasonal application of the ETS service.  
3)  Provided gas volumes burned at plant.
To be provided under separate cover.

Caledonia
1) Identify location of FT-BH rights in transaction documents (FT-A Contract).
Transportation is provided  under  Gas Transportation Agreement Service 
Package No. 29230.  This contract  is TGP's  pro forma Agreement from its 
FERC Gas Tariff.  Changes to the pro forma  are included in the Firm 
Transportation Discount Letter dated April 7, 1999.  Additional 
transportation rights negotiated by Caledonia, such as FT-BH (page 4) and the 
FT-A replacement contract (page 5), are included in a letter dated March 31, 
1999 titled ""Commercial agreement with:  CALEDONIA POWER I, L.L.C., Natural 
Gas Transportation"". 
2) Identify location of 4.5 Bcf/yr obligation in transaction documents (FT-A 
Contract).
This provision is included in the  Firm Transportation Discount Letter dated 
April 7, 1999 (See page 2 and 3, Article 3).
3) Provide gas volumes burned at the plant.
To be provided under separate cover.

Megan will be at the wedding that weekend, but I will not be able to make 
it.  Megan is going to spend most of July up in New York.  How is the 
fundraising business going?  I heard that Clinton's fundraiser tonight will 
bring in $23 million which will be $2 Mil. more than George W., which would 
be pretty impressive.

I got your message this morning.  Since we were so successful in selling some 
of our peaking plant last time, we have decided to some some more - so we are 
running like crazy to close these deals this year.  I want to let you know 
that I talked to both people at KinderMorgan and Cinergy about your company 
and the types of transactions that you guys are doing.  I have not had the 
chance to follow up, but plan to real soon.  I just tried to call you about 
10 minutes ago, thus the e-mail response.  I will try again in a little bit.  
Hope all is going well and I'll talk to you soon.

Don,

Tom and I had a quite good meeting with ICF staff yesterday. Although they 
did not show us actual mathematical formula, Tom is a lot more comfortable 
with ICF methodology. Their definition of capacity price and energy price is 
a little different from traditional concept. Tom will write summary memo and 
we can sit down Wednesday morning (9 or 10am). Another outcome is that we can 
go over ICF's assumption about O&M, financing, etc, and request more 
information as it is needed.

Are you available 9 or 10 am tomorrow? Thanks.

Great PICS.  When do you get back?  I want to see if we can get together up 
in NYC or DC with OB and Mike.  I will be in the Hamptons for July 4th 
weekend.  It's starting to get hot down here in Houston.  Things are going 
well.  I have moveed into a new group (Enron's M&A Group) - were looking at 
some interesting deals.  We are looking at taking a company public which I 
may go work for if I can get enough equity in the deal.  The other thing that 
might happen is finally going to my pops company at a much higher position 
than I am at now, which would be great, but I would be in Ohio, booooooo.  
That way Megan and I could buy a house and potential go and get an executive 
MBA from Kellog, but these are all scenarios and if any of these play out I 
would be amazed.  My golf game is ok, but my training is starting to get 
better.  I did see that none of us made the NYC Marathon on the first go 
around.  Did you see that Jon and Kati had their baby-I didn't even know she 
was pregnant.  Shit were getting old!!!!!!!!!!   Hope all is going well and 
I'll see ya.

This morning, we announced an offer to acquire London-based MG plc, one of=
=20
the world=01,s leading metals marketers, for $446 million.  We have been=20
monitoring the global metals market for several years, and we believe that=
=20
now is the right time to enter this $120 billion market.  We are confident=
=20
that our successful business model, which we have proven in the natural gas=
=20
and electricity markets, gives us a tremendous advantage in a market that i=
s=20
undergoing fundamental change.

Our offer to acquire MG plc has been unanimously recommended by MG plc=01,s=
=20
board of directors, and we expect to close the transaction by early third=
=20
quarter of this year, following shareholder and customary regulatory=20
approvals.

MG plc is a leading independent company in global non-ferrous metals tradin=
g=20
and marketing and the only such company that is publicly traded. =20
Headquartered in London with major offices in New York and Frankfurt, MG pl=
c=20
has 330 employees in 14 countries.  It is the world=01,s leading copper=20
merchant, one of the top three merchants of copper concentrates and nickel,=
=20
and a leading European merchant of recycled metal.  Other products that MG=
=20
plc markets include aluminum, lead, tin, zinc, brass and stainless steel.

This transaction provides Enron with access to new customers and enables=20
cross-marketing opportunities.  We plan to sell Enron energy products to MG=
=20
plc customers and offer bundled products combining metals and power=20
outsourcing.  Enron will help producers and consumers manage the risks=20
inherent in volatile raw materials and energy markets, and we will improve=

commodity prices for both buyers and sellers.

MG plc=01,s existing market-making capabilities and market knowledge provid=

Attached is the JV Term Sheet that was originally drafted by Lance which I 
have revised in the following ways:

1)  The concept of having 25% of the aggregate consideration supported by a 
letter of credit or otherwise payable in cash has been added.
2)  The bracketed questions/comments relating to (1) Purchaser's potential 
ability to effect a tax free contribution without requiring the establishment 
by the issuer of a holding company and (2) the request for confirmation about 
non-compete arrangements and development opportunities, have been deleted 
[JORDAN - PLEASE ADVISE IF THIS IS PROBLEMATIC]
3)  The Doyle and Calumet facilities have been removed from Annex A
4)  The entity names for the Wheatland and Lincoln Sites have been inserted.

Please call asap with any questions or comments

Peakers delivered to you and Clement.  You should receive them within the

The New Power Company, the first national residential and small business 
energy service provider in deregulated
markets was launched today with strategic investors and partners including 
Enron, IBM and America Online.

H. Eugene Lockhart has been named President and Chief Executive Officer of 
the company.  He was formerly President
of AT&T Consumer Services and Chief Marketing Officer of AT&T, as well as 
President of Bank America's Global Retail
Bank and President and CEO of MasterCard International.  Lockhart is joined 
by a number of high-level executives from
the telecommunications and financial services sectors as well as several 
former Enron executives specializing in energy
commodity pricing, marketing, risk management and government regulatory 
affairs.   

The former Enron employees include Jim Badum, formerly Managing Director of 
Consumer Services at EES, John Henderson, 
formerly Vice President of Retail Risk Management for EES, Dave Eichinger, 
formerly Vice President of Corporate Development
for Enron Corp., and Kathleen Magruder, formerly Vice President of Government 
Affairs for Enron Corp.  Lou Pai, Chairman and
CEO for EES will serve as non-executive Chairman of The New Power Company. 

Enron will provide The New Power Company with energy commodity pricing, risk 
management, and government/
regulatory affairs.  Ken Lay is quoted in the news release, ""We've studied 
the residential and small business market
for several years and believe this is the optimal way to provide value to 
these customers.  By assisting in setting up
an independent company, Enron is able to leverage its core competencies of 
energy and risk management, while
partnering with other industry leaders to give The New Power Company 
extraordinary and immediate depth and
capability.""  Ken will also serve on the Board of Directors.

The New Power Company is scheduled to initially provide service in 
Pennsylvania and New Jersey in the second half
of 2000.  The company will be headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut, with 
some operations in Houston.

There is only one quarterly report required for Brownsville. This is the EPA 
electronic data report (EDR) which we generate from the CEMS system and 
submit electronically to the EPA. 

Mitchell - Since you are generating the 3rd quarter reports to the EPA today, 
would you please copy Ben on the submittal. Thanks.

Don:  your list doesn't reference Ben J's request for Chicago:  based on LM 
6000's and the ABB's.  I know we have not been able to sit down with Clement 
to extrapolate on what he already has on Chicago (MAIN).  

BenT & Ben R:  let's get together heat rates for each of the referenced 
plants (there should be very little variable with inlet chilling on the LM's) 
but I have very little info on the West Coast projects.

Subject: ICF

I have scheduled a call at 10:00 Houston time on Monday to talk with ICF 
about a new curve for LV, Pastoria, Louisiana, Florida and Missouri.  They 
have said that they can get a preliminary curve to us within 3-5 days with a 
full market study to follow.  For this, they have ask for $95M.  They usually 
charge $37,500 per region, and usually give us a 12% discount for a total of 
$33,000.  So in their minds, they are shaving off $70M from the standard 
discounted price. 

Let's talk before the call if at all possible. We need to be in a position to 
give them the go ahead on Monday, if we are comfortable with the proposal.  
Otherwise, we risk not getting the results until the following week.

Thanks,

Don

Don:  your list doesn't reference Ben J's request for Chicago:  based on LM 
6000's and the ABB's.  I know we have not been able to sit down with Clement 
to extrapolate on what he already has on Chicago (MAIN).  

BenT & Ben R:  let's get together heat rates for each of the referenced 
plants (there should be very little variable with inlet chilling on the LM's) 
but I have very little info on the West Coast projects.    
Thanks, Thomas.

I have scheduled a call at 10:00 Houston time on Monday to talk with ICF 
about a new curve for LV, Pastoria, Louisiana, Florida and Missouri.  They 
have said that they can get a preliminary curve to us within 3-5 days with a 
full market study to follow.  For this, they have ask for $95M.  They usually 
charge $37,500 per region, and usually give us a 12% discount for a total of 
$33,000.  So in their minds, they are shaving off $70M from the standard 
discounted price. 

Let's talk before the call if at all possible. We need to be in a position to 
give them the go ahead on Monday, if we are comfortable with the proposal.  
Otherwise, we risk not getting the results until the following week.

Thanks,

Don

Mitch,

I spoke with Chris Meyer.  He said that hey should have asked for more 
detail, but only asked for total gas volumes moved.  As a first cut, let's go 
back with total volumes in 1999 and 2000 (broken out separately).  They may 
come back wanting more detail, but this will serve as a start.

Thanks,

Clement,

I do not believe that Ozzie has given his two copies of the summary info to 
FPL yet. If not, let's get them back and make these changes plus the changes 
that to the summary chart that you discovered.

Thanks,

Mike,
I was speaking to Sam and he had two comments to the Pastoria document that 
Don Miller is preparing.  Sam wanted to change two items in the Estimated 
Timetable:

1)  Change ""Start of Construction"" to ""Start of Construction and Engineering""
2)  Change Testing date from December 2002 to January 2002.

 As far as Georgia is concerned, we should have a total of five dots on the 
state.  The Doyle project actually needs to be changed to ""In Operation"" as 
it is now going through its run tests.  The Athens, GA site should be labeled

I talked with Thomas Suffield and he wants Miguel Vasquez to run the numbers 
on the Florida model., since they have been running numbers on the Plano 
model for a little while now.  I walked Miguel through what I had done and 
how they should look at running the model, based on what Thomas found out and 
what you have said in the past.  I also gave them the numbers that the desk 
has given based on the simple cycle case (5 year number) and combine-cycle 
case (5 year number).  From this they have modeled and graphed these 
different scenarios.  I also worked on getting a bid and ask from the desk, 
but you may need to talk to Berney because they are not giving out the ask at 
this time.  
Hope this helps and please give me a call if you have any questions. Thanks

Hi Benjamin,

Winston Cheng asked me to forward to you the attached schedule of development 
projects for the west.  Note that these projects are not firm - for example, 
most have not got firm site commitments etc.  No doubt, many of the projects 
are expected to fall through or be terminated for one reason or another.

Cheers

Christian

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

Normally, there is a short period during startup when the NOx goes to 
approximately 35 ppm.  This is very short in duration and occurs while the 
gas turbine is loading.  Our site is permitted to normally operate between 
70-100% turbine load.  These emissions have subsided within the few minutes 
required to attain 70% load.  Our permit constraints require that we do not 
exceed our emissions limits on a 3 hour rolling avarage.  Therefore these 
short-term startup emissions are not an issue.  

CO is a calculated value.  I do not have short-term CO2 numbers at present.  
However, I don't believe they are at issue since they are related to excess 
air which is pretty high during startup.

There is a condition called lean-lean firing which can and has occured from 
time to time.  A transition takes place above 40MW when the nozzle gas 
arrangement normally goes to a firing state called ""premix steady state.""  If 
this transition fails for some reason, the machine goes into a lean-lean 
state and the NOx level can rise to 40-50 ppm.  The turbine activates and 
operator alarm when this happens.  We can count the number of occurances that 
this has happened on one hand at Caledonia.  When this conditions occurs, the 
operators correct the condition by reducing the load to about 35MW and then 
increase the load again.  Typically this resolves the faulty transition and 
it configures the nozzles correctly on the second attempt.



2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?

No industrial stormwater permit is required at Caledonia.



3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

The fuel sampling schedule for both sulphur content and heating value at 
Caledonia is once per month.



Regards,

Pat Cathers

BEn,


Here is the schedule I currently have for TECO. Would you mind having a look 
and telling me if it takes into account the debt reserve?
thanks

Ben:

Thomas Suffield has determined, through discussions with our accounting 
group, the project cost methodology used for our Genco assets. Unless there 
is a compelling reason, we need to conform your Florida model to this model 
as (i) it is already an accepted methodology used by the organization, (ii) 
it is used as the basis upon which we determine accrual income for our 
existing merchant portfolio, and (iii) it will result in more favorable cost 
profile in terms of $/kW month than other methodologies.

Please let me know if you have any issues relative to this approach. If not, 
please adjust the Florida model and provide me with the results which Mike 
and I need to present to Delainey on Friday. It would also be helpful to have 
the bid and ask from the desk (5 yr. term) for this presentation. Lastly, 
FYI, we have released ICF Kaiser to prepare a forecast specific to the LM6000 
configuration (6x and w/wo a 74.9mW steam turbine), which we can then use to 
compare to the forecasted cost basis of your model.

Thanks,

Ben"

Question 1

Case 1 at 20F and 60% RH CTG would have net unit output of 46,726 kW at a 
heat rate of 10,183 Btu/kWhr HHV new & clean
Case 2 at 90F and 54% RH CTG would have net unit output of 43,220 kW at a 
heat rate of 10,804 Btu/kWhr HHV new & clean

Case 1 has gas compression, no chilling/heating, Case 2 has gas compression 
and chilling. Both cases include simple cycle CTG aux and expected steup 
transformer losses. Back pressure is based on 14"" HRSG.

Question 2

For case 2, Sprint water injection is 1915 lb/hr +/1 20%, we are also water 
injecting for NOx control 21,981 lb/hr so total is 23,896 lb/hr. Currently 
cannot Sprint with DLE combustor.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Mark Frevert and Mark Haedicke

Don:

Thomas and or Mike may have already asked you this, but I want to make sure 
we're all on the same page (or determine if I'm not). In order to support the 
greenfield merchant decision making process for '01, we need price forecasts 
for the following locations / configurations:

1. Florida - 6 - LM6000s in simple cycle mode; 6 - LM 6000s plus a 74.9MW 
steam turbine in combined cycle mode
2. St. Charles Parrish, LA (south of N.O.) 6 - LM6000s in simple cycle mode
3. Chicago area: 2 - ABB 11N2s in simple cycle mode; 6 - LM 6000s in simple 
cycle mode
4. Ameren / AEC interface, Missouri - 6 - LM 6000s in simple cycle mode

Please let us know as to how we should proceed in order to obtain these 
forecasts as soon as possible. Perhaps Thomas can take the lead in dealing 
with the consultants after you make the intro...

Thanks much,

Ben"

Clement,

Here is the first run on the FPL Map and Excel grid.  I found some additional 
plant information on the FPL home page, and I aligned the presentations with 
the home page as my main source.  

I plotted the locations by city and net MW, because that was in the key to 
the Enron asset page.  Please let me know if you would like me to change it 
to plant name.  Also, there are several wind projects in the cities of 
Altamont and Tehachapi, CA.  I totaled the projects' net MW and listed them 
under their respective city.  

Finally, the only pages that I altered on the PowerPoint presentation were 
the map pages.  The rest of the presenation is still in the Reliant format.  

Regards,

Ben

Dave:
 I was talking with my brother-in-law who is Kinder/Morgan's VP of Corp 
Development and they would be interested in talking with us about 
contributing their 5,000 MW's of generation into a JV/Partnership to lead 
into a public offering.  We are still under several different CA's with them, 
due to our past conversation's regarding generation.  
 With our previous discussions, Rich Kinder had suggested to Kevin Hannon if 
Enron would be interested in buying the whole Orion  Project, but at that 
time ENA was only interested in the first couple of projects, due to the 
delivery of the turbines.  
 In light of our past discussions and KMI's desire to exit the generation 
business, this JV would give them the perfect ""exit strategy"".  Also, it 
would give us a better growth strategy, with respects to our talks with other 
parties.  I know that bringing in a potential third party would complicate 
the deal structure, but I think that it would build a much better growth 
story to Wall Street.
 If you think this would be a good idea, I can begin to set up a meeting as 
soon as possible with Kinder/Morgan.  Thanks!  
Ben

Hey, sorry its been a little while but I've been traveling and keeping some 
late hours on these generation projects.  With regards to UT, I am going to 
stay at Enron for another year.  I feel that the thing that hurt me from 
getting in the schools I wanted to get into were my undergraduate grades.  So 
I have decided to take a couple of graduate level finance courses this summer 
and re-apply next year.  Actually, I'll apply to Columbia this Sept to get 
into their January program, which goes for a year and half.  

So lets get together for lunch before you head off for B-school this summer.  
Talk to you soon.

Attached is a revised and updated 2000 Weekly Cost Report.  Please review the 
changes, which I have summarized below, and call if you have any questions.  
Thanks Amy 3-7805

1.  For the Wilton and Gleason projects,  the Current Forecast was overstated 
by the amounts paid to Nepco on April the 28th.  This resulted in a 
significant erroneous variance of about $27 million.  In other words, I 
didn't reduce the forecast by the amount of the payment.

2. The unapproved Acceleration Scope change on Lincoln, approximately $14 
million , has been broken out separately to be consistent with the other 2 
projects as a separate variance explanation.

3.  The EECC Fixed Fee of $3 million per project has been removed from both 
the Original Budget and Current Forecast. as requested by Dave Delainey."

FYI--I called Jay Hopper and told him that our own backlog of LM-6000 
projects had priority in terms of tolling agreements.  Given our existing 
backlog of such projects, I would not presently be in position to offer a 
tolling agreement to KN's project in the pricing range that KN was seeking. "

Ben,
Here is a real quick estimate on the info you gave me on this ""Synthetic CC 
Plant"".  Consider the error to be about +-25% with this quick a turn around.
I will be on vacation next week, if you can wait for the next go around until 
I return on the 15 May, your welcome to call Scot Chambers at 68371.
Regards,
Rich

Here are the new Plano numbers and the revised Homestead numbers.  Please 
only use these for discussion and model purposes and not with client 
conversations.  These are all indicative cost numbers.  Give me a call if you

Subject: Plano vs Homestead

Ben



This is a revised Plano we did late yesterday. It was adjusted from Lowell, 
Mass Nepco estimate and we changed format to more closely match  Homestead 
form.

Biggest differences 'tween original Plano and original Homestead were:

Homestead had dual fuel     +4M
Homestead had additional piling and foundation bulks  +1.8M
Homestead was connecting to a complicated t-line config +1.5M
Homestead had an FPL substation    +5M
Homestead did not need as much gas pipeline    -2.1M
Homestead used 6% margin     +4.4M
Homestead had lower capacity due to additional chilling  +1.5% (not capital 
cost but does change $/kW)

Differences from original Plano to new Plano is that Nepco has estimated a 
union job for Lowell. This impacts indirects upward by about $5M and 
construction up above my earlier guesstimate by about $4M. I had doubled the 
cost per manhour which Nepco also did but additionally they added manhours 
for productivity loss. Additionally I moved new Plano margin to 6%.

New Homestead went up due to raw water pretreatment and first stage RO but we 
dropped the substation cost so total estimated cost went down by a coupla of 
million.

Numbers still just should be used for screening, no commitment. 

These summaries should not be passed around.

This sure sounds like a deal Len Gunderson was looking at early this year and 
a large chemical facility. The capacity for the project did not match what 
equipment it was based on - any more details so I can see if we have any data 
from that earlier look?

Maybe the message is garbled but 4 7FA's and 2 STG's (probably two 2 X 1 
CCGT's) should be nominally $470,000,000 based on the Pittsburg CCGT out in 
California (but includes no real EPC contractor margin/contingency so will 
not match what Nepco or other third parties might bid), would nominally be 
480 MW at 95F for each 2 X 1 so about 960 MW for all. I think this works out 
to about $489/kW. This based on about $34,000,000 for each GE7FA so pricing 
will adjust if market price higher or lower.

I honestly don't and have not seen a 501G price. I did see 701G prices in 
Asia and they appeared to be about 5% lower per kilowatt than 701F and 
GE9FA's. In this hot market they maybe at a premium due to better heat rate 
and larger unit size. I would suggest $515/kW as a go by. I have called John 
Garrison to see what current pricing and delivery is - also to see if 
performance might be a touch better than our maybe two year old model. Do we 
want to get an estimate from Nepco or a benchmark from my estimator's? I 
would need a charge number/tasking letter.

I spoke with CIPCO today on our proposal submitted on 4/28/00 and they are 
initially interested in what we put together (i.e. 2 GE-7EA's) with right to 
substitute technology as long as overall project economics are not impacted.

They will be meeting with their consultants tomorrow (5/5/00) to come up with 
a list of questions to help develop a short list.

Assuming we make it to a short list, then we will be asked to come to Iowa to 
meet with their generation planning team.

All of this should play out over the next 3-4 weeks.


(Also, please note that we are looking at this as a way to substitute 3 
LM-6000's for the two EA's and keep the heat rate spread.  A plant at CIPCO 
also is an OPPD workout.  We have a site under option in Iowa that is into 
Mid-Am 345Kv and Alliant/CIPCO.

Ben,

I have put together a quick estimate of the adder to get from the ""two 7EA 
open cycle peaker configuration"" to the ""2x1 combined cycle configuration"", 
adding the two HRSGs and 100 Mw steam turbine along with extra BOP equipment. 
The estimate was quick and is therefore +/- 20% accuracy. Beyond this 
accuracy, we would need a tasking letter.

Your CIPCO Proforma for EPC costs of two 7EAs Open Cycle = $57,580,000 or 
$378.82/Kw

The rough cost estimate (+/-20%) of the 2x1 Combined Cycle  = $130,336,000 or 
$493.70/Kw
 (See Attached Analysis)

The estimated adder for conversion to 2x1 Combined Cycle is therefore:

   $130,336,000
   -$ 57,580,000
   ____________
Estimated Adder is =  $72,756,000      +/- 20% 

Hope this data is sufficient for your needs. Please call me at ext 67958 if 
you need any clarification beyond the attached.

Looks like a 2 X 1 MHI 501G plant would produce about 684MW plant net output 
at a heat rate of 6684 Btu/kWhr net new&clean. 

Still looking for capital cost.

Subject: Question 2


More Questions:

Both Plants

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?

Caledonia

3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

Brownsville

4.  What is the agency's response to the Enron letter regarding the 2nd
stormwater NOV?

5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwater
NOV was never responded to?

6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was that
during construction only or is it ongoing?

7.  Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping
issue?

Basic summary for Teco:

Still working with Finance Group to come up with different finance structures.
Working with Insurance group (weather desk) to wear the risk of the project, 
since the Power desk will not wear that type of risk.
Pricing of the put, call and spread option values is still not finalized, 
because Kevin Presto has said that he does not put much value into these 
plants in Eastern PJM
Don Black is beginning to look at other companies for his price risk 
management product.  
He feels he will not be able to get a deal done with Teco at this point in 
time.

Let me know if this is suffient for your analysis.

Good to hear from you!  It's been a while.  I am also going to work for 
another year.  My undergrad grades were what held me back.  I have already 
enrolled in a summer graduate finance course for the summer.  How Fun!  I am 
also retaking the GMAT.  But what I am looking forward to is kicking your ass 
in the NYC Marathon since I signed up and will hopefully get in.  Megan will 
is almost done with school and will be spending most of July in NY.  So I 
will be coming up to NYC quite a bit this summer.  Would you be interested in 
going out to Colorado this summer to play some great golf.  They have some 
fantastic courses.  Other than that - work is going really well and Enron 
stock and company culture is really getting noticed by Wall Street, which is 
great for future job opportunities.  I'm playing a lot of tennis, golf anf 
basketball as of late and its been quite fun.  Hope all is going well and 
lets get together when you get back.  See ya soon.

Team,

I finally got a chance to talk to Entergy about their merchant peaker in 
their own service territory.  Specifics are as follows:

Configuration: 4 x GE 7EA's at 72 - 73 MW each because of elevation and 
humidity levels.
Location: Vicksburg, MS sharing a site with the Baxter Wilson plant (1320 MW 
coal/gas fired boiler)
HHV: 12,200 btu/kwh
Pipe: A new intra-state that will be shared with the Baxter Wilson plant.  
Existing sources are Koch and Duke.
Start date: 7/01
Permits: PSD permit at 9 ppm.  No run hour limitation.
Taxes: Fee in lieu of taxes at 1/3 cost for first ten years.  Full property 
taxes thereafter.  Entergy claims this is the same deal Ben Jacoby got for 
our peaker in MS.

First we need to model a pro-forma of plant operating costs using estimates 
of FOM and VOM from internal sources.
Second, we need to calculate spread option valuations of the underlying plant 
for 20-years using curve, vol and correlation assumptions acceptable to the 
desk.
Thirdly and based on 20-year plant valuations, I need to create a debt 
service schedule.
Finally, we have to price the put option premium and sensitivities using the 
research/structuring model.

Any questions, please call me at 3-4750.

regards,

Don"

Hey Ben,

How is life in Texas?  Have you met that guy Rob McDonald I know from DC?
He is good friends with my cousin Eddy Quinn.  Life has gotten rather boring
out here. We have a ton of work to do and work long hours with no days off.
This work style in the beginning made time fly but recently the monotony of
the routine has gotten mundane.  We all live for port calls and push the
envelope of ethical billing while in port.  I have been shot down by every
school I applied for.  How about you?  They can all blow me as I would
probably outperform all of those faggots with high GMATs.  That has been my
achilles heel.  Right now I am focused on the summer and getting off this
ship.

I hope I get in the marathon because I have been training for so long.
There is nothing else to do except that in my free time.  If I don't have a
goal to shoot for then I could never keep up this training on land.  The
summer will be the hardest because I am going to want to travel and visit
people when I get back.  Any plans to be in NY this summer?

I have been messing around with stocks too.  I have made only a little since
the tech crash.  I stay away from those Internet companies so I didn't get
killed.  See you in the summer.

CHOB"

Jim:
Scott and I are working with Kinder/Morgan on pricing a 3 year deal off of 
one of their facilities.  These are the facilities that we looked at late 
last year for buying 2 of their plants.  The plants have a configuration of: 
6 LM 6000's, 2 GE 7EA's and steam turbine.  They are able to run in at peak, 
swing and base load levels very easily.  They are looking for a 3 year  term 
deal for 510 MW's, with $1.00 VOM and Heat Rate of 8,531 located in Little 
Rock, ARK..  Pricing starts June 02 and goes to Cal. 04.  Anyway, I want to 
know if you guys are able to meet tomorrow at 2:00pm to talk about pricing up 
this deal.   It should only take about 15-25 minutes.  Thanks for your time.

Regards,
Ben

Attached are the master indices for the peakers.  I combined the old project 
indices from Rippy with the Deal Bench indices.  I've gone through the files 
for Brownsville and Caledonia and tied them to the indices.  I'll update 
these periodically as the Deal Bench indices change.

I am working with Kinder/Morgan on pricing a 3 year deal off of one of their 
facilities.  These are the facilities that we looked at late last year for 
buying 2 of their plants.  The plants have a configuration of: 6 LM 6000's, 2 
GE 7EA's and steam turbine.  They are able to run in at peak, swing and base 
load levels very easily.  They are looking for a 3 year  term deal for 510 
MW's, with $1.00 VOM and Heat Rate of 8,531 located in Little Rock, ARK..  
Pricing starts June 02 and goes to Cal. 04.  Anyway, I want to know if you 
guys are able to meet tomorrow at 2:00pm to talk about pricing up this 
deal.   It should only take about 15-25 minutes.  Thanks for your time.

Attached is a short form estimate I had on Pittsburg which is a 2 X 1 GE7FA 
plant. Also included is Linden 6 (which is a 7FA with an HRSG supplying steam 
to an existing facility, i.e. no steam turbine). Pittsburg is an outdoor 
plant so should represent a fairly competitive deal.



I also have some place a 1 X 1 that we just got on Coyote Springs.

Ben

Roughly speaking if you use absorption chilling, you would save (at max 
summer conditions) maybe 1.2 MW per LM or about 2.5% on capacity which would 
be nominally a 2.5% improvement in heat rate. To get this you need a source 
of steam. For Lowell, we possibly could get steam from UAE (I don't know how 
the transaction would work). We would need about 180,000 lb/hr of steam at 
least at 15 psig. The chillers would cost about $400,000 total more than the 
mechanicals we have discussed.

If UAE can't supply the steam, then we would need small HRSG's behind each 
CTG and would most likely also try and steam injection for NOx control. Heat 
rate would improve by maybe 6-7%, plant net output would increase by maybe 2 
MW per LM. Capital cost would grow by maybe $8,000,000 (this is wild guess, 
we did get HRSG quotes for this steam injection/absorption version but have 
not done a detailed capex).

Greetings, Mr. Rogers

My apologies for the delay in responding to your last inquiry - but the
entire TEXASMBA Admissions Team is still intently focused on the still
remaining pool of fall 2000 applicants requiring consideration for this
year's class.

However, let me briefly respond to your note by suggesting that you also
address one of the more visible point of need in your competitive admission
profile -- that being your GMAT.  I believe you had indicated previously
that you chose not to utilize GMAT's services and accommodations for
non-standard test takers such as yourself.   I suggest you consider the
merits of changing your position in this decision.

As one of the competitive points of consideration within your application
profile, it could be to your benefit to address your currently
non-competitive score by accepting GMAT's accommodations.   I suggest you
request a copy of GMAT's ""Supplement for Testing with Disabilities"" for
additional insights into the nature and personal acceptability of these
accommodations.

Best wishes as you again consider your options.

Carl

Dr. Harris:
     In my pursuit to strengthen my application profile for next year I have
explored taking two graduate level night courses this summer and I wanted to
know what courses the admissions committee would suggest that I take this
summer.  I wanted to make sure that I was taking the courses that were most
appropriate with regards to my application. Just to let you know, I was
planning
on taking two finance courses.  Thanks in advance for your suggestion with
this
matter.
     I was in Austin yesterday for the completion of the MS 150 Bike ride,
but
was not able to stick around.  Hope all is going well and hope to hear from
you

Please review and lets discuss Monday (I am off tomorrow).  I have a rough
consensus on this but I am waiting to circulate it following our discussion.

Check out the new item on gas imbalance risk and see if it works.  I did not 
go
to 5.5 years (through 2006), but that would help our case.  Also I tried to
quantify the capital I want to have at risk at the end of the 4.5 year toll.
Hope this helps you evaluate other alternatives.

If you have comments tomorrow I'll review them over the weekend and make
changes.  Thanks.

NOTE:  We also need to know if you are going to move ahead on Ameren.  Your
comments to date on size make me think Enron is 50/50.  Please let me know 
asap.

PEPSI FINALLY WINS QUAKER
PepsiCo will wed Quaker for $13.4 billion in stock.

By Tom Jacobs

Ending weeks of maneuvering and speculation, PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP)
has agreed to buy Quaker Oats (NYSE: OAT) for $13.4 billion in
stock. Pepsi matched its deal of one month ago of 2.3 shares per
Quaker share, valuing Quaker at $97.46 per share, based on
Pepsi's Friday close at $42.38. Quaker ended Friday at $88.63.

The deal follows weeks of machinations that began with a
rejected Pepsi bid for Quaker, followed by interest from
Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and France's Groupe Danone (NYSE: DA) --
reportedly at a price more than $14 billion. With the departure
of Coke and Groupe Danone from negotiations, attention returned
to Pepsi,whose original lower offer now looked darn good to
almost-left-at-the-altar Quaker.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=225166
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=225167

The pact creates a food and beverage powerhouse with $25 billion
in revenues and an expected $80 billion market cap. The deal
gives Pepsi three key advantages: 1) Pepsi swigs Quaker Oats'
Gatorade sports drink, which is tops in its market and carries a
huge distribution and warehouse system that Pepsi hopes will
increase efficiency and reach for its Tropicana brand; 2)
Quaker's fruit, oatmeal, and granola bar and other snack
products will spice Pepsi's Frito-Lay and other snack foods; 3)
highly profitable Quaker brands such as Quaker Oatmeal, Life and
Cap'n Crunch Cereals, Rice-A-Roni (""the San Francisco treat!""),
and Aunt Jemima syrup provide hefty free cash flow.

Pepsi's CEO and Chairman Robert Enrico had planned to retire,
and will now speed up his move. Current President Steve
Reinemund will become CEO, and Enrico will remain on the board
as vice chairman. Quaker's CEO Robert Morrison, credited with
Quaker's turnaround, committed to stay on for 18 months and will
join Enrico on the board as a vice chairman. Indra Nooyi,
Pepsi's CFO, becomes president, increasing the ranks of
big-company top-level women executives.

The fianc,s agreed to two price conditions: If Pepsi stock drops
under $40 for 10 days in the month before closing, valuing
Quaker at $92 a share, Quaker may walk unless Pepsi commits to
$92 a share. On the flip side, Pepsi pays no more than $105 a
share, even if its stock climbs over $45.65 a share. Pepsi will
issue 315 million shares to pay for the purchase, which the
parties expect to be completed in the first half of 2001 --
depending on antitrust scrutiny.

NEWS TO GO

Bloomberg reports the network storage giant EMC (NYSE: EMC) will
introduce a product, code-named Chameleon, to compete against
Network Appliance (Nasdaq: NTAP) in the small to medium-size
business market for network attached storage (NAS). EMC already
competes in the market for large corporation NAS, and holds 30%
of the overall NAS market compared to Network Appliance's 40%,
according to information technology market researcher IDC. IDC
estimates that the NAS market will reach $7 billion by 2003. EMC
closed Friday at $78.25, off a 52-week high of $103.94, while
Network Appliance finished at $53.94, from a 52-week top of
$152.75.

Barron's reported in its December 4 edition that eBay (Nasdaq:
EBAY) was in talks to buy uBid, a unit of CMGI (Nasdaq: CMGI).
Reuters reported that an eBay source denied the story, though
eBay declined official comment. According to Barron's, UBid
plans to pop the champagne this week on a new
consumer-to-consumer auction site, Auction Exchange, to compete
with eBay. UBid has 1.5 million registered users, and its
current online auction site sells mostly refurbished and
closed-out consumer electronics.

Bad news keeps copying at Xerox (NYSE: XRX). After Moody
downgraded Xerox debt to junk-bond status on Friday, the company
announced it would lay off 200 production workers -- the first
time in more than a year that the company has fired union
workers. The laid-off employees must work until December 22 but
will receive pay and benefits through January 26. This action
follows November's decision to pink-slip 350 white-collar U.S.
workers, and both are separate from last March's decision to lay
off 5,200 workers by April 2001. Xerox shares closed Friday at
$6.25, down 56.3 cents, or 8%.

Swiss drug giant Novartis (NYSE: NVS) announced positive Phase
II results from its developmental leukemia drug, Glivec.
Leukemia involves uncontrolled proliferation of white blood
cells. Glivec selectively targets a key protein involved in
leukemia, and Novartis hopes the drug will be used instead of
painful bone marrow transplants or more toxic alpha interferon
treatment. Significant response rates varied according to the
disease stage, and ranged from 33% to 78%, with 30% showing
normal blood counts. Glivec is still several years from the
pharmacy shelves because it faces larger Phase III studies and
application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
marketing approval.

My thoughts on the Central Iowa Power Cooperative RFP

Let me know what you think

1.  We will develop two GE 7 EA's.  Unit 1 operational 5/1/01.  Unit 2 
operational 5/1/02

2.  We will use the Ogden/Boone County Site being secured by John Moore.  The 
site is 1/4 mile from Northern Natural Gas Mainline.  Also, Ameren 345 Kv and 
Alliant 115Kv line onsite.  Assume interconnects to both of these systems.  
Please break out cost for each.

3.  Assume no fuel oil back-up

4.  Assume no black start

5.  Design the units to be later converted to combined cycle.

6.  Assume water injection for nox control.

7.  Assume portable de-min water facilities

8.  Assume Enron does EPC

9.  Assume CIPCO will finance and own the plant  through ther term of the PSA 
and thereafter

10.  Assume CIPCO will execute a power sales agreement (PSA) with Enron from 
5/1/01 through 10/31/07

Michelle, I just faxes you an executed copy of the CA.

In addition, please find the turbine payment schedule, attached.  We are 
possibly signing a deal for the April 2000 payment ($69MM) tomorrow (so move 
quickly if you want that one!).  Therefore, I would suggest that you mainly 
focus on the payments scheduled after April 2000.  Finally, please keep in 
mind that the last column is for ABB turbines for our Arkansas project (the 
rest are GE).

Please give me a call to discuss.  I should be in the office today until 
around 2:00, and then back on Monday.

Yvan,

According to Dave Botchlett, we should be able to use the Low Sulfur HO curve 
that is in the file I've given you in the past with the 3 cent transport cost 
over the NYH mean.  

He did a question:   Can we ship the oil into the plant on barges or on cargo 
ships as opposed to trucking?

Attached is the updated file

Ben, please find attached an O&M cost estimate for one oil fired 6 x 1 
LM6000PC power project located in Homestead, FL. The estimate assumes 1,400 
run hours in simple cycle during the first year (without SCR) and 2,500 run 
hours in combined cycle for years 2+, with SCR. Given that it's combined 
cycle in years 2+, the staffing plan is assuming year round availability 
needs (except for agreed upon Scheduled Outages). Please note the increase in 
GT Major Scheduled Maintenance costs due to liquid firing.



Please review it and let me know if you have questions or comments.

Mark and Tom, sorry for the short notice. Can you please review and provide 
comment, particularly on the proposed staffing plan and Operator fees?

regards, Scot

Yes, those are the numbers I have gone by and I have
already done my shopping!!! :-)  Anyway, we really
have to get going on MOm and Dad's gift so I can feel
like I am getting somewhere.  Anyone interested in
taking responsibility for the shopping around????
Speak up now!  Also, did I hear besides shopping for
the kiddie KK, we can/should shop for our
godchildren???  Someone please let me know.

Where should adult KK gifts be sent??  To the couples
home or if they live in NY, to Mom and Dads???

Ben and I got our first tree this year--how exciting!!
 We got it and put it up today.  It looks beautiful if
I do say so myself.  Here is a new list for Ben and I
since Maeve doesn't think it is appropriate for me to
ask for china and things Ben probably doesn't want---
Ben-- a BROWN snap on Tiffany belt (for the silver
buckle)  they will know what you mean.  Dee-maybe your
friend can get this at a discount???  Any Beatles
CD's--  I think one is called Beatles One--  or a
Beatles box set (if there is one)---or camel color
cordeuroy's from POLO (don't know how much they are)
in a 38 X 32--
Now for ME--spode china 5 PPS,  anything from Tiffany
(if you are going there for Ben's gift) again,
Dee-maybe you can get at a discount???-- earrings
(silver balls) or bracelet (silver balls),  tiffany
heart necklace, etc., I also saw at POLO (if you go
there for Ben's gift) a tea pot to go with our
everyday Claire Pattern,  there are these miniature
stand up figures called ""The Carolers"" (I know Talbots
has some), that I am collecting (department stores may
have them also) about a foot tall--they all look like
they are singing.
Anyway, I hope this gives some more ideas for our
KK's.  Hope you all had a great weekend!  Oh, I have
our address for Colorado (but please send to arrive
after the 16th)
Rogers
114 Bermuda Drive
Edwards, CO  81632
Thanks so much!!  Meg and Ben

Ben, please find attached an O&M cost estimate for one oil fired 6 x 1 
LM6000PC power project located in Homestead, FL. The estimate assumes 1,400 
run hours in simple cycle during the first year (without SCR) and 2,500 run 
hours in combined cycle for years 2+, with SCR. Given that it's combined 
cycle in years 2+, the staffing plan is assuming year round availability 
needs (except for agreed upon Scheduled Outages). Please note the increase in 
GT Major Scheduled Maintenance costs due to liquid firing.



Please review it and let me know if you have questions or comments.

Mark and Tom, sorry for the short notice. Can you please review and provide 
comment, particularly on the proposed staffing plan and Operator fees?

regards, Scot"

Here are the responses to my CIPCO questions

1.  Henwood Energy is a third party evaluation consultant.  They will review 
the RFP responses

2.  Burns & McDonald has assisted in site selection/review and will 
participate in evaluation of any self-builds that CIPCO does.

3.  CIPCO has a preference to purchase from the market or from plants that 
Enron would develop.  They are not big on wanting to build their own plant or 
JV.

4.  CIPCO has identified a key site in Iowa that has direct access to their 
own system as well as the Mid-Am system.  They would make that site available 
to us if we needed it.  They will not reveal the site unless we get into 
negotiations.

5.  CIPCO will consider terms longer than 5 years.  They would consider a 
15-20 year term if there was a capital project involved.

6.  CIPCO does have their own transmission system as well as point/point 
transmission agreements on Mid-Am and Alliant.  The point to point agreement 
are from plants where CIPCO owns a partial share to CIPCO's system.

7.  CIPCO appeared to not value the LM-6000 technology to any higher degree 
than other machines.

8.  CIPCO was not sure of how things would be financed.

9.  If CIPCO decided to self build, they would certainly be interested in 
working with Enron on the gas deal."

Attached is nominal performance for 6 LM6000 and 75 MW STG at Homestead. I am 
getting about 8175 Btu/kWhr HHV net plant heat rate (does include GE/S&S 
margin) at about 348 MW net plant output.

Dr. Harris:
 In my pursuit to strengthen my application profile for next year I have 
explored taking two graduate level night courses this summer and I wanted to 
know what courses the admissions committee would suggest that I take this 
summer.  I wanted to make sure that I was taking the courses that were most 
appropriate with regards to my application. Just to let you know, I was 
planning on taking two finance courses.  Thanks in advance for your 
suggestion with this matter.  
 I was in Austin yesterday for the completion of the MS 150 Bike ride, but 
was not able to stick around.  Hope all is going well and hope to hear from 
you soon.  

Regards,
Ben Rogers"
