Yes, I've been contacted by Paul Puchot in Global Finance.  There is some type of meeting this afternoon.  It is not clear to anyone which Enron company is involved.  FYI - I was in  the midst of negotiating an ISDA with BSIL for Enron Corp. with respect to potential forward deals.

I received a phone call from Nancy Bauer with Bear Stearns International Ltd. (""Bear Stearns"").  Nancy has  informed me that Bear Stearns will be doing a large trade with Enron North America Corp. (""ENA"") very soon.  Their goal is to get an ISDA Master Agreement in place quickly.  Bear Stearns would like for the ISDA Master Agreement with ENA to mirror the ISDA Master Agreement dated July 3, 2000 between Enron Credit Limited and Bear Stearns.   

My review of our Lotus Notes database did not reveal that Enron Credit Limited has a Master Agreement with Bear Stearns.  If this Master Agreement has been executed, please make an entry for it in Lotus Notes.  Also, please e-mail me a copy of the execution version of the Enron Credit Limited and Bear Stearns Master Agreement for legal and credit in Houston to review.  Since time is of the essence, your attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

Mark:

I'll be brief.  We received an objection from Nuevo (wants to use Monday, Sept. 10 price).  David Andrews (Treasurer) sent the letter and I left him a voice mail.  The ENA trader is Bill Berkeland and Bill suggested that Fred handle this customer (since it's Fred's customer).  Nuevo neglected to read our ISDA (all standard language) and we actually fall into the ""ENA averages two quotes"" scenario.  Fred should try to negotiate this one.  I left Fred a voice mail and Bill will contact Fred in the a.m.  Kim is aware of this situation.

I have received the email below and have only two minor comments concerning
the Confirmation.

1.  In the ""Cash Settlement Amount"" paragraph, ""Notional Amount"" should be
changed to ""Notional Quantity"" to be consistent.

2.  For sake of avoiding doubt that the payment date is the fifth business
day following the date on which the product is priced for the last pricing
day of the prior month, I would amend the existing language of the Payment
Date(s) to add the following at the end of the sentence:  ""for the
applicable Determination Period.""

Sara,

It has been brought to my attention that the payment language we are using for financial power trades that are less than one month in duration does not mention that payment is due 5 business days after the floating price is determinable.  It basically says 5 business days after the last day of the month.

The fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable (this language is in all confirms with a calculation period of one month or longer).

The fifth (5th) Business Day following the last day of the month that includes the Calculation Period (this language is in all confirms with a calculation period less than one month).


Can you draft payment language for trades less than one month that states payment is due five business days after the floating price is determinable?

Call me if you would like to discuss.

Thanks,
Melissa

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) 

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim"

Stephanie -

Where do we stand with respect to getting a document into National Energy Group, Inc.?  I need to push this forward, as this is a critical document.  Please let me know how we are proceeding on this.  

As a reminder, I want to have the ability to call for margin if NEGI's positions are any less than $4 million dollars in their favor.  I had put $3 million dollars in my prior email, but this figure should actually be $4 MM. 

I will be out Monday and Tuesday, but please contact Max Sonnonstine with any questions.


Thanks,

JRW

Stephanie and Sara -

We currently have several deals on the books with National Energy Group, Inc. that we confirmed under omnibus confirms.  The initial two deals that we did with them, TAGG numbers QY8453 and QY9133, required independent amounts and had the credit language attached.  I have attached those annexes below.  We have since executed the following trades:

VH0606
VH0931
VH0969
VH0982
VT5854
VT5861



Our positions with this counterparty have gone deep in the money to them, and they have asked us to send them back the collateral.  While I am not thrilled about doing this, I understand that this is a commercial issue and we probably need to do this to be responsive to the customer.  If you hadn't guessed by now, this is a Lagrasta customer, so I am getting the requisite incentive from Fred to get this done.

In concert with the return of their collateral, I want to send them a document that allows us to call for margin again if their positions start moving back in ENA's favor.  I want to be able to call them if their position moves any less than $3 million in their favor.  Right now, the positions are over $6 MM in National Energy Group's favor; I want to call them if that exposure changes to anything less than $3 MM in their favor.  This would still give us some ""cushion"".  

What do we need to do to make this happen?

You are handling this counterparty from a credit perspective.  Rich Friedman from Global Markets has called to inquire about the status of this ISDA request.  Please refer to Lotus Notes to review the last action taken by Russell in February, 2001.  Please determine whether we can eliminate the Credit Support Annex from this agreement before we send another version.  You will note that this counterparty wants to rely entirely on the form used by Aron.  Russell has a copy of this agreement.

Do you want to put this on the legal credit list for follow up? 

Thanks.

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) 

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

(1)  the BS&Co. confirm references the ""Irrevocable Sell Order dated August 9, 2001"".  Please forward a copy.  This apparently contains definitions for (multiple) Sell Order Execution Dates.

(2)  according to your notes, the BSIL ""Standard Terms and Conditions of Business"" is subject to review by a UK lawyer.  Please advise of your conclusions. Forward executed version (which is incorporated into the confirms).

(3)  the BS&Co. confirm references the Customer Agreement and incorporates this as a Credit Support Document.   Please forward executed verison.  [BS&Co. also claims that deals pursuant to your Customer Agreement are Specified Transactions for purposes of OTC derivative transactions]

(4)  portions of the confirm do not match the unexecuted Term Sheet which you gave me.  Was a Term Sheet executed?  Is there an ENE guaranty which is supposed to be a Credit Support Document under the confirm?

Before any brokerage account can be opened, you need to advise the RAC group.  Please send an email to the three persons (""Cc"") above explaining what accounts Enron North America Corp.

ENA has a brokerage agreement with Bear Stearns Compamies, Inc. but not with Bear Stearns International Limited.  ENA already has resolutions for opening brokerage accounts.

Mark,

Following a discrepancy with an incorrect confirm generated and executed for an EOL deal between ENA and Chase, Dutch Quigley on the Enron Gas desk has spoken with Greg Crowley, a Chase trader, and Cecile Taylor-Simpson (their confirms Manager) - and agreed that they would all like Enron to be the confirming party for EOL deals between us.  (Presently Chase is the Confirming Party for financial commodity confirms).

Can we, and do we want to, revise their Master Agreement to reflect this?  I thought perhaps this would be a good opportunity to try to get Chase to execute the EOL Amendment.  

Please advise.
Thanks,
Diane

We urgently need to have a new prime account set up at Bear Stearns to facilitate moving the Anker Coal positions from ECI into a fair value entity.

I had forwarded this to Frank Sayre as both of you were out on Friday.  This is background information on why we need to set up the prime account for ECT Europe Investments Inc.

We have been given until the 12th to move the Anker positions to the ECT Entity.  The account will need to be fully open and funded before the positions can move.

As this is of the highest priority please let me know immediately if there will be any issue with completing paperwork by tomorrow.

Dear Tom,

As we discussed, here are the stipulations we talked about regarding the entity to which Enron Credit Inc. can transfer the Anker stock and bonds. Those stipulations regarding the transferee entity are that it:

1. must be a US company (this is for tax reasons)
2. must be a ""fair value"" entity under US GAAP (accounting reasons)
3. must by an entity whose results roll up to Enron Europe Limited (account reporting purposes)
4. must be able to hold stocks and bonds viz. have a brokerage account

Of existing Enron entities, the only entity that meets 1. to 3. is ECT Europe Investments Inc. Therefore, this entity would need a brokerage account. This would appear to be the easiest (!) way in which to meet all four conditions.

As we discussed, even if we gave Bear Stearns a global Enron Corp. guaranty I do not think that ECT Europe Investments Inc. would be able to take advantage of Enron Credit Inc.'s funding arrangements unless it had further 0% risk weighted transactions held in the account.

Thanks and regards,

Edmund"

EOL is asking for the Chase master to be amended to eliminate the need for confirms on EOL trades.  Do we need to meet to determine which Chase master (i.e., Chase or JP Morgan) should be amended (or both)?  Do we want to begin the upgrade process?   Please call.

Also, are you available for the 9:30 Hanover call?

We are ok with eliminating the CSA from the ISDA with Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC).  However, we would like to add an additional termination event, of debt rating change below A for OUC and BBB- for Enron Corp.

Richard!

In the absence of any margin rights, we will be monitoring trading activities with this counterparty more closely and this may result in certain transactions limitations.

Maggie:

I do have comments to this confirm.  I have never seen your ISDA Master Agreement (""Master"") so you need to have your lawyer review some portions of it to eliminate the possibility of conflict.  

(1)	Is SunTrust the Calc Agent under your Master? Should they be agent for this deal?

(2)	Need to upgrade definitions to 2000 Definitions (the 1991 and 1998 Definitions have been superseded!)

(3)	Are you in agreement with the optional early termination language and all calculations being performed by SunTrust in the manner set out? There is no valuation or payment time/date for this termination or details for giving notice of intent to exercise the termination option.  This language is extremely vague but perhaps you do not mind.

(4)	Do you have existing transactions with SunTrust on your books in addition to this one?

(5)	Are there any Additional Termination Events under the Master?  You don't want to necessarily eliminate such events from occurring.  Also, it is not clear to me if this transaction or any other derivative transaction with SunTrust is ""related to the Loan Agreement"" for purposes of giving SunTrust the right to terminate.  Is it?

(6)	Defining an ""event"" as either an ""Event of Default"" or a ""Termination Event"" has different settlement consequences.  It looks like you're not concerned as to how SunTrust values terminated Transactions if this deal is ""related"" to the Loan Agreement. I think part 2(d) would be clearer if stated as:

""Additional Termination Event will apply.  The following shall constitute an Additional Termination Event with respect to the Counterparty: (cite events (i) and (ii) if accurate) .  For the purpose of the foregoing Termination Event, the Affected Party shall be the Counterparty.""

This means SunTrust will calculate as if you were in default.  Or do you want to calculate at mid?

(6)	You should delete Par. 2(a).  I don't believe you have agreed to do this in the past (but perhaps you do not mind).  Your lawyer should review the impact of stating ""This provision shall constitute an additional Agreement for the purpose of Section 4 of the Swap Agreement.""

(7)	Are the economics of the deal stated correctly?

(8)	What Transaction(s) are being superseded?  Has anything from the initial deal been left out that should be retained?

Subject:	Consolidated Edison Company of New York / Enron North America Corp - Proposed Credit Terms

Please review the following proposed outline of the credit lines for the proposed ISDA.


Collateral Threshold (tied to S&P and Moody ratings, lower of):	

	
					ConEd		Enron
	A+/A1 and above		$75,000,000	$60,000,000
	A, A-, A2, or A3			$60,000,000	$55,000,000
	BBB+, BBB, Baa1 or Baa2	$25,000,000	$50,000,000
	BBB- or Baa3			$5,000,000	$15,000,000
	Below BBB- or Baa3		$0		$0

I am trying to set parameters which give ConEd the credit that it deserves as an A+ regulated utility and Enron the credit it warrants as a BBB+ energy marketer.  Given the different business profiles of our companies, I don't believe that the application of parity should be practiced with regards to setting credit lines.  I think you would agree to this approach when looking at other market players, such as banks, municipalities, etc.  I hope we can come to agreement on the proposed credit lines, so that we can proceed with the negotiations of the ISDA.  Please call or reply with any comments or questions.

As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline incorporating
the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
(modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is the
last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would suggest
that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
since it is the final version.

 <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at which
point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature page)
via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
Schedule with your revised Schedule.

Thank you for your patience.

Kim:

Is the legal entity for PacificCorp:	PacificCorp Power Marketing, Inc.?  Is there only an entity for financial power?  

Thanks.  Sara

Kim:

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

Thanks.

   What about the limitation of liability language which you suggested
   could
   be similar to the PB agreement (your 9/20/01 email)?

         Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language
         amending
         the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

         Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose
      the
         language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

         I trust this will now close the open issues.

         I look forward to hearing from you

         Daniel:

         Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding
   issues
         relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate
   policy.
         If
         you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option
      and
         we
         can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International
   Chamber
      of
         Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be
   non-prime
         brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and,
   therefore,
         are
         not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do
   have
         other
         business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of
         limitation
         of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

         ""Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter
   or
      from
         any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect,
      special,
         punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage.""

         Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out
   of
      the
         office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

         All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them
         executed
         together with the terms of business letter.

         Regards.  Sara

            The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your
         relationship
            with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues
   that
         relate
            to
            the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects
   with
      the
         PB
            relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

            Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are
   adequately
            addressed
            in the documentation as drafted.

            I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as
      possible
         so
            we
            can try to get this wrapped up today.

            Kind regards

            Daniel:

            Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the
   PB
            conflict
            because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with
      Par.8
            requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to
   the
         Terms
            of
            Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts
      prevail.
            Are
            you agreeing with this analysis?

            Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to
      conflict
            with
            the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to
   the
      PB
            (except
            for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It
   is
         Enron
            Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit
      the
            Terms
            of Business in the same manner.

            Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or
         suggest a
            different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the
   the
            remaining
            documents.

            Thanks.

               Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke.
      Arbitration -
            more
               appropriate to general terms of business which principally
            contemplate
               the
               regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the
      event
         of
               inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause
      A3).

               I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

               Kind regards

               Daniel:

               Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the
         ""Agreement"")
               with my colleague Angela Davis.

               I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business
   Letter
            relating
               to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we
      discussed
         but
               were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

               (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J,
   Par.
      14
         of
               the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the
   possible
      use
         of
               arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration
   in
      the
            OSLA)
               so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph
   of
         the
               Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to
      English
            courts,
               I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter
   which
      will
               prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

               (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same
         manner
            as
               Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe
      that
         you
               and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why
         shouldn't
               these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

               I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest
   of
      the
               account documentation.  Regards.

Kathryn:

The customers appearing on Kim's list have been assigned to various lawyers in the swap group.  There are 22 parties on the list and 16 of these parties have ISDA Master Agreements with ENA.  We will focus on the ISDA customers first.  We will use the template developed by Brent for Entergy-Koch as a basis for the 16 parties.  The template will be customized for each of the 16 parties.  Brent has a preliminary template underway and it should be further refined by October 19.  Using that  template, our goal is to produce six (6) new amendments each week.  We should finish the ISDA customers in about three weeks (first drafts).  The remaining customers have no master agreement in place or an ECT Master Agreement.  Those six (6) customers include:

	Sempra Energy Trading Corp. (old master)
	Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (old master)
	Dynegy Marketing and Trade (old master)
	Ameren Energy (none)
	American Electric Service Power Corporation (none)
	PacificCorp Power Marketing Inc. (under negotiation with ECC)

The physical power group can coordinate the amendments with the members of the swap group listed above by forwarding drafts to us.

Please let me know if you have further questions.  Thanks.  Sara

Subject:	RE: ConfirmLogic Target Customer List-Legal Entity Name

Sara:

I have followed up with Brent and he is working on the Entergy-Koch amendment for CommodityLogic.  He cannot commit to a completion date at this time since he has some other priorities.  I've asked for Friday and he has indicated that may be aggressive.  The sales team is presenting Entergy-Koch the CommodityLogic legal agreements today (ESA, Password application, Subscription Agreement).  In light of this, can you provide a status of where the other 18 customer amendments are (excluding Sempra and Entergy-Koch) ?  The Sales process is moving along and we will need to have these amendments ready to present to the customer soon.  Could you go through the list and provide an estimate date of when a draft of the amendment would be available by client.  We need to provide a status to management on Monday 10/8.  

Per our conversation today, if there is a way to focus on the creation of a template that addresses the confirmation exchange via electronic systems (e.g. ConfirmLogic) that can be shared earlier with the clients.  The additional language that is deemed necessary can be added to this form as needed per counterparty.  This will allow us to achieve getting something to the client so they can start the process from their side while we continue to shore up what language needs to be added.  We still need to be thinking of how to keep this process simple to allow quick turnaround yet satisfy the legal requirements for confirmations.  I ask that you and Leslie continue to help define a better process for us and I will continue to work with Kim and the sales team to implement this process.

Thanks for your help
Kathryn

Kim:

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

Thanks.

	We are looking to restart the process of  establishing an executing broker agreement with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.  We had temporarily put this on hold due to the WTC attack.  We have been given a new contact.  Sheila had previously already sent the memo to authorize going forward with the process.  Below are their requirements for account set up:

3.  Settlement Instructions.


I am trying to get them to fax me their broker agreement.  As soon as I receive some documentation, I will forward to you.

   As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
   incorporating
   the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
   (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is
   the

   suggest
   that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
   since it is the final version.

   Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
   which
   point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
   page)
   via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
   Schedule with your revised Schedule.

   Thank you for your patience.

Can we get together for an hour or so to discuss:

1.  Multi Branch counterparties--we need to be certain we are covered by Master's for all of this trading.

2.  Training on the ISDA definitions.  I've pulled some confirms together for a group review.  I'd like to get together with you to go over where I see our weaknesses.  

Hope the legal conference was fun.  Give me a call and let's set up a time.  thanks!!"

We provided CSFB puts just like Lehman.  We did that the last time we had to move the trigger price since our stock price was declining.  As a result of us giving them puts, they took the trigger price out which means that we don't have to renegotiate the confirms every time our stock heads south.  Jeff, would you please get the details of the puts to Sara.  Thanks.

I would like to begin working on an ISDA, I have attached our standard form
schedule and CSA for your review.  I think this is a good window of
opportunity.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Tammy:

Your redraft is fine with two exceptions:

(1)  We need to define ""business day""  which is used throughout the agreement and is never defined.  I propose capitalizing the term throughtout your document and using the ISDA definiton or one which recognizes those days on which banks are open in NY and Houston.

(2)  ENA cannot agree to arbitrate before the National Futures Association and you are no longer required to use that forum for arbitration. The situs is fine. I would like to again suggest the language which I originally proposed.  If we cannot agree, can we be silent as to jurisdiction?

Please let me hear form you.

Sara,

I'm attaching a draft of the futures agreement to ""get the ball rolling""
again.  I believe I have included the terms you indicated were most
important.  One item I would like to bring to your attention is the
arbitration clause.  Morgan Stanley prefers to litigate disputes, but I
can agree to NFA arbitration rather than litigation.  I know New York is
our preferred location, and Texas is yours, so I thought that holding
the arbitration in Chicago might equally inconvenience us.   Please let
me know if this works for you.

Regards,

Tammy

Gil:  I left you a voice mail earlier.  I'm concerned about the definition of ""Specified Transaction"".  As drafted, I read this as cross defaulting to all other derivative trades between ENA and BSIL, as well as ENE and BSIL.  I don't know if we have any on the books or will enter into any prior to termination of your trades, but the same will be impacted unless you limit the Section 14 definition to your trades only.

Tim - we are comfortable with the changes to the definition of ""material""
given that Lehman is not entering the market as a result of ""rolling"" the
transaction.  Should we amend the transaction in or enter in any future
transaction where we enter the market on behalf of ENE, we would require the
""standard"" definition of ""material.

 Dear Sara,

I am attaching the long form confirm re a deal which we did yesterday  - small, but our office's first yen based crude transaction!  

The yen-USD forex however was done through ENA and needs to be documented.  ENA will also be providing these services to EJ (through our metals desk) moving forward so we need a master agreement in place.  

Alan suggested you may be able to assist with a form of document that would work in this situation.  The only requirement from EJ's perspective is that it be effective from yesterday, Oct 11, 2001.  

If you need more information about the forex arrangements we have with ENA, Sheila / Jan Erland may be able to assist.

Otherwise, if you were able to get a draft together, I will run it by Susan Musch and Jan-Erland, and get it signed up.

Thanks Sara.

Mr. Doukas:

On September 27, we opened a prime brokerage account in the name Enron
Credit Inc. Bear Stearns is acting as Prime Broker on this account, and
First Union Securities, Inc. is executing your securities. The SEC requires
the Clearing Broker (us) to have the attached agreement on file for our
prime brokerage clients.

If you would be so kind as to have this agreement signed, I would greatly
appreciate it. If you have any questions, you can call me at 704-593-7024.
Once it is completed, it can be faxed back to my attention at 704-593-7032.

Thank you and best regards,

We would like to use the same format which was agreed to by ENA and CSFB.  That agreement was sent for execution on July 6, 2001 and we have never received an executed version.

Please feel free to contact Scott Kreuzinger (phone is 617-556-5730 or fax is 617-542-1814) to ensure that ENA has executed docs which can also be duplicated for ECI.  Perhaps your contact at CSFB can assist.  Scott Kreuzinger was ENA's contact for having docs executed.

We have been unable to extract any response from Scott Kreuzinger.

Dear Sheila,

I left you a voice mail this afternoon with regards to establishing an execution and clearing relationship for exchange traded futures and options. At the request of Shane Dallman and Aaron Armstrong in London, I have quoted rates for all relevant exchange traded products. They have expressed an interest in using Deutsche Bank for their futures trading so that we are arranging to have documentation drafted and sent to Houston as soon as possible.

I have asked one of my colleagues, Rob Manders, to contact you to establish the names of the legal entities that should be on the contracts, and the name and address of the person/people to whom all documentation should be sent. Rob will be coordinating all the documentation and will assure that your operations department is happy with the service that Deutsche Bank will offer. To that end, he has organised a video conference with Kimberley Hopley in London and Jason Fisher in Houston for the week of 8th October.

I hope that these arrangements meet with your approval. Should you have any questions, please feel free to call me on 44 207 547 3486. Equally, you can reach Rob Manders on 44 207 545 2005.

Best Regards,

Kelly McKenney

Just a few notes from the Agreement:

(1)	Par. 2(d) - DBAB will use its ""reasonable judgment"" to value securities or other assets posted as margin
(2)	Par. 2(e) - DBAB will use its then current rates of exchange for any currency conversions (probably not applicable to ENA)
(3)	Par. 3     - Have we agreed to commissions and brokerage charges?  These are to be agreed ""from time to time""
(4)	Par. 5     - Position Limits:  ENA must promptly notify DBAB if ENA is required to file position reports.  Can you explain, please?
(5)	Par. 7(b) - Not sure why we're being asked to make this rep.  What is ENA's relationship to the Enron FCM these days?
(6)	Par. 9(a) - Trader changes binding on DBAB upon receipt of written confirmation
(7)	Par. 9(d) - verify binding nature of trades

 Dear Sara,

I am attaching the long form confirm re a deal which we did yesterday  - small, but our office's first yen based crude transaction!  

The yen-USD forex however was done through ENA and needs to be documented.  ENA will also be providing these services to EJ (through our metals desk) moving forward so we need a master agreement in place.  

Alan suggested you may be able to assist with a form of document that would work in this situation.  The only requirement from EJ's perspective is that it be effective from yesterday, Oct 11, 2001.  

If you need more information about the forex arrangements we have with ENA, Sheila / Jan Erland may be able to assist.

Otherwise, if you were able to get a draft together, I will run it by Susan Musch and Jan-Erland, and get it signed up.

Thanks Sara.

Sara,

I called Scott with no answer.  My contact does not know who he is, but suggested you could send the ECI and ENA agreements to her and she would ensure both were put in place with her legal and compliance people.

You can send the completed agreements to:

Kelly Keneally
11 Madison Ave, 5th Floor
NY, NY 10010
Phone: 212/538-5581
Fax: 212/538-4057

Please advise me when you send the documents out so I can ensure they are dealt with properly.

Thanks,

Tom

We would like to use the same format which was agreed to by ENA and CSFB.  That agreement was sent for execution on July 6, 2001 and we have never received an executed version.

Please feel free to contact Scott Kreuzinger (phone is 617-556-5730 or fax is 617-542-1814) to ensure that ENA has executed docs which can also be duplicated for ECI.  Perhaps your contact at CSFB can assist.  Scott Kreuzinger was ENA's contact for having docs executed.

We have been unable to extract any response from Scott Kreuzinger.

Thanks.

Jane:

I wanted to give you the benefit of some of my thoughts before I considered your Annex A which I would like to compare to the ENA current version.  We are currently considering more revisions so your Annex A will help me to think a bit.

I have attached a redline of the actual confirm (without Annex A).  A couple of thoughts:
(1)	for purposes of creating a ""template"", I gave a choice for Termination Date
(2)	I collapsed Payment Date/Invoice because I'm concerned that EJC may forget to send a timely invoice so we need to ensure that there is no issue about whether or not a payment is owed
(3)	We need to ""fix"" the Floating Price language.  I don't know where the reference to ""North Sea, West Africa, Mediterranean"" comes from.  I didn't see it in Marketwire and London doesn't use it.  Also, the conversion language is vague (i.e., TTM, TTB and TTS are not defined but I suspect they refer to bid/mid/sell?  Are they references on the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. screen?).  Also, it may be better to create a conversion reference to your Central Bank and not a particular banking institution (you could get caught later dealing with that bank, using the conversion language and then giving the bank an unfair advantage).
(4)	I didn't see your Schedule 1 guarantee but I assume that it is the normal ENE format. 

Regarding Annex A, I quickly noticed an issue with the ""TIBOR"" definition (which uses quite a bit of ISDA language) which can be easily fixed with an appropriate ISDA reference.  Give me another day or so to comment.

Let me know if you'd like to talk.  My home number is 713-664-3207 if you'd like to call.

Regards.  Sara

 << File: Final.doc >> Dear Sara,

I am attaching the long form confirm re a deal which we did yesterday  - small, but our office's first yen based crude transaction!  

The yen-USD forex however was done through ENA and needs to be documented.  ENA will also be providing these services to EJ (through our metals desk) moving forward so we need a master agreement in place.  

Alan suggested you may be able to assist with a form of document that would work in this situation.  The only requirement from EJ's perspective is that it be effective from yesterday, Oct 11, 2001.  

If you need more information about the forex arrangements we have with ENA, Sheila / Jan Erland may be able to assist.

Otherwise, if you were able to get a draft together, I will run it by Susan Musch and Jan-Erland, and get it signed up.

Thanks Sara.

Jane McBride

Ps. I didn't make it to the GM Legal Conference this time but hope it went well and to see you in May."

I spoke with Yair about your suggestion to have a ""unilateral"" approach to
include Affiliates for yourselves but not for us since we are restricted by
PUHCA (as explained by Anthony Wilson, our in house regulatory attorney) and
he is inclined to not agree to your request (our approach is either if
applied to both of us or neither of us).

Let me know if you need to discuss this further - in which case we will get
on a call (Yair, you and myself) to discuss.

   As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
   incorporating
   the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
   (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is
   the
   last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would
   suggest
   that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
   since it is the final version.

    <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

   Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
   which
   point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature

   via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
   Schedule with your revised Schedule.

   Thank you for your patience.

Thanks for the quick response.  Your ""business day"" suggestion is fine.  With respect to your second comment, ENA agrees to AAA arbitration in all phases of its physical and financial business.  We are not a clearing member of any exchange so we do not seek arbitration before a regulatory board.  Hope this helps.  Sara

Sara,

For the purposes of margin, defining a business day as those days on which banks are open in NY and Houston will work.  For the purposes of error notification, we should remove ""business day"" and insert something along the lines of ""market day"" and define ""market day"" as any day that the market on which the contract traded is open.  There are a few days the markets are open but the banks are closed.   Will that work for you?

Both Morgan Stanley and Enron are registered with the NFA.  Is there a specific reason you can't agree to NFA arbitration?

Regards,

Tammy

I've just reviewed this credit worksheet for a first draft ISDA.  Is this the type of counterparty for which a ""regulatory out"" MAC provision is appropriate?  I am not familiar with Exelon's business.  I know this event was used in some of Tracy's ISDA's with northwest utilities.

include Affiliates for yourselves but not for us since we are restricted by
PUHCA (as explained by Anthony Wilson, our in house regulatory attorney) and
he is inclined to not agree to your request (our approach is either if
applied to both of us or neither of us).

   As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
   incorporating
   the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
   (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is
   the
   last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would
   suggest
   that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
   since it is the final version.

    <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

   Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
   which
   point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
   page)
   via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
   Schedule with your revised Schedule.

   Thank you for your patience.

I had a long conversation with Sylvia Dooley this afternoon.  She contacted me about finalizing the Con Ed ISDA Master Agreement and the ""related"" Consolidated Edison Energy (same lawyer, different commercial) master.  Sylvia is preparing a new version.

We have a lot of open issues, most appearing on the open issue list that I just circulated to you both.  However, Sylvia and I identified some significant credit issues which we should address now.

Ed:  In addition to finalizing the credit matrix, the big ticket issues include the following items and (according to Sylvia) you should probably call Triche Douglas right away to resolve as she is being moved to another project and may not be available for ISDA negotiations much longer:

(1)	credit event upon merger:  Con Ed coming back with newer definition of ""materially weaker"". Con Ed rejects ENA's proposal

(2)	Con Ed is still rejecting our setoff language.  I will send our newer language but the substance is the same as before.

(3)	will not agree to our transfer language (i.e., always want to consent for purposes of transfer and no carve out for guaranteed affiliates)

(4)	want an extra day for delivering L/C's

(5)	issue about notification time for requesting collateral.  Con Ed wants 1 pm NY time; we countered with 11 am NY time.

(6)	are insisting that parties obtain consent for substitution of collateral

(7)	major issue with respect to holding/using collateral.  Con Ed will propose that with respect to ENA, only Enron Corp. can hold collateral and Enron Corp.'s eligibility to hold collateral will be tied to credit rating of BBB

(8)	major issue defining MAC: no one has come up with a MAC

Given my conversation of this afternoon, please let me know how you would like to proceed.  Rob, will you be handling both Con Ed entities?

At the point the language was agreed to in the below agreement we may not
have been aware of the regulatory contraints under PUHCA that does not allow
for the inclusion of Affiliates under Set-Off (we may actually have to amend
that agreement to carve it out).

With respect to the our ISDA, I will make sure to forward to Anthony the

   With respect to your setoff request, we cannot agree to eliminate setoff
   for your non-regulated affiliates.  Perhaps you could provide us with
   the

      Sara -

      As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
      incorporating
      the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of
   ISDA
      (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached
   is
      the
      last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would
      suggest
      that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of
   agreement
      since it is the final version.

       <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

      Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
      which
      point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
      page)
      via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
      Schedule with your revised Schedule.

      Thank you for your patience.

      Regards,
      Michelle

Sara-thank you for looking into this issue for us.  Here is a brief
summary of what occured.


UBS and Enron entered into a Sterling-UBS spot transaction on 11-19-01,
which both parties confirmed and settled on 11-21. (UBS pays USD
7,083,500 and receives 5 mio sterling).

On 11-21 UBS and Enron erroneously confirmed the same trade again for
settlement on 11-21. UBS made a second USD 7,083,500 payment to Enron's
account at BA-Dallas on 11-21 (payment reference: FED IMA
1121B1Q8052C001081).

UBS did not receive the Sterling it was expecting and for the next few
days Enron and UBS tried to resolve the non-payment based on a mistaken
assumption that Enron owed 5 mio Sterling to UBS.

On 11-28, UBS realized that the trade was duped and on 11-29 informed
Enron of the nature of the error and requested that the USD payment be
returned. Enron agreed to return the USD payment on 11-29. The returned
payment was never received.

If you need additional information please contact me at 203-719-1141 or
Bryan Murtagh 203-719-8955.  Here are our contacts at Enron who are
aware of this issue.

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Ed:  Can you resolve credit issues with Triche before the end of next week?  I think credit will drive a major part of the agreement.  

Do you guys want to meet early next week?

How to open the database in Notes:
Go to File...Database...Open
Server = ECTHOU_LN1
FileName = North_America\Swap.nsf
Click [Open]

I may have mentioned this a long time ago and then forgotten about it but I'd like to coordinate with the group that administers eRequest so that this becomes a requestable app on eRequest. Someone would then be able to make a request for access to the db and you'd have to approve it. The eRequest group would then be responsible for giving them access. That way, you don't have to wait on me.

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Laurel:

Please call me in the morning.  I need to verify:

1.	Was this an ENA transaction?

2.	What is the actual account number?

3. 	What happened to the money when it hit the BofA account?  I think you said it was swept into a Citibank account.  Was this an ENA or ENE account?

4.  	Where is the money today?

Thanks.

A very general question:  shouldn't all of the financial power templates provide for corrections to published prices and rounding to four places for commodities quoted in MMBtus?  Your template does not contain either of these.

Kim:  I need to verify that the EOL amendment changes conform to the general financial power template changes.

(1)  The EOL amendment provides that the rounding convention for calculating power Floating Prices relating to MMBtus is rounding to four places; the current financial power template provides for rounding to three decimal places.  Which is the correct convention?

(2)  With respect to corrections to published prices, changes will be required to both the ISDA and GTC formats since the latest EOL amendment does not conform to standard ISDA terminology.  There is no corresponding GTC terminology.

Please let me know about (1) above.  Thanks.  Sara

Carol:

As the log is continually updated, we should be clear as to which entities we are reviewing for purposes of informing the book ad mins.
To date, we have only focused on:

	ENA 
	EPMI
	ENE
	ENA Upstream Company LLC
`	EPMI

We have consciously excluded EES and the London entities or US entities trading through EEFT in London (such as ECTRIC).

Since Enron Global Markets (and presumably EIM next) is under a mandate for liquidation, don't we need to liase with Alan (for his US products) and London (for products such as weather) which are EGM products?  Since ENA includes FX/rate, we have included that global product in our original review.  This is needed to understand the process of liquidation of the FX/rate book (as netted against other ENA outstanding positions). 

Or is our focus still only gas and power? I just don't want to miss anything or slow down the process.

Kim:

I didn't save the email verison of the ""corrections to published prices"" so I'll state the changes below and you can revise:

(1)  You will need two different versions:  one for GTC's and the other for ISDA confirmations	

(2)  Don't capitalize the word ""party"" in either version

(3)  Use the capitalized term ""Interest Rate"" for the GTC version

(4)  Use the capitalized term ""Applicable Rate"" for the ISDA version

When I hear back from Kim T., we can finalize the rounding convention for online and offline confirmations.

Thanks.  Sara

Dear Susan:

Pursuant to the discussions between Anthony Lupiano of our Credit

attached you will find a proposed Fourth Amendment to the Master Energy

the Exposure Threshold definition.    It is my understanding that Mr.

Just FYI, we are revising the two put confirmations we sent out to you

settlement.  We will correct the confirms to include only physical

Rex, Jim and Clint:

You may recall that ENE has been in the process of documenting two forwards, effective 10/3/01, and two puts, effective 10/1/01.  The forwards consisted of rolls of outstanding forwards with Lehman.  These transaction confirmations were signed by Tim DeSpain on Friday, October 19, 2001. 

In that regard, I have faxed to your attention the two (2) REVISED put confirmations prepared by Lehman per the email attached below.  I received the confirmations by fax today.  The confirmations were revised to provide for physical settlement on the Expiration Date.  There are two different Expiration Dates; one is October 30, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.5246) and the other is December 28, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.6947).  You will see the details on the confirmations.  As Seller of the options, ENE will be obliged to pay Lehman upon delivery of the shares if the options are automatically exercised on the Expiration Date(s).  Please note that there are also changes to the confirmations with respect to ""Regulation M/Tender Offer Event"" appearing on page 4 (i.e., Cash Settlement will apply instead).

Clint:  please verify that the confirmation changes conform to your discussions with Russ.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.  Sara

Clint,

Just FYI, we are revising the two put confirmations we sent out to you
earlier to reflect the discussions you previously had with Russ around
settlement.  We will correct the confirms to include only physical
settlement at maturity, and we will send them out shortly.

I have not received anything from anyone in London or anywhere else regarding positions, etc.

I did speak with a Weil bankruptcy lawyer and there were many issues especially with respect to ENA positions (and I don't know where the high value credit positions are booked).  They believe that we may have structuring issues working through London and not directly with a purchaser.

Can you send the information over here?

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

It will mean doing the paperwork all over again and closing the old account assuming ECTEF does not want an account.  This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don't already have them in place.

Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.  As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.

Subject:	Investment companies

After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.

The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.

I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.

If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.

After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.

The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.

I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.

If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.

Subject:	FW: Put Confirmations:  ENE as ""Seller"" and Lehman Brothers Finance S.A. as ""Buyer"" (or ""Lehman"")

Rex, Jim and Clint:

You may recall that ENE has been in the process of documenting two forwards, effective 10/3/01, and two puts, effective 10/1/01.  The forwards consisted of rolls of outstanding forwards with Lehman.  These transaction confirmations were signed by Tim DeSpain on Friday, October 19, 2001. 

In that regard, I have faxed to your attention the two (2) REVISED put confirmations prepared by Lehman per the email attached below.  I received the confirmations by fax today.  The confirmations were revised to provide for physical settlement on the Expiration Date.  There are two different Expiration Dates; one is October 30, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.5246) and the other is December 28, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.6947).  You will see the details on the confirmations.  As Seller of the options, ENE will be obliged to pay Lehman upon delivery of the shares if the options are automatically exercised on the Expiration Date(s).  Please note that there are also changes to the confirmations with respect to ""Regulation M/Tender Offer Event"" appearing on page 4 (i.e., Cash Settlement will apply instead).

Clint:  please verify that the confirmation changes conform to your discussions with Russ.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.  Sara

Clint,

Just FYI, we are revising the two put confirmations we sent out to you
earlier to reflect the discussions you previously had with Russ around
settlement.  We will correct the confirms to include only physical
settlement at maturity, and we will send them out shortly.

It will mean doing the paperwork all over again and closing the old account assuming ECTEF does not want an account.  This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don't already have them in place.

Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.  As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.

Sara how feasible would it be to prepare account paperwork for the ECTMI company to obtain a Bear account?

Thanks,

Tom

Tanya and Jay:

I need someone to please look into the following trades with various Enron entities (other than ENA) identified by Beth Ng of Morgan and whether these were booked incorrectly or should properly be booked in the names of the following affiliates:

Enron Liquids
Enron Reserve Acquisition Corp. (oil option)
EOTT (I think EOTT documents its financial deals separately)

Also, there have been trades for physical settlement, such as, an ""oil forward"" and a ""gas TBP forward"".  Maybe Jeff knows the answer to this one.

Thanks.

Subject:	Jeff McMahon Named CFO


Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work."

Larry Anderson with Carr has called to inquire about ENA financials and an Enron Corp. guaranty.  From an historical perspective, it has always been my understanding that Enron Corp. did not wish to provide guaranties to brokers and we have been successful in that regard with several recent exceptions.  In particular, Enron Corp. provided Carr with a ""comfort letter"" reciting the corporate ""policy of general financial responsibility and interest in seeing that subsidiaries act responsibly.""  [letter dated February 16, 1999]  Such letter is no longer sufficient to satisfy Credit Agricole which owns Carr.  

Joe, I believe that Larry may have already spoken with you.  I don't know if your conversation included discussion of a guaranty.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  Thanks.

(3)  Two (2) Equity Forwards on 1,025,000 shares and 1,672,000 shares ENE, respectively

The forwards contain $40 price triggers which will be adjusted through either an amendment or put.  This will be documented after the swap and forwards are signed.

Subject:	Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows:

Sara,

Per your conversation with Phil Levy, attached please find our proposed
amendment to the Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement currently in
place between The Chase Manhattan Bank and Enron North America Corp.  I
have reviewed the definition of ""Specified Swap"" as defined in Part 1(2) of
the Schedule and it does not appear to include foreign exchange
transactions.  Therefore, I have modified the definition in the amendment.

Please review the amendment and, if satisfactory, arrange for the execution
of two copies.  Both copies should then be returned to my attention at 270
Park Avenue, 40th Floor, New York, New York 10017.  In addition, once
executed, I would appreciate your faxing me a copy at 212-270-7368.  Once I
receive the originals and have them executed by Chase, I will return to you
one fully executed original for your files.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me.  My
telephone number is 212-270-2673.

Best Regards,

Maureen Ryan

(1)  I thought you said that there were specific transactions in the U.S. entities.  I need a list of trades booked in the names of Enron Credit Inc. and Enron North America Corp.

(2)  I need someone to walk me through the numbers appearing on the charts which you sent me.

(3)  I don't understand what happened with the Anker Coal position.  I know that London used that entity for the purpose of transferring this position to ECTEF Inc.

I have not received anything from anyone in London or anywhere else regarding positions, etc.

I did speak with a Weil bankruptcy lawyer and there were many issues especially with respect to ENA positions (and I don't know where the high value credit positions are booked).  They believe that we may have structuring issues working through London and not directly with a purchaser.

Can you send the information over here?

Beth Ng at Morgan has requested that trades in the names of Enron Liquid Fuels, Inc. (""ELFI""), Enron Reserve Acquisition Corp. and Enron Gas Liquids (physical and financial) be ""novated"" or transferred to ENA.  Beth is aware that this is a credit issue.

I have copies of four (4) financial confirms between Morgan and ELFI.  These were produced by Morgan for Trade Dates February 28, 2001 (30,000 BBL total ethane), March 6, 2001 (30,000 BBL total propane),March 26, 2001 (150,000 BBL total propane) and March 26, 2001 (150,000 BBL total propane).

Beth has probably contacted Jeff Hodge and/or Alan Aronowitz on the physical side with the same request.

Thanks.  Sara

Sara,
Another opera channel bites the dust... must be the opera fans are too cheap for the advertisers that remain on the web.

Spoke with Phil Levy regarding several issues.  He is immediately emailing FX amendment for the existing master and will simultaneously review the existing ISDA for FX coverage.  The executed amendment will resolve the margining issues ASAP.  ENA will produce a draft Schedule/CSA to begin negotiations for an upgraded master which will include multibranch parties.

Has Enron Credit filed for Bankruptcy?  [Shackleton, Sara]  not yet  If not, do we try to sell the positions? [Shackleton, Sara]   Enron Credit Limited is reviewing the positions and I am engaging our bankruptcy lawyers to see what type of structure is plausible  I do not even know who the Authorized traders are on the account.

Sara,

The attached shows our balances at GS and Bear Stearns.

1) Bear Stearns owes us $3.9 million to ECT Investments, Inc.
	Ena is owed 159,022
	Enron Credit Inc has positive liquidating equity at BS of $14,013,523 which includes cash and positions.

2) Goldman Sachs ENA account grouping includes a positive cash balance of 1,493,288 which belongs to Enron Credit Inc.  As discussed, GS will not touch any monies relating to ENA.

3)  Enron Credit Inc. has a positive cash balance of 132,680 at MSDW.  It is segregated from any other entity's balances.

Adding up all three pieces of Enron Credit is $15.6 million, which includes positions and cash balances and presumes that the market value used by the prime broker is correct for some of these illiquid positions.

Please call so we can discuss.

Thanks. 
Sheila

Sheila:  attached is the markup I am preparing to send to FIMAT Canada.  Some of the redlining reflects ENA's prior agreement with FIMAT USA, Inc.  A few things for you to note and we can chat quickly:

(1)  Par. 5 - will we agree to a fee schedule now or ""as agreed to from time to time""?

(2)  Par. 7 - I have requested the interest rate schedule. Alternatively, I have ""borrowed"" language from the FIMAT USA, Inc. agreement.  Which do you think is best?

(3)  Par. 8 - is the reference to CAD50,000 for speculative accounts alright?  Or will this be simply a hedge account and that particular language is extraneous?

(4)  Par. 14 - will you need to object by phone (or is fax sufficient)?

I checked two other ENE subsidiary agreements and found:

(1)  We have successfully negotiated a limitation of liability clause (ENE's format)

(2)  We have been able to amend Par. 2 to ""delete all references to affiliates of GS&Co, including the words ""or any of your affiliates"" and ""each of your affiliates"" wherever such words appear AND delete the words ""without notice to Client "" in the sixth line and replacing them with ""without prior notice to Client, but with reasonable notice thereafter"" AND deletethe last sentence of Section 2

(3)  Section 4: same as (2) above

Beth Ng at Morgan has requested that trades in the names of Enron Liquid Fuels, Inc. (""ELFI""), Enron Reserve Acquisition Corp. and Enron Gas Liquids (physical and financial) be ""novated"" or transferred to ENA.  Beth is aware that this is a credit issue.

I have copies of four (4) financial confirms between Morgan and ELFI.  These were produced by Morgan for Trade Dates February 28, 2001 (30,000 BBL total ethane), March 6, 2001 (30,000 BBL total propane),March 26, 2001 (150,000 BBL total propane) and March 26, 2001 (150,000 BBL total propane).

Beth has probably contacted Jeff Hodge and/or Alan Aronowitz on the physical side with the same request.

Mark:

Per our conversation, attached is a short ""recap"" of the companies and amounts involved.

With respect to prime brokerage accounts, the following approximate cash balances are held by Bear Stearns & Co. (""Bear"") in accounts for the following companies:

Enron North America Corp.	$159,022		[filing debtor]

ECT Investments, Inc.		$3,923,970.84		[has not filed]

Enron Credit Inc.		$10,500,000		[has not filed]

I understand that one of our U.K. companies, Enron Credit Limited, has been in touch with one of your employees with respect to the return of the Enron Credit Inc. cash and was told that Bear wished to offset that amount against the amount owed by Enron Credit Limited to Bear under OTC trades, approx. $1,500,000, for a net balance of approx. $9,000,000.

ECT Investments Inc. sent a demand letter to you via facsimile on November 30, 2001 requesting return of its cash balance.  I do not believe that ECT Investments, Inc.has any OTC trades with Bear but I will need to verify.

We would like to resolve the return of cash issues.  Please feel free to contact me.

Thanks for your assistance.

Would you confirm whether the $250 MM was swept back by Enron Corp.?

I'm not so sure of that because we couldn't see all of the wire transfers.  There was a credit to the new entity's account in the amount of $250 million on November 5th and then there was a debit of $249,900,000 on the 6th.  It looks like that money went into a Goldman Sachs account.

Donna and Sara,

Rather that calling the SEC, a easier and a cost effective approach may be to prepare the March 31, 2002 SEC 13F filing which is due on May 15, 2002 now.

I have confirmed with Art Boos, Bowne, 713-869-9181, that we can submit and approve now and they will hold unitl the release date in May.  

Please advise if you are okay with this approach.  At Sara's suggestion, I have discussed with Robert George who agrees with the the efficacy of this approach.

Regards,
Sheila

Donna and Sara,

Executed hard copy to be sent to you today.

I will call the SEC because once you drop below the 100 million you are supposed to file for three quarters.  June 30th was the last time we were over $100 milllion so by rule we should file one more time.  I am not sure how they treat a company that is no longer in business.

The following parties have either tired of speaking with us or would still like to agree to settlement:

San Diego Gas & Electric (Not Terminated)
RBC
SEB

Francisco was handling SDG&E; I have been working on the latter two (which were both subject to termination notices).

The following parties have either tired of speaking with us or would still like to agree to settlement:

San Diego Gas & Electric (Not Terminated)
RBC
SEB

Francisco was handling SDG&E; I have been working on the latter two (which were both subject to termination notices).

These are financial ""out of the money"" swaps between ENA and various SPV's have been sent to me with the request for ""termination"" from Jesus Melendrez who is managing the ECR portfolio.

Should this be reviewed by the ""Intercompany Contract"" group?

Jesus Melendrez, who is managing the ECR portfolio, has asked that the subject swaps be terminated. None of them is in the money for ENA. I have put together a small file folder for each and Eric Boyt has been asked to provide updated values. These are in l purple folders on my desk should I not be available . I am happy to liase with Jesus but seems to me that one of the swap attorneys who is more conversant with the ISDAs, T&Cs, swaps and ENA's current position re same should weigh in. Basic question is what approval is required to terminate.  The relevant interests are as follows :

Cresendo Energy LLC - 50 % JEDI ll , 50 % Trutta
Juniper - 75 % JEDI ll, 25 % Trutta
CGAS -  100% McGarret
East Sour Lake -100 % Trutta

All,

Attached is the 11/30/01 file which is probably the best information we have.  I have screened it so that it only includes those counterparties with financial mark to market exposure.  Additionally, I screened out all Enron entities except for ENA, ECC, and EPMI.  While I cannot guaranty that the data is completely accurate, it should give you the starting point you need to proceed with processing/prioritizing financial terminations.  Obviously, the values will be different from what is specified here based on the Termination Date specified by each counterparty.

Thanks,
Tanya

Further to my voice mail, attached is a ""short list"" of FX/rate desk financial counterparties.  We will need an aggregate ENA exposure before attempting to negotiate ENA's in-the-money positions on a commodity by commodity basis (i.e., the FX/rate exposure, in particular).  I will speak with Clara Carrington about segregation of the terminated trades from their books.
 
I'd like to sit down with you and Sheila Glover as soon as possible to strategize.

Call me.  Enron MW LLC will be treated like any third party.  Since we do not have our trading order, there are no unwinds or terminations and we do not have special preference for dealing with affiliates.  If this is in the money to ENA, we may be able to expedite the process but we are still dealing with a debtor.  I'm not sure that the relationship to ENA bears different treatment.

Richard Tomaski (Chicago office) tells me that Enron Midwest (wholly owned sub of ENA) has certain hedges in place with RMT and perhaps ENA, relating to physical positions we had.  The gas is being sold on Tuesday, so they want to close out these hedges, by unwinding or terminating.

Do you have any suggestions on how to handle this?

Kay

All,

Attached is the 11/30/01 file which is probably the best information we have.  I have screened it so that it only includes those counterparties with financial mark to market exposure.  Additionally, I screened out all Enron entities except for ENA, ECC, and EPMI.  While I cannot guaranty that the data is completely accurate, it should give you the starting point you need to proceed with processing/prioritizing financial terminations.  Obviously, the values will be different from what is specified here based on the Termination Date specified by each counterparty.

Thanks,
Tanya

AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.  

For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 853-6457.  "

It is apparent after several conversations last week that we need to come to some agreement on the termination criteria for the financial contracts.  Can we all meet at 11:00 am on the 5th floor in ECS.  I will come back to you all with a room number.

Sara - will you please bring the most recent copy of your list of all counterparties and expected terminations.

Alex:

The documents look fine.  I am having the waiver reviewed by our bankruptcy attorney and I have not yet received a response.  The signature blocks will change.  The U.S. Enron Entities will require a V.P. signature.  The U.K. entity has two directors. I'll touch base with you in the morning.  Thanks for your help.

A few questions:

(1)  Where does the NYMEX amount come from (I understand that ENA has no open futures positions)?  Is it margin?  Also, what is that number today?

(2)  Why are there entries for both ""JPMorgan Chase Bank"" and ""The Chase Manhattan Bank""?  What is the difference?  For example, we have a termination notice from Chase but not JPMorgan Chase.

Thanks.

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

Cheryl:

Gordon Heaney tells me that you have received information about non-terminated, defaulting P&P counterparties (on the financial side).  We are developing a strategy for handling these types of entities and I want to ensure that ENA responds/acts consistently.  Many of the P&P parties misinterpret the ISDA documents and I observe that many are in the money to ENA, have not terminated and may be in default for failures to pay or post collateral.  Can you let me know if you actively pursued these parties for Bob Crane?

Thanks.  Sara

I punted to you guys.  She's asking specifically about strategies for terminated/nonterminated positions and other time sensitive issues.  Also wants people like Sager, Hodge, etc.

I have attached a file which shows the information we would like to send to International Paper regarding counterparties.  It includes a description of the company (but not the name), the % of total tons traded and the credit rating of the counterparty.  Can you let me know if you think this information can be given to a third party under the confidentiality provisions mentioned below?  Please let me know.

Thanks,

Subject:	RE: Forest Products Trading Counterparties

Jennifer,

I have completed my review of the selected Forest Products counterparties listed in your email request of January 15th.   My review focused on the ""Confidentiality"" provision contained in either the Master Agreement or the Confirmation(s), being the documentation which established the trading relationship with either Enron North America Corp. (""ENA"") or Enron Canada Corp. (""ECC"").   I was asked to determine if the ""Confidentiality"" provision in our trading documents would prohibit ENA and/or ECC from disclosing to third parties: (a) ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or (b) ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"".

Conclusion:  Whether the trading relationship was established under a Master Agreement or under the Confirmation(s) -- the ""Confidentiality"" language employed by ENA and ECC prohibits the public disclosure relating to the Master Agreement or to the Confirmation(s).   Therefore, if ENA and/or ECC desire to public disclose ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"" -- ENA and/ECC must first secure the prior consent of any counterparty before public disclosure to third party can be made.

For your convenience, attached are my findings as set forth in the following:

1.	Master Agreement List for the Forest Products Trading Counterparties, along with the forms of ""Confidentiality"" provisions:

 << File: master agreement list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                 << File: confidentiality - master (standard provision).doc >>                    << File: confidentiality-master (non-standard provision).doc >> 
2.	Forest Products Trading Counterparties without a Master Agreement, along with the ""Confidentiality"" provision:
	
 << File: non master agreement  list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                  << File: confidentiality - confirms (standard provision).doc >> 

If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

Cordially,

Sorry about the previous attempt.  This is the list of counterparties.  We need to know if we can disclose to third parties that we have traded with them and the volumes associated with the trades.  Thanks for your help.  Call me if you need clarification.

Sheila,

At this time, there are no updates to report on deferred compensation since the bankruptcy filing.  As you know, the assets of the plan(s) are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors.  Thus, no distributions (current or future) can be made.  We sent a letter to you on December 10th with your 11/30/01 balance in the event that you wished to file a claim with the bankruptcy court for your deferral benefit.  We also indicated that the Company would explore options with its creditors to seek approval to restart the deferral plan(s).  To my knowledge, these talks have not begun.  However, I will see if I can find out any additional information to pass on to you.

On the December 10, 2001 letter we indicated that we would forward your ""Life to Date Deferrals"" at a later date.  This follow-up letter should be sent out to you next week.

Renee

Can we have a short meeting to identify our immediate path for trade termination?  I'm not certain of the critical steps required before we can begin to respond.  

I have a short list of questions.

I apologize if you covered this in yesterday's meeting.  Thanks.

EPMI shows up only twice:

Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish County
United Illuminating Co.

Also, you have an entry for ""Enron MW LLC"" as party wtih Peoples Gas Light & Coke Co.  

Was your list intended to capture any other Enron affiliates other than Enron MW LLC?
Are there any other EPMI parties?

Thanks.  Sara

All,

Attached is the 11/30/01 file which is probably the best information we have.  I have screened it so that it only includes those counterparties with financial mark to market exposure.  Additionally, I screened out all Enron entities except for ENA, ECC, and EPMI.  While I cannot guaranty that the data is completely accurate, it should give you the starting point you need to proceed with processing/prioritizing financial terminations.  Obviously, the values will be different from what is specified here based on the Termination Date specified by each counterparty.

Thanks,
Tanya

Here's the file showing which brokers owe us cash as of close of business 1/24/02.  Look at the ""0124"" tab and under the ""Wire Day Cash In/Out"" column.  The $95.6MM represents the amount each of these brokers owes to us (We owe HSBC $2,132).  Also, I sent figures to Steve Van Hooser and Mark Taylor on 12/5/01 for the exchange amounts that were due as of 11/30 and 12/4 for $58.4MM and $87.3MM respectively.  Currently all of our exchange positions are closed.

is this the file I sent last week?  NYMEX - I would talk to Elaine Schield or Greg Whiting; however, this data is as of 11/30 before terminations and the like - so we may well have had open positions on the nymex.  I suspect it is made up of the forward value to the contracts, accrued interest, etc. I have no idea what the number is today - again Elaine or Leslie Reeves would be the best contact.  I suspect there are entries for both JPM and Chase Man because our back office was booking to both places even though that was not correct.  If the back office doesn't move the deals over, the data will be in both places.  It is all about data integrity - there will be many issues like this, I suspect.

A few questions:

(1)  Where does the NYMEX amount come from (I understand that ENA has no open futures positions)?  Is it margin?  Also, what is that number today?

(2)  Why are there entries for both ""JPMorgan Chase Bank"" and ""The Chase Manhattan Bank""?  What is the difference?  For example, we have a termination notice from Chase but not JPMorgan Chase.

Thanks.

Not from the credit side as all financial exposure is netted together for our queries.  The details can be found by tracing the exposure through TAGG, ERMS or Enpower to the deal level detail.

Francisco tells me that all of the Mexican ISDA Master Agreements provide for automatic early termination (as of the day prior to filing).  Valuation would have occurred as of Friday, Nov. 30, 2001.

The valuation info. that I had (for the parties below) must have come from the commercial people and incorrect.

I received a call from Sara Shackleton (our in-house lawyer) yesterday.  She asked us to close out our remaining futures with Carr.   Can you please close out the EURIBOR and Short Sterling futures we have left with them?  I have enclosed a list below of the positions that we show the London desk as having.  Please confirm this amount, and close out the positions.  If there is a discrepency, please give me a call tomorrow and we can discuss further.  Hope you had a good vacation.

Ted/Paul:  Could you give me a call on Tuesday morning to discuss?  I think Mary Nell will try to call me as well.  I just want to determine how Houston can assist.  Thanks.  Sara

I had a conversation with Ted Murphy and Mary Nell Browning this morning re: ECTRIC and the London process.

Ted has generated both an in and out -of-the-money list which he will forward so that Houston can review for counterparty termination accuracy.  I think that London can use our newly established processes as a template.  Ted and others will participate in the 9:30 a.m. conference call Feb. 6.

Tom and Bjorn:  Can you provide a Ted with a copy of the ""Star Gas Propane, L.P."" template, or if this has been replaced, a copy of the most recent template?  Also, the ""Liquidation of Price Risk Management Book"" template?

Alan:  Can you provide Ted and Mary Nell with a copy of the decision tree and settlement process flowchart?

If the handouts for tomorrow will be ready and incorporate the above, the handouts are all that London will need.

Thanks.  SS

Sara  I have been concerned about your status and wanted to check and see if you were still around.  (I do not know many people in the ENA/EWS but like the few I know!) 
 
I am in Brazil this week straighterning out the mess.  
 
FYI, they are actually doing financial derivatives.  The government does not recognize them as such but that is clearly what they are.
 
Talk to you when I return to Houston.

Mary Nell:

Mark Ellenberg is the N.Y. Cadwalader lawyer who is assisting Houston on a regular basis (he has an office on our floor and is available through our email system).  Mark has asked Michelle Duncan with Cadwalader's U.K. office to contact you to explore the possibility of assisting you with ECTRIC and other trading/bankruptcy issues.  I was thinking that the U.S. process for trade termination/evaluation could be replicated in London and a Cadwalader lawyer (with trading experience) could make use of Mark's experience with pre- and post-filing ""Enron"" issues.

It has come to our attention that a group of employees missed their January 15th 401-K deduction.  This was due to an incorrect employment status being fed by ENRON's SAP system to our 401-K vendor which resulted in your contribution amounts being defaulted to zero.

Your 401-K contribution amounts were restored for the January 31, 2002 payroll.  If you would like to have your contribution for the January 15, 2002 pay date taken on the February 28, 2002 pay date please respond by February 14, 2002.   If we do not receive a response by February 14, 2002 we will assume that you have decided not to have a make up 401-K contribution for the one missed on January 15, 2002.  We are trying to be sensitive to the possible hardship a double deduction could have on your personal financial situation.   If you are not contributing the maximum percentage you could make an adjustment to your contribution percentage going forward to accomodate the missed January 15, 2002 contribution.

As always we encourage all employees to review your investment elections to ensure they are consistent with your investment goals.

In case we don't hook up, the update on TXU is as follows:

As you know, TXU would like to settle and pay what they owe us.  

I met with Jeff Shorter, my counterparty at TXU last week and presented him with our list of contracts and termination dates.  They sent us preliminary numbers, which appear to be pretty close to what we're showing.  Ball is currently in their court - they are to come back to us with their values as of the termination dates we specified, and back-up for amounts that are essentially their estimates of LDs.  We have questions on their numbers for EPMI and EES, but these only represent around $2mm.  The bulk of the value is in the financial gas position.  The ISDA has not been formally terminated, and we need to agree on a date to do this.  Next step is for them to come with their version of settlement amounts for each contract - we will then provide them with ours, then go to reconciliation process.  

 	 

The first file is Harlan's list of contracts and termination dates.  The second is TXU's estimates of settlement amounts.  We discussed both in our meeting and TXU is to come back with back up for their numbers so we can agree on dates and reconcile.  I have call into Jeff Shorter to follow up - they should be getting back to us shortly.  Assuming they agree with our termination dates, and come back with their back up info, the next step will be for us to meet and reconcile numbers.  This should take place in the next week or so.  If you have any questions please call me.  If I'm not at my desk my cell is 713 826-1439.  Home number is 713 781-2966.

Tony Soter: Return of an Oregon Native 
 by Cole Danehower, Oregon Wine Report
Tony Soter is one of the most respected winemakers in the business.

 NW Wine of the Week from Andy Perdue: Powers Parallel 46
 This affordable red blend was ranked No. 1 last week at the annual Pacific Northwest Wine Fair in Toronto. Other wines in the judging included 97 Ridge Montebello, 1998 Hedges Red Mountain Reserve, Gordon Brothers Tradition, and pepper Bridge Cabernet Sauvignon. At $30, the Powers wine was the least expensive of the entrants! Gorgeous bottle, too.

 Chris Camarda's delicious and hard to get Merlots- 2000 vintage is  made from ""his best fruit ever"".
Robert Parker says of Chris's wines: ""Andrew Will's wines have virtually perfect tannins. They are present but buffered by the loads of dominating sweet fruit. Furthermore, what is amazing about Chris Camarda's wines is that they are concentrated yet grateful. Camarda's (wines) blend power with elegance, concentration with finesse, and supersweet fruit with definition. Chris Camarda is a brilliant winemaker.""

Sure; I think we can do that now.  I thought we might approach it as we organize each file on a counterparty basis but we certainly do not need to wait.  However, we will not be able to reconcile trades, etc. until we have the credit review for each counterparty and I expect that this may be a hindrance.

FYI.

Do you think we should begin the process of sending letters asking for back-up from the counterparties who have sent us termination payment notices, but where we believe we are in-the-money?

Attached is a list of the counterparties who have provided termination payment calculations.  I have identified whether or not such counterparty provided backup to its calculation, but obviously cannot determine if such backup is sufficient.  For all new notices, backup will be identified when the notice is recorded on the termination log.  I did not look at the ECC or London entities.  For the US entities, we have begun to make files for those counterparties who submitted a calculation, but the files only contain the termination notices at this time.  As I understand, we will be focusing on the non-terminated in-the-money, then the terminated in-the-money.  Therefore, we have not begun pulling the contracts for these counterparties.


 << File: Counterparty Calculations.xls >> 

We have been concentrating on the non-terminated in-the-money financial contracts.  For each counterparty, we are pulling 1) the financial agreement, 2) all financial confirmations live as of November 30, 2001, 3) any physical agreements for that counterparty, and 4) any physical confirmations live as of November 30.

Scotie:

Here are three ideas.  He does need a DVD player.  Also, you might consider a black belt (to wear with suits) and a combination money clip/credit card holder (I saw them advertised by Tumi and other labels).  I always have to guess as to what he needs.

See ya soon.  Sara

Hi Sara
How are you doing? I am so sorry to hear about all the stress happening over there. I am thinking about and hope you can take a vacation soon! Things here are fine. Just getting ready for the holidays. I was hoping to talk to you about gifts for my dad. I am not sure what to get him. I got him a subscription to Sports Illustrated and was thinking about getting him  DVD player. What are your suggestions?
Anythign would be a huge help! And I am excited to see you in New Orleans too. I am there for a week and hoping to spend some time with you all. Have a good day.

I spoke with Barry Taylor-Brill.  He is interested in having me meet people in his organization and we will come up with some possible dates.

Thanks.

P.S.  Check out the NY Times today - lots of us lost our deferred compensation at the expense of those ""in the know"".

Enron Financial Energy Trading LLC (""EFET"") is ultimately owned 100% by Enron Corp.

There is no org chart.  Financials of all Enron subsidiaries are consolidated with  Enron Corp.

Sara,

Have you been able to get any information on the corporate ownership of EFET.  ABN/AMRO requries this information to make decisions on the disposition of their trades with us.  Ideally, they would like a corporate org. chart and balance sheet.  

I am also going to contact Ted Murphy and Eric Shaw.

Thank you

As we build the matrix of data discussed yesterday in our meeting we are encountering some missing data.  Below is a list of counterparties which are listed as terminated (in at least one of the various lists of counterparties we have) but which don't have termination dates.

BP Corporation North America Inc.	
ConAgra Trade Group, Inc.	
Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch	
Hallwood Energy Corporation	
IGI Resources, Inc.	
NJR Energy Corp.	

Can you please reply with termination dates for these counterparties.  Let me know if you need additional information.

Thanks

Dear Mr. Taylor-Brill:

I believe that the best direct jet service between Houston and Charlotte is via US AIr.  Continental has fewer flights and uses other carriers (unfamiliar to me).

For example:

USAIR #586 departs Houston at 7:50 am and arrives in Charlotte at 11:10 am
[USAIR#1620 departs Houston at 6:30 pm and arrives in Charlotte at 9:46 pm]
USAIR #897 departs Charlotte at 5:10 pm and arrives in Houston at 6:59 pm

I am certainly open to other options.  Please advise if there is anything further that I can do.

Regards.  Sara

ENA has ITM terminated positions with six bank counterparties (identified below).  Settlement is part of the ongoing EGM liquidation.

We have an approximate $70 million ITM position with Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P.  I have collected all confirms for rate/currency and weather. We need the MTM values and confirm list now because we cannot have PWC validate or pursue negotiations with Goldman.  This is the most urgent matter.

With respect to the remaining five bank counterparties, I have collected rate/currency confirms.  I need nat gas and liquids confirms, MTM values, etc.to proceed.

Can you please identify Goldman confirm numbers and MTM values now?  PWC will also need.

Also, can we establish a priority for the remaining bank counterparties?

I know you guys are busy so let's talk soon.  Thanks.  Sara

Alan:  We need Ed Smida's help with prioritizing the EGM in-the-money requests from Beth Apollo's group.  Beth is only focused on physical gas and power appearing on Don Miller's list.  Ed S. can really help me and PWC in bringing a small but discrete number of EGM parties to the top of the list.

Of these positions, where the counterparty has not terminated, and there is only FX/rate activity, I find only:

Goldman Sachs & Co.

Laurel and Clara are reviewing this one - it may be repo activity.

I am still trying to clarify what we can be doing for in-the-money terminated positions.

We can discuss further at 2:30.

Mark:

I don't know what your schedule is this week but I want to discuss ENA's response to counterparties who do not respond to our request for settlement calculations and methodology (e.g., Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P., J.Aron, etc.).  I understand that you may not be the lawyer to handle a response; this is a ""protocol"" issue.

Also, on the financial trading side, I have another ""protocol"" issue with respect to nonpayment by non-terminated counterparties (under the ISDA, GTC's or Master Energy Price Swap Agreement).  Specifically, let's discuss ENA's approach and use of a possible ""test case"" in this area.

Thanks.

I am not familiar with Enron Re but on the offset side I'd be concerned about (1) different creditors for ENA and Enron Re and (2)  ENA's offset position (with respect to the Creditor's Committee).  I am not certain that we have clarified the estate's setoff position.  Also, are the receivable and trades related?  Sara

Alan,

There is an outstanding $4m receivable due from Enron Re to ENA and various premiums in a lesser amount due from ENA to Enron Re (in relation to cover for the AIG puts). The EGM people are talking about offsetting one against the other. The rationale behind this ""internal"" settlement is not obvious to me but I am likely not in possession of all the facts. Do you know anything about this? How do you propose we handle? Thanks in advance. DEC

The top ten ITM non-terminated ENA MTM positions in financial gas:

Louis Dicarlo is assisting the effort in active financial gas (commercially).  Due to the large number of open gas and power positions, the immediate focus is open gas (financial)/power (physical) positions.  Due to the huge volume of information to be retrieved for each counterparty on a global basis, it is difficult if not impossible for Bob Hall/Beth Apollo to complete the data collection if the counterparty is not in this immediate focus group (I don't have the latest electronic version of the counterparty status produced by Beth).  By copy of this email, I will ask Bob Sevitz to determine if the top ten ENA ITM financial gas files have been completed (probably very close to completion).  The MTM numbers will then be validated by PWC.

The top 90-150 non-terminated ENA ITM financial gas parties have had their contracts reviewed and we are awaiting Bob/Beth to collect and validate data. Advise if you need an exact count.  We are in the process of notifying the parties in this group of possible payment defaults.

Hope this helps.  Please let me know if you need further assistance.

Bob:  Please advise of status of top ten financial gas ENA ITM files.

Can you give me a status on this request?  I have your name as the contact person to accomplish this.

Thanks!

As mentioned, we would like to review gas financial transactions.  As a start, we would like to obtain confirmations, and individual transaction MTM's, for the transactions associated with the 10 largest In the Money counterparties (as measured by positive net MTM)

That's always been an issue.  I don't think that Angelo handles all commodities.  ENA also books financial weather, paper/pulp, rate/currency, crude, steel, plastics, etc.  Credit Ag can pick up all products so Beth Apollo should be able to verify.  Sara

Ed made the point that we need to make sure we have picked up all commodities associated with the contracts we send demand letter for.  I'll talk to Angelo to see if he picked up all commodities.  If not we may need to slow down (unfortunately) in order to sweep the landscape for other commodity unpaid invoices (besides gas).

Sara- I am sorry to hear Frank has left.. have you spoken to him, is he OK? How are you doing?

Can you please tell me how you are dealing with counterparties who still have exposure to Enron?

I know all contracts are null and void.. what is the process for them to take off deals.

The only counterparties I have with any exposure are:
tudor
wexford

I am asking for them specifically.

Also, on monies we owe counterparties.. like tudor and catequil, what is the process they must go through?

Thanks very much,

Hi guys,

This is an article that ran yesterday in the L.A. Times, and I believe on
Sunday in the New York Times by Rod Smith on Chardonnay.  D-G gets a nice
mention so I thought I'd try to pass it along.

Let me know if this comes through since it's the first time I've attempted

I used to be a staunch ABC man. ""Anything But Chardonnay"" (and Cabernet) was
my motto. I was simply bored with the sameness of the oak-flavored grape
syrups so many California vintners were producing from the state's two
predominant varieties.

Sara,

I sent you an invitiation to a meeting earlier today and noticed that I scheduled it for last Saturday; my apologies.  Anyway, Louis and I are trying to get together with you and Alan Aronowitz to get up to speed on the status of Live CP's that were sent Demand Letters and to begin determining a process for moving ahead with terminated CP's.

We are able to meet in your building at whatever time works best for yours and Alan's schedules.

Subject:	CP Contract Information

As we move forward with CPs we need to know weather there is 1-way or 2-way termination payment methodology in the contract.  (Plan is to add a column to our spreadsheet to track this.)  You have mentioned that almost all CPs are 2-way.  What is the best approach to determining which CPs are 1-way versus 2-way?  

Additionally, there is other data we need to complete our spreadsheet, such as:
Contract type (ISDA, GTC, other)
Global contract number
What are your thoughts on getting this information?

I thought you've been saying Financial are largely 2-way but a few are 1-way and we would need to check for those.  Now ""financial contracts are 1-way.""  I'm confused.

(1)  Received a voice mail from Bill O'Brien (credit manager) of Select Energy at 860-665-2376.

He says that payments were previously made on the referenced invoices and he is pulling the data together.  He wants to talk on Thursday.  Louis, can you call him please?

(2)  Received a demand letter from Stone Energy Corporation which cites ENA's (i) failure to pay Stone $46,564 under the swap EV3943.1 which will be a default in 2 business days, and (ii) bankruptcy.  Stone may later designate an Early Termination Date.

Stone will also offset amounts owed by ENA Upstream Company to Stone.

Louis:  we need to verify the swap payment issue and I'll have a copy of the letter sent to you.

We need to revise the Master Log to specifically identify ALL of the parties to the Master Netting Agreement between the Dynegy group and the Enron group because all contracts subject to that Master Netting Agreement were terminated effective as of December 20, 2001.

This should pick up Dynegy Canada Inc. and ENA pursuant to the Mster Agreement dated as of 6/16/95 and cause our recent default notice to become moot.

I have not pulled the Master Netting Agreement today.  Let me know if you have any questions.

This appears to be an open position since neither party has terminated on the Master Log.

(1)  Any reason why one party cannot terminate?
(2)  Is this a single swap or several?
(3)  I think PWC ought to reveiw our ""valuation"" (and Bob's curve) since it becomes a matter of public record when the claim is filed in the bankruptcy.  Any valuation ought to be documented.

Carlos Ruiz is asking for the value of the ENA/Garden State Paper (GSP) swap to be included as a creditor in the GSP bankruptcy.  GSP is a bankrupt affiliate and the purpose of the valuation is not to settle but merely to show the claim that ENA has against GSP.  Can I provide him a MTM on the position?  

The internal attorney involved is Cheryl Lindeman.

Jim:

Are you looking solely for Enron Corp. executory contracts?

We can identify the Enron Corp. ISDA Master Agreements (which are safe harbor contracts under the Code) as well as securities contracts (also safe harbor contracts).  Please be a bit more specific.

Thanks.  Sara

There is a requirement to identify all executory contracts--that is all contracts that are currently active and still have performance required by one party or the other(s).  You each have probably already been asked to list those for somebody as part of the gathering effort.  If you have not, I am asking that.

Would you please let me know whether you have already engaged in this effort and provided the information or, if that is not the case, give me a list of those types of contracts that you know of [or tell me where I can go---maybe I shouldn't have started that way (joke)--to get such a list]?

Thanks.  I appreciate it."

Just a reminder that ENA received a letter from Tri-State last month and you are going to verify that Deal Nos. YB 5708.1 and 5833.1 are the only active financial deals with ENA.  If you can confirm, then we can indicate on the Master Log that Tri-State has actually terminated all outstanding trades effective as of 2/27/02.

I just received two letters from IR dated 12/6/01 and 2/1/02 which were probably in a black hole somewhere or on Elliot Bonner's desk.  IR is terminating Commodity Swap Y810701 and demanding payment from ENA.

Kevin, can you please confirm that Y810701 is the only active financial swap between the two parties?  If it is not, then we cannot reflect that IR has terminated its swap(s).  We will also need

Scottie:

I heard about your new job and, what can I say except ""Congratulations!"".  I'm really excited for you.  I'm also glad you stuck it out at Entertainment Weekly because that job will look good on your resume, especially because you had the gumption to remain for a full year.  

Believe it or not, your dad is very ""with it"" and knows what goes on in the real world.  I think that he would probably appreciate a candid discussion with you.  The reality is that he cannot control what you decide to do with your life, he wants you to be happy and he wants to protect you from all of the bad things that can happen in life (if he had that power).  Since you have decided to tell your dad about your decision, I think you should talk to him like you always do and listen to him the same way he will listen to you.  You guys have a terrific relationship and you should keep it that way forever (you know fathers and daughters are really special).  He may or may not be happy with what he hears but he would rather hear it from you than from someone else.

I'm looking forward to seeing you (briefly).  Tell Park hi.

Sara

Hi Sara
How are you? hope you are doing well. I just got off the phone with my dad so i was thinking about you and wanted to say hi. I am comign home next weekend (March 22) and will be happyy to see you that saturday. I am only in town for like 40 hours so it is a short visit but i am looking forward to it. 
So I am sure my dad told you but i am taking another job. Starting Monday, I am the new Merchandising asst for Old Navy women's division and i am really excited about this. So Friday is my last day at Entertainment Weekly so this is a huge change.
I also have some other news but this is just btw you and me for now. I am working on ways to tell my dad so I wanted to see what you would suggest and advise. Park has asked me to move in with him and so I have decided that I want to do that. He and I are not ready to get engaged at all and not ready to get married but we are so in love and pratically live together now so this just makes sense. But i do not want to make my dad upset and am not sure how he would feel about this..... and so I was hoping you could give my any advice or suggest a way to tell this to him.... I hope that this does not put you in an awkward position and if so, then pelase tel me and I will not ask you anyhtign about it again. 
 
Thanks Sara. I hope you have a nice Monday and I am excited to see you in two weeks. Talk to you soon

Spoke with Dale Ginter (bankruptcy lawyer).  Problem is that Merced wants to cut a deal and terminate if they can pay over 18 months.  I explained that we would terminate if he didn't.  I agreed to not act today and advise him of our decision.

You should show ""Hallwood"" as the terminated party (see Louis's email below).  I don't know when the acquisition took place but we would normally hear from Global Contracts about name changes, acquisitions, etc.

What exactly do you need?  I believe the new entity is ""HEP Pure"" and the termination was effective 12/3/01.  You should follow up with Susan Bailey or Blake Estes.

As we build the matrix of data discussed yesterday in our meeting we are encountering some missing data.  Below is a list of counterparties which are listed as terminated (in at least one of the various lists of counterparties we have) but which don't have termination dates.

BP Corporation North America Inc.	
ConAgra Trade Group, Inc.	
Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch	
Hallwood Energy Corporation	
IGI Resources, Inc.	
NJR Energy Corp.	

Can you please reply with termination dates for these counterparties.  Let me know if you need additional information.

!!=09
[IMAGE]=09   Dear Wine lover  We've been offering  Broadley and Beaux Frere=
s' new 2000 vintage Pinot noirs at a pretty big discount, and they are abou=
t to raise their prices by $10  a bottle. This is a great last minute chanc=
e to save a lot of  money (save about $120 a case!). And we are still offer=
ing a 10% discount off the sale price on a full case when you  use 3 day ai=
r to ship.   [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]               [IMAGE]  Beaux Freres winemake=
r Mike Etzel Trying the 2002 vintage   Beaux Freres  Pinot Noir 2000 $56.99=
 SALE  will be  $68.99 after Friday This is their standard bearer- their  f=
lagship wine that gets such high ratings each year. The 99 was one of two O=
regon wines on the ""2001 Wine Spectator Top 100 Wines  of the World"" list. =
This wine should do at least as well.   An excellent vintage from Ribbon Ri=
dge, the 2000 has a deep  saturated ruby/purple color. Ripe black cherry, c=
ola, and blackberry fruit dominate the bouquet. In the background a hint of=
 spicy  oak can be discerned. Still youthful, this medium to full-bodied wi=
ne has a layered palate, moderate tannin and a sweet, long  finish. It is a=
lways difficult to compare one vintage to another, but 2000 may represent a=
 hypothetical blend of 1998 and 1999. It  is not as powerful, muscular or t=
annic as the 1998 nor as forward, charming and accessible as the 1999. It i=
s a big wine and  certainly ranks with our finest vintages to date: 1993, 1=
994, 1998, and 1999.   JEAN SAYS; THIS IS GREAT WINE! 4-12 YEAR CELLARING, =

eyard 2000 $44.99  SALE  will be $56.99 after Friday    Their finest Shea V=
ineyard offering to date. It displays a healthy  saturated dark ruby color =
with purple nuances. Shea tends to be a seductive, open-knit effort, even i=
n a more tannic year such as  2000. Copious sweet, creamy, black cherry and=
 berry fruit intermixed with toasty wood emerge from the wine's aromas. Med=
ium to  full-bodied and fleshy, with more structure than previous vintages,=
 the 2000 offers the vineyard's hallmark black fruit and a  silky, lusty, h=
edonistic personality. It should drink well young , and evolve nicely for a=
 decade. Vineyard Manager: Dick  Shea.  Beaux Freres  Belle Soeurs Temperan=
ce Hill Vineyard  2000 $44.99 SALE will be $56.99 after Friday   Their firs=
t offering from Temperance Hill Vineyard, located in the Eola  Hills of the=
 Willamette Valley. This dynamic wine possesses a saturated dark ruby color=
 and a sweet nose of cranberry, strawberry  and black cherry fruit. An impr=
essive attack is followed by moderate yet ripe tannin. The wine reveals sed=
uctive aromatics, fine  density, medium to full body, and plenty of materia=
l, but it will require a year or two of cellaring in order to shed its tann=

Bob and Sarah,

Further to our conversation on Wednesday night, we have identified the top 10-15 counterparties from both a terminated and non-terminated perspective that we want to begin working on.  Of the non-terminated, 6 are counterparties that should be sent demand letters.

Shari Mao will be providing you today a list of those counterparties that owe us money and should be sent demand letters.  Lynn Shivers will be pulling these contracts as well as those for the overall top 10 to 15 and we will begin the binder process and get you copies of the contracts as soon as possible.  We will also do the credit agg check for collateral and any overlap with other commodities.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Would you be available sometime on Tuesday, March 18 to conduct (again) your bankruptcy discussion for a smaller focused paper and pulp commercial group?  I'd like to schedule as soon as possible.  We can meet at your convenience.  Please respond.

In a letter dtd 3/13/02 Ormet said they wired to ENA $14,645.03 (plus interest) to cure a contract default.  I've been watching the cash inflow spreadsheet that gets published daily but haven't seen these funds on that report.  

Can you let me know whether you see any such payment from Ormet?

Sara

We have a bid on the 91,674 MLMG shares held in account # 102-25786-USD-27 at Bear Stearns.
.
Paul Voigt from Jefferies (00 1 203 708 5800) showed us a bid of $2.25 several days ago. The bid now
may be $1.50 only due to size of the holding & illiquidity in the name.

We've discussed selling this position with Mike Breughel & Alexander Sheers at Bear Stearns, and 
Alexander has asked for you to talk to Bears directly.

Can you call Alex & ask if one of the Bears prime brokers can contact Jefferies to execute the trade,
and also to arrange for the proceeds to be paid back to our Citibank account in London.

Thanks
Simon

ENA executed an ""Assignment and Novation of Transactions"" effective 9/1/01 as to certain derivative transactions appearing on the attached Exhibit A reflecting that the HESC position would be assumed by Energy Marketing, a division of Amerada Hess Corporation.  ENA was never provided with an executed version of this instrument by the two Hess parties.  The assignment does not state that the transactions will be subject to the ENA ISDA with Amerada Hess Corporation.

Amerada Hess Corporation terminated its ISDA with ENA on 12/3/01.

(1)  Louis/Mike:

	(i)  We need a copy of the fully executed assignment document.  Please forward to Samantha.
	(ii)  You need to verify that all outstanding transactions appear on the attached Exhibit A to that assignment.

(2)  Samantha:

When we receive the fully executed assignment document, we need to insert into the Amerada Hess Corporation file and conduct a contract review.  If all outstanding transactions were assigned, we need to note in the Hess Energy Services Company, LLC file that no further action is required in that file.

(3)  Angelo:

If all of the above occurs, then we will conclude that the invoices should actually be paid by Amerada Hess Corporation which has terminated.

I spoke w/ Johnny Nor at Navajo today.  I told him that ENA could not wait any longer for Navajo's decision.  They have until 4PM Houston time TODAY, 3/20/02 to get a termination to ENA (via Stephanie Panus' fax: 713-646-4818).  He understands that if they do not terminate today ENA will terminate Navajo TODAY.  He gave me his fax number, 505-748-6742 (note that this is different from the fax number used for the demand letter).

Susan: Notes for the DDL.

Stephanie: Please watch the fax for a document from Navajo.

Sara: Based on the conversation w/ Nor I think we should be prepared to send a termination.  (Don't think Navajo will terminate.)  Call if you have questions.

I agree that the deals that the list of open transactions that Kern provided is all inclusive.  I have left a message for Alan Kornicks, Kern, to call me back to discuss the settlement process they have proposed.  Additionally, I will speak with Ed McMichael regarding our ability to settle and what steps need to occur prior to accepting Kern's termination letter."

Do not proceed with any action relating to a potential auction of financial trading contracts.  You will need to have the process approved internally, with the creditors' committee and by our bankruptcy lawyers.

I have copies of ""processes"" which were implemented by the physical power group which you may want to see and use as a template.

Mike:  the ""teaser letter"" has not been approved by Weil and we will need approvals before we can go forward.

Cindy's email address is:   cindy.ma@ey.com and her cell phone number is 917-680-7810.

Cindy Ma is currently in transit back to New York.  Although she doesn't know who I am, I will leave her an email and voice mail detailing who you are and the urgency of your situation.  You should do the same by email, voice mail and fax.  I suggest a deadline for E&Y to respond to you since I was told in a voice mail from Tony Buggs that any delay whatsoever will frustrate your process for a sale on Friday, December 21.  I am not at all familiar with the details of your proposed transaction but I would alert E&Y to the reasons why you need their ""approval"" (for which there is no written procedure) immediately or else your ""value"" evaporates.  There is nothing that I can do if E&Y is slow to respond.  In that situation, I suppose I would keep calling the E&Y New York office to request immediate attention to your situation.  By the way, I was unable to return Tony's message since I received it about 10 minutes ago and it's very late in the U.K.

Just copy me in case I receive a call.

Here are drafts of the Certificates and Sight Drafts for Niagara Mohawk, El Paso electric, LG&E Energy Marketing and Energy Production Corp. (just in case it wasn't renewed).  I have put together files for each of these that include copies of the LC, the underlying trading docs and any correspondence that has been sent.    Except for Niagara Mohawk which requires copies of the invoices and that the certificate be on ""letterhead"" there don't appear to be any other special requirements.  Leslie Reeves will be faxing the invoices to us.  I will be in tomorrow until around 11.  Thanks for your help on this.

I just faxed to you BS reports as of 12/28/01.  It appears total equity is 66,367.44 USD for Enron Credit.  The  metals position is still there.  

The quality of the reports is not good.

Please verify equity you think we should be able to withdraw.

Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the ""Personal Data"" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

ENA has received a second written request from a financial counterparty (Union Spring Fund Ltd.) for the return of $150,000 cash collateral plus interest.  The cash was posted as initial margin on trade date of the swaps.  We have confirmed that all trades were terminated as of mid-December, 2001.  The counterparty has not sent a ""termination letter"" as there was nothing to terminate, but has sent a letter requesting return of the collateral.

Although we may not want to return the cash, aren't we obligated to do so?

ENA received a termination notice dated December 11, 2001 from Tribune of the 8/21/97 ISDA Master Agreement and all outstanding transactions.  The Early Termination Date is December 12, 2001.

The Tribune claims it owes no payment but is seeking return of $34,000,000 in ""damages.""

We need to identify all trades and identify the Settlement Amount for our response to them.  Are we holding any margin? 

Please call to discuss.

Lisa:

ENA has received a second written request from a financial counterparty (Union Spring Fund Ltd.) for the return of $150,000 cash collateral plus interest.  The cash was posted as initial margin on trade date of the swaps.  We have confirmed that all trades were terminated as of mid-December, 2001.  The counterparty has not sent a ""termination letter"" as there was nothing to terminate, but has sent a letter requesting return of the collateral.

Although we may not want to return the cash, aren't we obligated to do so?

sara -- to bring you up to speed, BNP Paribas decided they could not go forward with the transaction.  We were able to get GenRe back into the trade late Friday night and are attempting to complete the novation/assignement over the next couple of days.  In order to reduce concerns over potential clawbacks, I think it is best to take this transaction through the Houston process.

Can you let me know exactly what needs to be done and I will start working on our side.  Thanks.

      Dear Cheryl,

      I've again had inquiries from our Geneva affiliate, Cargill
      International, S.A. (""CISA"") regarding an ISDA Master Agreement
      with Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.  Are

      documents.  If this is the case, please note that CISA enters
      into its ISDA Master Agreements without benefit of a Credit
      Support Provider or a Credit Support Annex.  Regarding their

      Dear Sara & Cheryl,

      I have been asked by our affiliate in Geneva, Cargill
      International, S.A. (""CISA""), to begin negotiations for
      them on an ISDA Master Agreement with Enron.

      There had been some question as to which Enron entity
      was to enter into an ISDA with CISA, but the latest
      information they had (possibly from someone in an Enron
      office in London?) was that it should be Enron Capital
      & Trade Resources International Corp.  FYI, Cargill
      International, S.A. is located and incorporated in Geneva.

      Could you kindly advise whom I should be contacting to
      confirm this is indeed the proper Enron entity and with
      whom I should be speaking to begin negotiations?  Please
      also let me know if there is anything that needs to be
      done from a Credit or Trading perspective in order to
      get this ISDA started on Enron's part.

Per my vague voice mail, please open the attached document (Terms of Business) and look at page 12, Paragraph 20 (Jurisdiction).  This is the paragraph I am inquiring about.

Thanks, as usual.

Jonathan:

The attached document is governed by English law and subject to SFA rules and regulations.  Could you please take a quick look at the SFA provisions and let me know if you have any comments?  The SFA references appear in the following paragraphs of the Terms of Business:

page 2	-	2.2
page 4	-	4.2
page 5	-	7.3
page 10	-	12.5
page 16	-	5.1 (of Part III)
Page 18-	7.9

Also, I'm uncertain of the following:

page 13-	1.2 	Is this ""best execution"" language alright?
page 17-	7.3	Is the ""further assurance"" language appropriate for perfection of a security interest in Collateral (in England)?
page 28-	Schedule 3	Are these ""LIFFE"" terms fairly standard?
Appendix	This Appendix contains provisions for documenting CFD's.  Can't these be documented under an ISDA?

Please let me know if you have any questions.  And, thanks for your generous assistance.

Sara

Sheila:

A few points:

(1)  I've sent a request to London to review the SFA reps and LIFFE provisions; Jonathan Marsh is out of the office until Nov. 5.  Jonathan is the regulatory expert.

(2)  Page 5 -	7.1 (MDL and CLR fees/charges) and 7.2 (direct payment by CLR of MDL costs).  Do you already have a fee schedule?  Since ECT will be clearing through GSI and MC&Co., should we delete references to CLR? or shoudl we markup the CLR references as if we would be clearing through CLR?  I suppose you may decide to clear throug CLR.

(3)  Page 6 -	7.5 (account debit for fees)

(4)  Page 11-	15.2.  I don't think we would object if CLR had the right to assign to Credit Lyonnais, but does ECT need to right to assign to another entity (without first obtaining consent)?

(5)  Page 16-	4 and 5.2.  Also, will we be settling outside the U.K. per 6.2?  I didn't know if this could be an issue.

(6)  Page 19-	8.1.  Have you agreed to alternative interest arrangements?

(7) What exchanges will you be trading on through MDL?  This terms of business contains a Schedule 3 (LIFFE terms) and 7.3 of that Schedule will apply to all other exchanges per 3.3 on page 3 of the terms of business.

Thanks.

On May 22, 2001, I sent an email to you regarding the aforementioned account assignment.  I also copied Nikki Kroll on that email.  ENA and ECI are anxious to have this assignment executed but we have not had any response.  I am reattaching a copy of the assignment for your convenience.  I will need your assistance in identifying the ECI account with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (""GS"").  Stephanie Panus sent Nikki Kroll the ECI account documentation via overnight delivery on May 18, 2001.

Please direct your attention to the following:

(1)  Please execute and return to ECI an original Corporate Account Agreement with GS.  Also, please provide ECI with the account number.

(2)  Please review the attached Assignment and Assumption Agreement and advise if we can execute and forward to GS for execution.

Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

I spoke with Beth Ng (who is not a lawyer!).  Beth would like for Enron Gas Liquids Inc. and ERAC to sign the ""mini-netting"" agreements she has already negotiated with EEFT through Paul Simons.  Morgan does not need to execute this ""mini-netting"" agreement with ENA.  Morgan would be interested, however, in seeing the ENA form of Master Netting Agreement which they may also agree to sign.  But for the immediate future, the EEFT version is their primary goal.

ENA will execute an assignment with ELFI and Morgan to accept ELFI's positions in the four financial trades.

Hope this helps.

I spoke with Beth Ng (who is not a lawyer!).  Beth would like for Enron Gas Liquids Inc. and ERAC to sign the ""mini-netting"" agreements she has already negotiated with EEFT through Paul Simons.  Morgan does not need to execute this ""mini-netting"" agreement with ENA.  Morgan would be interested, however, in seeing the ENA form of Master Netting Agreement which they may also agree to sign.  But for the immediate future, the EEFT version is their primary goal.

ENA will execute an assignment with ELFI and Morgan to accept ELFI's positions in the four financial trades.

Hope this helps.

Sara-

As discussed, I am forwarding the correspondence from Beth Ng of Morgan Stanley containing the draft netting agreements (based on the Enron Capital & Trade Resources Ltd. forms provided to Morgan Stanley) to be entered into by EGLI and ERAC.  

I am attaching below, amended versions of the netting agreements that Morgan Stanley would like to enter into today.  I note that Tom Moran, who heads up EGM credit, would like to get Morgan Stanley comfortable ASAP.

Let me know if there is any problem with entering into these arrangements.

Thanks for your help.

Read the message.  I think we can help.  My question is, who is this
opinion going to be given on behalf of.  If it is from the City of
Glendale to Enron, the logical firm to give it is Glendale's ""bond
counsel"" since that is the outside law firm which 1) knows municipal
finance, 2) has an existing relationship with the City and 3) isn't
going to get into conflicts issues (which we probably would if we were
going to deliver an opinion on behalf of Glendale to Enron).

We think the Jones, Hall firm in San Francisco may be bond counsel to
Glendale, but perhaps not.  Let me know how we can help.

I would first talk to Pat Boylston at Stoel Rives 503-294-9116.  Stoel
Rives has recently opened a San Francisco office and Pat, who will know
about 90% of the stuff to give the opinion, can probably find a
California attorney from their office to finish it off. ----cgy

We are opening up an account with Fimat Canada in the name of Enron North America.  Legal is currently working on getting the execution and clearing account opened.  
This was part of the initiative last Thursday to move futures accounts to beneficial Futures clearers.

In the meantime,  Fimat Canada is requesting that we get an Give-up agreement in place with clearing going to BMO Nesbitt Burns.
We are okay with this. 

They would like to get the give up signed today.  They say it is the standard format.
Jean-Pierre at Fimat is the contact for any questions.

Please call me if I can be of assistance.

Sheila,

We have not got yet the authorization from the Fimat Group risk department
to open a clearing account for Enron at Fimat Derivatives Canada.  I will
send you the required schedules once I get this authorization.

In the meantime, for your transactions on the Montreal Exchange, Fimat
Canada will execute them and give-up the clearing to BMO Nesbitt Burns.
For this purpose, we need to have a give-up agreement in place.

Attached is a give-up agreement.

(See attached file: giveup_ENRONNESBITT.doc)

Please have this agreement signed in three copies and send them to my
attention at 1501, McGill College, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 3M8.

Also, please fax me a copy this afternoon ASAP at 514-841-6217.

Sara,

Further to my voicemail message of this afternoon, attached is the ""merger
letter"".  As it happens, both Chase and Morgan had ISDA agreements in
place.  The letter selects the Chase agreement (which, as you know, we
amended earlier this week), as the preferred agreement, and terminates the
Morgan agreement.

Please review and call me (212-270-2673) if you have any questions.  If the
letter is acceptable, please call me and I'll arrange for execution copies
to be sent to your attention.

Thankyou again for you help.

We are opening up an account with Fimat Canada in the name of Enron North America.  Legal is currently working on getting the execution and clearing account opened.  
This was part of the initiative last Thursday to move futures accounts to beneficial Futures clearers.

In the meantime,  Fimat Canada is requesting that we get an Give-up agreement in place with clearing going to BMO Nesbitt Burns.
We are okay with this. 

They would like to get the give up signed today.  They say it is the standard format.
Jean-Pierre at Fimat is the contact for any questions.

Please call me if I can be of assistance.

Thanks, Sheila

Sheila,

We have not got yet the authorization from the Fimat Group risk department
to open a clearing account for Enron at Fimat Derivatives Canada.  I will
send you the required schedules once I get this authorization.

In the meantime, for your transactions on the Montreal Exchange, Fimat
Canada will execute them and give-up the clearing to BMO Nesbitt Burns.
For this purpose, we need to have a give-up agreement in place.

Attached is a give-up agreement.

(See attached file: giveup_ENRONNESBITT.doc)

Please have this agreement signed in three copies and send them to my
attention at 1501, McGill College, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 3M8.

Also, please fax me a copy this afternoon ASAP at 514-841-6217.

Sara,

I've been working with Carrie Richardson (Andersen auditor) regarding master contracts covering interest rate and foreign currency transactions.  The Global Contracts group has been able to find almost all the contracts with a few exceptions.  

The first, between ENA and HSBC Futures Inc., was set up in the Legal tracking database but we never did receive the actual documents.  The record in Global Contracts was finally trade suspended (as a result of a previous audit) until we can locate that documentation.  We do have an agreement between the CP and RMT. [Shackleton, Sara]  This agreement is a Futures Agreement [Shackleton, Sara]  ; I'm confused about RMT's arrangement with HSBC (we only use RMT for ISDA agreements with ENA) 

We also cannot locate a master agreement between ENA and BMO Nesbitt Burns Corp.  Georgi Landau has checked the Legal tracking database and didn't find anything there either.  Carrie has requested two transactions for this CP. [Shackleton, Sara]    This agreement is a repo agreement. 

Can you please try to locate master agreements for these counterparties?  If you are not the person I need to speak to, can you please direct me to someone else?  I'd like to give Carrie an answer as soon as I can.

Thanks,

Jay and Tanya:

Legal would like to speak with one of you about the ""Chase"" and ""Morgan"" issues surrounding the Master Netting Agreement requests.  There seems to be some confusion.  I think the Chase request came from credit and the Morgan request came directly from Morgan.  The items below summarize what I know about the two different counterparties.

(1)  At the request of Chase and with Jay's approval, ENA terminated the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York Master Energy Price Swap Agreement.  All outstanding trades have been transferred to the April 5, 1994 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement between The Chase Manhattan Bank and ENA (""the Chase Master).  When the merger is complete (anticipated around November 10, 2001), the survivor JP Morgan Chase Bank will be ENA's counterparty under the Chase Master. [See Letter Agreement dated October 24, 2001]

(2)  The Chase Master has been amended several times, most recently to provide for FX forward trades and resolve multibranch issues.

(3)  Chase recently agreed that ENA propose a new ISDA Schedule/CSA.  Legal has requested a credit worksheet.

(4)  Among other things, it appears that the Chase Master currently provides for First Method.  This has never been amended.

(5)  The Chase Master is used for FX/rate and commodity trades.

On a different note,

(5)  Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. has signed ""mini-netting"" agreements with ECTRIC.  Morgan now wants to sign similar ""mini-netting"" agreements with ERAC and EGLI.  I believe that John Viverito is working on these agreements.  Morgan is currently satisfied with its status with ENA but would like to see our Master Netting Agreement and may decide to execute.  Three outstanding ELFI financial trades will be reconfirmed under ENA and I am waiting for Morgan to forward that documentation.

(6)  Both ENA and Enron Corp. have been in the process of negotiating ISDA agreements with Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc.  Nothing has been executed.  ECTRIC has an executed ISDA with that entity.

(7)  The names ""Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc."" and ""Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited"" also appear in our database but you can check that out if necessary.

QUESTION:  The Master Netting Agreement assignment list contains the name ""J.P.Morgan"".  Legal is waiting for direction from credit for preparation of the JP Morgan Chase Master Netting Agreement.  

QUESTION:  Does credit also want to send a Master Netting Agreement to Morgan?  Or should legal merely send Morgan a blank template to see if Morgan has any interest in executing such an agreement?

Sorry for the length of this message but the word ""Morgan"" raises all kinds of questions.  I hope this explanation helps to identify some of the issues for anyone involved.

Just spoke with Harvard's lawyer Kim Noble who appreciated speaking with Bill earlier this week.

ENE has triggered an Additional Termination Event under the ISDA (commercial paper rating at A-2 and ENE placed on ""watch"" status) but Harvard does not want to terminate. 

Harvard will propose an amendment to the effect that our Threshold will drop to 0 as long as a short term rating is at A-3.

 Yesterday we entered into a trade with CSFB for the block sale of our shares of common stock of Catalytica, a public company.  The shares are held in JSB Asset LLC. We now have to set up an account with CSFB on behalf of JSB Asset, LLC to consummate  the sale of our shares in Catalytica.  PLease note that the trade occurred yesterday so we are now in documentation stage.  We will most likely terminate the account immediately upon conclusion of the transaction.

 Brenda and Joel--any problems with us setting up an account with CSFB for JSB Asset LLC?

Also note that I ran this by our internal and external counsel handling the investigations and these transactions in Catalytica do not create any issues relevant to the investigation.

ENA received a letter 10/30/01 stating that Man would begin margining on a risk-weighted basis rather than using the NYMEX SPAN calculation.  This is prohibited under our futures agreement.  Man has not formally called for additional margin (which they have the right to do) but rather is withholding about $25M based upon a misunderstanding between traders about moving option positions (I'm not entirely clear about the circumstances).  Man has never claimed that the $25M was ""additional margin"".  ENA faxed a letter this morning to Man demanding the return of margin in excess of the SPAN calculation, basically a response to the letter.

ENA acounting does not have the software to execute SPAN calculations.  A recommendation to purchase the software was made by Sarah Wesner (who then reported to Joe Deffner) to accounting last year. 

I understand that John Arnold intends to move most positions (including options) from Man to Paribas.  However, this information changes frequently.

Joe Deffner signed the letter and a copy was delivered to Louise Kitchen.  Let me know if you need further information.

Tracy:  Just spoke with Michelle Sternberg.  Allegheny does not want to carve out setoff benefit for ENA because it cannot take advantage of the setoff benefit.  I told her that we still wanted the provision for ENA and could continue business under the old Merrill ""deemed arrangement"" which has whatever setoff provision we negotiated.  She'll speak with Yair.

I have spoken with our in-house regulatory specialist and she has informed
me that we cannot agree to include our regulated or non-regulated Affiliates
in Set Off under the Public Utility Holding Company Act without getting
approval from the SEC.

Please advise if we can proceed on the ISDA with carving out Affiliates in
Set Off, as per our original request.

Michelle

With respect to your setoff request, we cannot agree to eliminate setoff
for your non-regulated affiliates.  Perhaps you could provide us with the
regulated affiliate(s) for a carve out.  I look forward to hearing from
you.  Regards.

   Sara -

   As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
   incorporating
   the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
   (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is
   the
   last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would
   suggest
   that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
   since it is the final version.

    <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

   Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
   which
   point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
   page)
   via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
   Schedule with your revised Schedule.

   Thank you for your patience.

   Regards,
   Michelle

Subject:	JP Morgan Chase  (""Chase"") and Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc.  (""Morgan"")

Jay and Tanya:

Legal would like to speak with one of you about the ""Chase"" and ""Morgan"" issues surrounding the Master Netting Agreement requests.  There seems to be some confusion.  I think the Chase request came from credit and the Morgan request came directly from Morgan.  The items below summarize what I know about the two different counterparties.

(1)  At the request of Chase and with Jay's approval, ENA terminated the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York Master Energy Price Swap Agreement.  All outstanding trades have been transferred to the April 5, 1994 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement between The Chase Manhattan Bank and ENA (""the Chase Master).  When the merger is complete (anticipated around November 10, 2001), the survivor JP Morgan Chase Bank will be ENA's counterparty under the Chase Master. [See Letter Agreement dated October 24, 2001]

(2)  The Chase Master has been amended several times, most recently to provide for FX forward trades and resolve multibranch issues.

(3)  Chase recently agreed that ENA propose a new ISDA Schedule/CSA.  Legal has requested a credit worksheet.

(4)  Among other things, it appears that the Chase Master currently provides for First Method.  This has never been amended.

(5)  The Chase Master is used for FX/rate and commodity trades.

On a different note,

(5)  Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. has signed ""mini-netting"" agreements with ECTRIC.  Morgan now wants to sign similar ""mini-netting"" agreements with ERAC and EGLI.  I believe that John Viverito is working on these agreements.  Morgan is currently satisfied with its status with ENA but would like to see our Master Netting Agreement and may decide to execute.  Three outstanding ELFI financial trades will be reconfirmed under ENA and I am waiting for Morgan to forward that documentation.

(6)  Both ENA and Enron Corp. have been in the process of negotiating ISDA agreements with Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc.  Nothing has been executed.  ECTRIC has an executed ISDA with that entity.

(7)  The names ""Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc."" and ""Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited"" also appear in our database but you can check that out if necessary.

QUESTION:  The Master Netting Agreement assignment list contains the name ""J.P.Morgan"".  Legal is waiting for direction from credit for preparation of the JP Morgan Chase Master Netting Agreement.  

QUESTION:  Does credit also want to send a Master Netting Agreement to Morgan?  Or should legal merely send Morgan a blank template to see if Morgan has any interest in executing such an agreement?

Sorry for the length of this message but the word ""Morgan"" raises all kinds of questions.  I hope this explanation helps to identify some of the issues for anyone involved.

Subject:	Deutsche Bank AG (""DB"") request for ISDA Master Agreement with ECTRIC

Steve Kessler (212-469-8202) with DB legal has called to request an ISDA Master Agreement with ECTRIC.  Who is the appropriate legal contact in London to initiate this process?

DB has an ISDA with ENA.  Steve told me that DB also has an ISDA with Enron Credit Limited.  Is a master netting arrangement appropriate here?

London:  Please let me know on Monday which lawyer will handle this ISDA request.

Jay:  Please let legal know if this arrangement requires a master netting agreement.

Thanks.   Sara

Read the message.  I think we can help.  My question is, who is this
opinion going to be given on behalf of.  If it is from the City of
Glendale to Enron, the logical firm to give it is Glendale's ""bond
counsel"" since that is the outside law firm which 1) knows municipal
finance, 2) has an existing relationship with the City and 3) isn't
going to get into conflicts issues (which we probably would if we were
going to deliver an opinion on behalf of Glendale to Enron).

We think the Jones, Hall firm in San Francisco may be bond counsel to
Glendale, but perhaps not.  Let me know how we can help.

I would first talk to Pat Boylston at Stoel Rives 503-294-9116.  Stoel
Rives has recently opened a San Francisco office and Pat, who will know
about 90% of the stuff to give the opinion, can probably find a
California attorney from their office to finish it off. ----cgy

Read the message.  I think we can help.  My question is, who is this
opinion going to be given on behalf of.  If it is from the City of
Glendale to Enron, the logical firm to give it is Glendale's ""bond
counsel"" since that is the outside law firm which 1) knows municipal
finance, 2) has an existing relationship with the City and 3) isn't
going to get into conflicts issues (which we probably would if we were
going to deliver an opinion on behalf of Glendale to Enron).

We think the Jones, Hall firm in San Francisco may be bond counsel to
Glendale, but perhaps not.  Let me know how we can help.

So far the worst article, I've seen yet.


Taken from this week's edition:
 
A financial black hole 
Houston, we have a problem
Nov 1st 2001 | HOUSTON, LONDON AND NEW YORK 
From The Economist print  edition

The troubles of Enron, a Texan  powerhouse in the energy markets, could result in a new financial  crisis

JUST last year, visitors  to Enron's glittering headquarters in Houston were greeted by a giant banner  that proclaimed the firm, ""The world's leading energy company"". That annoyed  Enron's smaller energy-trading rivals, many of which have offices only a stone's  throw away in Houston's Energy Alley, but not as much as what came next-a new  banner, declaring Enron ""The world's leading company"". In recent weeks, as the  company has been engulfed by a financial crisis, that banner has quietly been  removed. 
The heady mix of  audacity, ambition and arrogance revealed by the banners is as good a guide as  any to Enron's remarkable rise and fall. Forged in the 1980s by the merger of  two troubled gas-pipeline firms, Enron drove the development of the  sophisticated spot-and-derivatives markets in energy that it has come to  dominate. Indeed, such is the scale of its operations, and its dealings with  many of the world's financial institutions, that some observers see parallels  with Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), the hedge fund  that failed in 1998-and not just because seemingly brilliant financial  alchemists have been humbled. Were Enron to go bust-unlikely, but in the current  nervous climate, not impossible-might a crisis ensue?

Troubles in California's  politically crazed power market, an ill-advised foray into telecoms bandwidth  trading and concerns about management badly dented Enron's share price earlier  this year, prompting the departure of Jeffrey Skilling, the firm's newish chief  executive, in August. Kenneth Lay, an avid free-marketeer, friend of George Bush  and visionary chairman of the firm, was obliged to resume hands-on control.  
This has not slowed  Enron's decline. Day by day, it seems to be sinking deeper into a financial  quagmire that is largely of its own creation. Not least thanks to its lack of  transparency, the firm's credibility with the markets has eroded to the point  that talk of a possible takeover or even bankruptcy is widespread.
Enron's reputation for  financial wizardry has been turned from an asset to a liability since its  third-quarter results came out in mid-October, showing a $1 billion write-off on  water distribution, broadband trading and other investments. Worse, disclosed  only in passing by Mr Lay in a conference call with analysts, the firm suffered  a $1.2 billion reduction in capital, stemming from a hedging deal with a related  private-equity fund called LJM. The charge was due to  Enron's forced sale of 55m of its own shares when the partnership was unwound  this summer. Almost nobody outside Enron had been aware of the terms of the deal  with LJM, a ""structured finance vehicle"". 
Enron's failure to offer  details about the risks from other related partnerships have led many to fear  the worst about its huge balance sheet. Its shares plunged by 19% on October  30th alone (see chart), before recovering a bit the next day.

Andrew Fastow, who was  replaced as chief financial officer on October 24th, was a general partner in  LJM . Jeffrey McMahon, his successor, has much to do to  restore confidence. Questions abound. Were the trusts run at arm's length? What  did Mr Fastow earn from the partnership? Ominously, the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) has now launched a formal  inquiry.
Moody's, a rating  agency, last week cut its rating on the company's debt to barely above ""junk""  level. Further downgrades might unleash claims from other off-balance-sheet  partnerships. Those known about, such as Atlantic Water and Marlin Water, do not  seem big enough to bankrupt Enron, but speculation is rife about what other  obligations might lurk secretly in other structured vehicles.
A lower credit rating  could destroy Enron's core franchise as the leading energy middleman, by scaring  away customers and freezing the wholesale energy markets. That might have nasty  consequences in other markets. Enron acknowledges that it is a large participant  in the derivatives market, holding a portfolio with a notional value of $21  billion. Rightly or wrongly, many traders believe that figure vastly understates  Enron's presence. If the firms on the other side of Enron's trades start to fear  that payment is not coming, they might curb their other trading, producing a  knock-on effect. Where this could end up is a subject of much  conjecture.
Utilities that trade  energy could be hit. So could the commodity and derivative operations of large  commercial and investment banks. The ties are notably tight between Enron and  J.P. Morgan Chase, according to Ventana Capital, a research firm. Not only does  J.P. Morgan provide innumerable separate credit arrangements for Enron; it also  has the largest derivative operation of any bank, as well as a large business  trading commodities. There is ""no doubt"" that Enron is on the other side of many  J.P. Morgan trades, says Ventana.
Were Enron to fail,  Ventana thinks ""it has the potential to cause a major financial crisis"", worse,  in some ways, than what occurred after LTCM . That merely  froze the debt markets temporarily, whereas Enron deals in the building-blocks  of the American economy. Imagine gridlock in the markets for gas, timber, coal,  metals, fertiliser, bandwidth or indeed any of the products Enron deals  in.
As yet, this all seems  unlikely. Many big traders were happy to deal with Enron this week, although at  shorter maturities and with less complex structures than in the past. Trading on  EnronOnline was reportedly strong. Jim Donnell of Duke Energy, a big energy trader,  described ""a huge dichotomy"" between the collapse in confidence in Enron in the  equity and credit markets and the ""business as usual"" attitude taken by big  commodity trading firms when considering Enron as a counterparty.
Yet as questions about  Enron's credit-standing spread this week, it began to have difficulty making  markets in some instruments. Few firms would accept Enron's name as guarantor of  a credit derivative. In its core energy markets some big trading counterparties  refused the Enron name. On the InterContinental Exchange (ICE), two houses reportedly specified that they would not take  Enron's credit. 
The biggest credit  exposure appeared to be with banks, whose $3 billion of back-up lines to Enron  were drawn down last week. J.P. Morgan arranged an additional $1 billion  emergency credit-line this week. This back-up, it is widely assumed, is needed  mainly to meet margin calls triggered by the ratings downgrade.

Too big to fail?
Is Enron too big and too  important to be allowed to fail? Philip Verleger, an energy economist, thinks  that Enron is so central to energy markets that it could not easily be replaced.  Enron's rivals mostly disagree, unsurprisingly.
But even Enron's worst  enemies do not (yet) expect the firm to die from its current crisis. Most  traders seem keen that it should live. ""Nobody likes to see a wholesale trader  disappear,"" says one. They admire Enron's armies of traders and their ability to  do deals. EnronOnline is one of the Internet's few success stories, assuming its  huge trading volumes do indeed generate big profits, as the firm  claims.
Enron's, and the  financial system's, problems could worsen if doubts grow about its ability to  meet its obligations. On the surface it is rich in assets, if not cash. But its  lack of transparency leaves uncomfortable room for doubt. In June 2000, The  Economist challenged Mr Lay to reply to accusations of arrogance,  high-handedness and a propensity to push the limits of the law. His response was  revealing. To show that such charges were baseless, he pointed to another firm  unfairly maligned by critics: Drexel Burnham Lambert, an investment bank that  rose from obscurity to market prominence in the junk-bond boom of the 1980s.  Drexel was accused of arrogance, he groused, but it was only being ""very  innovative and very aggressive"". Drexel was not bailed out: Michael Milken, its  star, ended up in jail, and Drexel collapsed in a heap of bad debts and  ignominy. "

Can you confirm it's not a regulated entity?  (Public Utility, etc.)
Can we get a copy of its Cert. of Incorporation (whatever you have in your

Anything else you can tell me about the activity of the entity would also be

Hi Sara
No one here seems to know anything about ERMT Corp.
Can you confirm it's not a regulated entity?  (Public Utility, etc.)
Can we get a copy of its Cert. of Incorporation (whatever you have in your
files is fine.)
Anything else you can tell me about the activity of the entity would also be
helpful.

Thanks.

I apologize for not getting back to you, Sara.  Things have gone a
little nuts here, as I am sure they have in Houston.

My basic question about whether I am the right guy for you is:  Do you
really want to sue this firm if things turn bad?  Wouldn't you rather
turn on a firm which doesn't have an ongoing relationship with Enron?

In other words, what good is an outside opinion to you really if its
contradicts the in-house opinion your receive.  What good is it if it
just confirms the in-house opinion but is wrong.

My suggestion would be to seek an opinion from Glendale's outside
financing counsel.  That should give you a clear signal whether outside
counsel with independent skin in the game is willing to back the City's
opinion.

Sorry I am not being more help on this.  Let me know if there is more to
talk about.

no - this should be for FIMAT USA, Inc. right?

can you fax their form of guaranty to Clement Abrams and I'll speak with him?  I don't think ENE will accept FIMAT's form.

Clem:

Attached is my proposed form of guaranty (format accepted by Societe Generale when ENE executed guaranty for credit arrangement to fund FIMAT USA, Inc.'s margin calls to ENA).  FIMAT will not trade without an ENE guaranty.

Sarah Wesner will fax the form of guaranty submitted to us (ENE) by FIMAT.  If that format is acceptable, we're done.

Please let me know what you think.

We are moving futures positions ASAP.

Sara,

I just left you a voice mail about this.

We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.

Please tell me if this can happen.

Sara,

I just left you a voice mail about this.

We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.

Please tell me if this can happen.

Thanks,

Tom"

Sarah:

Per my voice mail, attached is the ""draft"" guaranty for FIMAT (you have a hard copy).  I can't remember if I marked any other changes on ;your version that are not in the attachement.

I would let FIMAT know that Soc Gen just signed this version (except for the cap) in December, 2000.  I have a copy of it in my futures agreement file.

If you need any help finding this while I'm out, please call Marie Heard at X 33907.

Raj:  CAVEAT:  I never heard back from Tanya about whether the CSFB confirmation would have a carve-out for margining pursuant to the master agreement.  Bob was going to send me the format he drafted for  the prior CSFB deal but which was never executed so that I could incorporate that language.  Tanya may agree to allow this trade to margin under the agreement just like the confirm which terminated 9/12/01.

Sara/ Bob, 

Further to my discussions with Sara yesterday evening, and in the absence of any email from both of you to the contrary, I conclude that the confirms as they stand now should be OK from a legal perspective, subject to the credit approval of the entities. As I mentioned yesterday, Treasa's contact at CSFB here is trying to retain CSFB International as the counter-party as was the case for the 2000 transaction earlier. 

Thanks very much for your help.

Kim:  Attached are four ""restated"" confirms formerly in the name of ELFI and now in the name of ENA.  I have reviewed the legal language for conformity with the Master Energy Price Swap Agreement and the language is fine. I previously sent you the three ELFI trades that Beth Ng had originally faxed to me.

I am not familiar with one of trades below, No. 923614.  

If you can reconcile these trades, please have executed and faxed to Beth Ng per her message below.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Please read paragraph 2 of the Termination confirmation.

It refers to the terminated transaction having ""Reference number 1980816"".

The confirmation that you  sent to me (for the terminated transaction) has a Reference number 1980815.  The termination confirmation is referenced as 1980816.

You need to correct paragraph 2 of the Termination confirmation. Then the document can be executed.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

Here is an estimate of the equity forwards that we'd like to repurchase over the next couple of months.  The dates will probably be a little different, but this should give you an idea as to the timing and sequencing.  If you need anything else, feel free to give me a call.

You are handling this counterparty from a credit perspective.  Rich Friedman from Global Markets has called to inquire about the status of this ISDA request.  Please refer to Lotus Notes to review the last action taken by Russell in February, 2001.  Please determine whether we can eliminate the Credit Support Annex from this agreement before we send another version.  You will note that this counterparty wants to rely entirely on the form used by Aron.  Russell has a copy of this agreement.

Do you want to put this on the legal credit list for follow up?

I spoke with Jeff and as we are winding down the book he asked that we just draw this out a little bit.  He feels it is not going to be needed as the book is going away.  Also there is no intention of moving any securities from one entity to the other.

How about changing the last sentence of Par. 8.1(b) to read as follows:

""The Parties shall designate Enron North America Corp. as the calculation agent for the purpose of determining Breakage Costs (such determination being final and binding on ECTRI, GSCI and the Parties) and Enron North America Corp. shall take into consideration the two Quotations and the Estimate and any other information that it in good faith deems relevant.""

The above language would preserve each swap party obtaining a quote from an ""Authorized Bank"" [NOTE:  you need to amend the definition of to provide that ENA must have the ISDA with the bank and not ECTRI!] and properly authorize ENA to serve as calc agent [which you are].  There won't be other changes to the existing Sale and Purchase Agreement.

Let me know what you think.

Please see our opinion about the procedure of Swap Cancellation
as below:


1.We appointed follwoing persons as our swap trader.

     Mr. Michael Hartley
     Ms. Yumi Ito

  of SMBC London


2.How to calculate Swap Breakage Cost

  We understnad the definition of ""Reverse Transaction"" in the
  Schedule One of the Contract means that banks (and ECTRI)
  calculate breakage cost with theoretical mean interest rate
  excluding any margin,(not with Libid)

Appreciate your confirmation

Tanya:  We have provided ENE guaranties in limited instances on brokerage accounts and futures accounts (with margin lines, e.g. most recently FIMAT USA, Inc).  The Bear Stearns Companies is an example of the use of corporate guaranties for the credit business.  Originally, Bear required a guaranty for an ENA account (holding credit positions); but that guaranty was terminated when the positions were transferred to an Enron Credit Inc. account at Bear with a new ENE guaranty.  There may be a few others but we'd have to conduct a file review.

ECT Europe Finance, Inc. is owned 100% by ENA. [Kate Cole is revising the corporate workbook to accurately reflect this ownership].

Sara,

I just left you a voice mail about this.

We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.

Please tell me if this can happen.

Thanks,

Tom"

Feel free to send the language.  I'm not sure Peter knows what parts of the agreement need to be modified.  And yes, I think it would be helpful if everyone discussed the changes and methodology ahead of time.

Sounds good.  That is the type of language we were trying to express.  Do you mind if I send a copy to Peter Anderson?  Do you think it would be helpful if we all sat down together to discuss any further changes to the document?  

Thanks for all your help.

How about changing the last sentence of Par. 8.1(b) to read as follows:

""The Parties shall designate Enron North America Corp. as the calculation agent for the purpose of determining Breakage Costs (such determination being final and binding on ECTRI, GSCI and the Parties) and Enron North America Corp. shall take into consideration the two Quotations and the Estimate and any other information that it in good faith deems relevant.""

The above language would preserve each swap party obtaining a quote from an ""Authorized Bank"" [NOTE:  you need to amend the definition of to provide that ENA must have the ISDA with the bank and not ECTRI!] and properly authorize ENA to serve as calc agent [which you are].  There won't be other changes to the existing Sale and Purchase Agreement.

Let me know what you think.

Peter,
Dan,


Please see our opinion about the procedure of Swap Cancellation
as below:


1.We appointed follwoing persons as our swap trader.

     Mr. Michael Hartley
     Ms. Yumi Ito

  of SMBC London


2.How to calculate Swap Breakage Cost

  We understnad the definition of ""Reverse Transaction"" in the
  Schedule One of the Contract means that banks (and ECTRI)
  calculate breakage cost with theoretical mean interest rate
  excluding any margin,(not with Libid)

Appreciate your confirmation

Sara:

I am following up with you regarding a timetable for the top 20 customers.  Per our conversation last Friday we had discussed that you would coordinate with the other lawyers to review the top 20 list and draft amendments for using CommodityLogic's ConfirmLogic module for the purpose of confirmations.  

The marketing team's goal for the timetable is to identify when the amendment can be ready for delivery to the customer.  Marketing will coordinate the actual delivery of the amendments to the customers at the appropriate time during the sales cycle.  Just to restate Tom Gros' goal, he would like the amendments to be drafted and ready to go so there will be no delays when the sales team reaches the point in the sales cycle to provide the documents to the customer.  The sales team's immediate focus is on the top 10 customers on this list and the amendments will need to be made available within the next couple of weeks for presenting to the customers.

If you could provide Jennifer, Kim and myself with your timetable that will help us set expectations with the sales team.  Jennifer will follow up with you on a weekly basis to get from you a status/update on the timetable to be incorporated in a marketing status report to Enron Networks senior management team.

Thanks, 
KC

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

All:

I am trying to resolve a recurring issue in the financial power group.

In the past, we have withheld payment for all swaps with the same counterparty terminating during a calendar month until the fifth Business Day after the floating price is determinable at the end of a month.  As a practical matter, calculation of the payment of an aggregate of daily transactions would conceivably wait until the last Business Day of the month when a floating price was needed for one or more of the swaps.

How do you feel about payment for multiple trades with a party having varying termination dates throughout a given month?  Is this a cash flow issue?  Do I need to involve someone from Treasury or Settlements?

Please let me know.  Thanks.

Hi Angela,

It was great seeing you in class this afternoon.  Keep
up the good work! Here is some information about my
Pilates studio as well as Pilates in general. Private
sessions in the studio are much different than the
mass mat class. At Powerhouse Pilates, I will design a
workout specifically for your body. We will focus on
your problem areas and we will increase your overall
strength and flexibility using all of the Pilates
equipment.

1. The benefits of Pilates

Pilates strengthens your abdominals, tightens your
buttocks, improves your posture, corrects your
alignment, reduces stress, alleviates lower back pain
and neck pain, strengthens and tones your muscles
without building bulk, and lengthens your body as a
whole. It helps you look and feel great, gives you a
sense of ease and confidence, and helps you feel
grounded and centered at all times.

2. Location

Powerhouse Pilates
1117 Omar St.
Houston, Texas 77009
Phone: 713-880-5307
Fax: 713-426-5466

Powerhouse is located in the Houston Heights, just 10
minutes from downtown Houston. From downtown, take
Allen Parkway to Studemont and turn right on
Studemont. Turn left on Omar and it's in the first
block on the left.

3. Hours of Operation:

Monday-Friday: 7am to 9pm
Saturday: 8am to 2pm

4. Cost:

Private session: $65 per session
Duet: $50 per person

Series cards are also available and can bring the cost
of a private session down to as low as $50 per
session. Duets are Pilates sessions with two students
and one instructor. If you know someone who is
interested in Pilates, you might consider bringing
them in so that you can work out together. If you buy
a duet series card, the price can be as low as $37.50
per person per session.

Series Cards:

Ten private sessions: $550 (save $100)
Fifteen private sessions: $800 (Save $175)
Twenty private sessions: $1000 (save $300)

Ten duet sessions: $425 (save $75)
Fifteen duet sessions: $600 (save $150)
Twenty duet sessions: $750 (save $250)

5. Payment methods:

We accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, checks,
and cash.

6. Scheduling

Appointments are scheduled on the hour and are fifty
minutes long. You will work on all of the Pilates
equipment and your instructor will develop a Pilates
routine specifically for your body.

7. Credentials

Powerhouse is owned and operated by Anne Walzel, a
certified Pilates instructor, dancer, member of the
Pilates Guild, and Pilates student of ten years. She
was certified through the Pilates Studio of New York
under the direction of Romana Kryzanowska, Joseph
Pilates' protege. Anne has taught Pilates at the
Pilates Studio at Atlanta ballet, the Pilates Studio
of New York, re:AB, and Tribeca Bodyworks, New York's
renowned Pilates studio. She danced at the Houston
Ballet Academy for 15 years as well as the School of
American Ballet, Martha Graham, the Paul Taylor
School, and the Jose Limon Institute, New York. She
has a bachelor's degree from Northwestern University
and is a graduate of St. John's School, Houston.

Problem is that if Harvard does a deal with ENA and ENA back-to-backs it withe ECTRIC, we lose it from an exposure perspective. ENA probably never records the deal since it has a closed position. Then ECTRIC thinks it has a position with ENA so we lose the third party exposure.  The simple answer, I think, is if they want to trade Brent on EOL, then they probably need an ECTRIC ISDA since ENA cannot trade Brent on EOL, right?

Tanya:

Apparantly, Presidents & Fellows of Harvard wants to trade on EOL.  They were given a long-term guest ID that has since been closed out.  However, they still want to do these Brent deals and have them booked back-to-back so that they are under the ISDA with ENA.  Two things:

1)	We do not show the ISDA in CAS
?	$20MM Threshold
?	Executed as of 11/20/00
2)	Shouldn't the Brent deals that were booked back-to-back with ECTRIC be showing up in CAS, given that the purpose of this action was to bring the exposure under the ISDA?
?	Deal #s:	QP4223 and VA0834

Are we still ok with doing this back-to-back booking?  Also, how do we feel about this entity trading Metals (or should they even be trading Metals)?

The below email is from Rod to Sara in relationship to this whole issue.  I will be out tomorrow, but I told Sara today that I would be running this by you to see what your thoughts were on the issue.  Thanks for your help!  Would you let me know of the outcome.

Hi Sara.  This issue comes up fairly often.  My understanding is that Brent deals are automatically booked to ECTRIC for tax reasons.  The Brent product stack is managed here in London by folks who live, work and eat in the UK.  Since they are in effect generating earnings for the firm 'in' the UK, the tax argument is that the Inland Revenue should collect tax on this amount.  We could book to ENA, but I here that this could cause double taxation (being taxed again by the IRS).  Perhaps ECTRIC could do a back-to-back trade with ENA at the Brent mid price - thus still managing the product in the UK but generating no UK earnings (Inland Revenue may call foul though).

Having said this, we have successfully re-booked in the past when trades were done on the phone (apparently without tax consequence).  No one has taken a hard stand on the above - that I know of anyway.  I would recommend just telling the book admin to rebook to ENA and see if we get any resistance.  Clearly, from a credit perspective we would much prefer to book both legs at ENA.

Hope all else is going well.

Subject:	Assignment of crude/Brent spread trades from ECTRIC to ENA

Hey, Rod (the ""Dude""):

Mr. Jason Williams of the Houston office has directed me to you.
I spoke with Harvard (has an ENA ISDA Master Agreement (the ""Master"") in place) who is trading on EOL (and all ENA trades are confirmed under the existing Master).  Harvard executed a crude/Brent spread trade on EOL and discovered that the counterparty was ECTRIC (and not ENA).  Boy, were they surprised!  

Harvard's request is whether ECTRIC can assign the trade to ENA.  Then, all of Harvard's trades would be subject to the ENA Master and could be netted.

Is this a commercial issue?  Does ENA need a ""Brent book"" to receive this trade? 

An assignment from ECTRIC to ENA would be only an ""accommodation"" to Harvard.  Please let me know what you think.  Thanks.

P.S.  I never made it to London in June.  My boyfriend's mother was in the hospital then and she died two weeks later.  My mother died a few weeks ago.  It's been a bad summer.  But, I'm taking a vacation from August 23 - 31 and will be in London (staying at the Ritz).  Maybe we can have that drink!

where is this coming from? are counterparties asking to be paid throughout the month? or is this coming from our side?

Subject:	Payment Date for financial power transactions

All:

I am trying to resolve a recurring issue in the financial power group.

In the past, we have withheld payment for all swaps with the same counterparty terminating during a calendar month until the fifth Business Day after the floating price is determinable at the end of a month.  As a practical matter, calculation of the payment of an aggregate of daily transactions would conceivably wait until the last Business Day of the month when a floating price was needed for one or more of the swaps.

How do you feel about payment for multiple trades with a party having varying termination dates throughout a given month?  Is this a cash flow issue?  Do I need to involve someone from Treasury or Settlements?

Please let me know.  Thanks.

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.  Thanks.  Sara

Subject:	Program Changes


As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

(2) Equity Swap on 400,000 shares ENE
(3)  Two (2) Equity Forwards on 1,025,000 shares and 1,672,000 shares ENE, respectively

The forwards contain $40 price triggers which will be adjusted through either an amendment or put.  This will be documented after the swap and forwards are signed.

Please review the trade details for the swap and forwards, including share caps, floating amounts payable by ENE, spreads, etc.  You have an email version of the CSFBI documents.

The documents are in the format agreed to with CSFBI on October 2.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Sara

Hi, Mark:

ECT Investments, Inc. is trying to finalize a ""Terms of Business Letter"" with Goldman Sachs International (""GSI"") in London (for trading foreign listed equity options).  GSI is resisting the inclusion of any limitation of liability language in the agreement.  Our agreement is governed by English law.  I have requested the following simple statement:

	""Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss of damage.""

Do you even use such a provision in your documents goverened under English law?  What language (if any) would you propose for use with an English party?

I'd appreciate your insight.

Regards,
Sara

David:

Attached is a draft confirm for a natural gas EFS under the new NYMEX rules.  Please review the redlined language.

The new NYMEX amendment permitting EFS transactions was originally part of a pilot program for Brent Crude contracts (NYMEX Rule 6.21) effective September 5, 2001.

NYMEX Notice No. 01-372 effective November 1, 2001discusses the application of the EFS for natural gas futures contracts but I cannot find a specific reference to a NYMEX rule (I assume it is NYMEX Rule 6.21).  Thus, I didn't know whether it was necessary to cite a particular rule.

I also didn't know if I need to reference the number of NYMEX contracts in my ""Special Provisions"" section.

Further, if Rule 6.21 is applicable to the natural gas futures contracts, then I suppose that the confirm should (?) recite the information required of the Clearing Member by the Exchange.  On the other hand, maybe the Clearing Member's report should contain information such as appearing in Rule 6.21A(C), if applicable, and it need not be repeated in the confirmation.

Can you give this a quick review?  Trading in the nat gas contract terminates in a day or so.  Thanks.

Importance:	High

Pursuant to the below email and our discussions today, pls find attached the list forward by Todd Delahoussaye, Financial Deal Compliance, which includes all the deals entered into with Morgan Stanley Capital Group. The deal no is QH4715. 

I am also forwarding you the confirms which we have executed with CSFB and MS, last year, which I had earlier forwarded to Bob last week. 

The contact person at CSFB is James Moran. His email address is james.moran@csfb.com

We still have to hear from CSFB whether they can provide a tax rep on their Cayman Islands entity. As per my understanding, that is the only relevant credit issue for this transaction. 

Looking forward to hearing from you on the confirms necessary for the roll-over. Could you give me a call sometime later today, when you have finished going through them. 

Thanks & Regards

Rajaram Jamadagni

Rob/ Sara, 

As indicated in the other email of today, Todd has sent me a separate list which Morgan Stanley sent to Enron. I have gone through the list and this particular deal is indeed there. The confirms for this particular deal were sent by me sometime last week (both the CSFB and the MS confirms). Will call today to discuss further.

 Todd,

The Deal number for the below deal is QH4715.  Can you tell me if it is included in the list Morgan sent back to you?


Raj,
Morgan does not actually sign and return documents per the Master Agreement.  They send a reply type of message which states that they agree to a certain deal number or numbers.  Todd will let us know if this particular deal has been agreed to in this manner.
FYI, today is my last day in this group.  Going forward you can contact Diane Anderson for anything related to Confirmations.

Hi Larry, 

You may have received a voicemail regarding the above. I am working with Treasa Kirby here in Global Finance and was wondering whether you have signed copies of the Morgan Stanley confirm for the above $150m oil prepay executed in Dec 2000/Jan 2001. We need to roll-over the oil prepay and need to discuss with the lawyers to understand whether any changes need to be made to the confirms. If you do have signed copies, kindly send both of us a copy of the same asap. 

Thanks & Regards

You MUST carve this transaction out of the CSFBI master. The margin does NO=
T flow around the structure.  If you read the confirms, you will see that E=
nron receives fixed 150MM from CSFBI day 1 and pays it back WTI basically a=
t the end of the deal (that is where all the volumes are concentrated).  Th=
us, this deal is out of the money to Enron 150MM and they can call us for t=
hat margin which we would have to post for the entire term of the deal.  Ou=
r swap with MSCG has us paying fixed, but we do not pay it until the end of=
 the deal (that is where all the volumes are concentrated). Thus, this swap=
 could allow for either party to margin based on WTI price movement - but i=
n essence, it is an at the money trade today. You will NOT be able to margi=
n MSCG.  Thus, the net effect is you have to post margin, but you do not re=
ceive any.  If you do not carve this deal out of the margin arrangements, y=
ou wil defeat the purpose of executing a prepay - you will have to post the=
 money they prepay you as collateral.  Hope it is clear - I am out of the o=

Subject:	Limitation of Liability 

Hi, Mark:

ECT Investments, Inc. is trying to finalize a ""Terms of Business Letter"" with Goldman Sachs International (""GSI"") in London (for trading foreign listed equity options).  GSI is resisting the inclusion of any limitation of liability language in the agreement.  Our agreement is governed by English law.  I have requested the following simple statement:

	""Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss of damage.""

Do you even use such a provision in your documents goverened under English law?  What language (if any) would you propose for use with an English party?

I'd appreciate your insight.

Regards,
Sara

I apologize for not getting back to you, Sara.  Things have gone a
little nuts here, as I am sure they have in Houston.

My basic question about whether I am the right guy for you is:  Do you
really want to sue this firm if things turn bad?  Wouldn't you rather
turn on a firm which doesn't have an ongoing relationship with Enron?

In other words, what good is an outside opinion to you really if its
contradicts the in-house opinion your receive.  What good is it if it
just confirms the in-house opinion but is wrong.

My suggestion would be to seek an opinion from Glendale's outside
financing counsel.  That should give you a clear signal whether outside
counsel with independent skin in the game is willing to back the City's
opinion.

Sorry I am not being more help on this.  Let me know if there is more to
talk about.

To all,
	We have expanded equity trading into the European Markets.  Along with that, you will see an increase of executing broker agreements that specialize in foreign equities.  We plan on executing a broker agreement with Metzler Capital Markets for the purposes of order flow and specialty in Italian equities.  Currently no documentation is required and we would still clear all transactions with our existing Primebrokers, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns.  In addition, Metzler clears their transactions through Paribas Milan.

The PLI has a 2-day seminar in Houston on Nov. 5 and 6 which I would like to attend (mega-refresher course for me).  The cost is $1295.  Although I have been looking for a seminar about equity derivatives, this seminar will be helpful in the context of ENE forwards and other affiliated equity deals from the securities vantage point.

Sara,
Attached is the EOL Amendment that Stacy Dickson has already prepared for Texaco and sent to Mark.  Power does not need to see it as stated below since Power does not do any business with Texaco.  Can you incorporate your financial comments into the version below?

Mark, 
Attached is an EOL Amendment for the Texaco entities.  EPMI does not trade power with Texaco so Janet does not need to see this amendment.

I've been trying to call you for about an hour, but the circuits are all busy.  Sometimes it's easier for NY to call out than for us to call NY.  I'll be in my office for about an hour before meetings.  Also, I am free in the morning.  We'll need to recall exactly where we were at the beginning of August.  Thanks.  Sara

Tanya:  FTU has asked to resume negotiations on the ISDA.  We originally sent our draft without a Paragraph 13 and FTU wants a Paragraph 13 (similar to the one FTU negotiated with ENA).  If you are agreeable to credit, can you please propose a credit worksheet?

As we discussed last week, ECT is sending a demand letter to Sonoco for the 
underpayment of $60,000.  I need the attachment which I have identified as 
merely Exhibit ""A"" to appear on a single sheet of paper (legal is fine).  We 
discussed your revision to cover the entire term of the swap AND revisions to 
the month of January, 1999 to reflect ECT's floating price as .33 (which will 
cause changes to the invoice amount and difference columns).  Also, instead 
of the term ""Sonoco Price"", I would prefer the caption ""Floating Price 
recognized by Sonoco"".  Please call if you have questions.  Thanks. Sara   "

I hope you had a safe trip back to Houston.  I found out Friday evening that 
I had the stomach flu and I was out of commission until today.  I hope I did 
not pass it on to you and Lynn.  

I noticed on Susan's report that the Duke master is still missing support 
documents.  Is this something that can be easily followed up on considering 
the possibility of entering into a trade soon?  Did we ever send them the 
documentation they were waiting for from us?  I tried looking at the swaps 
database but I can no longer get access for some reason.  Thanks.

Item 21 is actually a contract being reviewed by Bruce Harris and I.  I have 
already discussed the contract with Bruce, but last time I heard from him on 
the contract he had some questions for tax.  In any event, it is probably 
appropriate to take Andrea off of the list as the ""commercial contract"" and 
put Bruce Harris on instead.   That way people in Houston can start bothering 
the right person (ie, Bruce) when they wonder where it stands.

 Lynn and I arrived safely in Houston and the weather seems much like
Argentina
 last week.  That steak dinner was delicious and it will take me
awhile to return
 to Pappa's or The Palm.  Thanks again.  Sara

Hi All,
For those of you that don't know I am currently on a 7 week trip through
Africa, from Nairobi to Vic Falls, with my brother John-Henry. This will be
our means of updating all you boring non-traveller types of our adventures.
We arrived yesterday safe and well in Nairobi. We were tired, but had a full

day visiting an animal orphanage that raised these animals and set them back

into the wild. We were very priviledged to pet baby elephants, rhino and
zebra. We had a meeting of the folks we are travelling with and they all
seem really nice. All in their early 20's and I think I am mingling in well.

There are 8 of us on a truck made for 20 so lots of room. Last night we went

to a carvery that specialised in the local wildlife. Crocs, Zebra, antelope
that sort of thing. Today has been a long drive into Tanzania, to a place
called Arusha, from here we go off on a 3 day game drive over the serengeti.

We are staying in a place called Snakepark, which is a little unnerving, but

hell thats what we are here for.
We are both fit, well, happy and a little pink. I gave the first of those
little toys out today mum, there was a ?3yr old when we stopped for
charcoal. It took her a few minutes to touch the wiggling frog, but she
loved it. I had to bribe the others with pens so they didn't snatch it off
her. We are off now to eat as we skipped lunch and it is about 4.30pm.
Love to you all
Tessa and J-H

Hey Folks,

How is old blightey!!!
What a week J-H and I have had.
The 3 day safari around the Serengetti and Ngorongoro Crater was fantastic.
The 8 of us were split between 2 landrovers, that the rooves came off so we
had a really good view. We saw loads of game, basically everything. I was
most impressed with the 7 rhino - ok so 6 of them were in the distance and
we only knew they were rhino by looking through nans fantastic binoculars, a

quick thankyou to nan for lending them to me. And 6 cheetahs as I had seen
niether on my previous safari. Other things included 2 eagles eating an
impala up a tree, a leopard must have killed it and taken it up there, we
sat and watched a very bossy male zebra organising this whole herd of zebra
in and out of a watering hole in groups. Also elephant, lions - lots,
especially 11 sat on a large rock together, hippos, hyena, wildebeast,
warthogs, waterbuffalow, crocodile. I have probably left loads out, but you
get the drift, J-H made a list. In the evenings we camped and you will all
get to here J-h's story of the lion, but it is his story - niether lion nor
boy were harmed.
I will have to finish this tomorrow as I have loads more to say, but I have
to meet my group for a sunset beer.
Thanks Mandy for passing all this on. Give mum our love and reassure her
that J-H is really coming into his own.
Ross- don't you dare start lecturing me about settling down, you are only
doing it now and you are a dinosaur compared to me.

Love you all loads, and thanks for the replies.

Tessa

Ok Folks,
Where was I?
If you are interested we just made sunset last night and had a very welcome
cold beer.
Back to the adventure! The campsites we say in vary hugely, we range from
ones with just a hole in the ground toilet facility - like the one in the
Serengetti, to ones with proper toilets, showers with warmish water and
fully stocked bars!! In the Serengetti we were very close to nature. Too
close, we all went to bed early - this seems to be a bit of a trend, bed
before 10 most nights and up at 6, we have even made it up before sunrise a
few times. But the stories going between tents in the serengetti were of the

campers that have been lost to lions. Sure enough we certainly saw evidence
of their presence in the camp when we got up in the morning, even without
J-H's story. The next night after a long game drive, we camped on the edge
of the Ngorongoro crater, a bit windy, but warm, then as soon as the sun
went down it was bitterly cold and we huddled round the fire to eat our
supper, but all retreated to our sleeping bags soon after. It actually
turned out to be the best night sleep some of us had, especially as I always

find a lumpy bit of ground. I share a tent with a girl from Huddersfield
called Helen and we have the putting up and dismantling of the tent down to
a fine art.
The crater was fantastic, very bumpy and we were being thrown around the
back of the landrover as the driver did his best to get in front of a Rhino,

he did a brilliant job and it meant that the rhino passed by really closely.

That evening we went back to the snake park, to find our intrepid leaders
had finished doing some work on the truck. We were all desperate for
showers, even though you get dusty and mucky again very quickly it is lovely

for a while. We tried our best to wash our clothes, and managed to get the
semi clean. Since then Helen and I have discovered that it is easier to pay
a local to clean them properly and it only costs 15p for a pair of trousers.
The next day we played with the snakes for a while in the morning, they have

a baby pyhton we are allowed to hold, then J-H had a ride on a camel.
We went into Arusha to do a few things and stayed at a campsite the other
side of town, just to knock 20mins of the journey the next day. The cooking
has become a bit of a competition, J-H and I did the first dinner, rice and
stir fried veggies. Everyone thought it was great and it set a challenge for

the others, so people get a bit worried before its their turn. Since we did
just veggies, people have been adding meats, doing selection of salads,
cooking the rice with cashew nuts. It is getting like Ready Steady Cook,
when they started the chefs only did maincourses, now they do 5 course
dinners!!
We started the next day at 4.30am, it is a long drive from Arusha to Dar Es
Salaam, but we got to see the best sunrise over mount Kilimanjaro. During
these drives we are very pleased to be a select group, cos it means we get
to spread out and sleep. When we don't sleep it is really interesting to
watch the world go by and wave at the locals. They must be used to seeing
the trucks as quite a few do the same route, ours is the scruffiest - we are

very proud.
The campsite in Dar was right on the beach, we all ran in fora swim mand
gave up after we were over 100 yards in and syill only knee deep.
We had a morning in Dar and took the afternoon ferry over to Zanzibar. We
all fell deeply in love, it is the most beautiful place. We are staying in a

hotel here, Helen and I were in raptures over the ensuite bathroom and
airconditioning. We showered quickly and went off for dinner. In Stone Town
there is an evening market that is mainly selling cooked food, so you wander

down and take your pick. The first night I had tuna, squid and lobster, to
give you and idea, the lobster cost me about 80p. The group decided there
and then that we are setting up a commune here and turning our back on
civilisation.
Anywhere I can dine nightly on lobster gets my vote. We went on a spice tour

of the island yesterday, they grow everything from nutmeg to chilli to
cumerin. And all the fruit, bannanas, star fruit, mangos, pineapple, apples,

lemons etc etc, eat home even has their own tree that produces iodine for
any cuts they may get.
Obviously we went back to the market for dinner, J-H has challenged himself
to try and eat 5000 shillings worth - about 4 pounds, so far he is up to
3000. Today is a lazy day, postcards will be written etc. Tomorrow we are
off to stay at a deserted beach on the east of the island. This has been a
long e-mail - mainly for the family - cause the internet places will be few
and far between when we hit Malawi next week, so you may not here from us
for a week or 2. We will try whenever we can.
Love to all in breezy old England
Tessa

Dear All,

This is our last day in Zanzibar. We have just come back from the East
coast. It was very pretty, with few tourists or hotels. Unfortunately this
made the food and drinks more exspensive - ok, so we may only be talking
about 8p, but we are in cheap-sake travelling mood. There was also not a lot

to do, so it was 2 days of lying in the shade - the sun being too hot -
reading, playing cards and looking for shells on the beach. Boy what a tough

life I have!!
Our swahili is up to about 8 or so words.
Jambo - hello
Habari - how are you
Mizuri - beautiful
Mizuri-sana - very beautiful
Santa-sana - thankyou very much
Karibu - welcome
Fiti-Fiti - slang for very well
Thats about it.
Today we went to swim with the dolphins on the south coast. Apparently
nobody informed the dolphins and only a couple of pods turned up and they
were not in the playing mood. We got quite close to them and as soon as
anyone jumped into the water they were off - honestly you just can't get the

dolphins!!
Then we snorkelled on the reef for a while, there seemed to be quite a bit
of damage. I was really annoyed by a fella that kept diving underneath me
and picking things off the coral. Some people are sooo ignorant - sorry
Ulli, I love you to pieces - but they were bloody Germans.
We have our last meal at the harbour stalls tonight and take the 10pm ferry
back to Dar. Because of some silly rule they won't let us into Dar until
6am, so we kip on board ship.
Then we are back to our wonderfully dusty old truck and more bush camps.
As I said before Malawi is very poor and unlikely to have lots of internet
cafes so it may be a week or 2 before the next one.

Loads of Love
Tessa

Dear All,

Welcome back mum and dad, hope India was fab. The gang over here think the
Weltons are trying to take over the world.
Well, it has been a long time since the last update. This is due to Malawi
being a very friendly but poor country.
The adventures in the last 9 days are too much to go into too much detail.
The partying started in ernest at Lake Malawi, up until then the driver
thought we were a little slow, I was up late, but everyone else was flaking.

Our first big night the weltons did well, winning a drinking game each and
not being any of the 3 people that passed out. The next big night a few days

later we didn't do so well, the other boys think it is very amusing to get
J-H plastered and they have found 2 drinking games that he is really bad at.

He has even started praticing on the truck as we travel around. That night
though was a bad taste night and we had all had a budget and went to a
clothes market and bought each other outfits. Everyone was hoping I looked
bad, but a very nice unimaginative bloke just bought me an overall, I was
disappointed. All the lads had frocks, J-H had a fetching orange silky
blouse and silky skirt, he looked surprisingly fetching. Slightly less so
when passed out on the toilets 3 hrs later, or passed out on the floor in
front of the toilets, and he annoyed a few people when he woke up at 4.30 am

demanding to know where the party was - loudly. Apart from the parties we
have seen and done other things we have visited a school, a hospital, a
mountain or 2, had a tribal village meal and a brewery. That last one was
really tough. The gang are getting on really well, some how a hitch-hiker
has joined us, but he's cool. We had a couple of days of heavy rain, so
people were getting fed up with the tents, the mozzies have been on great
form, but its Africa and we love it. The crew have been trying to persuade
us to stay till Cape Town and if I didn't have fixed plans I would be here a

few more months. I shall return.
Now we are in Harare the capital of Zim. Just to make any of you sports
lovers sick, we have found out where the England cricket team are and will
be going to their hotel to watch the 6-nations rugby this pm and supporting
them in their one day against Zim tomorrow. As I said its a hard life. Last
night we went to a local night club and the band were amazing and still
going when we left at 3.30 am. I have just enough time to do a spot of
shopping before going to find Goughie and the boys.
I have probably left loads out, but nevermind, you are all going to have to
listen to my stories anyway.
Tessa

appreciate your comments.  Also, who else do you think should be a recipient 
of this memo?  Should we prepare a separate ""Action Plan"" or strategy to 
submit to Mike?  You may recall in our meeting of Friday last that Mike 
committed to assess the long term situation in BA (at least I think that's 
what he agreed to do) and we (foolishly) committed to prepare a review of our 
activity in BA.  Maybe we can discuss on Friday morning at 9 am (Houston)/12 
pm (BA).  Let us know if you have any questions.  I believe that Lynn is in a 
seminar on Thursday.  Sara"

appreciate your comments.  Also, who else do you think should be a recipient 
of this memo?  Should we prepare a separate ""Action Plan"" or strategy to 
submit to Mike?  You may recall in our meeting of Friday last that Mike 
committed to assess the long term situation in BA (at least I think that's 
what he agreed to do) and we (foolishly) committed to prepare a review of our 
activity in BA.  Maybe we can discuss on Friday morning at 9 am (Houston)/12

Sara,

This morning I spoke to Steve Morus @ Puget Sound.  He was inquiring as to 
the status of the draft ISDA Master Agreement.  As you may recall, on 
February 3rd, I prepared a draft for your review.  I beleive this draft was 
nto sent to the counterparty due to some thoughts you had concerning our IOU 
provisions.  Steve is eager to recieve the draft if such matters have been 
resolved.

Let me know if I may be of further assistance.

Susan

The Transaction must get papered whether its GTC's or a Deemed ISDA.  The

Tracy - since I 'm in class today and tomorrow will you find out what John's 
up to and circle back with Sara?  The deal should be papered as ENA.  Sara, I 
cannot imagine why we need a Deemed ISDA for a two day deal....if John 
indicates plans for additional deals, we may want to pursue, but I don't 
think its necessary at this point.

1.  Thursday's Market Action

                             $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Industrials               +154.20     +1.56%   10010.73
S&P 500                        +34.99     +2.56%    1401.69
Nasdaq                        +149.60     +3.05%    5046.86
Internet Stock Index           +42.29     +3.95%    1111.96

The Dow recovered in Thursday afternoon's trading session,
making big gains before closing up sharply, while Internet and
technology stocks propelled the Nasdaq to its fifth biggest
single-day point gain ever to close above 5000 for the first
time in history.

Thursday's early market action had all major U.S. indexes
performing lower following the Labor Department's report that
the number of Americans applying for jobless benefits increased
for the second consecutive week to 280,000 from 275,000 in the
previous week.  At the same time, however, a more accurate
longer-term measure showed that the closely watched four-week
moving average fell for the second straight week to 277,250,
which represented the lowest figure in 26 years.  Economists
view the four-week moving average as a more dependable indicator
of job market trends since it accounts for weekly fluctuations.

Notwithstanding the Labor Department's report, financial stocks,
which typically are sensitive to news related to potential
interest rate hikes, performed well, with American Express
(NYSE:AXP) edging up 1/8 (+0.10%) to 122 7/8, JP Morgan
(NYSE:JPM) gaining 5/16 (+0.29%) to 107 11/16, Chase Manhattan
Bank (NYSE:CMB) closing up 2 1/8 (+2.69%) to 81 1/8, Goldman
Sachs (NYSE:GS) finishing up 5 7/16 (+5.34%) to 107 3/4, and
General Electric (NYSE:GE), which has a substantial financial
services component, rising 1 1/16 (+0.82%) to 131 3/8.

In other financial stock news, Deutsche Bank AG, Europe's
largest bank, and competitor Dresdner Bank AG, the third biggest
German bank, jointly announced on Thursday that Deutsche Bank
would commence a $30 billion takeover of Dresdner in a
transaction that would create the world's largest bank with $1.2
trillion in assets.  Under the deal, the combined company would
close approximately 800 branch offices and reduce payroll levels
dramatically.  It is estimated that these cuts would result in
annual cost savings of over $2.75 billion.  Following the
announcement, Wall Street began speculating about whether this
deal would put increasing consolidation pressure on U.S. banks,
including financial giant Citigroup (NYSE:C), which edged lower
by 7/16 (-0.87%) to 50 1/16.

One of the strongest performing sectors on Thursday was the
pharmaceutical idustry, with Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY)
jumping 12.04% (up 5 3/4) to 53 1/2, Merck (NYSE:MRK) gaining
6.93% (up 3 15/16) to 60 3/4 and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) closing up
8.11% (up 4 1/2) to 60.

Insurance powerhouse Metropolitan Life Insurance announced on
Thursday that it would acquire the remaining interest in
insurance asset manager and research firm Conning Corp.
(Nasdaq:CNNG) in a deal valued at approximately $68 million.
MetLife already has a 61% stake in Conning that was captured
through MetLife's January acquisition of Conning's indirect
majority owner, General America Corp.  MetLife, which is
scheduled to trade its shares on the New York Stock Exchange by
the end of March, increased its offer from $10.50 per share of
Conning to $12.50 per share.  Shares of Conning gained 15.98%
(up 1 11/16) to 12 1/4, while shares of other companies in the
insurance space performed well, with Chubb (NYSE:CB) rising 3/4
(+1.68%) to 45 1/2, Aetna (NYSE:AET) closing up 3 1/8 (+5.77%)
to 57 1/4, and Hartford Financial Services (NYSE:HIG) gaining
15/16 (+3.19%) to 30 5/16.

Investors reacted on Thursday to the request by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) for more information relating to
the proposed $135 billion merger of America Online (NYSE:AOL),
the #1 Internet service provider, and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX),
the media and cable giant, after the initial filing by these
companies was deemed insufficient.  While a second request for
information by the Justice Department or Federal Trade
Commission frequently is viewed as a sign of potential delays in
approving a merger, analysts expect that the FCC request will
not delay significantly the agency's evaluation of the proposed
deal.  Shares of AOL rose 6 (+10.93%) to 60 7/8, while shares of
Time Warner gained 7 7/16 (+9.38%) to 86 3/4.

Among the big Dow movers on Thursday were:

<> Boeing (NYSE:BA), which closed up 3/8 (+1.12%) to 33 3/4
following the aerospace giant's announcement that an ongoing
strike could hurt the company's earnings and cause longer delays
of jet deliveries.

<> AT&T Corp. (NYSE:T), which dropped 3/8 (-0.71%) to 52 5/8
following news that Dan Hesse, president of the company's
wireless business that will be sold in what could be the largest
U.S. IPO ever, is leaving AT&T to take the helm at an Internet
start-up company.

<> Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HWP), which rose 11 (+7.81%) to 151 7/8
and was a driving force behind Thursday afternoon's recovery on
the Dow.

Internet and technology stocks continued to drive the Nasdaq
higher, with several companies hitting new all-time highs during
Thursday's trading session.  Among the several high-flyers
reaching new records were Redback Networks (Nasdaq:RBAK), which
jumped 32 3/16 (+9.82%) to 359 7/8, Nextel Communications

to 169 1/2.

GoTo.com (Nasdaq:GOTO) announced on Thursday that it would

proprietary technology permits buyers to search for products and
services that are being auctioned in cyberspace.  Online search
engine GoTo.com operates an Internet marketplace that introduces
Web users to advertisers.  Shares of GoTo.com, which analysts
believe will benefit tremendously from its e-auction acquistion,

launch of a large-scale Internet campaign, the company announced
on Thursday that it has signed agreements under which local U.S.
telephone providers Bell Atlantic (NYSE:BEL) and SBC
Communications (NYSE:SBC) will test IBM's new Internet access
devices.  While IBM did not disclose the number of devices that
would be tested in the trials, analysts predicted that the
testing by Bell Atlantic and SBC Communications would be a major
step in IBM's efforts to shift its focus to the development of
products designed specifically for Internet access.  Shares of
IBM gained 1 3/8 (+1.29%) to 107 5/8, shares of Bell Atlantic
closed up 2 1/8 (+3.76%) to 58 5/8 and shares of SBC fell 1/16
(-0.15%) to 41 9/16.

takeout and delivery services.  McDonald's also is exploring
various online opportunities for some of its smaller restaurant
brands, including Donatos Pizza, Boston Market and Chipotle
Mexican Grill.  Shares of McDonald's rose 7/8 (+2.85%) to 31
5/8.

Other big movers in the Internet and technology sectors
included:

(up 10 5/8) to 21 1/16 following the company's announcement that
it has developed a new wireless Internet access solution.

<> Globalstar Telecommunications (Nasdaq:GSTRF), which fell
12.99% (-2 11/16) to 18 and was one among the most active stocks
on the Nasdaq on Thursday following the downgrade of the company
by CIBC World Markets.

<> Copper Mountain (Nasdaq:CMTN), which rose 9.19% (up 8 13/16)
to 104 11/16 and rode the wave of a strong overall Nasdaq
performance.

Rod,

We will be sending you the financial statements of Pluspetrol so that you can 
analyse it and send the credit worksheet to legal so that they fill the 
schedule and the credit support annex of the ISDA.  

Pluspetrol (CayCo) is interested in signing an ISDA with ENA so that they 
start hedging Crude Oil.  Pluspetrol is a very important company in Argentina 
and they are one of the largest crude oil producers.

We will send you the information soon.

Guy,

FYI -- the ISDA Master Agreement utilized by Enron for its 
financially-settled swap & option transactions is the industry standard.   
However, for your comfort in understanding how it works I suggest that you 
call Sara Shackleton in our group.   Sara is very well versed with the ISDA, 
and can give you a great overview.  Sara's extension is x35620.

As for your matter concerning a contract employee -- I concur with you and do 
not believe you are being overly cautious.  I have worked with Howard during 
my tenure with EOG, and will therefore revise page 2 of the Schedule to 
Master Agreement to reflect Howard Selzer's name and title.   You will 
receive replacement  page 2 today by messenger.  Please do me a favor -- 
switch out the replacement page 2 with the existing page 2, so the agreement 
will be ready to go for execution.

Give my best to Howard and thanks again.

Susan

Susan
Good point.  However, our new VP & CFO is a contractor and thus not truly an 
officer of the company.  We have to be careful of this, so I would suggest 
that the title of the officer you place in the ISDA be our Chief Accounting 
Officer, since that individual (Howard Selzer) has the signature authority 
normally delegated to the VP CFO and he is the most senior employee in our 
department.
This may be being overly cautious here, but it is important that contractors 
not be treated as employees, especially with regard to officers of the 
company.

Thanks for the reminder on getting the ISDA returned.  Unfortunately there is 
no one I have located yet in our business unit who can explain the document 
or has seen one before which means I'm planning on spending at least several 
hours reading and understanding the issues & implications.  Perhaps you could 
help me.  Can you direct me to someone that routinely works with these 
documents that could walk me through the pages?  I think 30 minutes spent 
outlining the agreement & it's nuances would be useful.  If you have no 
ideas, just bear with me and I'll get to it. 

best regards
Guy

Guy,

It is my understanding that your VP & CFO will be joining Enron Corp.'s 
Investor Relations group.  In light of such development, I suggest that page 
2 of the ISDA Master Agreement dated August 24, 1999, between Risk Management 
& Trading Corp. (which you have yet to return in executed form)be revised to 
reference the title of the officer rather than the officer's name.

If such change is OK, I will forward the new page 2 for replacement to the 
EXECUTION COPIES in your possess.

As before, all of us are busy, but it would be most appreciated if you or 
someone in your group could see to the execution of this agreement.

Thank you.  

Susan

Sara,

I have just received word from Joe Kishkill.  He has signed the ISDA Master 
Agreement, dated effective July 27, 1999, between RMT and ESA.  We should be 
receiving shortly an executed counterpart for our files.

Yea.

I know that we try to limit the provisions but we should consider:

1.  confidentiality (in the miscellaneous section, perhaps)
2.  setoff where there is no early termination date (is this covered by NY/TX 
state setoff laws?)

I'll try to meet with Carol and Shari next week to develop a list of 
issues/recommendations for you.  We may come up with more omnibus items.  SS

Richard Sanders has asked us to revise the arbitration language in our forms

are any other revisions we should make at this time.  We make every effort to 
minimize the frequency with which we change the Annex (it has only been 
changed once since its inception) so it is important that we get as many 
necessary changes made at this time as possible.

Here is the general idea:

It is the understanding of The Dial Corporation and Enron North America that 
ENA is working to provide commodity risk management services to Re-Box Inc. 
to finance the construction of a linerboard facility  Should this endeavor be 
completed prior to May 1st and ENA  not exercise on the swaption above, Enron 
will pay The Dial Corporation the sum of $200,000.

Will this or something like this suffice?

Thanks.

attend and, if possible, I am planning on attending as well.  I think it is 
important that we begin to get involved in ADA activities even if we cannot 
currently transact in the nascent local derivatives market.  The cost will be 
$250 per person.  

Mark, I believe Sara has a copy of the ADA brochure if you are interested in 
getting more information regarding the association.

Regards,
Brent

Greetings to you both!  It has been awhile since we last spoke.  I would like 
to finalize the matrix which we have been discussing since the latter part of 
1999.  Although we were awaiting new Central Bank regulations, I am beginning 
to think that the Central Bank revisions will not impact the matrix except 
with respect to transactions which may be entered into by entities that are 
the subject of the Central Bank regulations.  Please let me know whether or 
not you agree or can offer any suggestions.  Thanks and regards.  Sara"

Another question that is very impotant from a trading execution perspective

BRAZIL: PRIMARY SURPLUS ON R$ 1.457BN IN JANUARY
Gazeta Mercantil, 13 Mar 2000, p. a-7:-
 The primary surplus of the public accounts of the Brazilian government 
reached R$ 1.457bn in January 2000 (R$ 882mn in January 1999), including a 
Social Security deficit of R$ 725mn, taxes collection of R$ 15.144bn (R$ 
11.897bn in January 1999) and expenses of R$ 13.512bn (R$ 11.326bn in January 
1999).


BRAZIL: PROVISIONAL MEASURE FOR TAX ON FUELS
O Estado de S.Paulo, 11 Mar 2000, p. b-2:-
 According to a provisional measure which was signed on March 10th 2000 and 
will be valid from March 13th, the payment of the taxes PIS (Employees' 
Profit Participation Program), Pasep (Public Service Employee Savings 
Program) and Cofins (Tax for Social Security Financing) on the Brazilian 
fuels sector will be transferred to refineries.
With the change, the Brazilian federal government will avoid losses of R$ 
1.2bn in 2000 which would have resulted from the lack of payment of those 
taxes by fuels distribution companies which had won preliminary orders to not 
pay them, hindering the balance of the fuels market.


ARGENTINA: OIL COMPANIES AND FUELS PRICES
La Nacion (Argentina), 11 Mar 2000, p. 2/2:-
 Argentina's oil companies association CIP announced such companies will not 
reduce the price of fuels in the Argentine market, as such price was fixed at 
a US$ 28 value per barrel and it has increased to over US$ 32 over recent 
times. Jose Maria Ranero Diaz, from Repsol-YPF, remarked this sector's 
profitability margins are very low, only 5% while Juan Jose Aranguren from 
Shell expressed companies are working with important losses. 


ARGENTINA: ""IT WAS THE RIGHT MEASURE"" 
La Nacion (Argentina), 11 Mar 2000, p. 2/1:-
 ""If tax collection figures remain stagnant at current levels, taxes may not 
be reduced, anticipated Argentina's Minister of Economy, Jose Luis Machinea, 
who also qualified as ""the right measure"" the implementation of a tax reform 
which implied significant increases over income taxes. During a recent 
interview, the official also admitted the government will intensify its 
negotiations with oil companies to force them to reduce the price of fuels in 
Argentina, as some companies may be operating as monopolies. Machinea 
announced the government had urged Repsol-YPF to reduce its stakes in some 
energy areas, where it holds a dominant position. Lower tariffs on assets 
imported from Mercosur countries as well as from extra-Mercosur areas and new 
credit lines from the Nacion bank are some of the measures the government may 
include as part of the exports promotion plan it may launch soon. Finally, 
Machinea predicted Argentina's foreign debt will fall, as a result of the 
measures adopted by its government.


BRAZIL: INVESTMENTS AGAINST BLACKOUT
Gazeta Mercantil, 13 Mar 2000, p. a-13:-
 The Brazilian National Electric Energy Agency (Aneel) informed on March 10th 
2000 that US$ 41mn will have to be invested in 2000 in order to eliminate 
critical points of the Brazilian interconnected system to avoid blackouts. 
The investments were estimated in a survey carried out by the Brazilian 
National Electric System Operator (ONS).


BRAZIL: COELCE WILL INVEST R$ 110MN
Gazeta Mercantil, 13 Mar 2000, p. C-6:-
 Coelce, the electricity company of the Brazilian state of Ceara, will invest 
the amount of R$ 110mn in 1999 to expand its distribution network and in the 
automation of substations.
The company is going to request to the National Electric Energy Agency 
(Aneel) a readjustment of its prices, to be valid between April 2000 and 
March 2001.


BRAZIL: TENDER FOR LIGHT'S SHARES POSTPONED
Gazeta Mercantil, 13 Mar 2000, p. b-1:-
 The tender for the sale of 9.23% of the control of the Brazilian electricity 
company Light, which was scheduled for March 14th 2000, will be postponed.
According to the new president of the Brazilian National Bank for Economic 
and Social Development (BNDES), Francisco Gros, the sale of Light's shares 
will be discussed in a meeting which will be held on March 13th, and then he 
decided to suspend the tender call.  


BRAZIL: INVESTMENTS IN CARIOBA
Gazeta Mercantil, 06 Mar 2000, p. A-5:-
 The Brazilian energy company Companhia Paulista de Forca e Luz (CPFL), 
together with the companies Shell and Intergen, will invest the amount of US$ 
600mn to repair the thermoelectric plant of Carioba and put it to operate.
Carioba, which is based in the Brazilian city of Americana (state of Sao 
Paulo), is currently moved by combustible oil, but it will be transformed 
into a plant moved by gas.
This plant has generation capacity of 945MW and the prediction for the 
beginning of its operations is the year 2003.


BRAZIL: RHODIA'S PLANS FOR THERMOELECTRIC PLANT
Gazeta Mercantil, 06 Mar 2000, p. A-5:-
 The French chemicals company Rhodia has a project to install a 
thermoelectric plant with generation capacity of 152MW in the Brazilian city 
of Paulinea (state of Sao Paulo).
The responsible for the operations of this plant will be Energyworks. This 
company will use 30MW of the generated energy, while the rest will be 
commercialised by Rhodia.


BRAZIL: COELCE REGISTERED PROFIT OF R$ 74.9MN
Gazeta Mercantil, 13 Mar 2000, p. C-6:-
 The electricity company of the Brazilian state of Ceara (Coelce) registered 
the following results in 1999:
- net profit of R$ 74.9mn (R$ 27.72mn in 1998);
- net operational revenue of R$ 576mn (11.5% higher compared to 1998);
- net profit per 1,000 shares of R$ 0.48 (in 1998 it was of R$ 0.18);
The company explained the increase of its net operational revenue as a 
consequence of the increase of the electricity demand by 5.8% in Ceara and 
also as a consequence of the prices increase by 5.31%.


BRAZIL: ELETROBRAS TO ISSUE US$ 300MN EUROBONDS
Gazeta Mercantil, 13 Mar 2000, p. b-1:-
 The Brazilian state-owned electricity company Eletrobras confirmed that the 
company plans to issue US$ 300mn eurobonds in the beginning of April 2000.
The eurobonds will have 5 years term and will be issued in the US and in the 
European market in an operation led by Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale.


BRAZIL: NEW ALCOHOL TENDER
Gazeta Mercantil, 13 Mar 2000, p. b-20:-
 A new tender for the sale of 60mn litres of alcohol fuel will be held by the 
Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture on March 16th 2000 in order to avoid 
abusive alcohol prices increases.


BRAZIL: GASOLINE CONSUMPTION DECREASES
O Estado de S.Paulo, 11 Mar 2000, p. B-3:-
 The Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP) informed that petrol 
consumption in Brazil decreased by 1%, or approximately 54,000 litres, in 
1999 compared to 1998.
According to the IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), 
alcohol and petrol production decreased by 15.9% in January. IBGE explained 
this decrease as a result of the decrease of the demand.


BRAZIL: US$ 3.2BN INVESTMENTS FOR SANITATION
O Estado de S.Paulo, 11 Mar 2000, p. b-2:-
 The Brazilian National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) 
estimates that approximately US$ 3.2bn will be invested in the development of 
the Brazilian sanitation sector by 2010.


BRAZIL: BAD COLLECTION FOR SANITATION IN RIO 
Gazeta Mercantil, 06 Mar 2000, p. a-5:-
 According to the co-ordinator of the Depollution Program for the Guanabara 
Bay (Greater Rio de Janeiro region in Brazil), Renato Lima do Espirito Santo, 
the shortage of collection network does not allow the use of the full 
sanitation capacity in the Greater Rio de Janeiro region.
One example is that the Sewerage Treatment Stations (ETE) of Pavuna and 
Sarapui do not work, even with total capacity for 1 cubic metre/second, due 
to the lack of 700 kilometres of collection network.


ARGENTINA: LPG TAX OPPOSED
La Nacion (Argentina), 13 Mar 2000, p. 2/7:-
 The tax imposed by the Argentine province of Buenos Aires on the initial 
sale of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) has been opposed by the sector chamber 
Cegla, on the grounds that it prejudices distributors of LPG in favour of 
natural gas, given that the tax will be used to subsidise the expansion of 
natural gas pipelines. The law was imposed in 1979.


ARGENTINA: OIL COMPANIES VS. GOV'T 
Buenos Aires Economico, 13 Mar 2000, p. 10:-
 The announcement by oil companies in Argentina last Friday, 10 March, that 
the recent drop in international crude prices would be reflected at the gas 
pump set off a new round of threats from the government. Argentina President, 
Fernando de la Rua, and his Economy Minister, both said they were prepared to 
battle the oil companies over prices. Meanwhile, the legislature is debating 
applying an export tax on oil, the funds from which would go to lowering 
consumer petrol taxes.


ARGENTINA: ENRON NEXT TO START LEGAL ACTION
Buenos Aires Economico, 13 Mar 2000, p. 2:-
 The US-based Enron Corp. could be the next company to take its case against 
Argentina to arbitration at the World Bank. Five other foreign firms have 
taken their cases to the World Bank, most of which are over differences with 
provincial governments. Enron, as well as Lancon International and Endesa, 
claim that taxes the provinces want to impose are unfair and were not part of 
concession and/or privatisation agreements. The French Compangnie Generale 
des Eaux is trying to claim damages when the north-western province of 
Tucuman cancelled its water services contract allegedly for serious errors. 
The oldest case is that of the firm, Eriday, which is claiming US$ 1.5bn owed 
by Argentina for its part in the Yacyreta hydroelectric dam. These cases are 
seen as one more negative legacy of the previous administration of Carlos 
Menem.


ARGENTINA: TO STAND FIRM ON YACYRETA ISSUE
La Nacion (Argentina), 12 Mar 2000, p. 2/7:-
 Argentina says that it will stand firm under any pressure to be applied by 
Henry Kissinger and his band of representatives from international companies 
to pay the some US$ 1.5bn due in budget overruns in the construction of the 
hydroelectric dam, Yacyreta. Eriday, the construction consortium, appointed 
Kissinger as its negotiator for its claims against the Argentine state. 
Officials in that country maintain they will review the claims one by one in 
an atmosphere of transparency, and for their part talk of amounts much less 
than those claimed by Eriday.


ARGENTINA: CAPEX RESULTS
Buenos Aires Economico, 13 Mar 2000, p. 18:-
 The Argentine energy company, Capex, reported earnings of US$ 11.6mn at the 
close of its intermediate balance on 3 January 2000, up by US$ 200,000 from 
the same period of a year earlier. Although net earnings were up, 
profitability was down considering that billing was up by 28%. 
Capex expects earnings to continue to increase especially now that the fourth 
line of the Comahue-Buenos Aires transmission line is working and the 
combined-cycle power plant in the western province of Neuquen is close to 
full operations.


BRAZIL: MEASURES TO COMBAT FUEL PRICES INCREASES
Folha de S.Paulo, 11 Mar 2000, p. 2-1:-
 The Brazilian government is studying some measures to avoid more increases 
in fuels prices, and one of this possible measures is to cancel subsides for 
the alcohol, and also to increase the prices of kerosene for aviation and LPG 
(Liquefied Petroleum Gas).
Allowing the increase of these prices, part of the oil import costs, which 
are included in gasoline prices, can be transferred to these other products 
and gasoline prices can be controlled.


ARGENTINA: PETROL MARKET SHAKE UP DUE
La Nacion (Argentina), 12 Mar 2000, p. 2/1:-
 The recent rises in petrol prices have caused new moves to be contemplated 
in Argentina to shake up the petrol market there. While many see government 
threats to control prices as empty, talk of opening up the market to other 
foreign oils imports and freeing up the petrol retail distribution chain is 
gaining ground. One idea circulating is to have supermarket chains act as 
sellers of foreign petrols. Oil companies remain firm in their stance that 
the reason petrol is so expensive in Argentina is because of taxes: 58% of 
the price at the pump.

FYI - Southwestern Bell is installing equipment in my home on April 3.  They 
will call me 1 hour before arrival.  This is just a head's up that I may have

Thanks for your help.

Patricia:  I can't thank you enough for arranging the many meetings and 
introductions for the Enron legal group.  Lynn and I are extremely grateful 
as it made our lives much easier and our jobs much more productive.  As 
always, I am impressed with the variety and number of individuals with whom 
you are so well connected.  At the moment, we are trying to finalize an 
internal memorandum addressing the breadth of the tax issues currently 
affecting our business in Argentina.  I would appreciate your comment on the 
following two items:

(1)  Can you cite the law that provides the exemption or modification (not 
sure which it is) that ""financial institutions"" are taxed (Gross Receipts) on 
the spread?  Is it possible to see a copy? (I can probably have it translated)

(2)  I am unclear as to how the Stamp Tax would be calculated with respect to 
Argentine local parties to an ISDA Master Agreement (crossborder trades) or a 
local master swap agreement (local trades).  Execution of the master 
agreement itself does not evidence any transaction.  Even when any 
transaction is executed, you are unable to determine net payments owed by 
either party until termination of the deal.  Brent thinks that the tax will 
be based on the product of the [Fixed Price  X volume X term] even though the 
master agreement will merely provide for netting.  Can you verify?

Give my regards to Pablo.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara"

I have agreed, after much discussion with both Bradford and Per, that in the 
case of these two contracts only, we will agree to a collateral threshold of 
$0 for both ENA and the counterparty.  In addition, I have agreed to a 
rounding multiple of $250,000 and minimum transafer amount of $1.  Worksheet 
is attached.

Sara,
Holli Krebs has asked for an update on the EWEB ISDA process.  EWEB means 
Eugene Water and Electricity Board           and is a small Oregon muni.   
She was under the impression that we had already sent an ISDA to EWEB but,  
she just got a call from Jim Deisen (the guy you and I met with at that  
Portland law firm---remember about a year ago?)  and Jim asked if we could 
send over our ISDA and schedule.    So.......   if we have already started 
down the path with EWEB, the West Desk would appreciate it if you could 
please  put it on top of the pile and follow up with Dieson (503-224-3092) 
or, if we have done nothing,  could you please give him a call and get the 
ball rolling on an ISDA.  Thanks very much and let me know if I can help in 
any way.----cgy

Subject: Hawaii 125-0

Gareth suggested that I forward these swap documents to you two.  We are 
working on a 125 ""revolver"" structure that allows for several 125 assets to 
use one Trust to complete transactions.  Each asset will be set up in its own 
Asset LLC and Transferor LLC, but the Total Return Swap will be with the 
Master Trust and a new confirmation will be issued for each asset as it is 
placed in the vehicle.  I will be out of town next week, so please let Gareth 
or Charles DeLacey (x35757) know if you have any questions or comments.  I 
will be available through tomorrow.  Thanks.

Subject: EWEB

Sara,
Holli Krebs has asked for an update on the EWEB ISDA process.  EWEB means 
Eugene Water and Electricity Board           and is a small Oregon muni.   
She was under the impression that we had already sent an ISDA to EWEB but,  
she just got a call from Jim Deisen (the guy you and I met with at that  
Portland law firm---remember about a year ago?)  and Jim asked if we could 
send over our ISDA and schedule.    So.......   if we have already started 
down the path with EWEB, the West Desk would appreciate it if you could 
please  put it on top of the pile and follow up with Dieson (503-224-3092) 
or, if we have done nothing,  could you please give him a call and get the 
ball rolling on an ISDA.  Thanks very much and let me know if I can help in 
any way.----cgy

     RE:  Revised Form of Annex A

     Dear Mr. Sorenson:

     Your letter dated March 7, 2000 directed to the Cargill Legal
     Department regarding the above-referenced subject has been forwarded
     to me for attention.

     We are currently deeply involved in the negotiation of an ISDA Master
     Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and Cargill,
     Incorporation.   I have been working with Sara Shackleton, Senior
     Counsel in your Legal Department, to bring this document to
     completion.   To date, the few remaining unresolved issues require
     the involvement and response of Tanya Rohauer in your Credit area.

     As instructed in your letter, this is to advise that we do not accept
     the General Terms and Conditions of Confirmation and prefer to
     continue to use ISDA's recommended standard long form Confirmation
     until the ISDA Master Agreement has been completed.  Any effort on
     your part to expedite the conclusion of these negotiations would be
     greatly appreciated.

     Regards,
     Marty Oelmann

Subject: Swap Schedule


     On an early conference call, Ian Schottlaender made the comment that in 
previous deals some of the banks have been confused by the termination 
provisions which were the first provisions in the Swap Schedule and, 
consequently, appeared on the front cover.  He asked if these provisions 
could be moved to a different part of the document and so were not 
conspicuous on the front cover.
     Accordingly, I swapped Part 1 of the Schedule with Part 5 of the 
Schedule.  Unfortunately, this meant that the CompareRite documents sent out 
earlier this week contained a lot of blacklined language, making it difficult 
to read Part 1 and Part 5.
     Attached to this e-mail is a blackline of the current Part 5 to the 
Hawaii Schedule compared to Part 1 of the Ghost Schedule, and the current 
Part 1 of the Hawaii Schedule compared to Part 5 of the Ghost Schedule.
     Please call me at 214-659-4414 if you have any questions or comments.

Carol:  How are you?  I hope you are doing well.  I took a guess at your 
E-mail address based upon all of the others I have for your ENA Legal 
compatriots, so hopefully this will get through to your desktop.

One of my partners, Warren Ingber, has been asked to pick up on some work 
that Kevin Leitao was handling for Western Resources involving a  trading 
contract between ENA and Western Resources.  As I think you know, Kevin 
recently left us to take a position with GE Capital.  Warren asked me if the 
conflict waiver had been cleared with ENA and that is the reason for my 
E-mail.  Warren informed me that the draft that had been forwarded to him had 
indirectly come from Jeff Sorenson and that you were copied on the 
correspondence.

In a number of cases in the past involving these types of contracts, ENA has 
granted us waivers to represent the particular ENA counterparty.  I think the 
general consensus was that ENA would rather have us represent the 
counterparty, rather than another outside firm, since Kevin in particular had 
been working with various ENA lawyers on a number of the issues that 
frequently arise under these agreements and that it was more efficient (and 
beneficial to the overall transaction) to work with a firm that had 
familiarity both with respect to the issues as well as ENA's general views on 
them.  Also, it is my understanding that the provisions are somewhat well 
accepted and that it is unusual for there to be difficult legal 
negotiations.  I know that Kevin had from time to time cleared these 
representations on a case by case basis with the various ENA lawyers involved 
(for e.g., I know there were one or more transactions in which Shari and Sara 
were involved) and would let me know how we were proceeding.  My memory is 
failing me on this one, although I seem to recall that the conflict had been 
waived a while ago.  However, I just want to make sure that that was in fact 
done in this case.

Could you let me know if my recollection is accurate or if you foresee any 
problem in this respect.  Our contact at Western Resources said he understood 
the conflict matter had been dealt with a while ago.  Obviously, we do not 
want to take on a representation of this nature without ENA's consent.

I will be out of the office during the early part of the week, but I will be 
checking E-mail and voice mail regularly.  My phone number is 212 424-8125.  
Thanks again, Carol.

John

Sami:

Thank you for your emails this morning.  Attached is a copy of Esteban
Buljevich's c.v. as you requested as well as a copy of his list of selected
transactions.

I am very pleased that you will be speaking to Randy about Pablo de Rosso.

Please let me know if John Novak requires my assistance in arranging to
speak with Joaquin Sales Saborit.

Regards,
Stanley Ross

Gil,
I received my copy of the instructions to Morgan Stanley and the letter to 
the transfer agent.
I have faxed a copy to Frank Moy at Morgan Stanley who has not received the 
original,as yet.
I have requested his verification that the account is open and an anticipated 
timing for the transfer agent.

Have instructions been provided with the account opening authorizing John 
Greene to trade for Enron Communications Investments Corp?
Has Donna been provided with the necessary internal releases for the sale?
Are we anticipating only selling 2,392,058 in the near term since that is the 
only piece being registered in street-name?
John Greene will be provided with  instructions requesting him to sell and 
acceptable pricing guidelines.
 
Thanks Sheila

internal releases.  Donna--will you authorize on a verbal release and we can 
do paperwork later this week?  We are only anticipating selling the 2.3 
million, the remainder will be back in ECIC's name.

Patricia:  I can't thank you enough for arranging the many meetings and 
introductions for the Enron legal group.  Lynn and I are extremely grateful 
as it made our lives much easier and our jobs much more productive.  As 
always, I am impressed with the variety and number of individuals with whom 
you are so well connected.  At the moment, we are trying to finalize an 
internal memorandum addressing the breadth of the tax issues currently 
affecting our business in Argentina.  I would appreciate your comment on the 
following two items:

(1)  Can you cite the law that provides the exemption or modification (not 
sure which it is) that ""financial institutions"" are taxed (Gross Receipts) on 
the spread?  Is it possible to see a copy? (I can probably have it translated)

(2)  I am unclear as to how the Stamp Tax would be calculated with respect to 
Argentine local parties to an ISDA Master Agreement (crossborder trades) or a 
local master swap agreement (local trades).  Execution of the master 
agreement itself does not evidence any transaction.  Even when any 
transaction is executed, you are unable to determine net payments owed by 
either party until termination of the deal.  Brent thinks that the tax will 
be based on the product of the [Fixed Price  X volume X term] even though the 
master agreement will merely provide for netting.  Can you verify?

Give my regards to Pablo.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara

1.  Wednesday's Market Action

                             $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Jones Industrials          -40.64     -0.37%   10866.70

Tech stocks propelled the Nasdaq higher today as tech investors
put yesterday's interest rate hike from the Fed behind them.

Yesterday, the Fed raised two critical short-term interest rates
by 25 basis points (which equals 0.25%) each.  Today, Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan made positive remarks concerning
the remarkable growth of the U.S. economy.  Greenspan attributed
much of the growth to the substantial increase in labor
productivity.  This is positive news to investors because to the
extent workers are more productive (due to technological
improvements), businesses produce more goods and services
without a commensurate increase in wages.  This, in turn,
suggests that wage inflation is being kept in check,
notwithstanding the nation's strong economic growth, which means
there is less of a reason to raise interest rates.

Large cap tech stocks were the driving force behind today's
rally.  Leading the way was Cisco Systems (Nasdaq:CSCO), up 3
33/64 (2.50%) to 144 3/8, Oracle (Nasdaq:ORCL), up 3 3/8
(+4.18%) to 84 1/16, and America Online (NYSE:AOL), up 4 1/8
(+6.12%) to 71 1/2.  Other large non-tech movers today included
Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), up 1 1/8 (+2.87%) to 40 5/16, General
Motors (NYSE:GM), up 1 9/16 (+1.95%) to 81 3/4, and Citigroup
(NYSE:C), up 13/16 (+1.40%) to 58 7/8.  On the downside, 3M
(NYSE:MMM) fell 4 7/16 (-4.91%) to 86, SBC Communications
(NYSE:SBC) dropped 2 (-4.42%) to 43 1/4, and Honeywell
(NYSE:HON) declined 3 3/4 (-7.50%) to 46 1/4.

General Electric (NYSE:GE) shares continued to impress today,
edging up 3/8 (+0.25%) to 150 7/8 on continuing announcement
from the conglomerate's announcement yesterday that its first
quarter earnings would come in ""modestly"" higher than expected.

The online and offline worlds came together today in another
cross-marketing alliance, this one between Pepsi-Cola (NYSE:PEP)
and Yahoo! (Nasdaq:YHOO).  The companies announced a joint
online and offline promotional campaign called ""Pepsi Stuff.com""
that will last 5 months beginning in August.  The program will
enable consumers to earn online awards and discounts from
promotions appearing under the caps of bottled Pepsi products.
A Yahoo! logo will also appear in close to 50,000 retail stores
nationwide where Pepsi products are sold.  Yahoo shares rose 5
7/16 (+2.84%) to 197 3/16 and Pepsi shares declined 13/16 (-
2.37%) to 33 1/2.

Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq:MSFT) led tech news today after
announcing an alliance aimed at establishing its position in the
burgeoning market for wireless handheld devices.  The software
giant will team with Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN), the world's
largest developer of semiconductor chips for mobile devices, to
develop improved software for these devices, such as personal
digital assistants (PDAs).  Microsoft will use TI's digital
signal processors (DSPs) to enable its Windows CE operating
system that is used in wireless handheld devices.  Microsoft
shares edged up 1/2 (+0.49%) to 103 1/4.

First Union (NYSE:FTU) shares rose 13/16 (+2.26%) to 36 11/16
after the bank announced plans to build and launch an e-
marketplace for small and mid-sized companies in the third
quarter of 2000.  Among other things, the online service will
aggregate the buying power of participants to lower their
purchasing costs on a host of supplies, products, equipment and
services.  First Union has tapped privately held Intelisys
Electronic Commerce to help set up the service.

PSINet (Nasdaq:PSIX) was also in the news after announcing it
would acquire Metamor Worldwide (Nasdaq:MMWW), a business
software and services company, in a stock deal valued at $1.9
billion.  The move will help PSINet, an Internet access and
services provider, diversify into the e-commerce arena =0F-- as a
result of the deal, PSINet will also gain control over Metamor's
e-commerce software affiliate, Xpedior (Nasdaq:XPDR).  Metamor
shares soared 108.30% (up 17 21/64) to 33 21/64 on the news.
Xpedior shares also impressed, gaining 53.71% (up 7 11/16) to
22, while PSINet shares slipped 16.04% (down 7 15/16) to 41
9/16.

The chip sector performed well today, once again on the heels of
a gain from industry leader Intel Corp. (Nasdaq:INTC), which
closed up 5 5/8 (+4.06%) to another all-time high of 144 1/16.
Meanwhile, Micron Technology (NYSE:MU) shares rallied today,
despite its announcement of lower than expected earnings
yesterday, after numerous brokerage firms came to the company's
defense today and offered positive comments.  Micron shares
surged 20 (+16.77%) to 139 1/4.  Rambus (Nasdaq:RMBS) shares,
which have fallen back in recent sessions, bounced back 31.43%
(up 83 51/64) to 350 3/8 today after a Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter analyst offered positive comments on the company and set
a price target of $500 per share.

Bio-tech stocks were again on the move today, this time to the
upside.  These stocks have been very volatile in recent weeks,
so today's big gains must be viewed in the context of overall
recent declines.  Nonetheless, Protein Design Labs (Nasdaq:PDLI)
gained 9 3/8 (+9.73%) to 105 11/16, Human Genome Sciences
(Nasdaq:HGSI) rose 14.55% (up 13 25/64) to 105 7/16, Affymetrix
(Nasdaq:AFFX) moved up 11 13/16 (+7.47%) to 169 7/8, and
Medimmune (Nasdaq:MEDI) added 15 13/16 (+9.92%) to 175 3/16.

Other big movers in the Internet and technology sectors include:

<> Vignette (Nasdaq:VIGN), jumping 16.32% (up 32 19/64) to 230
15/64 on news the e-business applications provider will join
forces with Breakaway Solutions (Nasdaq:BWAY) to help companies
build successful e-businesses.

<> Microstrategy (Nasdaq:MSTR), bouncing back 22.71% (up 16
27/64) to 88 47/64 after plummeting the first two days of this
week after it announced it would re-state earnings for the last
2 years.

<> Wireless Facilities (Nasdaq:WFII), gaining 20.93% (up 19
29/32) to 115; Sciclone (Nasdaq:SCLN), jumping 52.61% (up 5
63/64) to 17 23/64; and Selectica (Nasdaq:SLTC), surging 58.09%
(up 43 23/32) to 118 63/64.

6. IPO Commentary - http://www.smartportfolio.com/ipo
<A HREF=3D""http://www.smartportfolio.com/ipo"">AOL users click
here.</A>

Despite the underlying strength in the tech sector today, only
two companies made their public debut and with mixed results.
The big winner on the day was telecommunications chip component
maker inSilicon (Nasdaq:INSN), which surged 79.69%% to 21 9/16.
This company was highlighted in last week's Smat!IPO Report as a
likely winner.

The other IPO on the day -- that of PartsBase.com (Nasdaq:PRTS),
a provider of business-to-business (B2B) services in the airline
industry =0F-- did not perform as well.  The company's shares fell
12.50% to 11 3/8.

Although PartsBase.com did not soar like some of its leading B2B
predecessors, such as Comemrce One (Nasdaq:CMRC), Ariba
(Nasdaq:ARBA), or VerticalNet (Nasdaq:VERT), this doed not
necessarily signal a shift away from B2B stocks.  Rather, it is
due more to the recent flood of B2B IPOs.  These IPOs should be
judged on their individual merits -- promising ones could still
fly.  SmartPortfolio.Com will be watching.

There are many more very promising IPOs expected to start
trading later this week and next week.  For more information on

This looks good.  We do not have good copies of the ISDA Agreement, so if you 
could print the final copies of both the ISDA Agreement and Schedule and send 
them to me, I'd appreciate it.

Pete,

Attached is a clean version and blacklined version of the Schedule to the 
Master
Agreement, between Enron North America Corp. (""ENA"") and Vintage Petroleum, 
Inc.
(""Vintage"").   The attached Schedule includes the revisions agreed upon 
between
you and Sara Shackleton.  Pursuant to Sara's request, the Schedule has been
prepared as an ""execution copy"" and therefore, includes (a)  an agreement date
of March 22, 2000 (since no trades exist between the parties, today's has been
included), and (b) the name and title of the ENA signatory for the ENA 
signature
block.

If the attached meets with your approval, it is my understanding you will be
furnishing execution sets of the Schedule.  However, please advise if ENA or
Vintage will provide the execution sets of the ""preprinted boilerplate"" of the
ISDA Master Agreement.

If you have any questions you may reach me by phone.  My direct number @ ENA 
is
(713) 853-4737.   I look forward to your comments and further instructions.


Susan

Hi, Serge.  I am just checking to see when Enron North America Corp. (""ENA"") 
will receive your comments to the ISDA Master Agreement for FP&L.  Paul Karns 
mentioned that you would be devoting some time for review of the agreement.  
Please let me know if I can be of any assistance.  You can reach me via email 
or phone (713) 853-5620 if you have any questions.  I will be negotiating the 
agreement on behalf of ENA.  "

Please excuse the delay but I was hoping to deliver all of my information to 
you at once.  I am attaching our latest generic Schedule format.  You will 
see our ""No Reliance"" and ""Limitation of Liability"" provisions included.  
None of our confirmation templates contain non-reliance provisions (unless it 
is specifically added by an attorney for a particular Transaction).

Unfortunately, I  do not yet have an answer as to the existence of written 
guidelines or policy addressing the provision of  quotes to customers.  I 
will follow up when I have the response.

Please let me know if you need more information or if we need to conference.  
Regards.  Sara

Don, the ENA WTI swap which you booked for TBS needs to be rebooked into 
another entity which is totally controlled by Enron.  John Novak and I 
thought that perhaps the most appropriate entity would be Enron South America 
LLC.  Please confirm if this is the entity you want the trade booked with.  
If so, you will need to have John Mee prepare an amended deal ticket.  

Joe, can you confirm that Enron South America LLC is an eligible swap 
counterparty (1mm in net worth or 10mm in assets)?  

If anyone else has any questions, comments or issues please respond as 
quickly as possible.  This deal was closed on January 13 and needs to be 
documented.  

Thanks,
Brent

As we all know, the TBS/Enron South America LLC (""ESA"") confirmation issue is 
draining our little brains.  Let's all conference sometime Monday to sort 
through how these trades should be documented, booked and otherwise handled.  
Lynn has suggested that ESA is merely a holding company and therefore, an 
inappropriate vehicle for holding trades (maybe one or two trades is O.K.).  
Also, any ESA documents must be executed in the U.S.

Brent:  please leave me a voice or email for convenient times.  Sara"

1.  Friday's Market Action

                             $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Industrials                 -7.14     -0.06%   11112.72
S&P 500                         +0.11     +0.01%    1527.46
Nasdaq                         +22.42     +0.45%    4963.03
Internet Stock Index           +16.63     +1.56%    1080.27

A buying binge of Internet and technology stocks sparked Friday
morning's market rally, which led to solid gains on the Dow and
the Nasdaq throughout most of the day, before the Dow finished
lower amid profit-taking by investors, closing a week
characterized by strong performances on the major U.S. indexes
as investors temporarily put aside their concerns about future
interest rate hikes and upcoming quarterly earnings
announcements.

Friday's market action was kicked off by the Commerce
Department's report that new orders for durable goods, including
cars, computers and appliances that are intended to last three
years or more, fell 2.3% in February to $208.45 billion, which
was weaker than analysts' forecasts of a 0.2% decline.
February's numbers for orders of costly U.S. manufactured goods
represent the second month of declines in a row.  The report
came only a few days after the Federal Reserve hiked short-term
interest rates for the second time this year in its ongoing
determination to keep the steaming economy in check.

After boosting stocks on Thursday amid rumors that the mammoth
government antitrust lawsuit against it might be nearing
closure, Microsoft (Nasdaq:MSFT) is expected to make a sweeping
offer to settle the case as the government eases up on demands
that the software titan be broken up.  If the proposal by
Microsoft is sufficiently wide ranging, then it could result in
final negotiations as early as this weekend among Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Joel Klein
and Judge Richard Posner, who has been serving as the case's
mediator.  On the other hand, if the proposal is deemed to be
too narrow by prosecutors, it could destroy the settlement
negotiations and throw the case back into the courts.  A federal
judge ruled last year that Microsoft had abused monopoly power
in its Windows computer operating system, which allegedly harmed
consumers, customers and other companies.  Shares of Microsoft
dropped 3/16 (-0.17%) to 111 11/16.

Oil services companies had a strong day on Wall Street, as oil
prices rose on Friday in the wake of a final effort being made
by the U.S. government to persuade OPEC to agree to a big output
hike at next week's gathering of the group.  Halliburton
(NYSE:HAL) gained 7/8 (+2.31%) to 38 3/4, Schlumberger
(NYSE:SLB) closed up 7/8 (+1.13%) to 78 3/16, Transocean
Offshore (NYSE:RIG) rose 1 3/16 (+2.64%) to 46 3/16, Cooper
Cameron (NYSE:CAM) gained 2 1/8 (+3.28%) to 66 7/8, and Smith
International (NYSE:SII) closed up 1 7/8 (+2.50%) to 77.

The drug sector was buzzing over the statement by the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) that Propulsid, a popular drug with
nearly $1 billion in sales last year, had been associated with
341 reports of heart rhythm abnormalities, including 80 reports
of deaths.  Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), the maker of the
prescription heartburn drug, reported that it would stop
marketing the product in the U.S. and that it is working with
the FDA to create a special ""limited access"" program to keep it
available for certain patients that have not been helped by
other treatments.  Following the news, shares of Johnson &
Johnson plunged 10.78% (down 8 5/8) to 71 3/8, while shares of
other drug stocks also had weak performances, with Merck
(NYSE:MRK) dropping 1 1/8 (-1.79%) to 61 3/4, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)
closing down 3/16 (-0.53%) to 35 1/16, Schering-Plough
(NYSE:SGP) falling 1 1/2 (-3.97%) to 36 1/4, Pharmacia & Upjohn
(NYSE:PNU) dropping 2 9/16 (-4.30%) to 57, American Home
Products (NYSE:AHP) closing down 1 1/2 (-2.77%) to 52 11/16, and
Warner-Lambert (NYSE:WLA) falling 15/16 (-1.00%) to 93 1/16.

The hotel and real estate industries converged on Friday as
MeriStar Hotels & Resorts (NYSE:MMH), which operates 235 lodging
properties, announced that it would acquire BridgeStreet
Accommodations (NYSE:BDS), which offers upscale furnished
apartments, townhouses and condominiums as an alternative to
traditional hotel rooms.  The deal is expected to result in
MeriStar's leading position in the market for providing
temporary housing for executives and business travelers.  Shares
of MeriStar inched up 1/16 (+2.27%) to 2 13/16, while shares of
BridgeStreet soared 29.03% (up 9/16) to 2 1/2.

The Nasdaq had another run up on Wall Street on Friday, leading
to more record highs for many Internet and technology stocks
during the day's trading session, including Adobe Systems
(Nasdaq:ADBE), which closed up 1 5/8 (+1.52%) to 108 3/16,
Xilinx (Nasdaq:XLNX), which dropped 1 3/4 (-2.07%) to 82 5/8,
and Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq:SUNW), which closed up 2 11/16
(+2.75%) to 100 1/2.

Cisco Systems (Nasdaq:CSCO) surpassed Microsoft as the biggest
company in the world during Friday's trading session, before
Microsoft regained that distinction in a late-day rally.  Shares
of Cisco closed up 1 9/16 (+2.01%) to 79 3/8, representing a
market cap of $550.7 billion, while shares of Microsoft closed
down 3/16 (-0.17%) to 111 11/16, representing a market cap of
$581.3 billion.

In leading Internet stock news, the Financial Times reported on
Friday that Yahoo! (Nasdaq:YHOO) and online auctioneer eBay
(Nasdaq:EBAY) have resumed the merger talks that had collapsed
earlier this month.  In early March, analysts noted several
strategic benefits that would be derived from a Yahoo-eBay
alliance, but indicated that an acquisition of eBay would be
extremely expensive for Yahoo.  Moreover, questions were raised
with respect to why eBay would desire to sell out at a time when
its business is thriving.  Shares of Yahoo rose 3 (+1.57%) to
194, while shares of eBay jumped 20 3/16 (+9.03%) to 243 3/4.

Business-to-business (B2B) news was topped by reports that four
major players in the aerospace and defense industry are joining
forces to create an online marketplace with B2B powerhouse
Commerce One (Nasdaq:CMRC).  The joint venture, which includes
Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), Raytheon (NYSE:RTNa), Boeing
(NYSE:BA) and British Aerospace, is being designed to bring
together buyers and suppliers in the industry, allowing them to
buy and sell parts and conduct business over the Internet.
Following the news, shares of Commerce One jumped 18 11/16
(+9.12%) to 223 11/16, while shares of other B2B players
finished the day with mixed results as E.piphany (Nasdaq:EPNY)
closed up 6 1/2 (+3.80%) to 177 1/2 and Oracle (Nasdaq:ORCL)
gained 1/8 (+0.14%) to 87, while Ariba (Nasdaq:ARBA) dropped 5
15/16 (-2.24%) to 259 9/16, VerticalNet (Nasdaq:VERT) fell 6
9/64 (-3.23%) to 183 7/8 and VerticalNet (Nasdaq:VERT) closed
down 6 9/64 (-3.23%) to 183 7/8.

The B2B announcement was the latest in a wave of moves by
leading companies in various industries to create online
marketplaces.  It wasn't even the first such deal in the
aerospace and defense industry -- last month, United
Technologies (NYSE:UTX), Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and i2
Technologies (Nasdaq:ITWO) announced plans to launch
MyAircraft.com, an electronic marketplace for aerospace products
and services for approximately 25,000 buyers and sellers.  In a
separate transaction, General Electric (NYSE:GE) recently
created a new online exchange that will allow major airlines to
buy and sell parts via the Internet.  B2B marketplaces also have
sprung up in such industries as chemicals, automobile
manufacturing, construction and pharmaceuticals, as companies
increasingly are seeking to move their supply chains into
cyberspace to reduce the paperwork and time involved in
purchasing, manufacturing and inventory.

The online brokerage sector had a strong day on Wall Street
following the statement by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray that it
was raising its revenue forecasts for online brokerage giants
Ameritrade Holding (Nasdaq:AMTD) and E*Trade Group (Nasdaq:EGRP)
as a result of recent unprecedented trading volumes.  Shares of
Ameritrade gained 2 5/16 (+10.54%) to 24 1/4, shares of E*Trade
rose 4 1/8 (+14.80%) to 32, while shares of other online
brokerage firms also performed well on the day, with National
Discount Brokers Group (NYSE:NDB) rising 5 5/8 (+11.07%) to 56
7/16, Siebert Financial (Nasdaq:SIEB) gaining 1 9/16 (+11.26%)
to 15 7/16, Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCH) closing up 3 3/8 (+5.51%)
to 64 5/8, Knight/Trimark Group (Nasdaq:NITE) rising 6 5/16
(+11.97%) to 59 1/16, and DLJ Direct (NYSE:DIR) gaining 1 7/16
(+10.04%) to 15 3/4.

Other Internet and technology stock movers included:

<> GoTo.com (Nasdaq:GOTO), which surged 33.17% (up 11 63/64) to
48 7/64 after the Internet search engine company announced on
Friday that it logged more than 2 million unique visitors during
March 2000 and expanded the number of paying advertisers to more
than 25,000.

<> Xircom (Nasdaq:XIRC), which fell 10.21% (down 4 3/16) to 36
13/16 after the maker of products that connect portable personal
computers to telephone systems, networks and the Internet
reported that its quarterly earnings would not meet Wall Street
expectations.

<> Wit Capital Group (Nasdaq:WITC), the parent of online
investment banking group Wit Soundview, which jumped 29.43% (up
4 7/8) to 21 7/16 after reporting that its first quarter
financial results likely will exceed analysts' forecasts.

<> Compaq Computer (NYSE:CPQ), which fell 1 5/16 (-4.39%) to 28
9/16 on very heavy volume based largely on concerns that the
computer company's first quarter earnings may fall short of
estimates as a slowdown in corporate spending on PCs during the
first quarter might create a revenue shortfall.

<> Teledyne Technologies (NYSE:TDY), which jumped 14.68% (up 2)
to 15 5/8 on continued momentum from Wednesday's announcement by
the leading provider of sophisticated electronic and
communications products that it has reached an agreement with
Lockheed Martin to supply turbine engines for the Joint Air-to-
Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) program.

<> Power Integrations (Nasdaq:POWI), which sank 39.97% (down 19
11/16) to 29 9/16 one day after the circuit maker reported that
it expects its first quarter revenues to fall below
expectations.

6. IPO Commentary - http://www.smartportfolio.com/ipo
<A HREF=""http://www.smartportfolio.com/ipo"">AOL users click
here.</A>

The action in the market today demonstrated how not all IPOs --
even those tech-related -- are created equal.  Investors recent
love affair with communication/semiconductor stocks continued as
Silicon Laboratories (NASAQ:SLAB), a maker of mixed-signal
integrated circuits, bolted 123.79%.  In contrast however,
eMachines (NASDAQ:EEEE), a maker of low-cost computers, fell
8.33%.  eMachines is an interesting story because it actually is
one of the leading PC manufacturers in terms of total PCs
shipped.  Its low-cost model, however, clearly did not sit well
with investors.

Looking ahead to the next few weeks, the IPO pipeline is still
stacked.  While there are still many quality IPOs expected to
come to market, the glut of IPOs will make the top issues
slightly more difficult to find.  Investors are increasingly
scrutinizing business-to-business- and Internet infrastructure-
related issues just as they started to with business-to-consumer
Internet issues when supply became to much.

I spoke with Chris Littlefield (legal) a few moments ago and he would like 
for you to call Dial's treasury person, Dave Riddiford.  Dial really wants an 
explanation of how/why all numbers were selected for inclusion in the 
Schedule and CSA, including:

(1)  3rd p. D/F Threshold Amount
(2) whether Credit Event Upon Merger can be tied to ratings downgrade (I 
explained the MAC trigger)
(3) Collateral Threshold  (and, by the way, Chris says that he never 
understood that Dial would ever have to post)
(4) Min. Transfer/Rounding

Not too bad.  Call me if you have any questions.  From the legal perspective, 
I have only to resolve recording and arbitration.  Thanks.  Sara"

immediately, please send all correspondence, questions or requests to Lucy

remaining National Gypsum Company trade), including the trades that came down 
yesterday. 

Melba returns on Monday and will resume her role documenting Confirmations. 
In my absence, Lucy will assume my role of review/additional support, and 
will coordinate any new issues, language, etc. with Sara Shackleton.

As with myself, please realize that Lucy wears many hats, and extend to her 
the same patience and understanding that you give me.

Sara:  Enclosed are clean and marked copies of a revised schedule for
the proposed ISDA master agreement between Enron and FP&L.  I have
only reviewed and commented at this time on the master agreement's
schedule itself (I have left the credit support annex attached within
the same document, as you sent it, but have not yet reviewed or
commented on it, so ignore it for now).  I have reviewed many such
schedules and found your form to be quite good (as you may know, those
of some large market-makers are not so good, so please don't take this
as patronizing; it's a sincere compliment).  Hopefully you will find
the revisions equally acceptable.  I look forward to your comments or
approval.  Regards, -Serge

      Attached for your review are (i) an execution copy of the Assignment
of Membership Interest, (ii) a draft of the Swap Termination Agreement, and
(iii) a draft of the Guaranty Termination Agreement.

 I told Michelle Vonderhaar that we would e-mail to her copies of the
Termination Agreements after you have had a chance to review them.  Please
let me know when you would like me to send them to her.  Michelle also
indicated that it would probably take a couple of days to locate someone who
is able to sign on behalf of Bankers Trust International PLC, which means
that we will have to execute those documents as of a date after March 28,
2000.

 Please do not hesitate to call should you have any questions.

Hello everyone,

Hope you have had a wonderful week thus far.  I have attached the revised 
confirm for ESA LLC, but before a signature is applied, I would like to get 
an okay from you.  I spoke to Sara, and she said that we were working on 
getting Jana Morse as an approved signer for ESA.

Have a great day!

Sheetal :)

Sara,

Greetings!!!  Thanks for joining us again. I'm sure we'll have a blast and 
yes let's get together so I can update you on our organization.

 I have attached a memo from our guy in Australia who just started in 
January.  Please address his needs and let me know what the status of his 
requests are in a couple of days.  Shane's office number is 011 61 2 9229 
2412.

Paul S. called you because a London group thought they had the ok from Paul 
to trade financials in the UK.  I simply asked him what the difference was 
between that group and mine with respect to Enron's UK regulatory status.

Regards,

Gary

Subject:  Various Issues

Gary,

I haven't been able to get a hold of you the last couple of days and there 
are a
few things I wanted to discuss.

1. If you don't have a problem I am proposing to put in place an execution
agreement with ABN Amro Futures who will give up to Commonwealth Bank on 
behalf
of Carr. I have already put the steps in motion for this to occur through 
Shari
Stack.

2. I would like to put in place an ISDA between ENA and Commonwealth Bank as I
have been talking to their FX desk and would like to be in the position of 
being
able to trade with them. I will talk to Credit about it if you don't have a
problem.

3. The laywer here told me the other day that we have not signed an ISDA with
Westpac because of a disagreement over guarantees. Apparently Westpac have 
been
hard to deal with through the whole process although all other issues have 
been
signed off. When the FX contact came here for a meeting yesterday I told him
that I wouldn't be dealing with them until the ISDA was sorted out and he said
that Houston is dealing without an ISDA so I should. My concern is that while 
we
are dealing with them there is no pressure on them to sort out the ISDA.


I sent a book to Clara about Australian financial markets and included in the
package a surf lifesaving cap because I had heard you wanted one. It is the
competition cap of Memaid Beach Surf Lifesaving Club.

Everything else is going fine

Regards,

Shane

Close.  Credit is considering credit terms for the deal.  If executed today, 
we'll have to do a Deemed ISDA and simultaneously send out a draft ISDA for 
negotiation.  Do you have a deal ticket already?  I understand it's a 7-year

Sara,

Pushkar is in the process of doing an Interest Rate Swap with EMP Echo LLC.  
The deal has been approved by credit already.  Davis Thames is involved in 
the transaction and can give you the name of the attorney who is representing 
Echo.  Davis was thinking that his attorney (Gerald something) would prepare 
an ISDA and send it to you to put a Master Agreement in place.  Let me know 
what I need to do, as I will be waiting to find out what form of confirmation 
to use for the transaction.  Thank you very much for your help.

Hi Nancy!  I left a voice mail for you in Sao Paulo since Lynn told me you 
were there.  We need to authorize someone in the US to execute swaps on 
behalf of ESA.  Brent Hendry (after speaking with Jana Morse) thought Martha 
Stevens or Scott Mills would be good candidates (if not already authorized).  
Please give me or Brent a call. We're trying to get this done next week since 
TBS executed a swap in January, 2000 and we are still trying to confirm. 
Also, let's have lunch.  Sara "

I'm on someone else's computer - I'm having all sorts of e-mail problems 
today.

The business person on the  EES side to be signing this letter would be Mark 
S. Muller.  He is a Managing Director of EES LLC.

I don't necessarily have a problem with the description of the back-to-back 
obligations, but I'd like to know Gareth's opinion as to whether the language

(1)  The term ""Threshold Amount"" as used in Annex B refers to the threshold 
for cross default purposes under Section 5(a)(vi) of the ISDA boilerplate by 
reference to outstanding loans (""obligations for the payment of money"", i.e., 
""Specified Indebtedness"" in Section 14 of the ISDA boilerplate).  Credit sets 
the threshold level and we input that number into the document.

(2)  Susan Bailey will send you the ISDA Master Agreement boilerplate.  Her 
number is X34737.

SUSAN:  Please send Davis the ISDA boilerplate (no CSA).  Thanks.  Sara

As we discussed on the phone, the floating rate day count convention should 
be Actual/360.

Sara, could you easily explain what the Threshold Amount means in Annex B?  I 
tried to look it up on the web but couldn't find anything.  Additionally, if 
you have an extra copy of ISDA up there, I might like to have a copy (hope 
you don't hurt yourself laughing...).

Thanks & regards,

Susan,

Can you forward this to the appropriate legal person:

BP Amoco Corporation - still marks up Annex A, Setoff paragraph so that the 
word ""derivative"" is added (see attached - change in red, Section 5) We have 
recieved prior approval to ""Execute"" the EOL deals in which this change is 
made, but not the non-EOL deals.  Is this still correct?




Aquila Canada Corp. - marks up Annex A as attached (see markups in red)  (All 
are EOL deals)

Hi, Trena!  I am working again with Gary's desk now that Shari has moved on 
to power trading (legal).  My first task has been to reconcile the 
outstanding Sutton Bridge transactions.  I find three:

(1)  Currency Swap between ECT and Sutton Bridge Financing Ltd:  booked 
5/22/97 [ 12/31/97 through 6/30/22]

(2)  Currency Swap between ECT and Sutton Bridge Power booked 1/28/97 [ 
through 4/29/11]

(3)  Currency Swap between ""ECT"" and ""Sutton Bridge"" booked 3/29/00 [ through 
3/31/03].  I have only seen the ticket and not the confirm.

I understand that all swap transactions are to be terminated with the pending 
Sutton Bridge sale.  Are you terminating these three (3) trades?  Are there 
others?  What is the third trade which was booked last week (I don't know 
anything about it)?  Someone should be documenting the termination and 
payout.  Please let me know ASAP as the lawyers are headed to San Antonio

For a deal with Southern they would like to amend the true up period to be 90 
days. 

This is some language we used on an older deal under Special Provisions:

For purposes of this Transaction, the phrase ""within 30 calendar days"" in 
line 5 of Section 7.3 of the Commodity Definitions shall be replaced by the 
phrase ""within 90 calendar days.""

Is it O.K. to use this again.

""Following Business Day Convention"" means the convention for adjusting any 
relevant date if it falls on a day that is not a Business Day (when 
commercial banks settle payments is USD in N.Y., for our purposes) to the 
first following day that is a Business Day or a trading day for the relevant 
floating price source.  I hope I have given you a simple description.

Sara,

Patti Melcher, ENA's counterparty in the swap, called to ask me for a 
definition of the ""Following Business Day Convention"" referenced on page 2 of 
her confirmation.  I had not received my copy of ISDA yet, and so could not 
answer the question.  Would you mind forwarding back to both of us?

Thanks & regards,

It is on Thursday April 27th this year. I wanted to go ahead and start 
organizing what we should do for Kaye since she has supported us all 
outstandingly well this past year (surprise, surprise...) .  I have 
personally already gotten her a small present but would be happy to go in on 
flowers and/or lunch for her. 

Please email me back by the end of the week if you want to participate in: 

1. Lunch

2. Flowers

3. Lunch & Flowers

Also - I am open to suggestions on the lunch place. Anybody have a 
suggestion??   Some that I would propose are:  Mark's, Ruggles, Crostini, 
Boulevard Bistrot.

Shari, Westpac have contacted me re putting in place an ISDA with EAF. As far 
as we ar concerned it will cover just power trades and commodities. A couple 
of questions. 

Our credit sheet required a MAC trigger (fall below BBB-) for additional 
credit support. Was this changed? The ISDA Schedule Westpac sent me has no 
such provision?  
Can I have a copy of the Enron Corp.guaranty you finally settled with

In reply to your enquires:

Infinity number 10300 is a hedge that was put on with SBPL.  This is to 
remain in place
Infinity number 25556 is a hedge that was put on for SBFL.  This is to remain 
in place.


The other deal that you enquired about was a simple passthrough of cash.  
This was a spot deal and has matured.

Bob:  I haven't commented on preferred guaranty formats, I only asked Kris to 
fax the form of guaranty which Ed Wood had sent originally.  I thought that 
the e-mailed guaranty was the same as Ed Wood had distributed but I hadn't 
verified that item prior to sending.  I have not had a chance to review

Sara, I received your e-mail yesterday and was unsure whether the form of
guaranty you attached was the correct form. I understand you talked to Kris
and agreed that the original form distributed was not the preferred
document. Was the attached guaranty another copy of the first form of
guaranty distributed, or is the updated version?

In reply to your enquires:

Infinity number 10300 is a hedge that was put on with SBPL.  This is to 
remain in place
Infinity number 25556 is a hedge that was put on for SBFL.  This is to remain 
in place.


The other deal that you enquired about was a simple passthrough of cash.  
This was a spot deal and has matured.

Subject: Re: About to trade Weather on Thursday  

Raymond can we discuss. 

(a) This is definitely a possibility. We could back the trade out to EAF 
through an ISDA Agreement we have with RMT (an Enron company based in 
Houston).  
(b) This is also an alternative from an Australian regulatory perspective. 
(c)  Conceptually no reason why not except EAF  has no underlying ISDA 
Agreement with SG USA. Also I suspect this would be less tax effective than 
either one or two. 
(d) Another alternative - We have an ISDA Agreement between EAF and SG 
Australia Ltd . Could these entities be the contracting parties?

Raymond it is really a tax call as to which is the most effective contracting 
structure. I have copies in Susan Musch (our Houston based tax expert). Susan 
have you any ideas. I suspect also there will be some Enron management 
determinations as to the identity of the Enron entity entering into the 
trade. 

One other point Raymond if ENA is the contracting party it really is outside 
my jurisdiction. I would request  Sara Stackleton (who recently assumed took 
overe from Shari Shackleton) assist.

Dear David,

We are about to do a weather trade with SocGen or Aquila on Melbourne 
temperature
Expected trade date is Thursday - 13 April.
Steven Vu, Head Weather trader in Houston will transact with above thru a 
broker in US.

Premium approx 700k AUD.


What is the best way in terms of regulations and tax - assume limits in place 
!
Houston is to take a  portion of the deal too.

(a) ENA trades with SG USA, then back to back transact between ENA & En Aust ?

(b) ENA trades with SG USA, then gives p&L to  En Aust ?
can this P&L be real income or shadow only ?

(c) En Aust trades with SG Usa ( thru Oz arm of US broker or thru US broker)

or any other suggestions ???

Pls revert :o)
Thx,  Raymond
12 April

Raymond

I am meeting with Susan Musch (APACHI's tax expert) and we will get back to 
you on the tax issues. Immediately I can tell you that back to back deals 
(with no spread) will not work. This raises transfer pricing issues. If the 
deal is SocGen on Melbourne temperatures, why is the counterparty not SocGen 
Aust? Is the deal pure trading, or is it being done to hedge a real exposure 
for Soc Gen. If the deal is being treated in any way as 'insurance' there can 
be issues with the cross border nature. 

I am in 2014 in 3AC if you are around and want to chat about it tonight.

Heidi

Edmund,

ENA legal has suggested that ECTRIC prepare this document as SITA would like 
to use English law.  Attached is the credit worksheet for the ISDA.  You 
should receive all of the file information from Susan Flynn and Sara 
Shackleton.

Thanks for your help,

Hi Nancy!  I left a voice mail for you in Sao Paulo since Lynn told me you 
were there.  We need to authorize someone in the US to execute swaps on 
behalf of ESA.  Brent Hendry (after speaking with Jana Morse) thought Martha 
Stevens or Scott Mills would be good candidates (if not already authorized).  
Please give me or Brent a call. We're trying to get this done next week since 
TBS executed a swap in January, 2000 and we are still trying to confirm. 
Also, let's have lunch.  Sara

Dear David,

Thanks to you for your prompt attention and to Jerven for finding Christian's 
corrected document.

Nick has commenced the process to put a global confirm which can be used 
woeldwide by Enron for weather derivatives, 
He has contacted Paul Simons , ex Clifford Chance , ISDA board member, and 
SFC compliance officer to kick off.

In the meantime, we will use the document below { CDD 13-04-00.doc }
but changes will still be further required - sorry :o(  

A.
Payment Date(s)

want to say that final payment from any adjustment is no later than 20 biz 
days after end of 95 days.
Avoids continual payments if temp is revised frequently in the 95 days.


B.
in Floating amount for 
time, and tighter defn of temperature
and base temp is 18

C.
Data Sources
I want to make the Final payment dependent not on website ( because website 
is not updated when a correction occurs)
but rather the final
Data Source is  ""daily temp and climate archive"" of the National
climate centre ( NCC) of BoM

Do you want me to type up changes for you to peruse or shall i chase up 
directly with Sara ?
Who OKs the wording of the confirm. ?


Thx, Raymond

help them with an interimsolution on this contract.

Further down the line (and this should also be encompassed in the web stuff) 
we need to have alegal group that works toward producing a master contract 
confirm that can be used for all Weather deriv structures and used in a 
global marketplace.  Just a quick job for a supremo like you!!! 

I'll talk to you on Monday when I get back into London about the politics!!!

Subject: CDD Confirmation

Raymond attached is the CDD confirmation form. I have gone through the 
comments on the draft Jerven gave me. The only change I made is the inclusion 
of a weather station number in addition to a name. There was a question mark 
next to the website reference and a comment that there is no quality control 
for public access. Is the website reference OK?

Sara this confirmation follows the ENA model. The changes  only relate to the 
differing measurement references. We also included a  paragraph 5 to further 
reduce the possibility of the trade being characterised as insurance. If ENA 
is the counterparty then it should be enough to reference the relevant ISDA 
Master Agreement and change the references to EAF to ENA.

Due to the timing differences I had a crack at including these changes.   

Attached is an amended confirmation. The only change I was not sure about was 
tightening up the temperature definition. Do you mean moving to greater 
precision in rounding? No problem but we are following the UK approach. 

I would be most interested in any comments Paul would have. By way of 
background I consulted the London office on their rounding conventions for 
Celsuis.

Thanks to you for your prompt attention and to Jerven for finding Christian's 
corrected document.

Nick has commenced the process to put a global confirm which can be used 
woeldwide by Enron for weather derivatives, 
He has contacted Paul Simons , ex Clifford Chance , ISDA board member, and 
SFC compliance officer to kick off.

In the meantime, we will use the document below { CDD 13-04-00.doc }
but changes will still be further required - sorry :o(  

A.
Payment Date(s)

want to say that final payment from any adjustment is no later than 20 biz 
days after end of 95 days.
Avoids continual payments if temp is revised frequently in the 95 days.


B.
in Floating amount for 
time, and tighter defn of temperature
and base temp is 18

C.
Data Sources
I want to make the Final payment dependent not on website ( because website 
is not updated when a correction occurs)
but rather the final
Data Source is  ""daily temp and climate archive"" of the National
climate centre ( NCC) of BoM

Do you want me to type up changes for you to peruse or shall i chase up 
directly with Sara ?
Who OKs the wording of the confirm. ?


Thx, Raymond

Paul,
as per my voicemail - here is a draft confirm for weather - on the deems ISDA 
basis preparred by the guys downunder. Would like you professional input to 
help them with an interimsolution on this contract.

Further down the line (and this should also be encompassed in the web stuff) 
we need to have alegal group that works toward producing a master contract 
confirm that can be used for all Weather deriv structures and used in a 
global marketplace.  Just a quick job for a supremo like you!!! 

I'll talk to you on Monday when I get back into London about the politics!!!

have a great weekend
Nick

Subject: CDD Confirmation

Raymond attached is the CDD confirmation form. I have gone through the 
comments on the draft Jerven gave me. The only change I made is the inclusion 
of a weather station number in addition to a name. There was a question mark 
next to the website reference and a comment that there is no quality control 
for public access. Is the website reference OK?

Sara this confirmation follows the ENA model. The changes  only relate to the 
differing measurement references. We also included a  paragraph 5 to further 
reduce the possibility of the trade being characterised as insurance. If ENA 
is the counterparty then it should be enough to reference the relevant ISDA 
Master Agreement and change the references to EAF to ENA.

Due to the timing differences I had a crack at including these changes.   

Attached is an amended confirmation. The only change I was not sure about was 
tightening up the temperature definition. Do you mean moving to greater 
precision in rounding? No problem but we are following the UK approach. 

I would be most interested in any comments Paul would have. By way of 
background I consulted the London office on their rounding conventions for 
Celsuis.

As part of the Sutton Bridge unwind, Trena has executed a foreign exchange

appropriate person to send the confirm to, or should it be someone else?

I'm on someone else's computer - I'm having all sorts of e-mail problems

The business person on the  EES side to be signing this letter would be Mark 
S. Muller.  He is a Managing Director of EES LLC.

I don't necessarily have a problem with the description of the back-to-back 
obligations, but I'd like to know Gareth's opinion as to whether the language

Sara,

You are correct on both fronts. ""Enron Power Holdings"" is, I believe, an 
error.

Please ADVISE if ""European Power Holdings"" is the correct legal entity for 
closing out the FX piece of Sutton Bridge and if Maroon Aboudy is the party 
to whom a confirm should be directed.  Thanks.  SS

Sara et al.,

As part of the Sutton Bridge unwind, Trena has executed a foreign exchange 
deal with the parent company--European Power Holdings.  Is the attached form 
of confirmation acceptable to that counterparty?  Also, is Maroon Aboudy the 
appropriate person to send the confirm to, or should it be someone else?  
Thank you.

Of course I received this except that it arrived at 9:40pm last night.  The 
mansion was FAB! and we bought a Piero Fornasetti table (that belonged to 
Stanley Marcus) at a neat shop called Collage.  I am currently into Danish 
modern and bought a Poul Kjaareholm chair at the annual Knoll sale (and I 
know that the owner of Collage is Danish [modern!!!]).  Star Canyon was 
outstanding and we had a delicious bottle of pinot from Williams & Selyems 
(which we had been trying to locate).  And, yes, we went to a museum with 
Mike's mother and then for Mexican food.  We also saw ""Run, Lola, Run"" which 
is a cool German film with English subtitles.  I wish you would show Mother 
how to send e-mail and just get to search engine like Yahoo! so that she 
could check her stock portfolio periodically.  I spoke with Daddy this 
morning but he had to cut me off as usual.  See you soon, dahling!  CALL ME

Dear Sass,

Did you go to Dallas?  Did you have fun in Dallas?  How was your July 4?
Zachary called yesterday from his trip out of camp.  He told me that his
counselor has stolen a bunch of his clothes.  I'm not sure if I believe
him.  I think he may have just lost everything.

Let me know if you get this.

I miss you.

I've checked my notes and spoken to Heidi and it appears the delay was 
settling the mark up (107.5%) in the Agreement. Heidi believes that this 
figure can be reduced to 100% (which is current practice). If everyone is 
agreeable I will arrange execution.

Subject: OPP confidentiality agreement

Sara, Janice:

I'm not sure which, if either, of you will work with us on this.  We are 
under a somewhat rigid timeline though.  OPP is flying up from Brazil on Mon 
July 12 to hopefully finalize overall agreement in principle on the 
""Contingent Buyer"" transaction terms.  We'd like to finalize our response to 
a confidentiality agrement by Wed 7/7 and send back to OPP for signature.  
From what we see in the document looks like we need to:

work on the wording of the preamble
make ""two-way"" protecting our terms and conditions etc.
add agreement term
add ""confidentiality"" term
define ""products""
require their signature

Comments???

Thanks,

Doug

P.S.  This transaction has about $5 million in value to Enron.  Thanks for 
your urgent attention.

Attached is the Aquila/ENA weather HDD confirmation. A couple of points to 
note.

The Aquila company listed on the Confirmation is the one having an ISDA with 
Enron. I'm not sure if ENA is the Enron counterparty.
If we elect we can put a specific payment date in or just leave it to as 20 
Business Days after the Floating Amount is detetmined.
If there is an Aquila/ENA ISDA then that should be referenced  in Paragraph 1.


Will you pass it on

Marty:  I will have a response to setoff shortly.  With respect to the CSA 
and calculation of the ""Credit Support Amount,"" our change should not create 
any inconsistencies in the calculation of that amount among your 
counterparties since it would only change IF the calculation yielded a 
negative number.  The only reason for ""specifying otherwise"" in Paragraph 13 
is to capture the situation where the Pledgor MIGHT be holding Independent 
Amounts (if there are ever any specified in a particular Transaction) of the 
Secured Party as cushion (which is not meant to be returned until termination 
of Transactions) and subtraction of that amount would create a negative 
number when calculating the Credit Support Amount.  By specifying that the 
Credit Support Amount will be ""the higher of"" the amount calculated (deemed 
to be zero if a negative number) or the sum of the Pledgor's Independent 
Amounts, the latter would prevail.  This calculation method will make a 
difference if, for example, the Secured Party asks for a Return Amount when 
the Pledgor intends to retain any Independent Amounts as cushion (such that 
only Posted Credit Support exceeding the sum of the Independent Amounts will 
be returned).  I hope this helps.  Sara

     Hi Sara,
     Confirming or conversation, only 2 issues remain unresolved.

     1.  Please remove subclause (B) in Part 5(g) Setoff.  As we discussed,
         this contemplates including all kinds of ""obligations of any kind
         whatsoever"" and it is our intent to include only Energy trading
         under this Agreement.

     2.  Please explain the reasoning for modifying the definition of
         ""Credit Support Amount"" in Paragraph 13(b)(C) of the Credit
         Support Annex.  We would prefer to retain the intent of ISDA's
         definition to maintain consistency in the way this amount is
         determined among our counterparties.

     Thank you for all your assistance and I look forward to receiving
     execution copies of the Agreement if these two issues can be resolved.

     Best regards,
     Marty Oelmann

check the status of the assignment.   I know you are busy, but could please

Subject: physical option - proposals, term sheets, pricing


Group - we need to address the due diligence for executing the "" first "" 
physical option transactions in Brasil and for Direct Sales ( and Wholesale 
).  The initial industrial candidates are: 

Owens Corning ( 1.6MWs firm ). 1 site,  peaking unit.  break-even R$182/MW - 
5 year term
Carbocloro ( 10 MWs firm ). 1 site 3rd part re-sale(Copel) , monthly call 
option. supplanting product sales, estimate minimum incentive strike R$ 
125/MW  - 3 or 4 year term,  
O Globo. (1-3MWs) 2 sites, peaking units.  awaiting summary terms and 
conditions. 
White Martins (10-15MWs ).   8 sites (MG), intersite flexibility to adjust 
product between sites and maximize energy re-sale.  3rd party re-sale 
(Cemig). short-term capacity basis indutrial demand for gases short-term 
variable price - 2 or 3 year

In all four cases, Enron is buying the right to buy power and all 3 are 
executable in Q2/Q3.  We are expecting (hoping) to transact paying no premium 
- with the focus on the strike price itself being the profitability incentive 
to the customer.  However, we'll need to guage our pricing ability ( and 
appetite from a book and risk control point of view ) for option length and 
the forward curve, not to mention getting the terms and conditions into 
reasonably standardized and legally binding contracts.  

Wholesale. Am including Wholesale on the wire given both the synergies on 
contracting and pricing and given the significant potential ( benefit and 
opportunity to Enron's regional trading effort ) to launch the physical and 
financial option product line into the commercial Wholesale effort.  

Note:  Particularly to put options - how many LDCs would we expect to charge 
us anything for our right to sell them power at R$30 or R$40/MWh ( or have 
charged us  3-5 months ago for the right to sell closer to R$50-60.  

We're having first sit down with Remi and Sami this afternoon, Wed Apr 19; 
please shoot any/all additional inputs, insights.

In regards to these trades, we have not had a CFD confirmation from Phibro 
before.  I realize the trades have expired but would like the format to be 
reviewed.  I will then add it to the incoming confirmation file for future 
use.  As far as the payment date, 5 days after the Floating Price is 
determined.  These deals settled about the 11th of June.

Hi, Shane.  Here's a quick update.  As you can see, the Westpac ISDA is a 
done deal.  Susan Bailey (paralegal) had been holding the Commonwealth ISDA 
because she didn't have an address.  I asked her to email you for the info.  
I am working on ABN AMRO.  I' m also trying to keep up with you other trading 
activity.  Let me know if you ever have any questions.  Sara

John,
 Could you set up EnSight Resources an account with Enron, so they can 
transact some NYMEX NG fixed price swaps with us in the near future.  Karen 
Anthony is the CFO and she can provide you any financials that you need to 
get them set-up.

The address is:

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Subject: EOL -Enserco Energy

Brant, Tom

Enserco Energy busted on line today.  Although we are collateralized with 
L/C's, our exposure is increasing due to the size of the on line volume they 
have been doing.  ENA sent an ISDA draft to them a few weeks ago, with no 
response.  Today I spoke to their Credit Manager, Don Perkins, and informed 
him that we can not take on additional volume unless we have an executed 
ISDA. He is going to review, with his legal, the contract and will get back 
to me.  At this point I feel we should not take on any further transactions 
until the ISDA is signed.  Please let me know your thoughts.

Russell

Please forward this e-mail on to the appropriate EOL people so they are aware 
of Enserco's status.

I'm on someone else's computer - I'm having all sorts of e-mail problems 
today.

The business person on the  EES side to be signing this letter would be Mark 
S. Muller.  He is a Managing Director of EES LLC.

I don't necessarily have a problem with the description of the back-to-back 
obligations, but I'd like to know Gareth's opinion as to whether the language 
is too broad.

Tanya:  I left you a voice mail earlier this week on the single outstanding 
issue:  paragraph (B) of our setoff language.  This provision allows the 
nondefaulting party to withhold any payment it might owe to the defaulting 
party under the master until the nondefaulting party can be certain IN ITS 
REASONABLE DISCRETION  that ANY other payments owed to it (under ANY other 
agreements between the parties)  by the defaulting party have been paid.  
Cargill does not want to ""comingle"" its business.  Remember, we have already 
given in on ""affiliate setoff"".  [the lawyer never raised the paragraph (B) 
issue until this week!] 

Also, Cargill has requested that we change our Credit Support Amount 
definition (but I provided them with an explanation) AND Cargill has decided 
to issue transferable L/C's.

Please let me hear from you so that we can finalize.  I do not know if this 
is a deal breaker."

Hey, Sam:  Great to hear from you and I'm thrilled that your golf game is as 
good as ever.  Have you been playing in Palm Springs or Amelia Island or  The 
Boulders?  I was in Phoenix last year and thought it was wonderful except for 
the fact that people age faster.  I didn't go to Baton Rouge for Passover 
since the seders were in the middle of the week.  But I know that my sister 
ordered everything from the Second Avenue Deli in N.Y. and various other 
Manhattan establishments.  My niece has been accepted at that high school in 
Natchitoches for smart kids and Deb is really happy (and sad).  Jennifer is 
only 15.  My nephew is tall, handsome and driving Steve crazy.  My parents 
are fine and my Dad is going to have a knee-cap replacement sometime soon.  
He'll be 83 in June.  I've decided on in-house training for my dogs and the 
trainer thinks that CHLOE needs the most ""help"" since that sweet little 
bichon may try to bite strangers (and maybe friends!) in my home.  Otherwise, 
I'm rocking along.  You know, I never called Helen but I still have her 
number and I'll do it this week.  Hope all is well.  Do you keep up with 
Ron?  Love, Sara"

Sara, I didn't realize that Shari had left the financial swap group.  She 
just sent me an e-mail telling me that she thought you were handling the 
negotiation of ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada, so I thought I would forward 
this message I sent to Tana today for your information.

Tana, I received a request this week from Jannalyn Galloway of Reliant Energy 
Services Canada, Ltd. to commence the process of putting an ISDA in place 
between Enron Canada Corp. and Reliant Energy Services Canada, Ltd.  We 
recently finalized a Master Physical Agreement between these parties and I 
was wondering if you could commence the process of obtaining credit approval 
to do the ISDA and provide a draft to Jannalyn.  Her fax number is 
713-207-9663, her direct line is 713-207-5893 and her e-mail address is as 
above.

Thanks for you help on this and if you need anything further from me, let me 
know.

Sara,

Carol and Rod are working on the ISDA comparison for a potential ISDA between 
ENA and Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  Last week, Cregg Lancaster furnished 
Reliant's newest form of Schedule and Paragraph 13 for our review.  You may 
want to visit with Carol as to the status.

Also, it is my understanding that once we have the ISDA between ENA and 
Reliant in place, that that form of agreement would be used for the ECC and 
Reliant Canada agreement (with the exception of the provisions specific to 
Canadian entities).

Hope this explanation help.

Susan

Sara, I didn't realize that Shari had left the financial swap group.  She 
just sent me an e-mail telling me that she thought you were handling the 
negotiation of ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada, so I thought I would forward 
this message I sent to Tana today for your information.

Thanks

Tana, I received a request this week from Jannalyn Galloway of Reliant Energy 
Services Canada, Ltd. to commence the process of putting an ISDA in place 
between Enron Canada Corp. and Reliant Energy Services Canada, Ltd.  We 
recently finalized a Master Physical Agreement between these parties and I 
was wondering if you could commence the process of obtaining credit approval 
to do the ISDA and provide a draft to Jannalyn.  Her fax number is 
713-207-9663, her direct line is 713-207-5893 and her e-mail address is as 
above.

Thanks for you help on this and if you need anything further from me, let me 
know.

Harry Arora (e-commerce group) wants to take a look at Goldman's online 
trading operation.  His motive is to explore/navigate the site during the 
next 30 days (but not trade).  I told Harry that I would need to review the 
agreement and negotiate with Goldman just as I would any agreement in order 
to not set any precedent with Goldman for future agreements.  Although Harry 
does not intend to trade at all, and we could terminate the agreement when he 
is done, I suppose Gary may want to trade with Goldman online in the future.  
We could negotiate another agreement at a later date.

Let me know if you would agree to accept Goldman's agreement ""as is"" for the 
limited purpose of allowing Harry to navigate the site, with the intention of 
terminating the agreement when he is done.  Although ENA would have a 
password, access could be limited to Harry [and whomever he needs to 
assist?].  Please let me know your decision.  Thanks.  Sara"

Here's the comparison chart. We've gone as far as we can with SSB. The ball 
is in the traders' court to look at, and approve, the numbers. I don't know 
when, if ever, they'll do that. They don't seem as interested as they once 
were. I think we're more or less on hold waiting for them. SSB is aware of 
the development and said they will push the traders independently.

My schedule is fairly flexible so let me know when you'd like to meet.

Hi, David!  Hope all is well.  Since the referenced swap has been documented 
by ENA, I am now reviewing the Transaction.  I have a number of questions, 
many the result of my unfamiliarity with your Australian Reference/Fallback 
weather stations and a few other comments.  I thought I would mark this up

Thanks for the following email regarding our ability to remove Cargill in our 
reporting
system and replace their name with another broker.

May we discuss the possibility of closing the account with Cargill?

They added approximately $20,000 to our margin account by mistake on April 
7th.
They reversed this yesterday but didn't take out the entire amount, so it 
appears to be
creating additional work for our margin accounting group. Gerri Gosnell in 
our margin accounting
group may be contacted at 3-4898 if you need further information.

Please advise,

Hi,

We discussed closing the Cargill account yesterday possibly but you said that 
you wanted to keep it for
additional trades. We will leave it open as long as you need it.

I talked to Bank One this morning and they said that initially only NG would 
be traded; however,
if you want me to talk to them about rates for doing CL trades, I will.  
Legal should have the paperwork
set up within the next 2 weeks.

My contact at Bank One is Linda Bergdahl, 312-408-8333.

Regards,
David

Tanya:  I left you a voice mail earlier this week on the single outstanding 
issue:  paragraph (B) of our setoff language.  This provision allows the 
nondefaulting party to withhold any payment it might owe to the defaulting 
party under the master until the nondefaulting party can be certain IN ITS 
REASONABLE DISCRETION  that ANY other payments owed to it (under ANY other 
agreements between the parties)  by the defaulting party have been paid.  
Cargill does not want to ""comingle"" its business.  Remember, we have already 
given in on ""affiliate setoff"".  [the lawyer never raised the paragraph (B) 
issue until this week!] 

Also, Cargill has requested that we change our Credit Support Amount 
definition (but I provided them with an explanation) AND Cargill has decided 
to issue transferable L/C's.

Please let me hear from you so that we can finalize.  I do not know if this 
is a deal breaker.

Paul Radous asked me to get in touch with you in connection with a proposed 
ISDA Master Agreement with Kellog Supply Services (Europe) Limited.  I should 
be grateful if you would send me by e-mail all documents relating to the ISDA 
recently executed between ENA and Kellog's as Paul would like us to use 
similar provisions.

In passing, I should point out that both I and my colleague, Michael 
Khajeh-Noori, will be dealing with this matter.  I am in the office on 
Mondays and Tuesdays and Michael is in the office on Thursdays and Fridays.  
I should therefore be grateful if you would address any e-mails to both of us 
(we can both be contacted on the same extension: 34539).

If you have any questions, please let me know.

With kind regards

Deepak

Paul: will you be preparing a credit worksheet for this entity?

Susan:  I wanted to clarify  whether Enron Australia Pty. Ltd. needs to 
execute ISDA Master Agreements with the SAME counterparties which already 
have agreements with ENA (and vice versa).  As an example, I can only rely 
upon tax advice ENA has previously received in connection with the services 
agreement between ENA and ECT Canada.  For book and tax purposes, the trade 
is recorded on the risk books of the Enron affilate ultimately booking the 
trade but the transaction is actually documented in the name of the Enron 
affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterpary.  The Enron 
affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterparty then transacts 
with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through a bulk swap arrangement).  The 
credit risk remains with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through an internal 
back to back transaction with the ""booking"" Enron affiliate)  for which the 
""booking"" Enron affiliate will presumably pay a fee pursuant to the services 
agreement.

Consider:  ENA is negotiating an agreement with Commonwealth Bank of 
Australia.  Will Enron Australia require a separate master with Commonwealth 
Bank of Australia?  Or will the services agreement permit the hereinabove 
described arrangement?"

Subject: Brazilian Regulations for Swaps & Prepays

Antonio Felix,

As Enron is finding several opportunities involving financial derivatives in 
Brazil, we would like to get from Tozzini Freire Law Firm a summarized but 
concise read on the ""cans and cannots"" of these type of transactions in 
Brazil. Here is my understanding of the regulations from the memo you have 
already sent to us regarding swaps and prepays as well as a list of the most 
common examples of deals that Enron would be encountering in the marketplace. 
I would appreciate if you could comment on what is written here and also add 
further information so Enron can have some sort of menu of deals of this 
nature that can be pursued. I would like to ask you to add your comment in 
this same message to make the review process a little easier. Thank you 
inadvance for your attention.

Swaps (Pulp & Paper, Petrochem, Power)

OTC Swaps

The Central Bank regulates swap transactions involving local financial 
institutions acting either as dealers for their own account or as 
intermediaries to the contracting parties. When the financial institutions 
act as intermediaries, the agreements are in fact private agreements 
negotiated by two non-financial companies, but become subject to the 
requirements and regulations normally applicable to swaps involving financial 
institutions. According to regulations currently in force, such swaps can 
relate to exchange rates, interest rates, gold and price indices.

All of the swap agreements involving financial institutions must be 
registered with CETIP or with another custody and clearing system authorized 
by the Central Bank or the CVM (Brazilian SEC). As a matter of practice, the 
agreements used by the banks that participate in the swap market do not 
follow a standard form, since normally each bank has a particular sample form 
with which it feels more comfortable.

Derivatives
In addition to exchange-traded derivatives and OTC swaps involving financial 
institutions, there is no legal impediment, in principle, to derivatives 
transactions being privately negotiated and entered into between two 
interested parties. As a general rule in Brazil, as long as no specific 
prohibition is found in the law, parties are free to negotiate agreements 
that best suit their interests.

International Hedge 
Central Bank regulations authorize that Brazilian companies enter into 
transactions abroad, either in exchanges or having a financial institution as 
their counterpart, to hedge against the fluctuation of interest rates, 
exchange rates or commodity prices in the international markets. 

Such hedge transactions must refer to payments in foreign currency scheduled 
to be made by or to the Brazilian company in respect of commercial or 
financial rights or obligations, or to payments in local currency arising out 
of certain financial obligations subject to the variation of exchange rates 
and payments relating to imports, exports or local transactions involving 
commodities priced according to their valuation in foreign exchanges. The 
commercial market exchange rates are applicable to foreign exchange 
agreements referring to remittances of currency in connection with hedge 
transactions.

When the underlying obligation/right is registered with the Central Bank, the 
corresponding hedge transaction must be informed to the Central Bank within 
10 days of its execution. When there is no registration with the Central 
Bank, the banks executing the foreign exchange agreements relating to the 
hedge transaction must verify the existence of the obligation/right being 
hedged.

Examples

Commodity swap between two Brazilian companies:
As per what has been said above, there is nothing that precludes Enron Brazil 
of entering into a swap with another Brazilian company regarding any 
commodity traded by Enron (Pulp, Paper, Petrochem products, Power, Gas). 
Enron does not need to be a financial institutions to provide swaps 
transactions. On the other hand, I am not sure yet on the following points: 
(1) Does such swap agreement should be registered with CETIP or any other 
clearing system to be valid under Brazilian regulations? (2) What are the 
taxes involved in a swap?

Commodity swap between a Brazilian company and an offshore company:
This kind of deal seems to be also available in the Brazilian market and the 
only difference from example 1 would be the fact that it must be registered 
with the Central Bank and it would involved transfer of foreign currency.

Commodity swap between two offshore companies but involving Brazilian exports:
I am not sure if Brazilian regulations would have anything to do with a 
transaction like this one. I would assume that a Brazilian exporter would 
sell to their offshore subsidiary and such subsidiary would sell to their end 
customer. Enron would step in and offer a swap agreement for the offshore 
subsidiary of the Brazilian company therefore Enron would not have any 
involvement with Brazilian regulations because it would not be dealing with 
Brazil. 


Prepays (Pulp & Paper, Petrochem, Power)

The regulations currently in force governing export prepayments, especially 
Central Bank of Brazil's Carta-Circular 2624, of February 14, 1996, establish 
that all repayments of principal under such transactions must necessarily be 
made by means of shipments of the relevant exported goods.  Carta-Circular 
2624 allows cash remittances abroad only in regard to payments of interest 
under the facility.  Therefore, it is not possible to structure a transaction 
where the repayment of principal will be made only in cash or where the 
borrower has the ability to choose between paying cash or exporting the goods.

A transaction that involves structuring a direct loan to the Brazilian 
company where the value of the principal of which would be tied to the price 
of the relevant commodity is very difficult to be approved.  Under a direct 
loan registered with the Central Bank the borrower may remit all due amounts 
of principal and interest in accordance with the schedule of payments 
attached to the certificate of registration. The problem with such 
alternative is that, although there are no express regulations preventing it 
to do so, the Central Bank will most probably not issue a prior authorization 
for such type of loan, as it only normally issues authorizations for normal 
loans where the principal is a fixed amount and the interest rate is either a 
fixed rate or a floating rate (normally based on LIBOR or US Treasury).  It 
should also be noted that generally speaking all interest payments under such 
an agreement are subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% p.a.

CC 5 Account

A possible alternative way to structure a prepay would be by using a 
non-registered loan with the Central Bank.  Under such alternative, the funds 
disbursed by Enron under the loan would be remitted to Brazil through an 
international transfer of Brazilian currency, as allowed by Circular 2677 of 
the Central Bank of Brazil. The international transfer of Brazilian currency 
(""International Transfer"") is a system which uses a non-resident current 
account in Brazil and the Brazilian interbank foreign exchange market to 
effect remittances of funds to and from Brazil.  Under such system, a lender 
that wishes to disburse funds to a Brazilian borrower makes a foreign 
currency deposit with a bank located outside of Brazil (""offshore bank"")  and 
instructs the offshore bank to deliver such dollars to a Brazilian bank in 
exchange for Brazilian currency.  Such Brazilian currency is then deposited 
in a non-resident account held by the offshore bank in Brazil and thereafter 
transferred to the borrower. The repayments follow the inverse procedure, 
i.e. the borrower deposits the amount in a non-resident account of an 
offshore bank and instructs it to exchange the funds into foreign currency 
and deliver them to the lender abroad.

The main differences between the registered loans and the non-registered 
loans are that the non-registered loans are not subject to prior approval by 
the Central Bank of Brazil (and therefore not subject to scrutiny as to their 
minimum tenors and applicable interest rates) and the applicable foreign 
exchange rate to non-registered loans is the floating rate (as opposed to the 
commercial rate of exchange). All transfers of funds to Brazil as 
International Transfers are subject to a Financial Transactions Tax (""IOF"") 
at the rate of 2% on the amount transferred, plus a bank fee that normally 
ranges from 0.4% to 0.6% of such amount.  Any interest payments under a 
non-registered loan are subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% (or 25% 
if the lender is located in a tax-haven jurisdiction).

I don't think this type of transaction is the best way to circumvent some of 
the Brazilian regulations regarding prepayment given the bad press that deals 
via the CC 5 Account mechanism would bring to Enron but I have it addressed 
just in case someone does not share the same opinion. 

Examples

Financial prepay between two Brazilian companies
Not allowed unless the company providing the prepay qualifies as a financial 
institution as per Brazilian law. Since it will not be the case in Enron's 
cases, we should not focus in these kind of transactions.

Financial prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company
As it has been mentioned before it is allowed as long as Enron can structure 
the prepay in way where there is a pre-established amortization schedule for 
principal and interest. It is very hard to structure a prepay with specific 
split between principal and interest because the objective of the prepay is 
to lock on a certain volume of a product and not on a specific price. 
Therefore, if Enron prepays for a specific product on a floating basis the 
attached value of that commodity can go up or down as the market fluctuates 
as well as the total value associate to the deal. Such value can be either 
principal or interest and it is impossible to determine what it will be.

Financial prepay between two offshore companies but one being a subsidiary of 
a Brazilian entity
I think there is no restrictions in this case given the whole deal will be 
closed offshore and the Brazilian authorities are not going to be involved. 
It will most likely be a deal involving three parties: a company in Brazil, 
its offshore subsidiary and Enron.

Physical prepay between two Brazilian companies
No restrictions.

Physical prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company
No restrictions as long as there is physical deliveries.

Physical prepay between two offshore companies but  involving Brazilian 
exports
No restrictions. It would also involve three parties: a company in Brazil, 
its offshore subsidiary and Enron.

Thanks,

Gustavo

Subject: SEMPRA

It has recently emerged that we have concluded financially-settled trades 
from London with Sempra in the name of ECT (Houston).

Unfortunately, this could create a significant tax issue for ECT (Houston) 
i.e. a taxable presence in the UK.

Therefore, if we wish to continue trading with Sempra from London, we must 
trade in the name of ECTI (aka ECTRIC), but not ECT (Houston). 

This principle applies generally  - London should not bind ECT (Houston) to 
trades with counterparties.

Please call Janine Juggins or myself if you would like to discuss this.

Best regards

Tanya:  There's no short answer with these people!  I think we are fine with 
their setoff language (part A only) because the NDP always has the option to 
permit setoff to other agreements between the parties as to amounts payable 
by the Payee to the Payer (where the Payer owes money under the ISDA to the 
Payee).  So here's my recommendation:

(1)  Call your friend Andre and hear what he has to say.  He has some kind of 
suggestion about Part (B) and limiting the NDP's payment to the DP to be 
based upon satisfaction that ""nondisputed"" amounts having been paid by the 
DP.  Will he also raise the ""other agreements"" issue here?  Not a clue.

(2)   If Cargill leaves part A in tact and we agree to change part B, I'M 
FINE.  (I'm fine without part B, actually)

(3)  The potential problem is that Cargill and ENA view part A differently, 
right off the bat.  I think Cargill is wrong because they don't read part A 
as applying to ""other agreements between the parties"".  But Cargill proposed 
part A and it DOES apply to ""other agreememts between the parties.""  I don't 
want to start off on the wrong foot so I'm sure I'll have to discuss this 
again with Marty.

Sara

In advance of your calling me later this afternoon, I set out below some 
thoughts the issues to be discussed:

1. Jurisdiction - under the English law Annex the preferable route is 
recourse to the courts - I can confirm that this is Enron London's policy.

2, Non-reliance:  From our telephone conversation yesterday, I understood 
that you said that the CP would be relying on us.  I believe that this should 
not be the case and the usual non-reliance provisions should apply.  If this 
is not the case, then

3. the additional para. (h) that you faxed me earlier today, I am informed, 
is unnecessary.  I also understand that the practical effect of those 
provisions might be to scare the CP.

Please call me so that we can discuss any of the above and/or to confirm that 
you are happy for the documents to go out to the CP.

Thanks
Michael

Dear Ms Lavergne

Further to my email of 14 April 2000 attaching the first drafts of the 
Schedule and the CSA to the Agreement and the Parent Guaranty, I attach 
revised first drafts blacklined against the previous version to show changes.

These contain minor changes predominantly resulting from changing the Enron 
counterparty entity from Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. 
to ENA..

I look forward to hearing from  you.  If I am unavailable please contact my 
colleague, Deepak Sitlani who is also working on this matter (also on 
telephone number +44 20 7783 4539).

Kind regards

finalize the matrix which we have been discussing since the latter part of

Although we were awaiting new Central Bank regulations, I am beginning to

to transactions which may be entered into by entities that are the subject of
the Central Bank regulations.  Please let me know whether or not you agree or

Last week I had sent you a final version of the memorandum regarding pulp and
paper transactions (with attachment).  However, this morning I had an
computer-generated error message regarding that transmission.  I am sending 
you
the files again just in case you didn't receive them or couldn't open them.

If you would like a hard copy, please e-mail me back and I will send you a 
set.
Thanks.

Shari, Westpac have contacted me re putting in place an ISDA with EAF. As far 
as we ar concerned it will cover just power trades and commodities. A couple 
of questions. 

Our credit sheet required a MAC trigger (fall below BBB-) for additional 
credit support. Was this changed? The ISDA Schedule Westpac sent me has no 
such provision?  
Can I have a copy of the Enron Corp.guaranty you finally settled with 
Westpac?  

 Thanks

David,

Further to our telephone conversation, please find attached a draft copy of 
the
Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement.  I have based this draft on the 
recently
completed agreement between Westpac and Enron North America Corp and your 
draft
sent to me in September last year.

I would be grateful if you could review this draft and advise me of any 
comments
that you may have.  If you require a copy of the American Schedule, please let
me know and I will be happy to forward one to you.

As a  Guarantee is to be provided by Enron Corp, I would be grateful if you
could supply a copy of this document for our review.

Please do not hesitate to contact me on any  of the numbers below should you
have any questions.

Thank you for your assistance and I look forward to hearing from you very
shortly.

Attached is a ""high volume"" counterparty list for two categories.  With 
respect to the first category, Carol is handling BPAmoco and I am speaking 
with Cargill.  Should we address Neumin?  And should we actively try to 
replace existing ECT masters with ISDA's?  Sara

Subject: Re: HDD Swap between ENA and Aquila Risk Management Corporation  

Sara I agree that the confirmation should be in a form that is acceptable to 
ENA. We attempted to put use an ENA confirmation format. I have incorporated 
your comments into our latest draft. I did this with some caution as there 
appears to be slight differences between it and the draft you sent me. I 
suggest if you find our section 2 satisfactory then you lift it and place it 
in your standard confirmation. On the issues you raised.
1 October is correct as the termination date as time is measured from 9am 
each day. Hence 30 September finishes at 8:59am on 1 October   
The Payment Date should be at least 20 Business Days after the BoM readings 
to determine the Floating Amount. An alternative wording could be ""the 
earlier of the [specified date] or 20 Business Days after...."" 
 The ""Strike Amount Differential"" and  ""Payment Amount"" could be worded 
alternatively as in the pro forma ENA confirmation attached.  


Would you forward your final wording.

Hi, David!  Hope all is well.  Since the referenced swap has been documented 
by ENA, I am now reviewing the Transaction.  I have a number of questions, 
many the result of my unfamiliarity with your Australian Reference/Fallback

Dear Sara,

Thank you for recently visiting ShareBuilder and opening your new account!
I hope you're excited to put the benefits of ShareBuilder to work in your
investment portfolio.  Regular investing over time can help you build wealth
with the stocks you believe in.

With ShareBuilder, we have made it easy by setting no account or investment
minimums; you simply choose which stocks you want to invest in, how often
you would like to invest (weekly, monthly or on a one-time basis), and how
you would like to fund your account.

Investors have already begun to accumulate some of the biggest name stocks.
Below are the most popular companies chosen by thousands of ShareBuilders
over the last few weeks:

1. Cisco - CSCO
2. Microsoft - MSFT
3. America Online - AOL
4. Nasdaq-100 - QQQ
5. Wal-Mart - WMT
6. Intel - INTC
7. Home Depot - HD
8. Lucent - LU
9. Qualcomm - QCOM
10. General Electric - GE

While ShareBuilder does the work for you, it can't start a recurring
dollar-based investment plan until you create a ShareBuilder Plan and specify 
how
you want to fund your account.  I would like to encourage you to complete
your ShareBuilder Plan at http://www.sharebuilder.com!

Once you've completed your ShareBuilder Plan you only need to choose a
funding option to begin investing.  We offer three easy ways to fund your
ShareBuilder Plan: automatic transfers from your checking account, automatic
payroll deductions from your employer, or simply mail us a check.

If you have any questions along the way, please don't hesitate to contact
one of our customer care agents at mailto:customercare@netstock.com or call
us directly at 1-888-NET-STOK between the hours of 6 AM and 6 PM Pacific
Time, Monday through Friday.

ShareBuilder makes so much sense as part of your long-term investment

Anita:  It was great hearing from you and it sounds as though you have lots 
going on!
I am trying to refresh myself on the type of trading activity which is 
currently taking place in Singapore (physical vs. financial, types of 
commodities) and the confirmation procedures (what is confirmed in Singapore 
vs. what is confirmed in London).  Is there a written set of procedures that 
I can see?  Should I be asking this question of Paul Simons? anyone else?  
Please send me an e-mail.  These issues are arising because of my involvement 
in working with the Brazilian office.  Thanks.  Looking forward to speaking 
to you soon.  Sara"

It seems that there are only a few issues for me to respond as to and these 
are below.  You can handle the rest, I think.  Also, he jumped on the L/C 
removal language that we discussed.

[references are to numbered paragraphs below]
(2)  OK
(5)  Did you ever receive a response from Rhett?
(7)  Per already responded to you.  Please find out if CP has Cayman counsel.
(11)  These are two separate issues.  Short of a conversation, it sounds like 
he is confusing payments on Early Termination with consequential damages.  
The former will capture unpaid premiums in the event of an Early Termination 
based upon failure to pay.
(12)  Need to be consistent for both parties.
(14)  Is he right?
(15)  Verify with Rod.
(17)  I think I reviewed this point already, didn't I?
(19)  Check with Rod and I'll also review.

Susan,

Thank you for the revised drafts. My comments are as follows:

(1) Please date the Master Agreement as of February 1, 2000.

(2) Part 1(a) -Specified Entities. As Enron Corp guarantees the performance of
Enron NAC's obligations under the Agreement, please add the words ""Enron Corp,
but only to the extent that Enron Corp is a Credit Support Provider"". This 
seems
reasonable.

(3) Please re-number the pages so that the Schedule starts on page 19 and the
Paragraph 13 starts on page 11.

(4) Part 1(e) - Payments on Early Termination. I am checking with Tudor as to
whether they are agreeable to Loss for trades going out beyond two years. I
would say, however, that I am not aware that they have agreed to this with any
other counterparty. That said, Per's point that the trades are much shorter 
than
this is noted.

(5) Part 2(b) - Payee tax reps. Ospraie never makes payee tax reps other than
relating to its place of incorporation.  If this is an important point for 
you,
I will get out tax group involved.  However, Tudor prefers that neither party
makes payee tax reps.

(6) Part 3(b) - Documents to be Delivered.  Party B annual financials - should
read ""... 120 days after the end of its fiscal year"".

(7) Part 3(b) - legal opinion. Please confirm that you will pay the costs of
Cayman counsel.

(8) Part 4(h) - Jurisdiction.  I am checking with Tudor as ""any court"" is much
broader than the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the NY courts.

(9) Part 5(b)(g) - Commercial User rep. Tudor cannot make this rep. Please
replace with the following: ""Party A represents, with respect to Options, that
it is a producer, processor, commercial user of, or merchant handling, the
commodity subject to the Transaction or the products or byproducts thereof, 
and
is entering into each Option Transaction solely for purposes related to its
business as such"".

(10) Part 5(f) - Procedures for Entering into Transactions. Please remove the
word ""deemed"" in the last line. This is no longer relevant.

(11) Part 5(i). I am checking with Tudor. Is the ""no consequential damages""
consistent with Part 7 which expressly provides for the payment of out of 
pocket
expenses, the costs of a delta hedge etc. on non-payment of premium in a
currency option?

(12) Part 5(k) - Transfer.  For the part of the paragraph relating to Party A,
please change the proviso to read ""and provided that such transfer will not 
give
rise to adverse tax consequences to Party B or to a Termination Event or an
Event of Default, and the proposed transfer would not adversely affect Party 
B's
existing netting or set-off rights or under applicable law"".  The part of the
paragraph relating to Party B should provide: ""Party B may transfer its rights
and obligations under this Agreement with the prior written consent of Party 
A,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.""  These amendments are intended 
to
be reasonable and fair to both sides.

(13) Part 6 - line 2 ""Definitions"" - typo.

(14) Part 7(b) - please remove the reference to ""ISDA"". The FX Definitions are
previously defined in Part 5(e).

(15) Para 13(b)(ii). Please include longer term Treasuries. My understanding 
is
that this is what has been agreed, but please let me know if this is not your
understanding and I will check with Tudor.

(16) Para 13 (b)(iii). Please remove the reference to L/Cs.

(17) Para 13(d) - Specified Condition (Tax Event) should refer to Section
6(b)(ii) and Specified Condition (TEUM) should refer to Section 6(b)(iii).

(18) Para 13(g). I will check with Tudor.

(19) Para 13(g). I think references to ""Downgraded Party"" and ""Credit Rating
Event"" are inappropriate. Please clarify. Is there any way you will agree to 
the
provisions of Paragraph 6(c) without more? What seems to be important is that
the Secured Party is not a Defaulting Party - i.e. Para 13(g)(i)(1) (not (2)).
This is consistent with Para 6(c) of the pre-printed form. Para 13(h) is 
related
to this issue.

(20) Para 13(i) and (j) - please remove. L/C-related provisions are no longer
relevant.

I look forward to receving revised drafts of the Schedule, Paragraph 13 and
guarantee in due course.

Kind regards.

David:  I will try to call you before I leave work today to follow up with 
any questions you may have with respect to the following items:

(1)  I am having the Representative Agreement executed by ENA and will return 
an original to your attention.  Shari suggested that Susan Musch initial the 
agreement and Susan is out until May 22.
(2)  The ENA/Aquila weather deal has not been finalized ONLY because I have 
been waiting to actually view the Floating Price source materials which our 
traders have never been able to produce or cite a reference to (so that I 
could view).  There is no problem with the deal.
(3)  As a policy matter for Enron Australia Finance Pty. Limited, do you 
always agree to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South 
Wales as opposed to arbitration?  I am negotiating the ENA/ABN AMRO 
(Australian branch) futures agreement and am trying to determine appropriate 
jurisdiction.
(4)  ENA is attempting to draft an ISDA Master Agreement with a company 
incorporated in New Guinea (which may have a US office).  I don't know a darn 
thing about New Guinea law.  Do you happen to know if we've ever dealt in New 
Guinea, any lawyers located in New Guinea, what law is used (I guess New 
Guinea!) or whether it's similar to other PacRim countries? 

I'll speak with you later.  Regards.  Sara"

Rick:  With a little luck, I can attach the first page of each of the 
foregoing documents and the signature block for the ISDA Master Agreement (at 
the bottom of the first page of the ISDA Master Agreement).  The full set of 
signature documents comprises four pieces:

(2)  Schedule to the Master Agreement [previously emailed to you]
(3)  [BOILERPLATE] ISDA Credit Support Annex  [NOTE:  the document contains 
12 paragraphs]
(4)  Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex [previously emailed to you]

When we are ready to execute documents, we generally send out a complete

probably have the word ""DRAFT"" plastered all over them and we would normally 
remove this wording.  Please call me in the morning so that we can be sure to

Jack:  I just spoke with Karola and she tells me that you want to talk about
the
guaranty.  I didn't recall if you had ever reviewed our proposed format.
Also,
I am aware that Enron Corp. previously issued a ""General Guarantee
Agreememt"" on
behalf of Enron North America Corp. (formerly, Enron Capital & Trade
Resources
Corp.) on January 28, 1998.  Which format are you interested in using?  Our

Subject: Re: HDD Swap between ENA and Aquila Risk Management Corporation  

Sara I agree that the confirmation should be in a form that is acceptable to 
ENA. We attempted to put use an ENA confirmation format. I have incorporated 
your comments into our latest draft. I did this with some caution as there 
appears to be slight differences between it and the draft you sent me. I 
suggest if you find our section 2 satisfactory then you lift it and place it 
in your standard confirmation. On the issues you raised.
1 October is correct as the termination date as time is measured from 9am 
each day. Hence 30 September finishes at 8:59am on 1 October   
The Payment Date should be at least 20 Business Days after the BoM readings 
to determine the Floating Amount. An alternative wording could be ""the 
earlier of the [specified date] or 20 Business Days after...."" 
 The ""Strike Amount Differential"" and  ""Payment Amount"" could be worded 
alternatively as in the pro forma ENA confirmation attached.  


Would you forward your final wording.

Hi, David!  Hope all is well.  Since the referenced swap has been documented

many the result of my unfamiliarity with your Australian Reference/Fallback

Greetings to you both!  It has been awhile since we last spoke.  I would like

finalize the matrix which we have been discussing since the latter part of 
1999.
Although we were awaiting new Central Bank regulations, I am beginning to

that the Central Bank revisions will not impact the matrix except with respect
to transactions which may be entered into by entities that are the subject of
the Central Bank regulations.  Please let me know whether or not you agree or

Good afternoon Sara,

Please accept my apologies for not responding earlier.  With regard to the pre
printed terms of the  PSA/ISMA Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA) 
please
find enclosed one copy, herein, for your information
(See attached file: PREPRINTED TERMS OF THE GMRA DATED AS MAY 2000.doc)

In addition, you did mention about the existing repo doc with  Enron North
America.  Please note that the negotiations of the BMA (former PSA) are 
handled
by our New York head office, so I shall check with my colleague and revert.
Could you please advise what you require me to do: are you checking to find 
out
if we have a BMA in place ?  or do you need an executed copy of the BMA?

Please advise.
With best regards,
Monica

As a result of Jeff Nogid's request, here is a recap of the Morgan Stanley 
situation:

(1)  Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.
 This is the entity for commodity trading.
 (i)  ECT has a Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated 6/16/92
 (ii)  ECTRIC has an ISDA dated 3/2/99, but eff. 8/27/97

(2)  Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.
 Jeff Nogid requesting new master for fixed income transactions

(3)  Morgan Stanley International Limited
 This is the entity for equity trading.  Will Nogid or Kinneman ever need 
this one?

Each of these companies has a different lawyer to negotiate the agreement.

Each Morgan Stanley entity might require a separate guaranty.  Anne Clark in 
legal (Cap Services) will let me know.

I will put (2) in place.  Do you want to pursue upgrading (1)(i) or 
addressing (3)?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara"

Mark:  Barbara Gray and Shonnie Daniel worked on a Q1 deal between Enron and 
Texaco to create a JV called BL.  I believe that the ownership is 60/40, 
respectively.  BL has its own employees drawn from both companies and 
elsewhere but is still requiring additional services.  The swap group has 
already opened two futures accounts for BL and drafted resolutions, 
authorized trader lists, etc.  Before the closing, there was an 
""understanding"" that Enron would assist BL for a short time (until June, 
2000).  However, credit (through Bill Bradford) negotiated a 3-year services 
agreement for credit services to BL (I believe based upon 1 full-time person 
run through an entire budget).  Randy Curry (BL's president) has requested 
that legal (swaps group) consider a short-term services arrangement (I am 
told by credit this would be for approx. 6-9 months; BL looking for approx. 
20 ISDA's).  By the way, ENA is trying to negotiate an ISDA with BL but we 
have no one to negotiate with!  BL has not yet hired an in-house lawyer.

Carol:  Laurel Adams was wondering whether any of the paralegal candidates 
who we interviewed might have a good background for ""back office"" duties.  I 
have no idea whether salaries are comparable but she needs someone who can 
spot issues and learn the confirm process at the same time (if no experience 
in the confirmation area).  What do you think?  Sara"

Carol:  I've been meeting with Jarrod about confirm templates.  Prior to the 
departures of Shari, Lynda, et al, there was a move afoot to create an annex 
of weather definitions which could be incorporated by reference into the 
confirms (or added to the Schedule), either of which approaches would shorten 
the confirms considerably.  Jarrod advises that the EOL T&C's for the 
varioius weather products contain the basic information which can be drafted 
in the annex.  Jarrod will send us the EOL T&C's.  I think it's a great idea. 

Jarrod will also send the existing  weather templates (which may be slightly 
different from those Shari gave us earlier).  We should verify that the 
weather rep appears in the weather option templates (since we have agreed to 
remove that rep from the Schedule).  Also, shouldn't we verify that all 
weather trades are executed under NY law (they probably are anyway) since we 
now have the opinion from the NY Office of General Counsel?

I have two questions:

(1)  If the ECC financial trading business is to be confirmed in Canada, 
won't Greg Johnston need a ""short course"" on ISDA/omnibus, etc.?  I was 
thinking of practical issues as well as Tana's more formalized training.

(2)  Have you spoken with Mary Solomson about Anthony?  I'm not sure if Tana 
has organized her lunch with global contracts, but it sounded as though 
Anthony was part of the problem and that Mary should be at the lunch."

Subject:  Igaras Prepay - Next Steps

The structure for the financial prepay doesn't seem  to work under the 
Brazilian regulation therefore we need to come up with a different structure. 
David has put together a couple of different structures but basically all of 
them will run into the same problem and the Central Bank won't accept those.

We (Gustavo and I) had lunch last Thursday with a Mr. Jose Lavia owner of 
Fair Corretora (a brokerage house that I've worked with) basically he thinks 
that the financial prepay structure is not going to work because the Central 
Bank wants to see benefits for the country and impacts in the country's 
current balance.
He asked us to send him a draft of the structure and he will discuss with his 
partners to see if they came up with different ideas.

Below are the comments of the next steps and ideas from Antonio Felix 
(Tozzini Freire).


Central Bank:
As recommended by Antonio Felix from Tozzini Freire, we need to decide if 
this is a deal/structure we want to continue to pursue. If so we should 
schedule a meeting with the International Operations Director of the Central 
Bank in Brasilia and make a presentation covering the following points:

- The overall structure
- Market need
- Benefits to the companies involved (petrochemical, pulp and paper) - 
Benefits to Brazil ? (if any)

We should approach this not as a single transaction but as a new product, 
with specific characteristics, without any similar in the market, that Enron 
developed in the US and is trying to ""sell"" in Brazil.


Swaps:
A swap in Brazil can be arranged between two local parties and neither one 
needs to be a financial institution. If we want we can have a brokerage house 
or bank in the middle to register the contract with the BM&F (Mercantile 
Exchange).
The other possibility is to have a swap contract between a local and an 
offshore entity, in this case the offshore entity needs to be a financial 
institution.
Is one of the Enron companies in the US considered to be a financial 
institution ?

A specialist form Tozzini should be sending us some paper covering swap 
contracts. I hope to have a better understanding of the requirements for swap 
contracts after we receive that.

Yao Apasu: Andrea mentioned that you were involved with some swap contracts 
in Brazil. If you have anything about that (presentation, regulation) would 
you please forward  to us.



I think that we can structure the prepay mergin a simple loan and 
fix/floating swap, if the swap is something we are allowed to do under the 
Brazilian regulation.

Please add comments,

Andre

All:  Sheila and I have been trying to coordinate the account(s) to receive 
the shares of the above entity.  I can't locate the company on the corporate 
database.  My understanding is that CF First Boston will receive the shares 
and then transfer to our Morgan account (upon our instructions).  

CF First Boston has an Enron Corp. account (pre-1994) and can open a 
subaccount for EIplc.  However, two (2) items are required:
(1)  a letter of beneficiary ownership
(2)  Is EIplc a regulated UK company?  If the answer is no, then it (or the 
company reporting for it) must provide a net  asset valuation

Has someone in London already handled these issues?  If not, can one of you 
supply me with that information?  We have spoken with Andrew Bracken in 
London (0207 888 3196) at andrew.bracken@csfb.com

Thanks for your help.  Sara"

No, but we have considered recently our exposure to brokers where they hold 
our money.  The analysis is more a function of applicable law/regulation (SFA

outside advice or prepare memoranda, but Justin may have done so in the past 
(Justin?).  Please call me or Ed if you'd like to discuss.

Jarrod it seems the reference to Sydney time for a Melborne weather

Subject: Re: Yipes - Syd vs Melbon - HDD swap  

I agree this change could cause problems. During September 2000  daylight 
saving will start early in Sydney during the Olympics. As a result there will 
be a 1 hour time difference between Sydney and Melbourne.  The local time as 
reported by the Bureau of Meteorology is Melbourne time. Hence if there is to 
be a reference to a time zone it should time zone applicable to that 
location. More generally we should put a definition of ""LST ""in documentation 
as meaning the time at the relevant weather station. We could have a 
circumstance of reference weather stations in difference time zones (eg 
basket of cities).

Heidi can you handle?

The confirmation I have received below looks to be the deal we were talking

deal. It appears from the confirmation below that this is now a swap rather

Jarrod looks fine. For completeness I have noted one minor inconsistency in

whole numbers may not be apropriate in all cases. In practical terms it is so

I refer to our recent conversation relating to the progress of ISDA 
negotiations with the above counterparty.

I have just spoken to Carine Lavergne at SITA.  She informs me that SITA does 
not feel adequately equipped or informed to progress the negotiations 
internally and therefore intends to appoint external counsel (I urged her to 
do this as soon as possible).  Despite this intended appointment, she assured 
me that SITA wishes to enter into the ISDA as soon as possible and is keen to 
keep negotiations to a minimum.

Either I or Michael Khajeh-Noori will keep you updated as to the progress.

For your information, I also attach a status report with respect to the 
counterparties with whom Michael and I are currently negotiating.



Let me know if you need anything else.

Subject: Enron Investments plc (""EIplc"") - new brokerage account

All:  Sheila and I have been trying to coordinate the account(s) to receive 
the shares of the above entity.  I can't locate the company on the corporate 
database.  My understanding is that CF First Boston will receive the shares 
and then transfer to our Morgan account (upon our instructions).  

CF First Boston has an Enron Corp. account (pre-1994) and can open a 
subaccount for EIplc.  However, two (2) items are required:
(1)  a letter of beneficiary ownership
(2)  Is EIplc a regulated UK company?  If the answer is no, then it (or the 
company reporting for it) must provide a net  asset valuation

Has someone in London already handled these issues?  If not, can one of you 
supply me with that information?  We have spoken with Andrew Bracken in 
London (0207 888 3196) at andrew.bracken@csfb.com

Thanks for your help.  Sara

Definitely want to upgrade #1 - its on my list of ISDA upgrades as follows:

Done:  TXU, JAron
In Progress:  El Paso, Occidental, Reliant
To Do:  Morgan Stanley, Dynegy, Statoil, Vitol, Valero, Sempra

Can your dept provide a breakdown of type of executed masters? There are (as 
of today) 423 masters - can we break out which ones are old ECT masters?  
That may give us some insight in to any others that need upgrades.  Also, the 
confirm desk should be able to tell us the level of activity (as they did 
before) to determine priority.  Eventually, we would like to get to all of 
these; however, establishing new documents where we have none (Cargill, 
Mieco, Idacorp, PanCanadian) is my first priority.

Rod should be able to address #3.

Thanks,
Tanya

Subject: Various ""Morgan Stanley"" master agreements

As a result of Jeff Nogid's request, here is a recap of the Morgan Stanley 
situation:

(1)  Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.
 This is the entity for commodity trading.
 (i)  ECT has a Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated 6/16/92
 (ii)  ECTRIC has an ISDA dated 3/2/99, but eff. 8/27/97

(2)  Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.
 Jeff Nogid requesting new master for fixed income transactions

(3)  Morgan Stanley International Limited
 This is the entity for equity trading.  Will Nogid or Kinneman ever need 
this one?

Each of these companies has a different lawyer to negotiate the agreement.

Each Morgan Stanley entity might require a separate guaranty.  Anne Clark in 
legal (Cap Services) will let me know.

I will put (2) in place.  Do you want to pursue upgrading (1)(i) or 
addressing (3)?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara

Cargill said that we do not have a line of credit nor do we have money 
sitting in an account with them.
The account is inactive at this time.

Let's review our next step when you have an opportunity.

Hey, Rod:  Clint has trashed Lehman Bros. (for the moment) and is doing the 
deal with MLI.  So, today we confirm the trade on a Deemed ISDA and have 
agreed to sign an ISDA within 20 days.  Would you please prepare a credit 
worksheet and send it down so that we can get started? Please note that we 
agreed to use Enron Corp. as the swap counterparty.

Also, you left the chart for the PATS-2000 deal in my office (you, bum!).  I 
do ask that you let me review this with you so that you can evaluate the 
credit risk.

Thanks.  Sara

Subject: Re: Contacts

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EDIDE's accounts, EDIDE will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

I have attached draft Confirmation of a Collar with Rand Whitney. They want 
to go live with this deal today and send out an executable Confirmation. 
Tanya wants to put a provision in the confirmation that states that the deal 
is subject to Credit approval. If we do not get credit approval Tanya will 
kill the deal. I have left a message with Tanya asking her exactly what she 
wants to say in the Confirmation. Please let me know what you think of the 
Collar the way it is writtne and if we have any language to use for the 
credit provision. I have a meeting at 3:00 an should be back at my desk by 
4:00. 


Thanks,

Gareth:  My comments are generally directed toward the Schedule to the ISDA 
Master Agreement between the Trust and UBS.  Please note that UBS is aware of 
the 12/9/97 master executed between Swiss Bank Corporation and ENA (as it was 
attached to the original fax).  The confirms are pretty straightforward.

(1)  Is the Trust an eligible swap participant?
(2)  The Schedule is missing some ""standard"" Enron type provisions (which 
were in the Swiss Bank master).  These include:
 limitation of liability
 confidentiality
 setoff  
 isn't the Trust an Enron affiliate?  this could impact our approach.
(3)  Enron does not agree to the ISDA standard jurisdiction language (which 
is non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of NY state and the federal court 
in Manhattan; waiver of all objections).  Enron's preference is arbitration.  
With GC consent, we agree to other provisions (e.g., specifice courts, waiver 
of jury trial, so specific court and no waiver of objections, etc.).  In the 
Swiss Bank master, we agreed to NY law, neither party waived any objections 
to venue/forum, and parties could sue anywhere.
(4)  Is this master to be limited to this transaction only?  If the Trust 
intends to use this agreement for future currency, rate, or other 
transactions, we need to consider the impact of caving on our usual terms.  
What eventually happens to the Trust?

Also, Rod Nelson in credit is currently reviewing Enron exposure to UBS.
Call if you need anything else.  Sara"

Hello my Esteemed Doctors,

I am in Rodney Malcolm's Commercial Transaction Group focusing on selling 
energy outsourcing relationships to industrial consumers. 
Based on the list of executed master agreements that was provided to us 
recently, many of our targeted industrial customers have not signed our 
master swap agreement. 

In preparation for our transacting with these customers, would you send me as 
soon as possible a copy of our Master Swap Agreement language, a copy of the 
more intermediate ""Omnibus"" Short form Swap agreement, and a copy of the one 
or two page confirmation agreement.  I will forward to my group so that they 
can become more familiar with the language, and I will also accumulate the 
industrial customers that we are closest to closing deals.  I will then 
forward the names of those customers to you so that we can get these 
documents to the customers in advance of the deals.

If you have any questions or comments, please call me at x35583.  Thank you, 
Tim

Hello Bob and Ed.

What is the most efficient way for us to get Master Swap Agreements in place 
with our industrial consumers.  With the commodity energy market going 
through the roof, many of the industrials are asking us to concentrate on 
solving their short term commodity exposure and look to establish a  greater 
outsourcing opportunity in the future.  We do not seem to have Master Swap 
Agreements in place with industrials such as IMC Global, AK Steel, WR Grace, 
and our solutions will involve financial swaps.


Thank you. Tim

I assume everything went fine with the last financial swap we did with El 
Paso Electric.  I just sold them another swap for 28 Mws in June.  Could we 
follow the same procedure.

Jeff and Larry:  Last year, Mary Gosnell prepared a one page summary which 
was used by legal and credit to target the preparation of ISDA Master 
Agreements.  The summary was divided into two parts:  ""Without Master 
Agreements"" and ""With ECT Master Agreements"" and included the number of 
trades for the first half of the year.  It is our objective once again to put 
new agreements into place and upgrade existing ECT Master Agreements to ISDA 
Master Agreements.  I don't know if EOL trades have impacted the numbers this 
year and I'm not sure whether we need to create a line item for EOL (I'll 
leave that to your discretion).  Please let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.  Sara

P.S.  We were very successful in negotiating masters appearing on Mary's 
list!"

I have just spoken to Carine Lavergne at SITA.  She informs me that SITA does 
not feel adequately equipped or informed to progress the negotiations 
internally and therefore intends to appoint external counsel (I urged her to 
do this as soon as possible).  Despite this intended appointment, she assured 
me that SITA wishes to enter into the ISDA as soon as possible and is keen to 
keep negotiations to a minimum.

Either I or Michael Khajeh-Noori will keep you updated as to the progress.

For your information, I also attach a status report with respect to the

Let me know if you need anything else.

		 Subject: CAPEX

Rod/Sara: last week we met with Capex and everything is advancing very well.
They see the signing of the ISDA as a very simple process, as they have 
several of them signed. But we need to take into account the following:
They want to sign 2 ISDAs, 1 with CAPEX and another one with CAPSA, because 
LPG, Oil and power are traded from the different entities
They have a Fiduciary Assignment Agreement with IFC that we need to look at 
and if necessary add some language in the ISDA

We are sending you the IFC Agreement for your review and comment. It will go 
by courrier cause of it's length. Once you receive it pls. review, and if we 
need to discuss anything with Capex, coordinate with Patrick to arrange a 
conference call.
Patrick will be involved in the process as he needs to fully understand the 
ISDA document due to EOL which is scheduled to  come on later this year.

Sara, we will need an ISDA for CAPSA as well. It will be identical to the 
CAPEX I believe. Rod pls provide your input to Sara on credit for Capsa, 
considering the no threshold issue.

I am a derivatives lawyer with ENA in Houston and obtained your name through 
one of my traders who is transacting with Jay Carr in Houston (please see 
attached message below).  When I spoke with Jay earlier this month, I asked 
him for the name of a lawyer but was advised that all Vitol lawyers were in 
New York and that he would pass my message along to a lawyer.  I am assuming 
that you are the trading lawyer who can assist me with negotiating an ISDA 
Master Agreement between our respective companies.  If not, please let me 
know and feel free to pass this message on to the appropriate attorney.  On 
April 12, 1995, Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp., predecessor in title 
to ENA, and Vitol S.A., Inc. entered into a Master Agreement which is one of 
ENA's early energy price swap agreements.  Since our companies are currently 
trading weather derivatives, I think you would agree that it would be prudent 
to supersede the existing agreement with an ISDA Master Agreement.  This 
relates to my conversation with Jay in that we confirmed our weather deals 
under the existing master but incorporated the 1991 and 1993 ISDA definitions 
into the confirms of our weather trades.  Please let me hear from you.  You 
can reach me via email, phone (713/853-5620) or fax (713/646-3490).

I am a derivatives lawyer with ENA in Houston and obtained your name through
one
of my traders who is transacting with Jay Carr in Houston (please see
attached
message below).  When I spoke with Jay earlier this month, I asked him for
the
name of a lawyer but was advised that all Vitol lawyers were in New York and
that he would pass my message along to a lawyer.  I am assuming that you are
the
trading lawyer who can assist me with negotiating an ISDA Master Agreement
between our respective companies.  If not, please let me know and feel free
to
pass this message on to the appropriate attorney.  On April 12, 1995, Enron
Capital & Trade Resources Corp., predecessor in title to ENA, and Vitol
S.A.,
Inc. entered into a Master Agreement which is one of ENA's early energy
price
swap agreements.  Since our companies are currently trading weather
derivatives,
I think you would agree that it would be prudent to supersede the existing
agreement with an ISDA Master Agreement.  This relates to my conversation
with
Jay in that we confirmed our weather deals under the existing master but
incorporated the 1991 and 1993 ISDA definitions into the confirms of our
weather
trades.  Please let me hear from you.  You can reach me via email, phone
(713/853-5620) or fax (713/646-3490).

Tanya:  Please see Vitol response below.  Do you generate the credit 
worksheet?  How does London credit fit in here?  Another interesting feature 
here is the use of the multibranch provision for a trading company (Vitol 
isn't a bank, or is it?).  I have never seen this utilized in practice for a 
non-bank entity and have resisted the idea for us.  There is very little 
written about the application of the multibranch party and I think that is 
because it has been understood as applying to banks.  However, would this 
master be a ""multibranch master"" for us as well?  Sara

Firstly, thanks for the message. I am indeed the right person for ISDA's in
Vitol. I did meet with your credit people in London ( David Hardy and Lee
Munden) and we did discuss the idea of replacing the existing agreement. I
am at present in our office in Rotterdam, but will be back in Geneva
tomorrow. I therefore do not have the existing agreement with me, but I seem
to remember that it is just signed with Vitol SA Inc, which is the US branch
office of the main trading company in the Vitol Group, Vitol SA, which is a
Swiss company registered in Geneva. I would suggest that you send us a
proposal for an ISDA agreement with Vitol SA, set up as a multibranch
company about to trade out of its Geneva and Houston office, and with Vitol
Holding BV (the ultimate parent company of the group) as the credit support
provider. I would hope that once we have agreed terms for the basic schedule
and credit support annex, we can then easily add other Vitol or Enron
companies as appropriate.

Regards, David

David 

I agree with your proposal but would like to add that in order to determine 
the MAC for Vitol Holding BV, in the absence of a Rating from S& P etc, we 
need to receive details of existing bank covenants which I believe you were 
going to forward to us.

We also need to consider the netting issue between the various entities 
involved in UK Power / Gas / Oil 

Please give me a call if you have any questions

company about to trade out of its Geneva and Houston office, and with Vitol
Holding BV (the ultimate parent company of the group) as the credit support
provider. I would hope that once we have agreed terms for the basic schedule
and credit support annex, we can then easily add other Vitol or Enron
companies as appropriate.

I am a derivatives lawyer with ENA in Houston and obtained your name through
one
of my traders who is transacting with Jay Carr in Houston (please see
attached
message below).  When I spoke with Jay earlier this month, I asked him for
the
name of a lawyer but was advised that all Vitol lawyers were in New York and
that he would pass my message along to a lawyer.  I am assuming that you are
the
trading lawyer who can assist me with negotiating an ISDA Master Agreement
between our respective companies.  If not, please let me know and feel free
to
pass this message on to the appropriate attorney.  On April 12, 1995, Enron
Capital & Trade Resources Corp., predecessor in title to ENA, and Vitol
S.A.,
Inc. entered into a Master Agreement which is one of ENA's early energy
price
swap agreements.  Since our companies are currently trading weather
derivatives,
I think you would agree that it would be prudent to supersede the existing
agreement with an ISDA Master Agreement.  This relates to my conversation
with
Jay in that we confirmed our weather deals under the existing master but
incorporated the 1991 and 1993 ISDA definitions into the confirms of our
weather
trades.  Please let me hear from you.  You can reach me via email, phone
(713/853-5620) or fax (713/646-3490).

Jay:  I am a lawyer with Enron.  I called for you on Friday, you're out, and
no
one else could help.  I would like to speak with a Vitol lawyer about (1)
replacing our existing financial master with an ISDA (to accommodate a
broader
range of products) and (2) specifically incorporating the relevant ISDA
definitions into the recent weather transaction confirmations even though
the
master is an early master energy price swap agreement.  Please call me at
713
853-5620 with the information so that we can move quickly.  Thank you for
your
help.  Sara

Dear Ms. Shackleton:

Thank you for your recent order placed at
www.bravo.com.  Bravo 20 has recently merged with OFFI
& Company.  During this transitional period, our time
between order receipt and shipping is longer than
usual, as we are in the midst of manufacturing and
re-stocking.

Due to this delay, the approximate shipping date for
your order is 7/25/00, although we hope the actual
ship date will be earlier.  Please do not hesitate to
contact us at 800-383-OFFI(6334) or offiweb@yahoo.com
if you have any questions or if we can be of further
assistance.

Thank you,
OFFI & Company

Corp. address book?  Tanya and Rod can be accessed through the ECT 
directory!  I spoke with David Mitchell this morning.  He will prepare a 
short memo summarizing our recent discussion (NYMEX), probably by the end of 
this week or early next week.  Then we can decide whether additional 
conversations are necessary and how to proceed in general.  Also, please send 
credit worksheets to BOTH Susan Bailey and Susan Flynn.  They divide up the 
booty.  We have a new paralegal starting on Monday named Samantha Boyd.  She 
will eventually be thrown into the fray.  We'll be sending a new message to 
everyone in credit soon.  Thanks for your help.  Sara

Ted:  ENA, formerly Enron Gas Marketing, Inc., opened a futures account with 
Cargill in 1993.  I am advised that there has not been any activity with 
Cargill for many months.  It appears that we had subaccounts for trading 
crude, nat gas, unleaded gas.  We do not have any margin residing with 
Cargill. 

Given our recent discussions regarding inactive equity accounts, I was 
wondering if you had given any thought to inactive futures accounts.  

As of 5/23/00, I see only 13 active futures accounts.  The following accounts 
appear to be dormant:

(1) Bank One - I am currently negotiating to open up a margin line
(2)  Cargill
(3)  Daiwa Securities America
(4)  Gerald Inc. (may have merged or business moved to another firm)
(5)  Merrill Lynch Futures
(6)  Paine Webber
(7)  OM Stockholm (paper)
(8)  Spear, Leeds & Kellogg

Please let me know what action you would like to take, if any, or discuss in 
general.  Thanks.  Sara "

Sara: 

Would you mind to handle this one?  It appears that ETOL is the entity 
involved in the Watershed deal you worked on back in December.

I have been sent a copy of a proposed  ECT-ETOL ISDA Schedule and it is very 
specialized and unlike (despite what Mark Evans wrote) the Riverside 6 
transaction I am working on.   Maybe it is the Schedule used in the Watershed 
deal?? Anyway, I will bring it to you. 

Many thanks,

Subject: Re: ETOL ISDA


Shari,

this has been sent to you because of the similarities with the Teesside 
Riverside 6 swap which you are dealing with. Perhaps you or Mark could let us 
know whether you or someone else will be taking this forward.

The deal is that Enron is providing swap support to the deal which is an 
Enron structured financing to get ETOL off balance sheet. ETOL (Enron 
Teesside Operations Limited) owns the power station at Wilton which we bought 
from ICI at the end of December 1998.

The main factor to bear in mind is that (as in Riverside 6) the swap has to 
be seen in the context of the deal  as a whole and thus there may be 
non-standard provisions in the documentation  which  are deal specific and 
which Enron has to accept in the context of the deal.

Let's speak about this as soon as we know that you will be the person to take 
this forward.

Thanks


     Mark

ETOL is Enron Teesside Operations Holdings Limited, a company we bought in 
December last year.   We are currently arranging the sale of subordinated 
debt and equity in this company to a group of US institutional investors.   
Since the underlying cash flows are sterling but the investors want US$, we 
have entered into a currency swap with Trena and Harry.   The ISDA that 
Jurgen has sent to you has been drafted by Milbank Tweed, counsel to the 
Investors.  Mark Evans is the Enron legal person on the transaction, and our 
outside counsel are Slaughter & May.

The underlying transaction is, I believe, similar to the Teesside deal, in 
that it is subordinated to the investors investment.   The underlying swap is 
for 10 years, but in certain circumstances, largely relating to default by 
ETOL, the swap might be accelerated.

My understanding from Slaughters is that the ISDA is standard for the first 
10 pages and thereafter is specific to the current transaction.

I would suggest that if you feed your comments back via either Mark or 
myself.  My number is +44 171 970 7438.

If you have any further questions, please call.

Regards, Robina

(Houston) Legal? ECTRI (London) Legal? Who am I supposed to neogiate with at 
ETOL? 
What are the underlying transactions that this document governs?

I am the attorney working on the Teesside ISDA and it does not resemble this. 

Any information you can give would be appreciated.

It seems you have recieved already similair agreements from us. Robina

Please give either Robina or me a call if you have questions.Thanks

P.S.: I talked to Gunnar from SEB lately about the ISDA and they really seem 
to be very slow in their legal department. Thanks for your up-dates.

As discussed, ECC hopes to transact with ATCO over the next week or so if we 
can agree on pricing.  This is the form of agreement they propose.  It 
represents 
the way their 3-way JV owned plant will sell power offtake to marketers such 
as Enron.  I would be interested in your opinion especially if we are close 
to

Further to our telephone discussion today with Jason Peters who I couldn't 
find on email. I did some checking around. The clause (which incidently 
normally has a paragraph (d))seems  to be only found in the CBA Agreements. 
Its purpose is a little uncertain. If the Broker was holding a Client's money 
then by law he must account for it. 

The reason why there ARN Ambro may be reluctant to accept the clause is 
because the instances it addresses would probably fall within the definition 
of an ""undesirable market event"" under the SFE rules. This would trigger 
action by the Board of SFE to sort out the mess. It may uncertain as to how 
these contractual would fit in     "

Subject: Re: Contacts

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EDIDE's accounts, EDIDE will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

Sheila, finally ready to open up the account at Morgan Stanley for EDIDE so 
that EPCA can transfer the correct amount of ADRs.  I have the Corporate 
Resolution from EDIDE.  I understand that the contact at Morgan Stanley has 
changed.  Please advise.

Team,

I have had a few conversations over the past couple of days with Terry 
Brownrigg at Twister Gas Services, LLC and Todd Tharp with Sanguine, Ltd..  
We transacted with Twister last week and I had sent you a credit worksheet 
for the transaction.  Twister is a broker who transacts on behalf of small 
E&P companies, and in this case, the E&P agreed to post the L/C we quoted for 
the transaction.  After talking to Sara, it sounds like we are going to go 
ahead and send a confirmation to Twister for the deal and attach to the 
confirmation an assignment of the deal from Twister to Sanguine.  It is my 
understanding that both Terry and Todd will need to sign both the 
confirmation and the assignment, so I think we will need to carefully 
coordinate the steps through the Confirmation Desk (Sheetal Patel).

I have attached a worksheet for the transaction (Sanguine agreed to post 
$500K).  Please coordinate with Sara, Sheetal and me in getting this out.

The contact information at Sanguine is:
Todd Tharp
Manager of Gas Contracts
Sanguine, Ltd.
1861 East 71st Street South
Tulsa, Ok 74136

Thanks,

John

This evening, ECT faxed comments to counterparty's proposed ISDA to both John 
Joel and Douglas Marshall.  We also resent the Credit Support Annex because 
counterparty never commented on ours and failed to include one.  John Joel 
called me this morning to determine when the lawyers could speak.  I told him 
to schedule a conference call because ECT was ready and was faxing comments 
today.  I haven't heard from him.  SS "

In the interest of time, I have revised our draft ISDA Schedule to conform in 
most material respects to the 1994 (effective 1992) agreement executed 
between ERMS and Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. (""Old ISDA"").  This was 
done to accommadate the Merrill lawyer, Gary Rosenblum (who didn't want to 
read our Schedule!).  The Old ISDA is not identical to the format used by 
Merrill Lynch International today so I'm not sure how hard they will press 
for other changes.  There are two potential credit issues that I see:  (1)  
agreement as to the Enron Corp. guaranty cap (and possible Merrill Lynch 
guaranty cap) and (2) our introduction of a MAC provision in the form of an 
Additional Event of Default (necessary because the Old ISDA had a Credit 
Support Annex and this one does not).  I left a voice mail for Gary Rosenblum 
and asked that he let me know when he was available on Monday to talk AND to 
have his credit person contact Rod Nelson.  Sara

P.S.  I haven't heard from Morgan Guaranty Trust Company or Morgan Stanley 
Capital Services, Inc."

 use of confirms with negative language

(3)  Hiring a clerk to assist paralegals to run errands

(4)  Policy regarding INDIVIDUALS as eligible swap participants

(5)  Method for shortening weather confirms

(6)  Mary and Brent - possible work assignments"

Carol St Clair has confirmed for me that the GTC does not contemplate a 
'Correction for Prices'. John Suarez states that corrected prices must be 
'flagged' by the ISO with 75 minutes of publication and must be changed 
within 5 days. Since the GTC doesn't contemplate the issue and the mechanism 
is different from ISDA,  I have added some suggested language to the Index, 
as we should contemplate this issue in the Long Description.

Subject: US East Power Financial Swaps

The East Power traders would like to commence transacting on financial swaps. 
We had anticipated this, so the Product Type was already built and has been 
approved. The Index and Loadshape built with this Product were done so based 
on comments from John Suarez (the trader), who has approved the attached.

Leslie - please offer commets/suggestions from the power perspective.

Mark - final approval will need to come from you since this is a financial 
product.

Also, trading wants us to consider price changes for the Product because the 
prices published do change from time to time. I know that the ISDA 
Definitions contemplate a 30-day true-up, but I can't find a like provision 
in the GTC. So - I took a hack at some language to contemplate the issue:

""If the price published (as set forth herein) on any day during a 
Determination Period is subsequently corrected and the correction is 
announced within 30 calendar days of the original publication date, the 
parties agree that the corrected price shall take affect as if it were the 
price published on the original publication date and the Floating Price will 
be adjusted accordingly. Payments of the adjusted Floating Amount will take 
place 5 business days following notification by either party of a change to a 
published price.""

We had anticipated this, so the Product Type was already built and has been 
approved. The Index and Loadshape built with this Product were done so based 
on comments from John Suarez (the trader), who has approved the attached.

Leslie - please offer commets/suggestions from the power perspective.

Mark - final approval will need to come from you since this is a financial 
product.

Also, trading wants us to consider price changes for the Product because the 
prices published do change from time to time. I know that the ISDA 
Definitions contemplate a 30-day true-up, but I can't find a like provision 
in the GTC. So - I took a hack at some language to contemplate the issue:

""If the price published (as set forth herein) on any day during a 
Determination Period is subsequently corrected and the correction is 
announced within 30 calendar days of the original publication date, the 
parties agree that the corrected price shall take affect as if it were the 
price published on the original publication date and the Floating Price will 
be adjusted accordingly. Payments of the adjusted Floating Amount will take 
place 5 business days following notification by either party of a change to a 
published price.""

Brent, Andrea and I had a ""status"" conversation this afternoon.  Brent will 
go to Sao Paulo on July 20 to meet with Andrea, Randy and commercial people.  
Andrea has requested that you and I go to Brazil after July 28 when the 
outside lawyer is back from vacation.  In general, the three of us are 
conforming and updating physical resolutions (final and proposed) and 
identifying additional research necessary to address the financial trading 
issues.  These are related to specific deals originating in Brazil (which are 
truly settled financially, e.g., a purported prepay where no physical 
commodity was to be delivered) and issues arising here in Houston (e.g., the 
Hickerson request for fixed income, FX and equity trading).  Brent will be 
discussing pending transaction structures while in Sao Paulo. 

It appears  that Brent is the ""point person"" for dealing directly with the 
Sao Paulo office and he will bring me in as necessary (although I will be 
dealing frequently with Andrea).

We would like to begin to establish ISDA agreements with the following 
entities:

Anglo American plc (www.angloamerican.co.uk) based in London and

Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited.

The annual financial statement  of Anglo American plc can be taken from the 
website above. I have asked the folks at Anglo American in Johannesburg, 
South Africa for the financials for the Anglo American Corporation.

Can you take a look at this for me please?

Thanks

How are we coming with the ISDA agreement for MP with parental guarantee from 
Heritage?

Also, does MP need to invoice ENA for May SWAP transactions or do you issue a 
credit invoice and wire
transfer payment to MP? (Deal #s NA 1279.1 and 1279.2).

Would you mind to handle this one?  It appears that ETOL is the entity 
involved in the Watershed deal you worked on back in December.

I have been sent a copy of a proposed  ECT-ETOL ISDA Schedule and it is very 
specialized and unlike (despite what Mark Evans wrote) the Riverside 6 
transaction I am working on.   Maybe it is the Schedule used in the Watershed 
deal?? Anyway, I will bring it to you.

Subject: Re: ETOL ISDA


Shari,

this has been sent to you because of the similarities with the Teesside 
Riverside 6 swap which you are dealing with. Perhaps you or Mark could let us 
know whether you or someone else will be taking this forward.

The deal is that Enron is providing swap support to the deal which is an 
Enron structured financing to get ETOL off balance sheet. ETOL (Enron 
Teesside Operations Limited) owns the power station at Wilton which we bought 
from ICI at the end of December 1998.

The main factor to bear in mind is that (as in Riverside 6) the swap has to 
be seen in the context of the deal  as a whole and thus there may be 
non-standard provisions in the documentation  which  are deal specific and 
which Enron has to accept in the context of the deal.

Let's speak about this as soon as we know that you will be the person to take 
this forward.

Thanks


     Mark

Shari

ETOL is Enron Teesside Operations Holdings Limited, a company we bought in 
December last year.   We are currently arranging the sale of subordinated 
debt and equity in this company to a group of US institutional investors.   
Since the underlying cash flows are sterling but the investors want US$, we 
have entered into a currency swap with Trena and Harry.   The ISDA that 
Jurgen has sent to you has been drafted by Milbank Tweed, counsel to the 
Investors.  Mark Evans is the Enron legal person on the transaction, and our 
outside counsel are Slaughter & May.

The underlying transaction is, I believe, similar to the Teesside deal, in 
that it is subordinated to the investors investment.   The underlying swap is 
for 10 years, but in certain circumstances, largely relating to default by 
ETOL, the swap might be accelerated.

My understanding from Slaughters is that the ISDA is standard for the first 
10 pages and thereafter is specific to the current transaction.

I would suggest that if you feed your comments back via either Mark or 
myself.  My number is +44 171 970 7438.

If you have any further questions, please call.

hello Sara,

I think this should be a high priority once they take on an ISDA attorney.  
Per your recommendation, I contacted Randy Curry, President of Bridgeline and 
passed along your thoughts about Jason.  I gave him your phone number and he 
sounded enthusiastic about wanting to talk with him.  God knows they need an 
attorney.

Right now, I think we can take this off the priority list.

Thanks

Dear Ms. Shackleton,

I refer to your fax dated 6th March, 2000.

The seller whether it is an Indian company or a foreign company is not
required to be registered with the BSE for the purpose of selling publicly
traded shares held by it of an Indian Company.  Only brokers and other
intermediaries such as merchant bankers etc. are required to be registered
with SEBI or BSE.

Please note that Vinay Dwarkadas is no longer working with us.

morning (6/2) since we didn't know who would handle.  I remember, now, I 
checked the log in book while Susan was at lunch and it wasn't there so when 
I asked her about it, she told me she was holding a prior confirm for Twister 
( apparently inactive until further notice) and she was now going to handle 
this one.   I reminded her that I was leaving early to fly to NO so that I'd 
have enough time to review. The rest is history.  Sara

Team,

I have had a few conversations over the past couple of days with Terry 
Brownrigg at Twister Gas Services, LLC and Todd Tharp with Sanguine, Ltd..  
We transacted with Twister last week and I had sent you a credit worksheet 
for the transaction.  Twister is a broker who transacts on behalf of small 
E&P companies, and in this case, the E&P agreed to post the L/C we quoted for 
the transaction.  After talking to Sara, it sounds like we are going to go 
ahead and send a confirmation to Twister for the deal and attach to the 
confirmation an assignment of the deal from Twister to Sanguine.  It is my 
understanding that both Terry and Todd will need to sign both the 
confirmation and the assignment, so I think we will need to carefully 
coordinate the steps through the Confirmation Desk (Sheetal Patel).

I have attached a worksheet for the transaction (Sanguine agreed to post 
$500K).  Please coordinate with Sara, Sheetal and me in getting this out.

The contact information at Sanguine is:
Todd Tharp
Manager of Gas Contracts
Sanguine, Ltd.
1861 East 71st Street South
Tulsa, Ok 74136

Thanks,

John

Hi Sara,

Gareth and I were going over the documents this morning and was wondering if
you have any comments on the revised Swaps (the three currency swaps and the
two option swaps).  Could you fax me your comments?

Could you also forward to me the Master Agreement btw UBS and Enron and
Enron's std language with respect to set offs, jurisdiction etc.. (as per
your e-mail two weeks ago).  Thanks.

Last week I had sent you a final version of the memorandum regarding pulp and
paper transactions (with attachment).  However, this morning I had an
computer-generated error message regarding that transmission.  I am sending 
you
the files again just in case you didn't receive them or couldn't open them.

If you would like a hard copy, please e-mail me back and I will send you a

Thanks.

Hi Sara,

I met with accounting regarding these amounts. I will be forwarding a copy to 
you.

We have a total of .77 cents remaining in our account with Cargill.

Since we have several acounts in addition to Crude Oil, it is my 
recommendation that
we do not cancel the account as traders may want to utilize Cargill for other 
commodities.

Regards,

Sara,

I have drafted the attached based on what we did for the GDR acquisition.  
Could you check the non-India trading names and titles to make sure they are 
current.  I checked with Samantha but she said she was having computer 
problems and wasn't familiar with the names.  And, obviously, we will not 
have this done by Monday morning.  Is there anything we can do to get the 
account opened on an expedited basis and then follow up with paperwork later?



Lena,

Once Sara checks the non-India names, may I have your permission to put your 
initials on these documents and get them signed?

Thanks,
Lauren

Hi David & Sheila,

As you will see from the DASH that Rajesh Agarwal is separately faxing to 
you, Rediff.com India Limited is issuing American Depository Shares (ADSs)

As discussed, we would like to bid for $ 4 mn equivalent at the clearing 
price, subject to a maximum price of $12 per ADS. This works out to approx. 
333,333 shares - however if the clearing price is lower, then we would get a 
higher number of shares.

We would appreciate it if you could put in a word to your contact at Goldman 
to let them know that the order is coming in.

Our contact in Goldman Sachs, Hong Kong is Vijay Karnani: +852 2978 1685 (W), 
+852 9188 3719 (M), vijay.karnani@gs.com

Our contact information is :

Hagerty/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 

Subject: Genesys : Sale of Shares : RBI approvall

Dear Rahul,

Your mail on the above subject refers.

As regards to the approvals to be followed in sale of the Genesys shares by 
Enron Distribution Ventures MHC Ltd., Mauritius, i list below the following:

(A) Approvals required:
Per section 10 B (1) the FEMA Regulations effective 1 June 2000, transfer by 
way of sale by a person resident outside India of the shares / debentures 
held by him to person resident in India will require prior permission of RBI. 
Veena, your activity chart shows that Form TS 1 is to be filed after the sale 
is effected, money received and at the time of remittance of sale proceeds. 
Since, the Act prescribes prior approval, we should sell only after receipt 
of RBI approval and not before.
The requisite form to be filed for seeking approval is Form TS1. 
If we are effecting the sale through a private arrangement , the application 
should be supported with the average quotation of the share price ( average 
of daily high and low) for one week proceeding the date of application, duly 
certified by a Chartered Accountant. If the sale proposed to be effected on 
the floor of the exchange to the general public at the prevailing market 
price, the Chartered Accountant's certification is not required. Since, we 
intend selling at the floor, this certification is not required.

(B) Thinly Traded:
I refer to Veena's query on whether Genesys shares are thinly traded. Per 
section 10 - Explanation i) the share will be treated as thinly traded if the 
annualised trading turnover in that share, on a main stock exchanges in 
India, during the six  calendar months preceding the month in which the 
application is made, is less than 2%( by number of shares) of the listed 
stock.
Though we can take a view that Genesys shares are listed for trading only 
from 5 June 2000, it is to be noted that the new shares issued to (a) the 
erstwhile Genesys shareholders are issued as a result of the scheme of 
amalgamation approved by the High Court, Mumbai & (b)  the applicants of the 
private placement ( incl. Enron) and the new amalgamated company, Genesys 
International Corporation Limited, whose previous name was Aeke Trading and 
Investments Limited, was a listed Company at the Mumbai Stock Exchange. 
Hence, it is advisable to check whether the shares of AEKE were thinly traded 
or not. FYI, the Paid - Up Equity of AEKE prior to the Amalgamation was 
2,40,000 Equity Shares of Rs. 10/- each aggregating Rs. 24,00,000/-. We can 
apply the test as explained above on the AEKE shares prior to Genesys 
amalgamation just to satisfy ourselves that it was not thinly traded.
It is better to check this provision. 

(C) Formalities for remittance:
Per section 11of the FEMA Regulations, remittance of sale proceeds shall be 
made by a authorised dealer upon:
satisfying himself that the security was held by the seller on repatriation 
basis ( we need to submit the Foreign Collaboration Approval Letter No. 3/9 
SIA/NFC 99 NRI to the AD)
submission of the contract note of the Broker effecting the sale and 
submission of a No Objection Certificate/ tax clearance certificate.

(D) Income Tax - NoC / TCC:
I understand from Veena that there is a current thinking that through a 
Chartered Accountants Certificate stating the double taxation treaty, we need 
not obtain the NoC of the IT. In my view, since the regulation stipulates an 
NoC / TCC from the IT Department, i doubt whether it is doable without a BoC 
/ TCC of the IT. 
In the past, this was followed and with an Undertaking from the Company, 
supported with a Chartered Accountants Certificate,confirming there are no 
tax implications in the underlying transaction, one could remit the funds 
without a NoC/TCC from IT. But, given a very specific statement u/s 11 of the 
FEMA Regulations and the same being introduced only from 1 June and hasn't 
been time tested, i doubt whether the Authorised Dealer will accept our view 
and effect fund transfer with an Undertaking and CA Certification. 
In my view, NoC would be a pre requisite. 

(E) Bank Account:
Assuming that the NoC is required, there will be a timing difference between 
we receive the sale proceeds and remitting the money to Mauritius after 
obtaining the NoC from IT. It is certainly not advisable to hold the 
instrument without encashing it. Hence, opening of a Bank Account in India to 
encash the instrument  is warranted. I refer to Mike's mail on allowing the 
Broker to hold the funds in a trust account for EDVMHC. In my view, instead 
of the Broker holding the same, the AD himself can hold it on trust for 
EDVMHC. But this needs to checked and properly documented with the Bank ( 
Authorised Dealer) and as well at EDVMHC. From Due Diligence and Compliance 
point of view, i would suggest to take the route of opening of an rupee Bank 
Account than the trust route. 
Since it is not a demated shares, opening of an custodial account is not 
required. This needs to be checked with the authorised dealer.

(F) Application to RBI / TS 1:
I suggest that while making the RBI Application under TS 1, it is advisable 
to state and seek their concurrence or keep them informed as to point E 
above. We could mention in our application to RBI and seek approval as to (a) 
opening of an rupee account or (b) authorising the AD to hold the same in an 
trust account for EDVMHC. RBI while according its approval, will look in to 
the transaction and accord approval for this as well. 
May be, before filing the application with RBI, we could meet with the 
concerned official in Exchange Control Department and walk him through with 
the transaction so that the approval is obtained at the earliest.

(G) Original Funds:
I understand that while making this investment, the funds have not come in 
from EDVMHC, Mauritius or it has come from a Company from Caymon Islands. Tax 
need to confirm whether the money received from Cayco ( though on behalf of 
an Mauritius Company) would qualify for tax benefits.  

(H) Confirmation by Genesys on non Lock-in:
There are no documents available like the Board Resolution while alloting the 
Shares to EDVMHC or the application to Stock Exchange which would specify 
distinctive numbers of the Lock-in Shares nor it is stated in the Information 
Memorandum as whether shares offered under this IM are freely tradable. 
Though the SEBI Guidelines are clear that if the shares do not form part of 
the Promoters Quoto, they are freely tradable, it is advised that we take a 
certificate from Genesys on this. I have spoken this with Rajesh who 
confirmed that such a certificate from Genesys can be otained without any 
difficulty.

Please feel free and do call me for any further assistance from my end.

Subject: Genesys : Sale of Shares : RBI approval

Seems to me from a read of the regulations that we are required 

Clause 10 B (1) to get RBI approval for the transfer on a TS1 form. Please 
note that the TS1 form requires a CA certificate
If we sell on an exchange through a broker, clause 10 B (2) (a) (i) will 
apply. Since the transfer takes place when its recorded on the register held 
by the company, there is time from when the sale order is given to the 
broker. 
Clause 11 (2) provides the conditions by which the AD will repatriate the 
money to Mauritius. Please note the requirement for an IT clearance in clause 
11 (2) (c). Also, it seems from Clause 11 (2) (b) that if we sell through the 
exchange, then approval of RBI under the TS1 is not required for the 
repatriation.

Rahul

I spoke with Eugenie Sibeud at Goldman Sachs who is a local market expert.  
She spoke with someone from Hong Kong.

Per Eugenie, We probably do not need an FII (which takes the 9 months to 
obtain) but we will probably need a FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) Form to 
sell the shares.  This form needs to be approved by RBI (Royal Bank of India) 
taking approximately 3 weeks and is good for a specified period of time (e.g. 
3 months). 

She said that we may be able to complete the sale by opening a cash account 
with Standard Charter Bank (GSs agent) or a special purpose account which 
would stay open only for a month.
Eugenie is going to get back to me and forward to me the specifics which I 
have tried to summarize above.
Thanks. Sheila.

Jen:  This is a good question and I think that the PG&E lawyer may be 
confused here with instructions to her traders.  
The PG&E trader can call either an ECC or ENA trader BUT a transaction will 
ALWAYS be booked and confirmed in the name of ENA under the executed ENA ISDA 
Master Agreement with PG&E.  For internal purposes, the trade will either 
remain on an ENA book or backed to an ECC book.  I hope this answers your 
question.  Sara

Sara;
One last thing is remaining.
Does PG&E have to have an ISDA with ECT Canada in order to trade with them? 
Can't Canada trades be covered under our ISDA. PG&E told me that in order to 
trade with Canada, they would have to trade through us. Can't they just call 
canada direct and then we can confirm the trade under our ISDA? 

Please call me to discuss.

Sara,

I have drafted the attached based on what we did for the GDR acquisition.  
Could you check the non-India trading names and titles to make sure they are 
current.  I checked with Samantha but she said she was having computer 
problems and wasn't familiar with the names.  And, obviously, we will not 
have this done by Monday morning.  Is there anything we can do to get the 
account opened on an expedited basis and then follow up with paperwork later?



Lena,

Once Sara checks the non-India names, may I have your permission to put your 
initials on these documents and get them signed?

Thanks,
Lauren

David:

Thank you for the email.  I left a message for you to call (let me know 
what's convenient and I'll make myself available) because we were trying to 
make the language generic enough to include all future products which might 
fall into this category.  We considered the following:

Alternative 1:  ""For purposes of any Transaction in a Commodity for which 
there is either no market or for which the market is illiquid, Party B 
recognizes that (i) this market is less liquid than other OTC derivatives 
markets; . . .""   

Alternative 2:  ""For purposes of any Transaction in which the relevant 
Commodity is traded in a market that is newer or less liquid than other OTC 
derivatives markets, Party B recognizes that (i) such market is newer or less 
liquid than other OTC derivatives markets; . . . ""

We also considered adding some type of statement that specifies newer 
products without limiting future applicability (i.e.. ""including but not 
limited to paper and pulp"").  Also, ""newer market"" may not mean illiquid.  
""No market"" could mean that we are the only market maker.

Your language places the onus on us to continually identify these illiquid 
products either in the Schedule, by amendment to the Schedule or in a 
separate writing.
Can we please discuss?  I am free all afternoon.  Thanks.  Sara"

Hi Sara,

I met with accounting regarding these amounts. I will be forwarding a copy to

We have a total of .77 cents remaining in our account with Cargill.

Since we have several acounts in addition to Crude Oil, it is my 
recommendation that
we do not cancel the account as traders may want to utilize Cargill for other 
commodities.

I am still handling financial derivatives matters in general for Mexico.

This provision is an election which we have added to the Schedule for 
governmental entities.  I believe that it is intended to eliminate any 
confusion that historically arose during the debate between ""First Method"" 
(one-way payments) and ""Second Method"" (two-way payments) for Early 
Termination purposes.  Although I can't find a good reason to continue to use 
this provision with an ISDA (except that it emphasizes the point), I can 
understand why we may have added it to a pre-ISDA agreement with a 
governmental.  The only example that I could locate was our September 21, 
1995 Master Agreement with Reedy Creek Improvement District.  For those of 
you who have never seen this form, it was one of the two types of master 
agreements developed by ECT before we became conversant with ISDA.  Because 
these forms didn't contemplate municipal counterparties, we had to add many 
of the ISDA U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule provisions.  The Part 
5(b)(k) provision originally appeared in this early agreement.  It was 
included in the ""Event of Change"" section [5F(4)] (which is tantamount to the 
ISDA concept of ""Illegality"", a ""Termination Event"").  I think it was 
probably included because in the ISDA, Second Method is the automatic payment 
method if the parties fail to make a specific designation for Early 
Termination purposes, but there isn't a comparable provision in the old ECT 
form.

We still have outstanding issues under French law.  Netting Transactions may 
not be possible (i.e., may not be enforceable)  with any of the French 
counterparties even if you have an ISDA in place.  If netting is not a 
concern, then we can have separate and unrelated transactions.  Are you going 
to push an ISDA for SITA?   Let's discuss.  Michael will have to encourage 
his counterparties to respond to our French counsel; SITA never did.  Sara

Hi Shari,

I'm sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you.  I had to get a few
people involved and it took a lot longer than I anticipated.  However, I
have things organized now and have summarized my comments below.  In
addition, we reviewed your form of guarantee.  I have attached a mark up of
your guarantee to conform with our form of guarantee and where possible
amended our form of guarantee to conform with yours.  (I believe there were
some conversations between my trader and your credit officer about
increasing the amount under your guarantee to $35,000,000.)

I think it would be helpful if we used my comments below and the blackline
of the guarantees as an agenda for a call to finalize the Agreement.  Please
let me know when you would be available.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Suanne

Part 1(b) Threshold Amount:  I know we agreed in concept to have the
Threshold Amount apply collectively to each party and their Credit Support
Provider, but I'm not sure we get there with your amendment.  May I suggest
the following:

  Threshold Amount means, with respect to Party A and its
Credit Support Provider, collectively, U.S. $100,000,000; and with respect
to Party B and its Credit Support Provider, collectively, U.S. $100,000,000.

Part 1(g) Credit Event Upon Merger:  Thank you for adding the last sentence,
however, may I suggest clarifying it further as follows:

  If such additional Eligible Credit Support is not provided,
or if additional Eligible Credit Support is deemed inadequate by Y in its
sole discretion, then the provisions of Section 5(b)(iv) shall apply without
amendment.

Part 2(b) Payee Representations:  I am still waiting for a response from my
tax department.

Part 3(a) Agreement to Deliver Documents:  (a) The W-8 ECI is not in effect
until next year, so we will only be able to deliver a W-8.  In addition, we
believe the delivery requirements are a little onerous and we would prefer
to deliver the forms upon execution and thereafter upon request.  ECT's
delivery requirements should be substantially similar.  (c) We will provide
you with a copy of DLJIC's Memorandum of Association.  We would also like to
receive similar documentation from ECT evidencing its authority to execute
the Agreement.

Part 4(c) Calculation Agent.  Below please find sample language:

  Calculation Agent.  The Calculation Agent will be Party A
and Party B jointly or, in the event of a dispute, a reputable, unaffiliated
financial institution appointed by the parties.  Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default or Termination Event with respect to a party, the Non-defaulting
Party or the non-Affected Party, as the case may be, or, in the
circumstances where there are two Affected Parties, as agreed between the
parties, shall be the sole Calculation Agent.

Part 4(i) Jurisdiction.  We can agree to this clause provided that you agree
to conduct proceedings in New York City.

Part 5(g) Setoff.  We can agree to your setoff clause with the following
amendments:

  in line 2, insert ""sole"" prior to ""non-Affected Party""

  in line 3 and 5, please insert ""(whether at such time or in
the future or upon the occurrence of a contingency)"" following ""amounts
owed"" in each line

Part 5(r) Consent to Recording.  Please add the following clause as
requested:

  (c) Consent to Recording. The parties agree that each
may electronically record all telephone conversations between them and that
any such recordings may be submitted in evidence to any court or in any
proceeding for the purpose of establishing any matters pertinent to any
Transaction, provided, however, that notwithstanding the terms of this
clause, the parties do not waive any rights they may have under the
applicable rules of evidence.

CSA (b)(ii) Eligible Collateral.  I believe we discussed adding Treasuries
with maturities greater than one year.  We propose Treasuries under one year
with a Valuation Percentage of 99%, 1-5 years at 97% and 5-10 years at 95%.

CSA (b)(iv)(B) Thresholds.  Please remove ""Potential Event of Default""

CSA (d) Conditions Precedent.  We asked that Tax Event and Tax Event Upon
Merger be excluded as Specified Conditions.  There is no reason to stop
collateralizing a Transaction upon the occurrence of these events, because
if at the end of the remedy period the Transaction is terminated, then the
posted collateral will be returned, if applicable, according to the normal
procedures of the CSA.  If the Transaction is terminated and the settlement
amount is not paid, then the non-Affected Party has the right to liquidate
the Collateral to satisfy its claim and you would want all Transactions,
including the affected transaction, to be fully collateralized at that time.

CSA (f) Dispute Resolution.  (i) We can agree to two Local Business Days to
resolve a dispute.  (ii) We suggested that the parties look to market
standard screens before polling dealers to determine Value.  This is our
standard definition of Value:

  Value. For the purpose of Paragraph 5(i)(C) and 5(ii), the
Value of Posted Collateral other than Cash will be equal to the sum of (i)
the face value of the Posted Collateral multiplied by the product of (A)
either (x) the closing bid price as quoted by Bloomberg Financial Markets or
Dow Jones Telerate Services as of Resolution Time or (y) the sum of the
arithmetic mean of the closing bid prices quoted by three mutually-agreed
upon Reference Market-Makers for the relevant security on the relevant date
and (B) the applicable Valuation Percentage plus (ii) the accrued interest
on such security (except to the extent Transferred to a party pursuant to
any applicable provisions of this Agreement or included in the applicable
price referred to in (i) of this clause) as of such date.

(iii) We can agree to transfer only the undisputed amount.

CSA (g) Holding and Using Posted Collateral.  I have several thoughts on
this section.  The Credit Rating for a party should include both S&P and
Moody's and a party's ability to hold Posted Collateral should be based on
the lower of those two.  However, if the Posted Collateral is a letter of
credit, then a party should be entitled to hold the letter of credit
regardless of their Credit Rating.  Under the terms of (g)(i), the party and
it's Custodian are individually entitled to hold Posted Collateral.
However, there are no requirements for a Custodian.  I believe the
requirement of a Qualified Institution should apply to the Custodian.  If
there is a ratings requirement for the party in order for it to hold Posted
Collateral and the party is no longer in compliance with that ratings
requirement, then in order to comply with the general terms of the CSA, the
party would have to transfer the Posted Collateral to a Custodian which met
the requirements of a Custodian or else it would be in breach of the
agreement (which would be an Event of Default if not remedied within 30
days).  Therefore, if you apply the requirements of a Qualified Institution
to a Custodian under (g)(i), then (g)(ii)(2) and (3) can be removed.
Finally, we would like the requirements of the Custodian to be a rating of
at least A/A2 and having total assets of at least US $10,000,000,000.

CSA (h)(iii) Alternative to Interest Amount.  Subparagraph (A) should not
apply.  In the event that the downgraded party is the Secured Party (and
they were at the time of downgrade holding Posted Collateral) and Posted
Collateral is moved to a Custodian, there is no reason why the Pledgor, who
was not downgraded, should be penalized by not receiving interest payments
in the form of cash when they are paid on the Posted Collateral.  As a
matter of fact, it is my understanding that it is more difficult
operationally to reinvest such funds and much easier to pay them to the
Pledgor.

CSA (m) Other Provisions.  The definition of Federal Funds Effective Rate is
not necessary.  Please amend the definition of Letter of Credit to reflect
the requirements of the issuing bank to include a rating of A/A2 and having
total assets of at least US $10,000,000,000.  The definition of Material
Adverse Change should be amended to reflect the rating of both Moody's and
S&P.

Exhibit A Letter of Credit Provisions.  (b) Please delete the parenthetical
in line 3 to 4 and conform (i) to the amended definition of Letter of Credit
with respect to the requirements of the issuing bank.  (d)(ii) Y should be
entitled to draw under the LC in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph
8 of the CSA and not only upon the occurrence of an Event of Default.  The
first sentence of this section should be amended accordingly.  (e) Please
clarify the intent of this section.  It is rather confusing as written.

Schedule I.  The statement to be presented to the issuing bank should
conform to the circumstances under Paragraph 8 of the CSA under which the
Secured Party can demand payment and not just be limited to an Event of
Default.

We have just completed a nightmare negotiation involving a confirmation with 
this counterparty and propose entering into an English law ISDA Master with 
them to avoid future problems.  I understand that one is already in existence 
between this c/p and ECT.  I suggest that we could mirror this and send it to 
the cp as a starter.  If you think that this would be appropriate please 
could you send me a copy of the Duke/ECT Schedule, CSA and any guaranties.

Have a great weekend.

Many thanks

Below is the response that we received from our Agent.  Please call me at
(2120 902-1930 with any questions that you may have.


This has reference to our telecon. Enclosed is the relevant RBI regulation
for the captioned company (ABC) to sell its stake in the local company. To
effect the sale, ABC would require an approval from Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) even though the stock is listed. The documentation required varies
depending on whether the stock is thinly traded or actively traded. RBI's
definition of thinly traded is included in the regulation.

The company is required to fill out Form TS1 (I  am enclosing the format)
and submit this to RBI. In addition, the RBI requires certain documents
which are detailed in the form itself.

Trust this helps. Any other information that you require, please do not
hesitate to get in touch.

Paul:  I think you are trying to avoid me!  Hope all is well and you are just 
overworked and overwhelmed.  I am now working with Moazzam Khoja in Houston 
who is part of the enroncredit.com group most of which (as I understand) is 
located in London.  In connection with that group's activities, I have some 
questions and all fingers point to you.

(1)  Do you have credit derivative research that may be applicable for credit 
derivative transactions (including your online ""bankruptcy swap"") in the US?  
I am sure that you've already explored the ""insurance"" issue and I don't want 
to duplicate reasearch, if possible.
(2)  What forms have you devised?  Are they online?   Should I just grab a 
password?
(3)  Are the enroncredit.com traders in the UK required by the SFA to take an 
SFA exam (I'm guessing it's a broker or securities exam)?  Is trading in 
credit derivatives regulated, or regulated differently than other types of 
derivatives?  I am trying to determine whether Moazzam needs to take the 
Series 7 here in the US; our traders taking that exam must be dealing in 
""securites"" for that exam to be necessary.
(4)  Where is enroncredit.com headed?

I would very much appreciate your [PROMPT] reply.  Sara"

Rod:  I'm thinking ahead with respect to Enron Corp./Hickerson matters.  A 
few current issues include:

(1)  Nogid/Freeland seem to be entering into more equity swaps.  I have asked 
that copes of all equity transactions be forwarded to my attention 
immediately.  The first order of business includes transacting with the 
following parties in the following order:
 1.  Credit Suisse First Boston (""CSFB"").  We have an ECT ISDA with Credit 
Suisse Financial Products which I believe is the predecessor to CSFB.  Can 
you verify?  Do we need to amend or create a new master?
 2.  Bear Stearns (I believe that it will be Bear Stearns International 
Limited because equities are done offshore)
 3.  Lehman Brothers Finance S.A.  (you already provided credit)

Please let me know about 1 and 2 above.

(2)  Credit derivatives and distressed loan transactions

On May 18, 2000, I provided you with a list of the types of transactions 
originating in Kinneman's group by ECT Investments.  Do these guys ever need 
to communicate with credit?  How do you monitor? 

Please let me know who I should be speaking with about these transactions."

Do you think that we should give Susan B., Susan F.  and Tana an expression 
of thanks for their work during Marie's departure?  I was thinking that a 
gift certificate would be appropriate (e.g., spa services, Enron gift 
products, etc.) and it might send the message that we do know and appreciate 
their efforts.   Sara  "

		 Subject: Assignment of ISDAs

Jaime,

In connection with our telephone conversation with Susan Helton last Friday, 
I wanted to follow up with you regarding the possibility of Enron North 
America Corp. (""ENA"") assigning some or all of its ISDA agreements entered 
into with Mexican counterparties to an Enron entity formed under the laws of 
Mexico (""Enron Mexico"").  Such a transfer would cause ENA to be subject to 
U.S. federal income tax (at a 35 percent rate) on the value of the contracts 
assigned.

As we discussed, one alternative may be for Enron Mexico to enter into new 
ISDA agreements with the Mexican counterparties, and to allow the ISDA 
agreements entered into by Mexican counterparties with ENA to lapse or, 
alternatively, to cancel such agreements.  While such an alternative may be 
preferable from a U.S. tax perspective, other business concerns must also be 
considered (such as credit issues).

Please contact me at ext. 35777 if you'd like to discuss further.

Best regards,

Jeff

Sara:

    As promised, this email discusses the securities laws issues involved
with equity derivatives, I
then make a few observations about the relationship between the securities
and commodities laws, and I
then makes some comments on the confirmations you sent me (both securities
laws comments and other
comments.

The principal securities laws issues relate to the fact that the equity
derivative itself is a security and to the
issue of whether and to what extent a counterparty=01,s activities in
establishing or unwinding a hedge are
attributable to the issuer.  When Enron enters into a derivative and the
counterparty goes out into the
market to make a purchase, is that purchase attributable to Enron?  When it
unwinds its hedge by making
a sale, is the counterparty=01,s sale attributable to Enron and therefore
required to be registered?  Here are
the principal issues:

1)  Rule 10b-5.  When Enron enters into a derivative, it must be sure it
does
not have undisclosed
material inside information regarding its affairs.  It is my understanding
that the traders are
supposed to check with Rex Rogers on the issue of whether Enron possesses
such information.
Although it could discharge its obligations under Rule 10b-5 by disclosing
the information to the
counterparty, that would probably be unacceptable since the counterparty
would then be in
possession of material inside information and could not engage in a market
transaction to hedge.
Thus, each time it enters into an equity derivative in its own stock, Enron
must be confident that
the public has available to it all material information regarding Enron.

2)  Rule 10b-18.  This rule permits issuers and persons acting in concert
with issuers to repurchase
the issuer=01,s  shares under a =01&safe harbor=018 that says in effect tha=
t if
purchases are made pursuant
to the rule they won=01,t be deemed to be manipulative by reason of the tim=
ing
and amounts of the
bids or purchases.  It is typical for an issuer to require its counterparty
to make purchases
pursuant to the rule.  Sometimes this is a contractual undertaking in the
confirmation, and in
some cases the issuer will simply obtain an oral commitment from the
counterparty to engage in
its hedges pursuant to the rule.  Obviously, it is better to have it in
writing.

3)  Registration of Sales.  If Enron decides to net share settle and issues
shares to the counterparty,
those are obviously restricted securities that cannot be sold by the
counterparty in the absence of a
registration statement.  But what about the resales by the issuer when it
unwinds its hedge that it
has put on by buying shares in the open market?  Are those sales
attributable
to the issuer so
therefore required to be registered?  I have seen lots of counterparties,
based on advice of their
law firms, take different positions on this:

a)  Some counterparties say that they want registration rights covering
resales of shares
purchased in the open market to hedge a derivative with the issuer.  If the
economics of
the derivative are determined based on the net proceeds from the sales, it=
=01,s

a more
difficult case because the issuer itself is realizing benefits and
detriments
from the sales.
b)  Some counterparties say they want registration rights covering resales
of
shares
purchased in the open market to hedge a derivative with the issuer only if
there is a
strong correlation at the onset of the contract between the terms of the
derivative and the
hedge.  It it=01,s a total return swap, for example, there will be a 1:1
correspondence (i.e.
the economics will tell you that the counterparty will buy 100% of the
shares
covered by
the swap immediately upon entering into the swap); but if it=01,s something
like
a collar
with divergent strike prices and involves dynamic hedging where it=01,s not
clear whether
and to what extent the counterparty will make purchases or sales in the ope=
n

market,
then it=01,s not as easy to attribute the counterparty=01,s actions to the =
issuer.

 In those cases
these counterparties look at the correlation and if it=01,s not that great =
they

don=01,t ask for
registration rights.
c)  Some counterparties say they don=01,t want registration rights for resa=
les
of stock
purchased in the open market to hedge their position.

Credit Suisse First Boston falls in category c) with respect to the May 200=
0

confirmation you sent
me. Even though there is a strong correlation between the deal and the hedg=
e

( i.e. even though
in that case they will no doubt immediately purchase 100% of the shares
covered by the
transaction) they are only asking for registration rights with respect to
the
shares that are
delivered by Enron on net share settlement.

4)  Commodities Laws.  Under the commodities laws there are some risks in
doing equity swaps in
that one has to rely on the swaps policy statement rather than the swaps
exemption, but those
risks are probably minimal enough that Enron is willing to take them.  (The
swaps exemption
does not cover equity swaps.)  With respect to equity options, they are
outside the CFTC=01,s
jurisdiction altogether.  Forward contracts present the most difficult
issues
in that there is a lot of
case law and CFTC lore about the distinction between forwards and futures,
and a key distinction
is that forwards are physical delivery contracts that bind the parties to
make and take delivery.
State bucket shop laws outlaw contracts that purport to be contracts for
sale
of a security that are
to be settled based on market price quotations.  So I would counsel Enron
not
to enter into any
forward contract that has a cash settlement alternative.  Although one can
argue that net share
settlement has the same defects, I don=01,t feel as strongly about that bec=
ause

you could get to where
you want to get by physically delivering the  shares and issuing  new share=
s

in payment; the
theory is that you actually delivered shares and just netted them out; that
is not quite as bad as
flying in the face of the case law and CFTC lore on net cash settlement.

The Bear Stearns Confirmation and Cancellation.  I really don=01,t have any
comments on this; I think the
cancellation was effective to cancel the parties obligations.  The
confirmation did not present any
registration issues.  I guess I would say that if you do something precisel=
y

like this you might get them to
agree to make any hedge purchases pursuant to Rule 10b-18, but that=01,s it=
.

The Credit Suisse First Boston Confirmation.  This is an extremely well
written document.  For the
reasons discussed above, I would counsel against entering into this kind of
transaction with the cash
settlement feature, in light of the risk that it could be characterized as
an
illegal, unenforceable futures
contract.  A few other comments: They say automatic early termination
applies, but I think that is a really
bad idea.  Enron had an agreement with a counterparty that took bankruptcy
and Enron did not find out
about it until a few days later, after the market had moved; since Enron di=
d

not know of the termination it
did not unwind its hedge, yet the ISDA said that the amounts payable on
termination would depend on the
termination date pricing.  So Enron took a loss.  You ought to always have
within your control the right to
terminate.  This is especially true of U.S. parties, but I would think the
same would apply to foreign
parties unless there is something peculiar about the law of the jurisdictio=
n

you are dealing with.

Both Confirmations  Both confirmations have language that says that if the
parties have not entered into
an ISDA Master then the counterparties=01, standard form controls.  I think=
 it
is not a good idea to agree to
such language because you are agreeing to something you know nothing about.

Additional Comment.  I think that whenever a counterparty requests
registration rights Rex should be
involved.  I think the CSFB confirmation=01,s provisions relating to
registration are fine, and of course they
can=01,t force us to register because the choice of net share settling is
purely
our choice.  Nevertheless, I
think that Rex needs to be involved so you and Rex need to get this point
across to the business people that
they shouldn=01,t just sign a confirmation and then send it to you and ask =
if
it
is ok.

But my bottom line is the only change I would make would be eliminating the
net cash settlement feature
in the CSFB confirmation.

Attached are the two (2) sets of assignments with attached trade descriptions.

(1)  the first set (first two docs) is an assignment of trades between ENA 
and HS Resources, Inc.; after execution of the assignment, the trades will be 
between ENA and HS Energy Services, Inc.  subject to the ISDA which we are 
now negotiating [the second doc is an appendix consisting of 5 trades and I 
have asked the desk to confirm that these are the only outstanding trades]

(2)  the second set (last two docs) is an assignment of trades between J. 
Aron & Company and HS Energy Services, Inc; after execution of the 
assignment, the trades will be between J.Aron & Company and ENA subject to 
the 8/14/94 J.Aron/ENA ISDA [the fourth doc is an appendix of all existing 
trades between J.Aron/HS Energy Services, Inc.  I have no idea where this 
came from but I assume it is part of your agreement with HS.  Who is 
verifying the trades and are all trade terms acceptable?  Presently, the 
assignment is drafted such that a conflict between the Master and a confirm 
will be governed by the Master]

There was a flurry of activity in March, 1997 involving Petron but it was on 
the physical side and we never made it to the swap issues.  Again in April, 
1998, Manuel and John Enerson began looking into the issue of gaming statutes 
in an effort to attack legislation in the Philippines.  No further legal work 
was ever attempted.  Hope this helps.  Regards.   SS

When Janice mentioned the legal due diligence with regard to commodity

that isn't the case and you've done more ISDA work in the Phillipines since 
then, I'd be forever grateful if you could send over whatever copies of the

Well, it looks like we might have a shot at an ISDA w/ a PHilippines 
company.  One issue that discussed w/ Manuel but he does not mention in his 
note is that we would probably require an enforceability opinion from Petron 
(a compnay jointly owned by the PHilippines govt and Saudi Aramco).  I'm not 
sure which credit dept. would handle this deal, but Cynthia Schnedier has 
some familiarity w/ Petron.   I'll leave it to Mark, Alan and Anita to 
determine whether Anita will handle the ISDA or whether it will be someone 
from Houston (Sara S. did the original legal due diligence on the 
enforceability of commodities derivatives contracts in the PHilippines).

Subject: Update on Petron Hedging Program




Dear John,

Yayette Ventigan of Petron informed me yesterday that the energy derivatives 
course conducted by Paradigm in Manila from July 7 to 10 was well-received.  
I sensed that the course was not deemed easy by the Petron participants.  
Further, Yayette indicated that they could have easily used up more time for 
the same amount of material.

Given the Paradigm course (and the Citibank course which Yayette attended in 
Australia), Yayette indicated that the Petron Board will most likely give the 
marching orders to Petron management on July 27 to (1) develop an initial, 
basic and conservative hedging program for Petron?s fuel oil and gasoil 
supplied to the National Power Corporation and (2) go out to the market (most 
likely through a bid process) and execute a financial risk management 
contract (ISDA).

Yayette indicated that Petron looks forward to the working meeting with 
Enron?s Singapore traders.  I indicated to Yayette that end of August to 
early September would probably be convenient for us.  Yayette could not yet 
determine an appropriate time for Petron.

With respect to legal expectations, Petron appears to be at ease with the
following:

?  In general, the concept of disassociating the financial risk management 
contract from the Philippines with the exception of Petron Corporation (a 
Philippine corporation) being a party to the contract.

?  Petron executing a financial risk management contract with an offshore 
counter-party like Citibank Australia or ECT Singapore.

?  Petron physically executing the contract outside the Philippines.

?  The contract to be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

I did point out to Yayette the need for offshore collateral in the form of a 
Letter of Credit, which is consistent with the risk of non-enforcement for 
collateral in the Philippines.  Yayette indicated that she would raise this 
issue in her discussions with Petron treasury.

More later as I receive more feedback from Petron.

Best regards,
Manuel

		 Subject: Differences

Joe - attached is a first shot at getting a handle on all the differences 
between the proposed and existing margin lines.  I plan to do more analysis 
with respect to covenants and warranties but this hits the main points.  The 
analysis between rates will be very complex and may be something best left to 
the research Group.  We can go through why this is such a complex issue to 
model.  What I do plan to do is update historical info. so that based on the 
past we can make general statements such as over time Fed Funds + X bp <,>,= 
to LIBOR + X bp.

A quick synapses of difficult items:

Commissions vs. Margin lines - will trading desk use facility for many trades 
or less frequent trades for smaller amounts
Short on Financial gas vs. Long on physical gas - cash flow differentials and 
how we can model the cost of cash to fund the working capital (as you 
explained to me today)
What positions the trader take and how our equity position is at that exact 
time.  Will we trade in a similar fashion in the future?


From what I understand the trading desks do not have ready access to the 
above  information in a format which lends itself to modelling of reasonable

Joe - attached is a first shot at getting a handle on all the differences 
between the proposed and existing margin lines.  I plan to do more analysis 
with respect to covenants and warranties but this hits the main points.  The 
analysis between rates will be very complex and may be something best left to 
the research Group.  We can go through why this is such a complex issue to 
model.  What I do plan to do is update historical info. so that based on the 
past we can make general statements such as over time Fed Funds + X bp <,>,= 
to LIBOR + X bp.

A quick synapses of difficult items:

Commissions vs. Margin lines - will trading desk use facility for many trades 
or less frequent trades for smaller amounts
Short on Financial gas vs. Long on physical gas - cash flow differentials and 
how we can model the cost of cash to fund the working capital (as you 
explained to me today)
What positions the trader take and how our equity position is at that exact 
time.  Will we trade in a similar fashion in the future?


From what I understand the trading desks do not have ready access to the 
above  information in a format which lends itself to modelling of reasonable 
complexity or do not wish to share it with us (understandable considering the

fyi.  also, I just spoke with Sarah Wesner (ext. 35261) who will coordinate 
with you.  You can review the note with her and let's talk about their 
guaranty (will our guaranty format work?).  Also, I'm almost inclined to go 
with their commitment letter (if revised) in lieu of a lengthier agreement.

Sara,

I had a call on this from Bob a few weeks ago.  I told him that generally it 
was ok, but that we would need to revise our file should he require a 
definitive position, plus we would need to ensure that advice which we 
ploughed through earlier last year was still current.  He told me not to do 
any more work on this at the time because it was not clear whether there was 
any chance of doing a deal with an Indian counterparty.

I am more than willing to send you ou all my notes, etc, however, which 
crunched through the 1/14/97 opinion with Crawford's and asked supplemental 
questions.

Kind regards

Mark

Thanks Sara. I called John late yesterday and left a voice mail saying that 
we could begin pricing the deal while the lawyers worked on the ISDA.  I have 
not heard from him yet, either.  I will let you know if anything progresses 
on the deal side.  Will you let me know what progresses on the ISDA and legal 
side.  Also, if I am around, will you let me know when the conference call 
with the lawyers is.   I would like to sit in on the call.  Hopefully,  I 
will speak with John today and hear more about it.  Since I inherited this 
account from someone who recently left Enron, I don't know John as well as I 
would if he had been my client all along.  Of course,  I am not complaining - 
always happy to inherit a client ready to do a deal.

Thanks again for your help.

Attached is our revision to the draft ISDA schedules for the HSES/Enron ISDA 
with changes marked.  My approach was simply to make changes consistent with 
the HS Resources ISDA other than items specific to their different credit 
status.  Please call me with any comments or questions.

This is a heads up about a NEP deal that may be coming to EPMI Friday 
afternoon (6/23).  John Llodra (mid-marketer, part of Ed Baughman's group) 
would like to be ready to send out our paper if we are selected as the 
winning bidder.  Our bid contained two alternatives (physical or financial), 
and NEP could pick either one.  We've prepared a physical contract and wanted 
to alert you that there may be a need for a financial one -- which I assume 
would be in the form of an ""Omnibus"" agreement (as far as I can tell, we do 
not have an ISDA in place w/ NEP).  John will let us know tomorrow either 
way, so we'll be in touch.  In the meantime, please let me or John know if 
you have any questions.  Thanks for your help.

Genia,

Attached please find a credit worksheet containing terms for an EEI Master 
Power Agreement between New England Power Company and EPMI.  Please note that 
S&P does not provide a credit rating for senior, unsecured debt, therefore, I 
am electing to use the ""long-term credit rating"" by S&P and senior, unsecured 
debt to apply to Moody's.  Please see the cws for the color allocation.

I am available should you have any questions, x3-0554.

Susan,

The below e-mail/Telex was sent to our Trading desk as MG's Confirmation for 
a Copper Transaction we have traded with them.  Per the desks instructions I 
have not sent our form of Confirmation for several reasons as follows:

1) Trader wrote on ticket that MG was to Confirm the Transactions
2) We were unsure of MG's Legal entity name
3) No contact @ MG

My question for you is are we going to accept this as a form of Confirmation?

Thanks,
Joe

Pushkar:  Here's the language suggested by Merrill for use in NDF's.  I am 
not familiar with the frequency of our trades, but I'm sure Laurel can fill 
in the blanks.  I thought that the process being implemented by the EMTA 
seemed reasonable but let me know if this is a fallback that you would agree 
to use if the PTAX rate is not available for settltment.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

Previously we have agreed upon ""CURRENCY REFERENCE DEALERS"" as the first 
disruption fallback, and """"CURRENCY MUTUAL AGREEMENT"" as the 2nd disruption 
fallback.  It appears that EMTA has created a ""BRL Industry Survey Rate"" 
(BRL11).  Merrill feels that this definition is replacing the Currency 
Reference dealers definition--or at least setting out a clear methodology for 
determining the rate.  Also, Shari always preferred that we use the mutual 
agreement rather then calculation agent determination of settlement rate.  
The ISDA template defaults to Calculation Agent.  Do you prefer that we 
continue on asking people for mutual agreement, or are you o.k. with 
Calculation agent determination of settlement rate?  Trading has no 
preference on that matter.  

I am faxing you a current ML non-deliverable deal with this new language in 
it for your review.  Please let me know if the confirm is o.k. to sign, or if 
you have any issues we need to address.  

Thanks!

See the below attachments for the new definition and the history surrounding 
it.

Hi Laurel,

Please take a look at the following documents sent by EMTA.  Only difference
is that we have not included the ""unscheduled holiday"" provisions as there
has not been a clear cut consensus among counterparties whether to use
Preceding or Following.

Please contact me if you have any problems.

I will try to sort through my e-mails if I find additional information on
the BRL templates.

Thank you

Tanya:  I just spoke with Chris about this ARCO transaction which might trade 
TODAY.  We are ""cleaning up"" some of the language as it was based on the 
prior ARCO deal (when we were ECT).  Please note that Enron Corp. previously 
provided a guaranty.  I am not certain whether that guaranty is tied to the 
transaction specifically and I'll try to track down.  Will ENA provide a 
parent guaranty for the new transaction?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara

Subject: Confirm for Power Swap




Chris, I've attached a simplified confirm based on our prior May, 1999 
version.
The only change in the new draft is to represent the fact that we are now 
using
only firm energy rather than a blend of firm and nonfirm. As a result volume
weighting should only apply on holidays and Sundays when on-peak and off-peak
values may need to be weighted in with 24-hour firm values.

On a related issue, how quickly could you have a corporate guarantee 
available?

Dave

Arco today.  His number in Portland is 834-3822.  I'm not certain about

Please see the attachment for a specific definition of ELIGIBLE SWAP 
PARTICIPANT and the TRADE OPTION EXEMPTION.

From a legal perspective and to avoid scrutiny and regulation by the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, ENA must always comply with the Trade 
Option Exemption when entering into options (as buyer or seller) with a third 
party.  Some of ENA's trading parties cannot satisfy this exemption from 
regulation because they are not a producer/merchant handling the underlying 
commodity (such as banks, hedge funds, etc) even though they may be entering 
into the transaction for business purposes.  If that situation occurs, ENA 
MUST ALWAYS BE THE OFFEREE OF THE OPTION (as buyer or seller) and ENA cannot 
solicit the party to enter into the transaction.

If ENA's trading partner fails to satisfy the Trade Option Exemption, our 
confirmation will EXPLICITLY state that ENA was offered the option to buy or 
sell by the counterparty.

Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara [ENA legal]

		 Subject: Revised Assignments from Jim Piccone


Attached are revised forms of Assignments for both the HSES to Enron (J. Aron 
trades) and HS Resources to HSES (Enron trades).  These are redlined versions.

The main changes to the HSES to Enron (J. Aron trades) assignment are 
completion of the Effective Date (June 28), the date of the J. Aron/Enron 
ISDA and the addition of counterpart and fax signature language.

The HS Resources to HSES assignment has been structurally revised to assign 
all HS Resources/Enron trades to HSES except those shown on Appendix A.  
Since the HS Resources/Enron trades continue to change every day until the 
HSES/Enron ISDA is in place, this new structure of the assignment will be 
much simpler and will pick up all HS Resources/Enron transactions through 
Friday, June 30.  Hopefully, by then the HSES/Enron ISDA will be in place.

Please let me know as soon as you believe these documents are ready for 
Enron's signature.  As soon as I have sign off by the other parties to the 
documents, I will advise you.  We can then have everyone print finals, get 
signatures and fax all counterparts to me.  I will act as a clearinghouse and 
get counterparts back out to everyone.

All:  Attached is a short recap of the items which I have been discussing 
with Clint and Jeff.  I'd like to get together sometime today or tomorrow.

Rex and Jim:  I will fax to you copies of the Enron Corp. resolutions (some 
final, some draft only) referenced in the attached summary.  I may not have 
the latest information and perhaps you can update and address when we meet.  
Please call me with a suggested time.  This afternoon is best for me.

Rod and I discussed this party (which always appears on the legal/credit 
list!!!!  It seem that BP signed a Master Agreement (our OLD form) with 
ECTRIC on 1/8/98 and agreed to sign THE IDENTICAL AGREEMENT with ENA.  Absent 
an executed agreement, ENA and BP continue to use a form of ""Swap Contract"" 
which had been agreed to many years ago (similar to our GTC's in the omnibus) 
which also provides that the parties will negotiate a master agreement.   Rod 
doesn't see much current trading activity so we didn't believe this to be a 
high priority.

Having said all of this, the form is limited to swaps, doesn't provide for 
setoff, arbitration, certain market disruption events and several other items 
which we can review if necessary.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  Thanks.  Sara  "

Sara, Susan:

The attached revision of the Appendix to the HS Resources to HS Energy 
Services assignment corrects the Total MMBtu column, which had a math error.  
The trade descriptions, which would control in any event, have not changed.

We would like to proceed with execution on Thursday.   Would you please 
accept the changes  in the red-lined documents I sent yesterday, print 
cleans, get signatures, and fax to me at 303-296-9709?  I will send the HS 
signiture pages in the morning, and will send the J. Aron pages as soon as I 
get them.

I will be in touch with you in the morning to discuss further.

Thanks. Jim

Hello David,

I didn't want to bother you - you're probably more than busy right now.

In my continuing effort to get your account going, specifically,
completing the margin line of credit, I thought the following might
help:

When Jeff Shankman first told me of Enron's requirement to have a line
of credit for margining, nat gas initial margin was $2750 per contract.
It is now $3850 and likely to rise again.  The 'cheap financing' that
our line represents to John Arnold may be even more appealing now (if he
has a second to convince Sara Shackleton to work on the documentation).

Otherwise, thanks for the intro to Bill White.  We've only spoken
briefly so far, but he did say he was trying to free up some time to get
something going.

I'll be in Houston in about two weeks, but I hope to talk to you before
then.

Regards,
Jim Naughton

Subject: Swap Agreement



I am sending this e-mail message to address several issues related to the
swap and to circulate a proposed confirmation for your consideration.

Before addressing the swap, however, I should note that it is not clear to
me that the project team has finally decided to proceed with a swap rather
than a guaranty.  If we are not, I would appreciate someone letting me know
so that we can stop this process.

Comments on the Draft Schedule:

 1.  Part 1(a) ""Specified Entity"":  A Specified Entity is an entity
other than the parties whose actions can cause an event of default or a
termination event.  The draft schedule does not contemplate a Specified
Entity.  I think we should consider whether EPE and/or SCG should be a
Specified Entity with respect to TBS.

 2.  Part 1(b) ""Threshold Amount"": proposes $1,000,000 for TBS, which
seems low given that Enron Corp. is backing it up.

 3.  Part 1(h) ""Additional Event of Default"":  If we use a swap
arrangement, there will be two: one for 72.5% between TBS and ECT, and one
for 27.5% between TBS and a Shell entity.  If that is the case, do we want
an additional event of default under which a sale by Shell of its interest
in TBS could result in termination?

 4.  Part 2  ""Representations"":  I think that we need someone in tax
to determine whether TBS can make the representations.

 5.  Part 4(d) & (e) ""Credit Support Provider"": Shell will be the
credit support provider under the other swap arrangement, not this one.

 6.  Part 4(g) ""Governing Law"", 4(h) ""Arbitration"": The schedule
proposes Texas law with AAA arbitration to be held in Texas.  It would seem
to me that we would want to use arbitration procedures that are similar to
those in the gas supply agreements, with ICC arbitration, held in Miami,
under New York, with joint arbitration if the same issue arises under one of
the gas supply arrangements (such as the proper calculation of price).

Comment on the Proposed Confirmation:

 I have reproduced the gas supply pricing provisions from the EPE Gas
Supply Agreement under the ""Fixed Amount Details"" but have not done so under
the ""Floating Amount Details"", which cross-references the provisions of the
SCG Gas Supply Agreement, because of the length of those provisions.

 Please let me know if you have any reactions to the above comments
or any comments on the attached confirmation.  I will contact Nasim to
discuss the process for pushing the swaps (or, alternatively, guaranties) to
completion.

Regards, Dean

All:  It appears that this is the group which can best address the 
(derivatives) issues which may arise when Enron Corp. attempts to enter into 
equity swaps/options/forwards based upon Enron Corp. stock.  We have all 
undertaken to provide the group with the following items:

(1)  ""Procedures for Executing/Documenting/Unwinding Enron Corp. Equity 
Derivatives""
       Clint has already circulated a draft proposal.  Comments are invited.

(2)  The transacting party:  ENA (with an Enron Corp. guaranty) or Enron 
Corp.?
       Rex has no preference and credit's initial response was to consolidate 
trading in ENA.  I will revisit this issue with Bill Bradford.

(3)  Enron Corp. equity trading resolution
       Rex and Jim will handle the drafting and logistics.  This will be 
necessary if Enron Corp. is the trading party because the counterparty will 
want to review      (and equity trading requires authorization) AND also 
necessary if ENA is the trading party because equity trading requires 
authorization.

(4)  Standard form of Registration Rights Agreement
       Rex and Jim will handle the drafting.  This can be used as our ""form"" 
for future transactions.

(5)  Enron Corp. ""position paper"" addressing equity derivative parameters, 
preferable methods of settlement, registration rights, etc.
       I have no volunteers.  Maybe Bob Baird needs an assignment.

As you know, there are several outstanding confirms which require immediate 
attention before the foregoing items can be finalized.  Please let me know if 
we can establish a timetable for completion of this project.  Thanks for your 
help.  Sara"

Bill:  I have previously discussed this issue with Rod.  I would like to 
revisit once again.  These transactions include swaps/options/forwards on ENE 
stock.  There is a renewed effort coming from Treasury to use these tools 
more frequently than in the past.  I am in touch with Rex Rogers (Enron Corp. 
securities lawyer) as registration rights issues on ENE stock are definitely 
involved.  Our counterparties are telling us that they prefer to look to 
Enron Corp. since it is Enron Corp.'s stock that is involved.  At a minimun, 
even if ENA were the trading counterparty (with an Enron Corp. guaranty 
capped at an appropriate level), Enron Corp. would probably have to sign each 
confirmation as ISSUER OF THE STOCK (and ENA cannot make those agreements on 
behalf of Enron Corp.).

I would like to discuss ASAP as we are in the midst of negotiations with CSFB 
International, UBS AG, Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc. and Lehman 
Brothers Finance S.A."

All:  I spoke with Bill Bradford to get the global credit perspective, and, 
he is entirely neutral.  However, he agreed that it made sense for Enron 
Corp. to transact on its own stock.  

I am prepared to draft new ISDA Master Agreements with our remaining 
potential targets in the name of ""Enron Corp."" without Credit Support 
Annexes.  Upon execution, the parties generally exchange evidence of 
authority (i.e., resolution or excerpt thereof).  

The outstanding confirms are in the name of Enron Corp.  These are ""Deemed 
ISDA's"" and no party has asked for evidence of authority (although the 
parties do represent that they have such authority).

Please let me hear from you if someone objects to the use of Enron Corp.   
Thanks.  Sara "

		 Subject: Expanding Enron Online into the Mexican Market.

This is a wrap-up email to inform all of you about the dates, activities and 
where we are standing with regards to the expansion of EOL to the Mexican 
Market.   The general strategy is to target the 40 major key customers 
directly, through two  formal presentations. One on Thursday August 3rd in 
Monterrey, at the  Quinta Real Hotel; and the second one on Friday August 4th 
in Mexico City, at the Four Seasons Hotel.   The setting is pretty much a 
Continental breakfast, followed by welcoming remarks and the formal 
presentation of EOL.

We plan to send out the invitations with the brochures around July 15th.  Kal 
Shah is planning on delivering around 600 spanish-translated EOL Ball 
Brochures in the next days. The brochures will have a cover letter that will 
include the Guest Accounts for the customers that will be invited to the 
formal presentations. We will follow up with RSVP personal calls from the 
15th to the 3rd. The rest of the customers will receive the brochure by mail. 

Jeff Blumenthal is helping us on the Tax Issues regarding on-line 
transactions by Mexican Counterparties. Jeff is almost finishing on checking 
the Tax implications on the products most probably traded by the targeted 
customers, as well as all other products listed on EOL. 

Carol St Claire is helping us on all the legal issues, as well as reviewing 
the marketing material that would be sent out to customers. We should have a 
formal opinion in the next days. 

Eric Thode is putting together the press releases to be sent on the launching 
date, and is also helping us with a plan to invite and inform the media about 
the event as well as EOL service. Eric, please send a copy of the press 
releases to Carol, since there are some words we need to avoid on the legal 
side of things.

Paul Radous and Rod Nelson are helping us with the pre-approval of credit for 
all of these targeted customers to be able to transact in EOL. 

Leonardo Pacheco is helping us on several fronts, and specially coordination 
of this effort, as well as getting all the guest accounts for the customers, 
together with Frank Davies. Leonardo please send a bunch of  Getting Started 
manuals as soon as you can. 

Daniel Diamond will help us with the marketing material and strategy. Dan let 
me know who will be attending the presentations on your behalf, and type of 
aid we will need in the Hotels. 

Let me know who is planning to attend so we can help with reservations and 
travel arrangements, or call directly Barbara Martinez at 011-52-8-152-2404.

I really appreciate all of your support and great work.  I am looking forward 
to successfully concluding the ""Approval"" process in the next days so we can 
move forward with the logistics, and please let me know how else can I help.

Kind Regards,   Jaime Williams.

A few thoughts:
1. Section 2.1 (y) the .30% should specify per annum
2. Section 2.1 contemplates that interest is payable monthly--this seems to 
conflict with the provisions of Section 3.1 which makes it payable on demand. 
Am I missing something?
3. Section 3.5 should we specify a time of day?

I have reviewed this via remote access, and am not able to print. I think 
more thought should go into the mechanics and timing  of what is going on 
here. I will be available next week. Can we have another meeting?

1.  Media General wants the cross-default to be reciprocal at $100 million
for both Media General and Enron.
2.   Further, Media General thinks that this should be a cross-acceleration,
not a cross-default.
3.   Page 3 of Schedule.  The ""date by which to be delivered"" for Party B
should track the same with Party A: i.e., if financials are available on
EDGAR then they would not be automatically provided by MG on a quarterly
basis.
4.  Page 4 of Schedule.  Under (a), add ""Attn.: Chief Financial Officer"".
We will send Marshall Morton's fax and telephone numbers.
5.  We will let you know who will serve as process agent.  We would like to
talk about governing law in Texas and the site of arbitration in Houston.
6.  Page 6 of Schedule.  In clause(b)(g), please note that MG intends to
assign this agreement and we want to make sure that does not affect this
representation.
7.Page 8 of Schedule.  MG wants the right to assign this agreement to a
party with a credit agreement equivalent to a certain level.  We can discuss
what that level should be.  We should discuss what Enron's credit rating is
in this connection.

Transaction Confirmation Document.

1. MG does not think this transaction should be characterized as a
""swaption"".  This was to be a deal for the purchase of newsprint at a fixed
price, not at Enron's option.
2. We want todiscuss the expiration date. We should also discuss the other
dates and terms which are blank.  On page 2, under ""Additional Provisions"",
the date for satisfying conditions is clearly wrong since it refers to July
5.  Once again, all of this ties in with not being an option, but a fixed
agreement.
3. We would like to have Enron render a monthly settlement statement with a
net amount being paidto/receivable from MG.  No netting is presently
provided for in the agreement.


ISDA Credit Support Annex

MG  would like to delete this entirely and would propose that Enron would
rely on the general cross-acceleration provisions.  Media General never
contemplated credit provisions more onerous than its credit agreements.

          I will have the Media General business people follow up with the
people at Enron, but could you please have some one get in touch with me on
this.

Thanks,
John

All trades were originally confirmed in the name of Dow Hydrocarbons and 
Resources Inc.  The Dow trader (Mike Blillings) subsequently contacted the 
desk and requested that all trades be booked in the name of ""The Dow Chemical 
Company"".  Mary Gosnell contacted Cathy Tudon in credit and Cathy approved 
the changes.  Let me know if you have any comment for the desk.  SS

ECT does NOT have a master with The Dow Chemical Company.  Are these trades 
booked on an omnibus?  I am not certain that credit approved these trades.  
Are they all propane?  We need to discuss.  SS

Sara and Paul,

I have received a request for a quote from Inforsa CI, and Chilean company.  
They appear to have an excellent balance sheet, but I don't know if we are 
set up to trade with Chilean companies.  Paul, the company's information is 
available on Bloomberg if you type in INFORSA CI and hit the equity key.  We 
are just starting discussions with them, but I wanted to make sure to give 
you both advance notice.  Please let me know if there is any additional 
information that you need from me.

It looks like it will be at least a month before Singapore Press Holdings 
will be ready to do business.  I'll keep you informed as our talks progress.

Thanks,

Jay

(1)  CIBC
 (a)  Enron Corp. has a 1/17/96 master and CIBC is designated as multibranch 
to act through offices in Tokyo, London and New York.  If this agreement is 
used, we need to add FX/currency provisions.
 (b)  ENA has a 10/1/94 master and CIBC is designated as multibranch to act 
through offices in Toronto, Tokyo and London.  The agreement was amended on 
5/24/96 (to add a collateral annex), on 7/27/97 t(o add FX/currency option 
and FRABBA provisions) and on 1/13/00 (to amend thresholds).

(2)  Deutsche Bank AG 
 ENA is in the process of negotiating an ISDA master agreement.  We are 
speaking with Stephen Kessler (legal) in New York.

(3)  Commerzbank AG

You are probably aware that Enron has gone unconditional on its offer to buy 
MG, a metal company here in London.
The objective is to integrate with them ASAP and as smoothly as possible.

I made a visit with MG today and talked to their FX trader who said that he 
trades with the following banks:
CIBC
Deutche Bank
Commerz Bank
Metall Bank

Can you please tell me what lines we have in place with these, if any at all.


Sara
Do we have isdas etc in place?


Most of the trades are spot or 3mth forward, but some trades are up to four 
years out.

I have attached an ISDA worksheet for EnMax Energy Corporation, Carol and 
Susan Flynn had worked on an ISDA to EnMax Power, although per the request of 
Derek Davies in the Enron Canada office, this should now be EnMax Energy with 
a guaranty from EnMax Corp.  Also, this agreement is being executed in

Please call with any questions.

The confirmation desk recently received a call from Mike Billings who I 
believe is your Dow trader.  Mike is trying to trade financially under the 
name ""The Dow Chemical Company"".   ECT SHOULD CONTINUE TO TRADE FINANCIALLY 
WITH ""DOW HYDROCARBONS AND RESOURCES INC"" (the party that ECT has a Master 
Agreement with).  ECT will NOT agree to change the counterparty on any future 
trades.  When you speak with Mike Billings, you may alert him to this.  
Thanks.  Sara"

Sara and Paul,

I have received a request for a quote from Inforsa CI, and Chilean company.  
They appear to have an excellent balance sheet, but I don't know if we are 
set up to trade with Chilean companies.  Paul, the company's information is 
available on Bloomberg if you type in INFORSA CI and hit the equity key.  We 
are just starting discussions with them, but I wanted to make sure to give 
you both advance notice.  Please let me know if there is any additional 
information that you need from me.

It looks like it will be at least a month before Singapore Press Holdings 
will be ready to do business.  I'll keep you informed as our talks progress.

Thanks,

Jay

Is there a Guarantee in place by Enron Corp. for ECT Investments, Inc. 
relating to our prime broker agreements with Goldman Sachs?  
We are talking to Goldman currently about increasing our leverage and a 
guarantee may be beneficial if one does not already exist.  We are unsure if 
one already exists.

* Where to stash your cash between investments
* A four-step checklist for researching technology stocks online

E*TRADE Step-By-Step Guide to Online Investing,"" simply visit
http://e-trade.0mm.com/CST008002 or copy and paste this URL into
your browser.  Then place a stock or mutual fund order by July

hope will make your personal online investing experience an
even more rewarding one.

Sara,


As way of background, Carol has been working on an ISDA with PCES.  I had 
advised our PCES contact that I was unable to attend to this before my 
departure.  As you know,  PCES is a ""Top Ten"", therefore, you may want to 
pass this message onto to someone to handle.

FYI:  Our PCES contact is out of the office until August 2nd, but you may 
want to tackle anyway.

The PCES file can be found in the file drawers for ""green files"".  

Thanks.

Susan, 

We are definitely getting closer to bringing this ISDA agreement to a close. 
I reviewed with the Calgary office the latest draft you e-mailed; listed 
below are the remaining questions: Part 1 of the Schedule; subitem (k) with 
reference to romanette (ix) - the term ""Performance Assurance"" should be 
changed to ""Eligible Credit Assurance"" (same as in subitem (f) of Part 1). 

Part 4 of the Schedule; subitem (h) Governing Law - question was asked about 
Texas being the choice of law as opposed to New York. Our understanding is 
that the ISDA was structured under the guidance of New York law and request 
that Governing Law be changed to New York. 

Paragraph 13(c)(iv), Notification Time - request that the time be changed to 
1:00 p.m. 

Paragraph 13 - the remaining issues (listed below) will be discussed by Mr. 
Harry Wijsman in Calgary's Credit Department with Mr. Bill Bradford. These 
same issues were discussed during the ISDA negotiations with PanCanadian 
Petroleum and Enron's Canada office. The items are: 

Paragraph 13(b)(iv)(C) - Minimum Transfer Amount
Paragraph 13(g)(ii)(2) - Use of Posted Collateral
Paragraph 13(m)(i) - Material Adverse Change
Irrevocable Transfer Letter of Credit: transferability and automatic 
extension language.

Your assistance over this time period of negotiating has been appreciated 
very much. FYI: I will be leaving for vacation on Thursday, July 20 and back 
in the office on Wednesday, August 2. If you have any questions, please 
contact me at 713-331-5049. 

Best regards, 
Rick

Jeff, I am sending you the specific information of the indexes and products 
that we believe our customers would be trading on EOL.....Please take a look 
at the file attached, and the page with Index Definitions, for the 
information you are looking for. The trades will be performed based on 
indexes taht already exist in OEL, so no new Mexican Indices will be 
included.   Please note however, that the mexican gas is priced in Mexico on 
the basis of the Tetco/Valero basket. So, most probably, that same basket 
will be included in the system to accomodate to our customer's needs. 
Please note that Carol St Clair will be helping us on the legal aspects of 
including Mexico into the EOL system.
Thanks and regards.

Por otro lado para el polietileno esta la descripci?n para el LLDPE.

Trading with certain type of metals is regulated. Let us confirm that.

One possibility would be to incorporate TradeCo first the way that we have
recommended, and then amend the corporate purpose once we have ascertained
which metals could be traded without being subject to governmental
concession.

Rogelio, the new corporate purpose looks very good to me...However, as you
know, Enron has recently acquired the largest metals trader in the world
(MG), and as of next september we will be able to trade metals on the
London exchange...I want the new corporate purpose to include ""metals"" in
its definitiion....

Peggy, let us know if this is O.K. with you so we can proceed....

the contract that we enter into) .  I have also attached a document
discussing a proprietary way that we have developed to enter into tax

I've spoken with Morgan Stanley this afternoon to get details on progress

In brief, they have our ISDA documents and are in the process of reviewing 
them.  They also informed me that Enron North America was in the process of 
negotiating ISDA documents with the same MS entity.  They are going to 
provide consolidated comments to myself and Sara Shackleton in Houston during 
the course of tomorrow.

I'll liaise with Sara to ensure that this gets pushed along at top speed from

Since commercial is not pushing, we determined that it would be imprudent to

I got a copy of 2000 Definitions Annex via distribution today.  However, I 
did not know of nor do I have the 2000 Definitions, which apparently 
restated/conformed the 1991/1998 basic ISDA definitions.  Our Master still 
refs 1991, as amended etc., so it probably does pick up the 2000 issuance by 
ISDA.  Do you have the 2000?  Do we need to order?  Should we consider 
revising the master agreement in respect of the definition incorporation 
language?  Give me a call.   Mary  Thanks."

ISSUE

For a number of business reasons, a company may enter into contracts that are 
indexed to, and sometimes settled in, its own stock. Examples of these
contracts include written put options, written call options (and warrants), 
purchased put options, purchased call options, forward sale contracts, and 
forward
purchase contracts. These contracts may be settled using a variety of 
settlement methods, or the issuing company or counterparty may have a choice 
of
settlement methods. The settlement methods are:

     Physical settlement - the party designated in the contract as the buyer 
delivers the full stated amount of cash to the seller, and the seller 
delivers the full
     stated number of shares to the buyer.

     Net share settlement - the party with a loss delivers to the party with 
a gain shares with a current fair value equal to the gain.

     Net cash settlement - the party with a loss delivers to the party with a 
gain a cash payment equal to the gain, and no shares are exchanged.

The contracts described above may be either freestanding or embedded in 
another financial instrument. A freestanding contract is entered into 
separate and
apart from any of the company's other financial instruments or equity 
transactions, or it is entered into in conjunction with some other 
transaction and is legally
detachable and separately exercisable.

This Issue applies only to freestanding derivative financial instruments (for 
example, forward contracts, options, and warrants). This Issue does not apply 
to
security price guarantees or other financial instruments indexed to, or 
otherwise based on, the price of the issuer's stock that are issued in 
connection with a
purchase business combination [Note See STATUS section.], nor does it address 
the accounting for either the derivative component or the financial instrument
when the derivative component is embedded in and not detachable from the 
financial instrument. This Issue does not address the accounting for 
contracts that
are issued to compensation employees or to acquire goods or services from 
nonemployees.

The issue is how freestanding contracts that are indexed to, and potentially 
settled in, a company's own stock should be classified and measured.

EITF DISCUSSION

A. Framework for Accounting

The Task Force discussed the accounting for freestanding contracts that are 
indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own stock and reached 
several
consensuses, as described below. The consensuses in this Issue are to be 
applied to all freestanding derivative financial instruments that are indexed 
to, and
potentially settled in, a company's own stock; however, nonpublic companies 
may continue to apply the consensus in Issue No. 88-9, ""Put Warrants ,"" to the
instruments covered by that Issue. Hereinafter, the framework for accounting 
that is established in this Issue is referred to as the ""Model.""

(1) Initial balance sheet classification

The initial balance sheet classification generally is based on the concept 
that contracts that require net cash settlement are assets or liabilities and 
contracts that
require settlement in shares are equity instruments. If the contract provides 
the company with a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares, the 
Model
assumes settlement in shares; if the contract provides the counterparty with 
a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares, the Model assumes 
net cash
settlement. However, this Model is not applicable when settlement 
alternatives do not have the same economic value attached to them or when one 
of the
settlement alternatives is fixed or contains caps or floors. In those 
situations, the accounting for the instrument (or combination of instruments) 
should be based
on the economic substance of the transaction.1

          1 For example, if a freestanding contract, issued together with 
another instrument, requires that the issuer provide to the holder a fixed or
          guaranteed return such that the instruments are, insubstance, debt, 
the issuer should account for both instruments as liabilities, regardless of 
the
          settlement terms of the freestanding contract.

Accordingly, unless the economic substance indicates otherwise, contracts 
would be initially classified as equity, or as assets or liabilities, in the 
following
situations:

Equity instruments

     Contracts that require physical settlement or net share settlement

     Contracts that give the company a choice of net cash settlement or 
settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net share settlement).

Assets or liabilities

     Contracts that require net cash settlement

     Contracts that give the counterparty a choice of net cash settlement or 
settlement in shares (physical settlement or net share settlement).

(2) Initial measurement, and subsequent balance sheet classification and 
measurement

The Model requires that all instruments be initially measured at fair value 
and subsequently accounted for based on the initial classification and the 
assumed or
required settlement method in (1) above.2 Contracts that are initially 
classified as equity are accounted for in permanent equity. If physical 
settlement was
assumed or required and the company is obligated to deliver cash as part of 
the physical settlement,3 then public companies should refer to ASR 268, which
provides guidance by analogy for those transactions, and account for the 
transactions as provided below under ""Equity instruments - temporary equity.""

          2 For contracts that are classified as equity instruments that 
provide the company with a choice between either net share settlement or 
physical
          settlement that may require that the company deliver cash, net 
share settlement should be assumed. For contracts that are classified as 
equity
          instruments that provide the counterparty with a choice of either 
net share settlement or physical settlement that may require that the company
          deliver cash, physical settlement should be assumed.

          3 For example, if the company sells put options indexed to its own 
stock that enable the holder to sell shares back to the company at the strike
          price.

Equity instruments - permanent equity

     Contracts that require that the company deliver shares as part of a 
physical settlement or a net share settlement should be initially measured at 
fair value
     and reported in permanent equity. Subsequent changes in fair value 
should not be recognized.

     Contracts that give the company a choice of (a) net cash settlement or 
settlement in shares (including net share settlement, or physical settlement 
that
     requires that the company deliver shares) or (b) either net share 
settlement or physical settlement that requires that the company deliver cash 
should be
     initially measured at fair value and reported in permanent equity. 
Subsequent changes in fair value should not be recognized. If such contracts 
are
     ultimately settled in a manner that requires that the company deliver 
cash, the amount of cash paid or received should be reported as a reduction 
of, or
     an addition to, contributed capital.

Equity instruments - temporary equity4

          4 Classification and measurement in temporary equity is required 
for public companies. ASR 268 provides guidance by analogy for transactions
          classified as temporary equity.

     Contracts that (a) require that the company deliver cash as part of a 
physical settlement, (b) give the company a choice of either net cash 
settlement or
     physical settlement that requires that the company deliver cash, or (c) 
give the counterparty a choice of either net share settlement or physical 
settlement
     that requires that the company deliver cash should be initially measured 
at fair value and reported in permanent equity, and an amount equal to the 
cash
     redemption amount under the physical settlement should be transferred to 
temporary equity.

Assets or liabilities

     Contracts that are initially classified as assets or liabilities should 
be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
and disclosed
     in the financial statements. If contracts initially classified as assets 
or liabilities are ultimately settled in shares, any gains or losses on those 
contracts
     should continue to be included in earnings.

B. Hedging

The SEC Observer stated that the SEC staff has consistently held the position 
that hedge accounting is not permitted for transactions involving the 
contracts
within the scope of this Issue because those transactions have not met all 
the criteria of Statement 80. The SEC staff also believes that hedge 
accounting for
transactions involving those contracts is inconsistent with paragraph 28 of 
Opinion 9.

Because of the SEC staff's position, the Task Force decided to end its 
discussion of whether the contracts described above can qualify for hedge 
accounting.

C. Application of the Model to Specific Instruments

The following reflects several Task Force consensuses with respect to the 
application of the Model, described in Section A of this Issue, to certain 
freestanding
derivative financial instruments that are indexed to, and potentially settled 
in, a company's own stock.

(1) Written put options5 and forward purchase contracts

          5 Includes shareholder rights (SHARP rights) issued by the company 
to shareholders that give the shareholders the right to put a specified number
          of common shares to the company for cash.

Description

The company (the buyer) agrees to buy from the seller shares at a specified 
price at some future date. The contract may be settled by physical 
settlement, net
share settlement, or net cash settlement, or the issuing company or the 
counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods.6

          6 Application of the Model to purchased call options is discussed 
in C(3).

Consensus

The Model would be applied as follows:
                                                One Settlement Method

                                                                 Physical (a)
                                                                              
        Net Share

(a) Physical settlement of the contract requires that the company deliver 
cash to the holder in exchange for the shares.

(b) Classification and measurement guidance within temporary equity applies 
only to public companies.

(c) Subsequent changes in fair value should be reported in earnings and 
disclosed in the financial statements.

(d) If the contracts are ultimately settled in shares, any gains or losses on 
those contracts should continue to be included in earnings.

(e) If the contracts are ultimately physically settled by the company, 
requiring that the company deliver cash, or are ultimately settled in net 
cash, the amount of
cash paid or received should be reported as a reduction of, or as an addition 
to, contributed capital.

(f) If the contracts are ultimately settled in net cash or net shares, the 
amount reported in temporary equity should be transferred and reported as an 
addition to
permanent equity.


(2) Forward sale contracts, written call options or warrants, and purchased 
put options

Description

The issuing company (the seller) agrees to sell shares of its stock to the 
buyer of the contract at a specified price at some future date. The contract 
may be
settled by physical settlement, net share settlement, or net cash settlement, 
or the issuing company or counterparty may have a choice of settlement 
methods.

Consensus

The Model would be applied as follows:
                                                One Settlement Method

                                                                 Physical (a)

(d) If the contracts are ultimately settled in shares, any gains or losses on

(3) Purchased call options

Description

The company (the buyer) purchases call options that provide it with the 
right, but not the obligation, to buy from the seller, shares of the 
company's stock at a
specified price. If the options are exercised, the contract may be settled by 
physical settlement, net share settlement, or net cash settlement, or the 
issuing
company or the counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods.

Consensus

The company should follow the table included in (2) above in accounting for 
the call options.

(4) Detachable stock purchase warrants

Description

An enterprise issues senior subordinated notes with a detachable warrant that 
gives the holder both the right to purchase 6,250 shares of the enterprise's 
stock
for $75 per share and the right (that is, a put) to require that the 
enterprise repurchase all or any portion of the warrant for at least $2,010 
per share at a date
several months after the maturity of the notes in about 7 years.

Consensus

The proceeds should be allocated between the debt liability and the warrant 
and the resulting discount should be amortized in accordance with Opinion 21.
The warrants should be considered, in substance, debt and accounted for as a 
liability because the settlement alternatives for the warrants do not have the
same economic value attached to them and they provide the holder with a 
guaranteed return in cash that is significantly in excess of the value of the 
share
settlement alternative on the issuance date.

(5) Put warrants

Description

Put warrants are instruments with characteristics of both warrants and put 
options. The holder of the instrument is entitled to exercise (a) the warrant 
feature to
acquire the common stock of the issuer at a specified price, (b) the put 
option feature to put the instrument back to the issuer for a cash payment, 
or in some
cases, (c) both the warrant feature to acquire the common stock and the put 
option feature to put that stock back to the issuer for a cash payment. Put
warrants are frequently issued concurrently with debt securities of the 
issuer, are detachable from the debt, and may be exercisable only under 
specified
conditions. The put feature of the instrument may expire under varying 
circumstances, for example, with the passage of time or if the issuer has a 
public stock
offering. Under Opinion 14, a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of 
debt with detachable warrants must be allocated to those warrants.

Consensus

Because the contract gives the counterparty the choice of cash settlement or 
settlement in shares, public companies should report the proceeds from the
issuance of put warrants as liabilities and subsequently measure the put 
warrants at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. 
Nonpublic
companies may continue to classify and measure the put warrants in accordance 
with the consensus in Issue 88-9.

D. Earnings per Share

The Task Force reached the following consensus on how written put options 
affect the earnings-per-share calculation:

If the written put options are ""in the money"" during the period being 
reported on, the potential dilutive effect on earnings per share should be 
computed using
the reverse treasury stock method. Under that method, the incremental number 
of shares is computed as (a) the number of shares that would need to be issued
for cash at the then current market price to obtain cash to satisfy the put 
obligation less (b) the number of shares received from satisfying the puts.

The Task Force discussed whether it should comprehensively address issues 
relating to earnings per share in this Issue. The Task Force agreed that the 
FASB
should address the issues relating to earnings per share as part of its 
project on earnings per share. [Note: See STATUS section.]

STATUS

In February 1997, the FASB issued Statement 128, which supersedes Opinion 15. 
Statement 128 is effective for financial statements for both interim and
annual periods ending after December 15, 1997, and earlier application is not 
permitted.

Statement 128 affirms the consensus reached by the Task Force on how written 
put options affect the earnings per share calculation. That is, in computing
diluted EPS, Statement 128 requires use of the reverse treasury stock method 
to account for the dilutive effect of written put options and similar 
contracts that
are ""in the money"" during the reporting period. Statement 128 states that 
purchased options should not be reflected in the computation of diluted EPS 
because
to do so would be antidilutive. At the July 23 and November 18-19, 1998 
meetings, an FASB staff representative made an announcement (Topic No. D-72,
""Effects of Contracts That May Be Settled in Stock or Cash on the Computation 
of Diluted Earnings per Share "") that for those contracts that provide the
company with a choice of settlement methods, the company shall assume that 
the contract will be settled in shares. That presumption may be overcome if 
past
experience or a stated policy provides a reasonable basis to believe that it 
is probable that the contract will be paid partially or wholly in cash. For 
contracts in
which the counterparty controls the means of settlement, past experience or a 
stated policy is not determinative. Accordingly, in those situations, the more
dilutive of cash or share settlement should be used.

At the July 23-24, 1997 meeting, the Task Force addressed the accounting for 
contingent consideration issued to effect a purchase business combination in
Issue No. 97-8. ""Accounting for Contingent Consideration Issued in a Purchase 
Business Combination ."" The Task force observed that Issue 96-13 should
be applied to freestanding contracts that are indexed to, and potentially 
settled in, a company's own stock if those instruments meet the criteria in 
Issue 97-8
for recording as part of the cost of the business acquired in a purchase 
business combination.

A related issue has been discussed in Issue No. 98-12, ""The Application of 
Issue No. 96-13 to Forward Equity Sales Transactions ."" That Issue deals with
the accounting and earnings per share treatment of situations in which a 
freestanding derivative instrument (a forward contract) that is indexed to, 
and
potentially settled in, a company's own stock is issued concurrent with the 
issuance of shares of the company's stock. This Issue is limited to 
situations in which
the party to whom the common stock was sold is also the counterparty to the 
forward contract.

Another related issue has been discussed in Issue No. 99-1, ""Accounting for 
Debt Convertible into the Stock of a Consolidated Subsidiary ."" That Issue
deals with the accounting in the consolidated financial statements for debt 
issued by a consolidated subsidiary or a parent company that is convertible 
into the
stock of a consolidated subsidiary. As part of the discussion of Issue 99-1, 
Task Force members agreed to consider further whether to clarify this Issue by
indicating that equity shares of any entity under the control of the 
consolidated entity are considered ""a company's own stock.""

A related issue was discussed at the May 19-20, 1999 meeting in Issue No. 
99-3, ""Application of Issue No. 96-13 to Derivative Instruments with Multiple
Settlement Alternatives ."" That Issue deals with how certain derivative 
contracts indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own stock that 
contain
multiple settlement alternatives should be accounted for.

The Task Force discussed another related issue in Issue No. 99-7, ""Accounting 
for an Accelerated Share Repurchase Program ."" That Issue addressed the
accounting for, and pooling-of-interests implications of, purchasing treasury 
stock and simultaneously entering into a forward contract indexed to the
company's own shares.

At the March 16, 2000 meeting, the Task Force discussed a related issue in 
Issue No. 00-6, ""Accounting for Freestanding Derivative Financial Instruments
Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, the Stock of a Consolidated 
Subsidiary ."" That Issue addresses how freestanding derivative instruments 
entered into
by a parent company that are indexed to, and potentially settled in, the 
stock of a consolidated subsidiary should be classified and measured in the
consolidated financial statements.

Another related issue was discussed at the March 16, 2000 meeting in Issue 
No. 00-7, ""Application of Issue No. 96-13 to Equity Derivative Instruments 
That
Contain Certain Provisions That Require Net Cash Settlement If Certain Events 
outside the Control of the Issuer Occur ."" That Issue deals with how certain
derivative contracts indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own 
stock that require a cash payment by the issuer upon the occurrence of future
events outside the control of the issuer should be accounted for.

No further EITF discussion is planned."

EITF Issue No. 00-7, ""Application of EITF Issue No. 96-13 to Equity=20
Derivative Transactions That Contain Certain Provisions That Require Cash=
=20
Settlement If Certain Events Occur ."" The final consensus in Issue 00-7=20
generally stated that equity derivative contracts that contained provisions=
=20
that implicitly or explicitly required net cash settlement outside of the=
=20
control of the company must be treated as assets and liabilities and carrie=
d=20
at fair value rather than equity instruments carried at original cost and=
=20
reported as part of permanent equity as provided for in EITF Issue No. 96-1=
3,=20
""Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentiall=
y=20
Settled in, a Company's Own Stock .""

The Task Force also tentatively provided an extended transition period for=
=20
existing contracts and contracts entered into before a final consensus is=
=20
reached. The goal is to reach a final consensus at the September 2000 EITF=
=20
meeting.

The Model=20

The model=01,s governing concept is that, for a contract to be accounted as=
=20
permanent equity, the contract's provisions should put the company=01,s=20
counterparty in no better position than the company=01,s common shareholder=
s.=20
Specifically, the EITF tentatively concluded that contracts in a company=01=
,s=20
own stock, such as written puts or forward purchase contracts, that come=20
under the scope of Issue 96-13 and have net share settlement provisions tha=
t=20
keep a contract from being classified as an asset or liability must have th=
e=20
following characteristics =01* otherwise the contract must be treated as an=
=20
asset or liability at fair value with changes in fair value reported=20
currently in earnings.

The contract must permit the company to settle net in shares, at its option=
,=20
in either registered or unregistered shares. (It was determined that the=20
ability to deliver registered shares was outside of the control of a compan=
y.)
The contract must contain an explicit cap on the number of shares to be=20
delivered in a net share settlement. This cap must exist even if the contra=
ct=20
terminates when the stock price reaches a stated price trigger. (The need f=
or=20
a cap was determined to be critical in determining whether a company had=20
sufficient authorized and unissued shares to settle the contract.)
At contract inception and on an ongoing basis, the company must have=20
sufficient authorized but unissued shares available to settle the contract=
=20
considering all other claims on authorized shares for stock options,=20
convertibles, and other transactions that may require the issuance of stock=
.=20
(This requirement was deemed critical as the ability to have a request for=
=20
additional authorized shares approved by the shareholders was deemed outsid=
e=20
of the control of the company. In this context, ""the company"" is defined as=
=20
the company's management rather than its management and shareholders.)
There is no requirement in the contract to post collateral at any point in=
=20
the contract or for any reason.
There are no required cash payments to the counterparty (true-ups) if the n=
et=20
shares initially delivered are insufficient to provide the counterparty wit=
h=20
full satisfaction of the amount due. However, true-ups may be included in t=
he=20
contract if the company only, not the counterparty, can choose whether to=
=20
satisfy the true-up in shares or cash and the true-up is subject to the=20
explicit cap discussed in item 2.
There is no economic penalty in the contract for net share settlement that=
=20
would economically compel the company to settle in net cash. (The right to=
=20
increase the number of shares delivered based on the fair value differentia=
l=20
between registered shares and unregistered shares was not deemed to be a=20
penalty.)
There are no provisions in the contract that would indicate the counterpart=
y=20
had creditor rights, or would otherwise contravene the objective of this=20
model that the counterparty=01,s rights would rank no higher than those of =
a=20
common shareholder. (Subject to future EITF discussions, it may be possible=
=20
to meet this criterion by having a legal letter addressing the issue or a=
=20
specific statement of this concept in the contract.)

Related Issues

There was also discussion of the provisions relating to termination and=20
settlement in the event of a merger or change in control. There was general=
=20
support for a position that, as long as the counterparty received the same=
=20
choice of compensation as other shareholders (for example, stock for stock,=
=20
stock and cash for stock, cash for stock), the fact that the counterparty=
=20
might receive cash in such circumstances would not preclude equity treatmen=
t=20
for the contract.

Similarly, in the event of nationalization or liquidation, a net cash=20
settlement of the same type afforded a common shareholder would not preclud=
e=20
equity treatment for the contract.

In addition, counterparty rights that did not exceed rights of common=20
shareholders should be acceptable, for example, rights to sue for damages i=
n=20
the event of misrepresentations or a breach of warrranties or if a company=
=20
simply refused to perform under the contract, as long as a common sharehold=
er=20
would also have those rights.

With respect to events that would cause a contract that was compliant with=
=20
the model at inception to later become noncompliant (for example, because a=
n=20
acquisition consumed enough authorized shares that otherwise were needed to=
=20
satisfy the contract), the EITF concluded that, at the time the contract is=
=20
no longer compliant, the fair value of the contract should be transferred=
=20
from equity to an asset or liability at fair value with prospective changes=
=20
in fair value reported currently in earnings. There would be no immediate=
=20
earnings effect at the time of this transfer.

Further, if, at a later date, sufficient shares were authorized to again=20
satisfy the contract, the carrying amount of the contract (that is, its fai=
r=20
value) would be transferred back to equity and the contract treated as equi=
ty=20
prospectively to the extent the contract continues to comply with the model=
.=20
(The company would not be permitted to reverse the gains and losses in fair=
=20
value recognized in earnings during the period the contract was treated as =
an=20
asset or liability.)

Transition

The EITF tentatively concluded that all contracts entered into after the da=
te=20
of a final consensus will have to comply with the model at contract incepti=
on=20
to achieve equity treatment. (The goal is to reach a final consensus at the=
=20
September 2000 EITF meeting.) For contracts entered into before the date of=
 a=20
final consensus, a company will have until June 30, 2001, to modify the=20
contract to comply with the final consensus.

For example, if a company entered into a contract before the date of the=20
final consensus, the company will have until June 30, 2001, to obtain any=
=20
shareholder authorization of shares needed to satisfy the criteria or to=20
modify their contract for the other criteria or any EITF changes to the=20
tentative model.

Since a variety of viewpoints are discussed at Emerging Issues Task Force=
=20
(EITF) meetings and it is often difficult to characterize the conclusions,=
=20
the following minutes may differ in some respects from the final minutes=20
available from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).

Bob and Sara -

 As we discussed, I enclose the cover page from the lengthy CFTC
policy paper relating to regulation of Ag Options.  This paper was never
approved by the full Commission and does not represent CFTC policy.  I also
enclose:

 (i) An outline of the application for designation as a contract
market (a recent example is the application of BrokerTec Futures Exchange
LLC, published at 65 F.R. 36667 (June 9, 2000));

 (ii) Excerpts from a report by the General Accounting Office
discussing issues relating to the reauthorization of the CFTC (May 1999).
(This represents much of the seed work for S. 2679 and deals with certain of
the issues we discussed yesterday.); and

 (iii) Introductory notes to CFTC revisions to its Rules relating
to agricultural trade options (December 6, 1999).

The exemption we discussed was for an entity called SwapClear, referred to
in the GAO report.  During one of our conversations, Bob referred to
multilateral transaction execution facilities.  The Commission has proposed
regulations on this subject.  They are reported at 65 F.R. 38985 (June 22,
2000) (CCH Commodity Futures Law Reporter paragraph 28,153).

Regards.

- Larry

Here's my stab at the Product Long Description.



Sara - please review and offer your comments.

RAC - I need a Sigma Factor, please.

William - I have built a test Product in the Product Manager and it appears 
to have worked okay. I have asked David Forster to review the description as 
well as the attributes that I built in TEST. I will begin to build this in 
Production once I have his and Sara's sign-off. David will also be checking 
on the issue that I mentioned to you about the number of characters that can 
be put in the Volume and Price feilds in the Stack Manager. This is the one 
thing that could really hold up the process, so we may want to think about 
alternatives (such as trading in 10,000 increments - so that 5 means 50,000; 
50 means 500,000; etc) 

Jennifer Denney will be contacting Clara Carrington to talk to her about how 
Clara will see trades come over in the EOL Bridge Monitor.

Things are progessing relatively well so far, with the exception of the issue 
of the character limitation.

Hi, Clem!  Please see below message from Sheila Glover.  I believe that in 
the past ENE has only issued a guaranty to Paribas, ED&F Mann and Bank One in 
connection with ENA's futures/special margin arrangements.  I'll be speaking 
with Paul Radous in credit.  Do you see any issues here?  Sara

Subject: Margin leverage and Enron Guarantee

Bill and Sara,
We have been talking with Goldman Sachs, one of ECT Investment's prime 
brokers,  about ways to reduce our margin requirement and gain greater 
leverage.  Goldman suggested that we may want to consider putting an Enron 
Guaranttee in place.  

We also have a prime broker agreement with Morgan Stanley.  Per the 
documentation that I have... I do not see a guarantte with Morgan Stanley.

1) Can you confirm that no guarantee exists with either Goldman or Morgan?
2) Any comments regarding a Goldman guarantee by Enron Corp for ECT 
Investments Inc.?

Thanks, Sheila

I've spoken with Morgan Stanley this afternoon to get details on progress 
with the ISDA for credit trading.

In brief, they have our ISDA documents and are in the process of reviewing 
them.  They also informed me that Enron North America was in the process of 
negotiating ISDA documents with the same MS entity.  They are going to 
provide consolidated comments to myself and Sara Shackleton in Houston during 
the course of tomorrow.

I'll liaise with Sara to ensure that this gets pushed along at top speed from 
the Enron end.

Thanks, Edmund

Tana,

Before Carol St. Clair left for maternity leave, she was working on the 
assignment of some financial and gas deals with Christopher Smith (who 
previously worked in our group).  Since Christopher is no longer here and 
with Carol being out, I'm scrambling to find out who in the financial team is 
working on this.

I've left Mark Taylor a message since Carol's voice mail forwards all 
questions to Mark.

Could you let me know if you have any info?

Thx,
Tracyh

Sara,

The following items are outstanding issues with respect to the 
above-referenced ISDA:

1. Arizona Public Service Company plans on executing the ISDA as Arizona 
Public Service Company, on behalf of its Bulk Power Marketing Resource 
Operations Division (""BPMROD"").  It is APSC's intent in the future to create 
a new entity for this division, such new entity to enter into all trading 
transactions.  As a result, it is ASPC's desire to  modify the definition of 
""Specified Transaction"" to only include transactions between Party A and 
BPMROD.

2. Procedures for Entering into Transactions - ASPC would like 5 days to 
dispute or accept confirmations.  Apparently, all of their agreements provide 
for 5 days, therefore any shorter time period could cause problems for them.  
I had previously offered 3 days.

3. Part 5 (f) Recording - ASPC wants to consent to recordings on ""trading 
lines only"".  They do not want to consent to officers (non-traders) being 
recorded if the communication does not occur on a trading line.

4. Part 5 (g)(B) - Setoff -  ASPC wants to delete ""or any of its Affiliates"" 
from this section.  ASPC thinks this issue is related to their issue in #1 
above.  I don't see why.  What do you think?  I assume that we are not 
willing to strike ""or any of its Affiliates"".

The only other issue is a credit issue which I am handling with Paul Radous.  
So, we're close.  Let me know what you think.

Jason

Carol:  Hope all is well.  We are missing you every day.

(1)  On a ""swap"" related note, we have a Canadian party requesting the 
ability to post cash collateral to ENA.  Can you recall where we left off on 
the issue?  I seem to  remember conflicting advice (Peter's insistence upon 
the Stikeman memo and ENA simply not agreeing to accept cash) and uncertainty 
as to how ENA could perfect its interest and what law governs (in cash held 
in a U.S. account).

(2)  On a ""credit"" related note, I was forwarded the 7/24/00 Margin Exception 
Report (originally sent to your attention).  What were you doing to follow up 
on this report?  Yesterday, Mary gave me a copy of a ""collateral letter"" 
being sent by Molly Harris.  Did you speak with Mary about working on this 
project in your absence?

Edward Ondarza is moving to EBS.   Stephanie Panus starts on Monday.  That's 
all the news for now.
 
Talk to you soon.  Sara

P.S.  Can you send photos over the net?"

Clint:  after the meeting, Jim advised me that the ENE board resolution will 
be drafted for the Oct. meeting.  In the interim, he is convinced that only 
Enron Corp. should be a swap party to these equity swaps, forwards, etc.  I 
am going to speak with Rod Nelson (credit) and make some changes to our 
approach.  This should also make life easier negotiating with Lehman and Bear 
(from a credit perspecttive) but we'll reach an obvious stalemate when they 
ask for an Enron Corp. resolution (forthcoming after the relevant board 
meeting.  Sara"

Everybody,

Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline 
call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to 
know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of 
Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they 
were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for 
Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the 
status of the master.

Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know 
if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct 
his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling 
this and pass the info on.

Ken:  In connection with our new product (and  absence of any physical 
activity in that product), I have the following question:

If neither ENA nor its counterparty is able to qualify as an offeree for 
purposes of the Trade Option Exemption (17 CFR Sec. 32.13, as amended) but 
each is an eligible swap participant (or better yet, each party has $10 
million in net worth as per Sec. 32.13) can the option still be exempt from 
CFTC regulation under the Swap Policy Statement or any CFTC interpretive 
letters?

I have concerns about not relying fully on the Trade Option Exemption but I 
also understood that the CFTC has informally said that the Swap Policy 
Statement provides a safe harbor for both swaps and options.

I am available to speak at your convenience.  Thanks.  Sara [713/853-5620] "

Sara, Samantha,
I spoke with Guillaume this morning.  He suggested that we do the PrimeTrade 
Access Agreement first.  This allows us to get the CD for the PrimeTrade 
application  and to install it on a  PC here, roll it out to the traders, and 
have CSFB come in for trainng.
At the same time we can complete the clearing agreement.
We will not do the give up agreement.  If we decide we can do easily in the 
future.
Guillaume suggested that you call him if you have any questions.  He will be 
happy to facilitate.

Sara,

here is online (web based) convertible trading site hat I could use - kindof 
like an online broker where they match up buyers and sellers.  I take it that 
before we enter to any agreement with them you need to approve it all.  

 I have not looked at this document yet, so please feel free to make any 
comments you may have.

I recently joined Jeff Kinneman's group and have been asked to participate in

agreements / legal issues related to the Buy Side Direct site or its parent 
Intelligent Markets ?  Could I get an update on the status of this review and 
any outstanding issues ?

The attached confirm is a swap.  There is no need for a rep in the confirm.  
If a weather deal is structured as an option, Gordon Heaney (backed by Diane 
Anderson) who confirms weather transactions, adds the weather-specific Trade 
Option rep into the confirmation.  The desk uses a template for options.  Let 
me know if you have any other questions.  Sara

From the contract specification documentation provided by the OM to us I 
would say that for the ""pulpex futures contract"", reference to the term
""Daily Settlement Price"" is the same as reference to ""daily closing price"" or 
""last traded price"" for the Pulpex Futures Contract after reading contract 
specification section 2.1.13 of their documentation.  The OM simply defines 
it as the last traded price on each business day.  However, ""Daily Settlment 
Price"" for the pulpex options contract per contract specification 2.2.6 
defines it as the mid price of the closing bid and offer price.  
Give me your fax number and I'll send the documentation to you for review.

That being said I think your floating price language is OK and we should move 
forward in order to close the books on this one.

Thanks for your help.

Sara,

I am working with Jeff Kabel in the Buenos Aires Office, pitching our risk 
management capabilities. We are focusing on the Power market and the Liquids 
market in BA. 
In this regard we have contacted Perez Companc, active both in Oil trading 
and Power Generation, and as a result we have a possibility of structuring 
some options on power with them.
I will like to ask you which is our situation as regards ISDA documentation 
with Perez. Do we have one signed with them ? What needs to be done to have 
it ?

I have received from them a copy of the credit support and schedule and will 
forward it to you.

Regards,

Bernardo

With respect to agricultural trade options, the CFTC has specifically said 
that the swaps exemtion and the swaps policy statement are not available.  I 
will call you.

>>> <Sara.Shackleton@enron.com> 08/04 11:52 AM >>>

Ken:  In connection with our new product (and  absence of any physical 
activity
in that product), I have the following question:

If neither ENA nor its counterparty is able to qualify as an offeree for
purposes of the Trade Option Exemption (17 CFR Sec. 32.13, as amended) but 
each
is an eligible swap participant (or better yet, each party has $10 million in
net worth as per Sec. 32.13) can the option still be exempt from CFTC 
regulation
under the Swap Policy Statement or any CFTC interpretive letters?

I have concerns about not relying fully on the Trade Option Exemption but I 
also
understood that the CFTC has informally said that the Swap Policy Statement
provides a safe harbor for both swaps and options.

I am available to speak at your convenience.  Thanks.  Sara [713/853-5620]

Sara,

I think we must mention the following as the source of the index price for 
energy: ""Documento de Transacciones Economicas"" (DTE). This is an electronic 
document published by Cammesa, and is available to all participants of the 
Wholesale Electric Market in Argentina. It's a summary of all the economic 
transactions between the participants of the Wholesale Electric Market 
(Generators, Transmission Co, Distributors, Marketers and End Users).

This DTE is published around the 5th or 6th day of each month and reports all 
transactions for the previous month. It is accessed by calling into Cammesa's 
server and replicating the corresponding database.

The attached word file shows you different screens of this electronic 
document. The second zipped file is the DTE for June.

(See attached file: IndexView.doc)(See attached file: dte9906.zip)

Have a look at it and give me a call if you have any questions.

Regards, Julian

Sara,

Since P&G is a mammoth bureacracy and I am dealing with a new business 
contact, can you check your files and provide me the name of their

Thanks.

Subject: FX Transactions

We received the attached from Sullivan & Cromwell re the FX business and the 
possibilities of using a US companyn which company to use for contract 
purposes. At a meeting here at MG today, the consensus/preference was not to 
use a UK company as we have no full ISD (chapter 10) firm nor the wish to 
change MG's status.

Per the advice from S&C, we like the idea of using a US corporation with a UK 
""arranger"" to cover any UK regulatory issues that arise. Dependent on where 
the business will end up (I understand to be discussed by Gary Hickerson/Mike 
Hutchinson 18th August), the following appears to be the among the logical 
solutions:

1. Contractual entity - either Enron North America, MG London Inc or Newco 
Inc.
2. Arranger - either EEFT Ltd, Metallgesellschaft Ltd or MG Brokers Ltd 
(depending on the effect on their chapter 3 status for the last two).

The current customer base consists of entities in the US, Canada, France, UK 
and Switzerland.

Please advise on any group/tax issues that can affect the final decision. If 
you need any further information, please let me know.

Many thanks.

Jon,

I had a glance over the written paper from Sullivan & Cromwell as to FX 
Transactions, and it seems to me that there would be fewer US regulatory 
issues (should there be any), if we were to use MG Brokers Inc, the FCM 
entity.  Are there any other reasons why we would not want to use this entity?

[Mark/Alan/Marcus - I have separately sent you by email the Sullivan & 
Cromwell paper]

Get ready...decimalization is coming soon!

Dear SARAH:

To bring the U.S. securities markets in line with foreign markets and
make the pricing easier to understand, the Securities Industry
Association and the Securities and Exchange Commission have agreed to
convert the existing U.S. stock and exchange-traded options markets
from fraction to decimal-based pricing. The SEC has recently mandated
that this project be initiated no later than September 5, 2000.

As of this date, it hasn't been decided whether stocks will be traded
in nickel or penny increments. The NYSE will begin testing the decimal
system in September with a group of 50 stocks traded to the penny,
while all others will continue to be quoted in fractions. To ensure
that the transition progresses smoothly, with no disruption to the
functioning of the market, other stocks and options will convert
gradually to decimal pricing over a period of six months.

What this means to you as an E*TRADE customer:

Decimalization means you'll soon see the prices for stocks and options
quoted the same way they are at the grocery store or the gas station:
$20.50 (not $20-1/2) and $35.25 (not $35-1/4). By April 1, 2001, every
price you see on your trade confirmations, statements, on the E*TRADE
Web site, in the newspapers, and on the stock tickers on television
will be expressed in decimals.

E*TRADE is prepared to do everything possible to make this transition
from fractions to decimals a smooth one. Beginning in August, we will
post more information about the conversion to decimal pricing on our
Web site. Please check regularly for updates.

As always, thank you for investing with E*TRADE. We look forward to
serving you for many years to come.

Sincerely,

Suzi White
E*TRADE Vice President, Service Quality

Subject: Re: Foreign Exchange from a US entity  

David

The US entity we're considering at the moment is an FCM, regulated by the 
CFTC and which is a member of NYMEX/COMEX. It currently clears the NY 
exchanges metals business for the group. It will probably be utilised to 
clear the NY exchange energy business following the Enron tie up. It may 
assist in clearing CSCE business but is unlikely at this stage to be looking 
to be a CSCE exchange member. 

It currently has capital of $2 million and subordinated debt of $20 million. 
Profits are generally paid out in the form of a dividend so although it may 
have a small amount of retained profit it won't be material. Currently it has 
about $10 million of regulatory capital requirements.

Depending on your advice, we may consider an un-regulated company with, at 
the moment, not very much capital. This latter point could be rectified, 
either with subordinated debt or capital injection. The EFP customer 
facilities (approximately 50% of the business) may prohibit this.

I hope this is enough info.

Best regards.

Jon

Thanks.  I will prepare a memo.  One question on your e-mail -- can you give 
me a bit more information about the US entity that will be the FX dealer?  
For example, is it currently regulated in any respect?  Is it, or will it be, 
engaged in any other businesses?  How large is it in terms of assets or net 
worth?  Thanks.  I'll get back to you soon.

Further to our recent telephone conversation, we would be grateful if you 
would
give us a brief written summary on the regulatory and/or legal issues 
governing
a US corporation transacting foreign exchange with US and non-US customers. My
basic understanding of our telephone conversation was that, as a non-bank,
neither the Fed, the SEC nor the CFTC have any jurisdiction. However the
Commodities Exchange Act prohibits us from contracting with certain types of
counterparties.

The potential business we are looking at currently covers outright foreign
exchange with counterparties such as banks, securities houses, funds, 
corporates
and, possibly, high net worth individuals. The business also covers the
provision of EFP facilities for these customers whereby they ultimately 
receive
a currency futures position on the IMM division of the CME or on FINEX. This
latter area is one where, from the Exchanges' points of view, we would
effectively be acting as an executing broker.

I hope this brief description is enough for you to be able to respond but if 
you
have any questions or would like further clarification, you can contact me by
e-mail or by telephone on +44 20 7265 5421.

Thank you for your help in this.

Kind regards.

We have decided NOT to proceed with the swap agreement.  Enron and Shell will
each write a guaranty in favor of TBS for their pro rata share of the negative
difference between the gas price received and gas price paid resulting from 
the
differential in the gas price escalators.  Any positive difference in TBS's
favor will run through the TBS accounts to the TBS distribution account and,
subject to the blocking test in the Accts and Disbursement Agmt, will then be
distributed to E & S.
Dean & John: Can you propose a draft guaranty for internal review?  Once we're
happy with it we can send it to Shell for their consideration/sign-off.  
Thanks.

Subject:  Swap Agreement




I am sending this e-mail message to address several issues related to the
swap and to circulate a proposed confirmation for your consideration.

Before addressing the swap, however, I should note that it is not clear to
me that the project team has finally decided to proceed with a swap rather
than a guaranty.  If we are not, I would appreciate someone letting me know
so that we can stop this process.

Comments on the Draft Schedule:

     1.  Part 1(a) ""Specified Entity"":  A Specified Entity is an entity
other than the parties whose actions can cause an event of default or a
termination event.  The draft schedule does not contemplate a Specified
Entity.  I think we should consider whether EPE and/or SCG should be a
Specified Entity with respect to TBS.

     2.  Part 1(b) ""Threshold Amount"": proposes $1,000,000 for TBS, which
seems low given that Enron Corp. is backing it up.

     3.  Part 1(h) ""Additional Event of Default"":  If we use a swap
arrangement, there will be two: one for 72.5% between TBS and ECT, and one
for 27.5% between TBS and a Shell entity.  If that is the case, do we want
an additional event of default under which a sale by Shell of its interest
in TBS could result in termination?

     4.  Part 2  ""Representations"":  I think that we need someone in tax
to determine whether TBS can make the representations.

     5.  Part 4(d) & (e) ""Credit Support Provider"": Shell will be the
credit support provider under the other swap arrangement, not this one.

     6.  Part 4(g) ""Governing Law"", 4(h) ""Arbitration"": The schedule
proposes Texas law with AAA arbitration to be held in Texas.  It would seem
to me that we would want to use arbitration procedures that are similar to
those in the gas supply agreements, with ICC arbitration, held in Miami,
under New York, with joint arbitration if the same issue arises under one of
the gas supply arrangements (such as the proper calculation of price).

Comment on the Proposed Confirmation:

     I have reproduced the gas supply pricing provisions from the EPE Gas
Supply Agreement under the ""Fixed Amount Details"" but have not done so under
the ""Floating Amount Details"", which cross-references the provisions of the
SCG Gas Supply Agreement, because of the length of those provisions.

     Please let me know if you have any reactions to the above comments
or any comments on the attached confirmation.  I will contact Nasim to
discuss the process for pushing the swaps (or, alternatively, guaranties) to
completion.

Regards, Dean

Subject: Foreign Exchange from a US entity

David

Further to our recent telephone conversation, we would be grateful if you 
would give us a brief written summary on the regulatory and/or legal issues 
governing a US corporation transacting foreign exchange with US and non-US 
customers. My basic understanding of our telephone conversation was that, as 
a non-bank, neither the Fed, the SEC nor the CFTC have any jurisdiction. 
However the Commodities Exchange Act prohibits us from contracting with 
certain types of counterparties.

The potential business we are looking at currently covers outright foreign 
exchange with counterparties such as banks, securities houses, funds, 
corporates and, possibly, high net worth individuals. The business also 
covers the provision of EFP facilities for these customers whereby they 
ultimately receive a currency futures position on the IMM division of the CME 
or on FINEX. This latter area is one where, from the Exchanges' points of 
view, we would effectively be acting as an executing broker.

I hope this brief description is enough for you to be able to respond but if 
you have any questions or would like further clarification, you can contact 
me by e-mail or by telephone on +44 20 7265 5421.

Thank you for your help in this.

Kind regards.

Jon Barrett

differs from that sent to several of you last week in that there are now

Subject: FX Transactions

We received the attached from Sullivan & Cromwell re the FX business and the 
possibilities of using a US companyn which company to use for contract 
purposes. At a meeting here at MG today, the consensus/preference was not to 
use a UK company as we have no full ISD (chapter 10) firm nor the wish to 
change MG's status.

Per the advice from S&C, we like the idea of using a US corporation with a UK 
""arranger"" to cover any UK regulatory issues that arise. Dependent on where 
the business will end up (I understand to be discussed by Gary Hickerson/Mike 
Hutchinson 18th August), the following appears to be the among the logical 
solutions:

1. Contractual entity - either Enron North America, MG London Inc or Newco 
Inc.
2. Arranger - either EEFT Ltd, Metallgesellschaft Ltd or MG Brokers Ltd 
(depending on the effect on their chapter 3 status for the last two).

The current customer base consists of entities in the US, Canada, France, UK 
and Switzerland.

Please advise on any group/tax issues that can affect the final decision. If 
you need any further information, please let me know.

Many thanks.

Sara,

Thanks for your message.  Perhaps we can speak over the next day or so.  

As far as MG's business is concerned from NYC and the US, the legal support 
will be managed from Houston (Alan Aronowitz and Marcus Nettelton)  - I 
believe they will shortly be visiting NYC.

I would very much appreciate your support re: other legal issues, CFTC, etc

Thanks.
Justin

I am not aware of the nuances of copper trading!  However, I left a message 
earlier this morning to find out from the MG lawyer.  I haven't heard back.  
The deal ticket should provide for the premium payment date and, if not, I 
would use our standard language.  Sara

On copper option trades, do you know when the premium is usually due?  Does

Our understanding is that FX traded from the US is effectively unregulated. 
If we use MG London Inc, there would be the possibility that the CFTC would 
have some type of oversight on the unregulated business. Only the posting of 
the IMM EFPs needs to be done through the FCM.

There are other practical issues here in that that MG London Inc currently 
lacks the infrastructure needed to do the outright FX business as it has no 
bank FX lines and no bank accounts for all the currencies. There are other 
issues where the main settlements/back office expertise is here in London. 
These are obviously not insurmountable but we need to do a lot of work to get 
either MG London Inc or, for example, MG Newco Inc ready for the business. Is 
there an angle for using Enron North America, for example, as I understand 
they already have existing FX lines and settlements or would that be a 
non-starter? There are currently some UK and EU customers on Wolff's books 
who would need to be routed via an SFA regulated arranger. Will we be able to 
use EEFT for this?

Jon,

I had a glance over the written paper from Sullivan & Cromwell as to FX 
Transactions, and it seems to me that there would be fewer US regulatory 
issues (should there be any), if we were to use MG Brokers Inc, the FCM 
entity.  Are there any other reasons why we would not want to use this entity?

[Mark/Alan/Marcus - I have separately sent you by email the Sullivan & 
Cromwell paper]

Subject: FX Transactions

We received the attached from Sullivan & Cromwell re the FX business and the 
possibilities of using a US companyn which company to use for contract 
purposes. At a meeting here at MG today, the consensus/preference was not to 
use a UK company as we have no full ISD (chapter 10) firm nor the wish to 
change MG's status.

Per the advice from S&C, we like the idea of using a US corporation with a UK 
""arranger"" to cover any UK regulatory issues that arise. Dependent on where 
the business will end up (I understand to be discussed by Gary Hickerson/Mike 
Hutchinson 18th August), the following appears to be the among the logical 
solutions:

1. Contractual entity - either Enron North America, MG London Inc or Newco 
Inc.
2. Arranger - either EEFT Ltd, Metallgesellschaft Ltd or MG Brokers Ltd 
(depending on the effect on their chapter 3 status for the last two).

The current customer base consists of entities in the US, Canada, France, UK 
and Switzerland.

Please advise on any group/tax issues that can affect the final decision. If 
you need any further information, please let me know.

Many thanks.

Subject: Re: Foreign Exchange from a US entity  

David

The US entity we're considering at the moment is an FCM, regulated by the 
CFTC and which is a member of NYMEX/COMEX. It currently clears the NY 
exchanges metals business for the group. It will probably be utilised to 
clear the NY exchange energy business following the Enron tie up. It may 
assist in clearing CSCE business but is unlikely at this stage to be looking 
to be a CSCE exchange member. 

It currently has capital of $2 million and subordinated debt of $20 million. 
Profits are generally paid out in the form of a dividend so although it may 
have a small amount of retained profit it won't be material. Currently it has 
about $10 million of regulatory capital requirements.

Depending on your advice, we may consider an un-regulated company with, at 
the moment, not very much capital. This latter point could be rectified, 
either with subordinated debt or capital injection. The EFP customer 
facilities (approximately 50% of the business) may prohibit this.

I hope this is enough info.

Best regards.

Jon

Further to our recent telephone conversation, we would be grateful if you 
would
give us a brief written summary on the regulatory and/or legal issues 
governing
a US corporation transacting foreign exchange with US and non-US customers. My
basic understanding of our telephone conversation was that, as a non-bank,
neither the Fed, the SEC nor the CFTC have any jurisdiction. However the
Commodities Exchange Act prohibits us from contracting with certain types of
counterparties.

The potential business we are looking at currently covers outright foreign
exchange with counterparties such as banks, securities houses, funds, 
corporates
and, possibly, high net worth individuals. The business also covers the
provision of EFP facilities for these customers whereby they ultimately 
receive
a currency futures position on the IMM division of the CME or on FINEX. This
latter area is one where, from the Exchanges' points of view, we would
effectively be acting as an executing broker.

I hope this brief description is enough for you to be able to respond but if 
you
have any questions or would like further clarification, you can contact me by
e-mail or by telephone on +44 20 7265 5421.

Thank you for your help in this.

it is the London credit group, we need to verify authority to execute.  I

Have you followed up on our solution of sending cash in respect of our

Mark:  I scheduled a meeting with you at 4:30 pm today to discuss the MG 
acquisition, in particular, MG London, Inc. (a U.S REGULATED NYMEX clearing 
member, FCM, CTA).  NO ONE is looking into this from a US regulatory/legal 
perspective and I think it should be the swap group.  Enron's ""regulated"" 
product areas are metals (since MG clears its own trades on the NYMEX/COMEX 
and has FCM/CTA status) and potentially agriculture if we (some Enron entity) 
choose to become a regulated ""ATOM"" (ag trade option merchant).  From a legal 
perspective, I think we should have a ""whitepaper"" drafted by Sullivan & 
Cromwell, and, it should include an analysis of the MG London, Inc. existing 
situation.  This would tie into the ag regulation.  Also, have you thought 
about ENA and MG as NYMEX members and whether we keep both designations, 
whether we move all/part of ENA's existing clearing business to MG (and 
perhaps eliminate the need for margin/brokering arrangements such as Paribas, 
etc.) and any other related issues?  For efficiency purposes, Donna Lowry has 
asked to join us.  Donna and I had a conference call this morning with 
Justin, Paul, Jon Barrett, Sheila Glover and Trena McFarland to figure out 
who's on first (with MG).

Also, I am attaching an update of my workload.  I have reached the breaking 
point and I need more help (even with Jason's help on brokerage agreements 
the new electronic trading platform agreements are reaching multiple 
proportions with a new request for agreements for ENA, ECT Investments and 
EnronCredit.com London).  Gareth and Craig Clark want to meet today about the 
prepay (Delta/Citibank) and I REALLY need help on the Global Finance side.

See you later.  Sara

Dayal/HOU/ECT@ECT
		 Subject: Online Trading Platforms

I am requesting that online trading agreements be executed with the following 
bond trading platforms which we are evaluating:

         Site   Initial Corporate Bond Categories *       Type  Site Status

Buy Side Direct   Convertibles (+ Equity Hedge)  ** Cross Matching  Aug 15th 
Launch

Trading Edge / Bond Link High Yield, Convertibles   Cross Matching  Live

LIMITrader   High Yield, Convertibles   Cross Matching  Live

Market Axess   Investment Grade   Multi-Dealer ***  August Launch
        
*   Additional corporate bond categories may be added in the future.  For 
example, Market Axess expects to add high yield and convertible bonds within 
3  to 6 months.   

** John Greene is aware that convertible bond transactions through Buy Side 
Direct will involve offsetting equity hedges.

*** We have execution agreements in place with all current Market Axess 
dealers.

Potential benefits offered by online sites include trading flows and improved 
execution efficiency.  In addition, these sites provide opportunities for 
generating demand for EnronCredit.com credit derivatives, given that users of 
these sites are buyers or sellers of corporate credit risk.  The ability to 
trade will greatly enhance our evaluation of these sites.  

As noted above, 3 of the 4 sites are cross-matching, where trading is 
completely anonymous and the site's sponsor or clearing firm are the nominal 
counterparty for all trades.   One of the 4 sites will be a multi-dealer 
system where counterparties transact directly with a particular dealer. 

Trades for all sites would be cleared through prime brokers with whom we have 
existing agreements.

As you suggested, we should ensure that agreements with online trading 
platforms allow for trading by ENA, ECT Investments and EnronCredit.com.   My 
understanding is that Sheila's group would coordinate the opening of any 
additional accounts required to facilitate trading by each entity.

I suggest that Madhur Dayal be designated initially at the person to receive 
notification of material changes to agreements.  We should retain the ability 
to change this contact person.

Thanks.

Mike

The interest component was eliminated from the terms of this Transaction (as 
was the switch from a price return swap to a total return swap and the name 
change).  It seems that Ben and Scott S. had a subsequent conversation (after 
ours) and the agreed changes were communicated to me.  SS

Mike and Sara,

There is generally ""no give"" on the Enron language regarding affiliates 
language which I have provided below.  

""The following entities shall also be deemed to be included in the term 
Subscriber and shall have the right to use the Service:  Subscriber's 
wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliated companies and those affiliated 
companies in which Subscriber or one of its subsidiaries or affiliated 
companies own an equity interest and which is under the direct or indirect 
control of Subscriber or one of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies.  
Furthermore, Subscriber shall also be allowed to have any agent or third 
party service company or facility manager of Subscriber's IT functions to 
assist it to the degree necesssary so that the Subscriber can fully access 
and utilize the Service.""

I will be happy to discuss any procedures we utilize and/or provisions in the 
document.   It is also my understanding that Mike is expecting more contracts 
of this nature so standardized and acceptable language will be to our 
advantage.  Sara, our legal counsel is Mark Holsworth and he is ""charged with 
reviewing all the IP documents"".  

Let me hear from you soon.

Shane:  Here's the scoop

(1)  ENA has an existing ISDA Master Agreement with Citibank N.A.. dated as 
of November 17, 1992.  The Master is not restricted to any particular type of 
transaction but it clearly anticipates commodity and rate swaps.  ENA is the 
Calculation Agent.  Also, only commodity transactions are netted.

(2)  Citibank proposed an amendment to this Master in February, 2000.  The 
amendment was primarily to amend the collateral annex to INCREASE the 
collateral threshold to USD 30 million for BBB (and above) rated entities.  
It also states Citibank to be ""multibranch"" with NY and London offices acting 
under the Master.  Apparently, the proposed FX language to be added to the 
Master was dropped (I think in the interest of time).  Mollie Harris in 
credit is trying to have Citibank sign the amendment.

(3)  ABN Amro is in my office ready for signature.  I will have it executed 
and email you when done.  Samantha Boyd (Ext.39188) will help me with the 
followup.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Sara,

Does this mean we have an ISDA and it is just being revised, so I can 
theoretically do a deal with them.

I also sent an email to Jason Peters ( don't know if he's still around) 
regarding the ABN Amro futures agreement. Do you know anything about this one?

Regards,

Shane

Sara,

I think we must mention the following as the source of the index price for 
energy: ""Documento de Transacciones Economicas"" (DTE). This is an electronic 
document published by Cammesa, and is available to all participants of the 
Wholesale Electric Market in Argentina. It's a summary of all the economic 
transactions between the participants of the Wholesale Electric Market 
(Generators, Transmission Co, Distributors, Marketers and End Users).

This DTE is published around the 5th or 6th day of each month and reports all 
transactions for the previous month. It is accessed by calling into Cammesa's 
server and replicating the corresponding database.

The attached word file shows you different screens of this electronic 
document. The second zipped file is the DTE for June.

(See attached file: IndexView.doc)(See attached file: dte9906.zip)

Have a look at it and give me a call if you have any questions.

Regards, Julian

All:  I have once again revised the confirm for the EBS Raptor deal.  There 
will be only one swap transaction:  Harrier I LLC/Talon I LLC.   
Please note the following changes:

(1)  the Initial Equity Notional Amount has been corrected
(2)  I have expanded the definition of Cash Dividends
(3)  I have ADDED a provison for ""Payment Obligations"" to avoid confusion for 
those of you unfamiliar with the 1996 Equity Definitions.  Since I have 
removed the interest payment feature, the only payments changing hands will 
be upside/dividends and downside.  The ""Equity Amount Payer"" pays the upside 
(difference between Initial Price (on the relevant Valuation Date) and Final 
Price) and dividends; the other party pays the downside.
(4)  I have retained the concept of multiple optional termination dates.
(5) Kevin:  I NEED the Harrier account/notice information.

This confirm should serve as a template for additional Raptor equity share 
swaps so please review and comment.  Thanks.  Sara

Darren-

Currently, we have three ISDA Master Agreements under process.  Our potential 
counterparties are Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co., The Industrial Bank 
of Japan and Sanwa Bank Ltd.  We have produced these documents based on the 
credit worksheets prepared in Houston and in conjunction with Baker & 
McKenzie, Tokyo.  Mark Taylor is reviewing the drafts prior to presenting 
them to the potential counterparties.

I am not aware of any brokerage arrangements to which Enron Japan Corp. is a 
party.  I note that I have copied Jonathan Whitehead on this correspondence, 
as he may be able to provide insight regarding plans for entering into such 
arrangements.

Best regards,

John

Thanks for your response John, I think it provides the clarification that we 
need to move forward.
I have one further question for you relating to current ISDA/exchange 
agreements that we have in place in Enron Japan.

Below are all exisiting ISDA and brokerage agreements that Financial trading 
currently has in place. Does Enron Japan have any ISDA/broker agreements in 
place that we can use for the purpose of executing financial trades?  
(perhaps with some of the names on the attached list?)If so, do you know what 
sort of credit has been extended and/or whether there is netting versus other 
commodity books or dedicated activity credit?

If we do not have any agreements in place which would allow us to conduct 
trades, do you know who I should contact regarding necessary documentation?

Sincerely,
Darren

Further to Mary's memo of 8/18/00, I would like to add the following comments:

(1)  I initially drafted the share swap confirm as a PRICE RETURN swap.  
Scott then requested a TOTAL RETURN swap (ie, dividends included).  I met 
with accounting this morning and (Ryan believes that) the swap is price 
return only:  the asset holder is only swapping price exposure and the 
business unit should recognize the immediate dividend benefit to its asset.

PLEASE VERIFY WHETHER THE SHARE SWAPS ARE PRICE RETURN OR TOTAL RETURN

(2)  With respect to the right of ""multiple optional partial swap 
terminations"", please verify that:
 (a)  the business unit has the right to request that Harrier partially 
terminate the swap prior to the scheduled termination, any number of times, 
without restriction as to frequency, minimum or maximum number of shares, or 
any other limitation, irrespective of whether the asset owner actually sells 
the underlying shares.  How is this right of termination (and the multiple 
requests) to be documented?
 (b)  the ""Initial Price"" of the shares on the Effective Date of the swap 
WILL ALWAYS BE USED to calculate the gain or loss (vs. using the share price 
on the date of each partial termination)"

Is it possible to get electronic file for the Enron North America and Peoples 
Energy Corporation ISDA?  Is it in Word?  I am trying to get our new JV, 
Midwest Energy Hub, to utilize our format for the template for MEH.

Thanks

Molly,

Could you send me an electronic version of the ISDA that was signed between
ENA and PEC. I understand from our attorney that we did not work with an
electronic version, only a hard copy. In order to create an ISDA template
for MEH, I need the electronic version.

Thanks

Aparna

Darren-

Currently, we have three ISDA Master Agreements under process.  Our potential 
counterparties are Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co., The Industrial Bank 
of Japan and Sanwa Bank Ltd.  We have produced these documents based on the 
credit worksheets prepared in Houston and in conjunction with Baker & 
McKenzie, Tokyo.  Mark Taylor is reviewing the drafts prior to presenting 
them to the potential counterparties.

I am not aware of any brokerage arrangements to which Enron Japan Corp. is a 
party.  I note that I have copied Jonathan Whitehead on this correspondence, 
as he may be able to provide insight regarding plans for entering into such 
arrangements.

Best regards,

John

Thanks for your response John, I think it provides the clarification that we 
need to move forward.
I have one further question for you relating to current ISDA/exchange 
agreements that we have in place in Enron Japan.

Below are all exisiting ISDA and brokerage agreements that Financial trading 
currently has in place. Does Enron Japan have any ISDA/broker agreements in 
place that we can use for the purpose of executing financial trades?  
(perhaps with some of the names on the attached list?)If so, do you know what 
sort of credit has been extended and/or whether there is netting versus other 
commodity books or dedicated activity credit?

If we do not have any agreements in place which would allow us to conduct 
trades, do you know who I should contact regarding necessary documentation?

Sincerely,
Darren

Darren:  Laurel mentioned that you were interested in existing/pending 
brokerage/futures agreements.  Attached are our most recent matrices by Enron 
company.  ALL of these agreements are negotiated by legal and must be 
executed by the business unit (VP or higher) and Ted Murphy.  Sheila Glover 
always sends a request and explanation for new account to legal, compliance 
and Ted Murphy.  Legal keeps a comprehensive listing by Enron company in an 
effort to avoid confusion.  Legal updates authorized trader lists and trading 
resolutions.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Sara

The following power point presentation graphically sets forth the steps

differs from that sent to several of you last week in that there are now 
dotted lines in red around those pieces of MG that are affected at each stage

All:  During the fourth quarter, 2000, MLB intends to transfer all FX 
business to MLIB Ltd.  ENA and Enron Corp. have been asked to agree to this 
transfer with the result that any executed master agreement with MLB will be 
transferred to MLIB Ltd as principal.  ENA has an ISDA Master Agreement dated 
effective 7/1/95; I cannot locate a master between Enron Corp. and MLB.

Will someone in credit approve this transfer?  Please let Stephanie Panus 
(X53249), our newest paralegal, know.  Thanks.  Sara"

Why don't we talk about this.  I have initiated Samantha as the trading 
agreement guru.  That's why she needs to be in the loop on all of these 
agreements (amendments included).  Let's distinguish margin lines from 
trading agreements (although the margin line concept obviously includes a 
futures or other arrangement)  I maintain a list (""in the pipeline"") which I 
circulate to the Hickerson desk since that desk opens the greatest number of 
trading agreements.  Sara

Please review this email from David Dupre on confirm desk.  He has been 
inquiring of me re credit lines the last few weeks.  The margin cash issues 
seem to be getting a bit of attention lately.  However, these are new 
brokerage agreements or amendments or amplifications of established accounts 
to trade other commodities.  I have the paperwork Refco sent.  Maybe we 
should sent down and visit re all of the brokerage matters.  Should I handle 
these, or stick with the ones related to margin lines.  Should we send this 
kind of stuff to Jason?  Please advise.  Mary

Hi,

1. Refco

Refco's paperwork will be submitted to you today to review. It is my 
understanding
that the following rates have been negotiated (on a round-turn basis):

$2.50 Brokerage
$0.55 Exchange
$1.20 Clearing
$4.25

Our contact there is Steffen van Keppel at 713-266-0050

2. Cargill

Our traders want to renew crude oil trading with Cargill at a lower rate. 
Which legal documents do we need to sign to ensure that this lower
commission rate is established and honored?

3. GNI-Next advisors

We are talking to Stephen Purdy upon the request of Spencer Vosko. We have 
been advised that the rate will be $5.25 on a roundturn basis.
This broker will be forwarded their paperwork to the trader, and, I'll ensure 
that you receive it.

Please keep me updated on any other new brokers which we may be negotiating 
with for new agreements and/or existing brokerage agreements
which may be establishing a line of credit.

Many thanks,

David

Jennifer below are MAP's legal department's comments on the Enron OTC 
agreement from July 14..

  1. On the address at the top of page 1 the address for MAP should be 
correctly identified.  I don't believe ""Document Department"" is correct. 
CHANGE TO ATTENTION DALE BARWIG

  2. Under the provision titled ""Floating Amount Details"", ""Floating Price"" 
at line 3, change the word ""entitled"" to ""titled"".

  3. Under Governing Law change ""Texas"" to ""New York"".

 On the last page, information should be inserted for notices for MAP and 
another provision for communications.  Under ""Communications"" insert ""Prior 
to the close of business on the next business day following the trade date, 
ENA will prepare and forward this contract electronically (faxed or attached 
to an email in a mutually acceptable format) to MAP's trader with a copy to 
the supervisor of Feedstock Acquisition and Derivative Accounting as listed 
below under Contractual Invoices"".

 Then for ""Contractual Invoices"":

Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC (MAP)
Name: Fred L. Bennett
Title: Supervisor, Feedstock Acquisition and Derivative Accounting
Address: Room 444-M, 539 South Main Street, Findlay, Ohio 45840
Tel No: (419) 421-4200
Fax No: (419) 421-5040
Email: FLBennett@MAPLLC.com""

  4. Under Annex A General Terms and Conditions under the provision titled 
""Market Disruption Event"", line 3, change ""ENA"" to ""both parties"".
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here starts my comments on the contract language.

5.  As we talked about I am confused that which crack sale has occurred.  The 
fixed price referencing the attachment should indicate USGC 74 Grade (Pipe) 
Heating Oil.  I am unclear where in the document we mention Low Sulfur.

Floating Price: The average of USGC platts oilgram midpoint for USGC Pipeline 
No. 2 74 Grade OIl, multiplied by 42, less the First Nearby NYMEX WTI Crude 
Oil futrures settlement prices

Where is the settlement paragraph?  Something like:

If the Fixed Amount exceeds the Floating Amount for such calculation period, 
the fixed price payor shall pay the floating price payor an amount equal to 
such excess.  If the floating amount exceeds the fixed amount for such 
calculation period, the floating price payor shall pay the fixed price payor 
an amount equal to such excess.

Thanks for you help.

Subject: Re: Swap Agreement





We have decided NOT to proceed with the swap agreement.  Enron and Shell will
each write a guaranty in favor of TBS for their pro rata share of the negative
difference between the gas price received and gas price paid resulting from 
the
differential in the gas price escalators.  Any positive difference in TBS's
favor will run through the TBS accounts to the TBS distribution account and,
subject to the blocking test in the Accts and Disbursement Agmt, will then be
distributed to E & S.
Dean & John: Can you propose a draft guaranty for internal review?  Once we're
happy with it we can send it to Shell for their consideration/sign-off.  
Thanks.

Regards,
     John

Subject:  Swap Agreement




I am sending this e-mail message to address several issues related to the
swap and to circulate a proposed confirmation for your consideration.

Before addressing the swap, however, I should note that it is not clear to
me that the project team has finally decided to proceed with a swap rather
than a guaranty.  If we are not, I would appreciate someone letting me know
so that we can stop this process.

Comments on the Draft Schedule:

     1.  Part 1(a) ""Specified Entity"":  A Specified Entity is an entity
other than the parties whose actions can cause an event of default or a
termination event.  The draft schedule does not contemplate a Specified
Entity.  I think we should consider whether EPE and/or SCG should be a
Specified Entity with respect to TBS.

     2.  Part 1(b) ""Threshold Amount"": proposes $1,000,000 for TBS, which
seems low given that Enron Corp. is backing it up.

     3.  Part 1(h) ""Additional Event of Default"":  If we use a swap
arrangement, there will be two: one for 72.5% between TBS and ECT, and one
for 27.5% between TBS and a Shell entity.  If that is the case, do we want
an additional event of default under which a sale by Shell of its interest
in TBS could result in termination?

     4.  Part 2  ""Representations"":  I think that we need someone in tax
to determine whether TBS can make the representations.

     5.  Part 4(d) & (e) ""Credit Support Provider"": Shell will be the
credit support provider under the other swap arrangement, not this one.

     6.  Part 4(g) ""Governing Law"", 4(h) ""Arbitration"": The schedule
proposes Texas law with AAA arbitration to be held in Texas.  It would seem
to me that we would want to use arbitration procedures that are similar to
those in the gas supply agreements, with ICC arbitration, held in Miami,
under New York, with joint arbitration if the same issue arises under one of
the gas supply arrangements (such as the proper calculation of price).

Comment on the Proposed Confirmation:

     I have reproduced the gas supply pricing provisions from the EPE Gas
Supply Agreement under the ""Fixed Amount Details"" but have not done so under
the ""Floating Amount Details"", which cross-references the provisions of the
SCG Gas Supply Agreement, because of the length of those provisions.

     Please let me know if you have any reactions to the above comments
or any comments on the attached confirmation.  I will contact Nasim to
discuss the process for pushing the swaps (or, alternatively, guaranties) to
completion.

Regards, Dean

All:  Please review for content.  This deal has been recast as a ""Price 
Return Swap"" and I hope it is self-explanatory (i.e., you won't have to drag 
out the 1996 Equity Definitions).  I will forward a draft letter shortly.

whether Midwest will be competing with us and who will be negotiating hedge

All:  Before Rod became a Brit, we were working with Enron Corp. treasury to 
put in place some masters in the name of ENA for the following parties:

Bear, Stearns Internaitonal Limited
Credit Agricole Indosuez
CSFB International
Lehman Brother Finance S.A.
Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.
Deutsche Bank

These masters will be used to for equity deals on ENE stock.  The Treasury 
group has concluded together with Rex Rogers and V&E, that Enron Corp. is the 
appropriate swap counterparty for these masters and NOT ENA.

Who in credit will be available to assist me in this process?  Thanks.  Sara"

Kristina:  As you may have heard, some Raptor issues have been raised to a 
new level.  I have waited to further revise the confirm pending the V&E 
response; Also V&E suggested edits on the confirm format for all Raptor 
deals.  As you will see from Scott's memo, the unilateral right of 
termination is a potential issue.  Sara

Sara,

We need to draft an ISDA for Empire Paper Group, LLC.  We would like to 
insert language that will allow Enron to get a second lien on the assets 
after the primary lender instead of using the CSA.  Cross default thresholds 
are $1MM and $100MM, respectively for Empire and Enron.

Please send the draft to credit first and we will check the new language.  
The underwriters are Jay Epstein and Chris Croon.

If you have any questions please feel free to call.

Thanks,

Jane Wilhite

Hey, Jen:  I'm not going to email you to death like some people but I hear 
through the grapevine that you're having a blast and making tons of friends.  
I told your mom that she and I should rent a convertible, don our sunglasses 
and drive to Natchitoches to go shopping at the Walmart and take you to 
lunch.  She didn't think you would like the idea too much.  Hope you really 
are having a wonderful year, making lots of friends and stretching your brain 
power.  Love, Sas

Jennifer below are MAP's legal department's comments on the Enron OTC 
agreement from July 14..

  1. On the address at the top of page 1 the address for MAP should be 
correctly identified.  I don't believe ""Document Department"" is correct. 
CHANGE TO ATTENTION DALE BARWIG

  2. Under the provision titled ""Floating Amount Details"", ""Floating Price"" 
at line 3, change the word ""entitled"" to ""titled"".

  3. Under Governing Law change ""Texas"" to ""New York"".

 On the last page, information should be inserted for notices for MAP and 
another provision for communications.  Under ""Communications"" insert ""Prior 
to the close of business on the next business day following the trade date, 
ENA will prepare and forward this contract electronically (faxed or attached 
to an email in a mutually acceptable format) to MAP's trader with a copy to 
the supervisor of Feedstock Acquisition and Derivative Accounting as listed 
below under Contractual Invoices"".

 Then for ""Contractual Invoices"":

Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC (MAP)
Name: Fred L. Bennett
Title: Supervisor, Feedstock Acquisition and Derivative Accounting
Address: Room 444-M, 539 South Main Street, Findlay, Ohio 45840
Tel No: (419) 421-4200
Fax No: (419) 421-5040
Email: FLBennett@MAPLLC.com""

  4. Under Annex A General Terms and Conditions under the provision titled 
""Market Disruption Event"", line 3, change ""ENA"" to ""both parties"".
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here starts my comments on the contract language.

5.  As we talked about I am confused that which crack sale has occurred.  The 
fixed price referencing the attachment should indicate USGC 74 Grade (Pipe) 
Heating Oil.  I am unclear where in the document we mention Low Sulfur.

Floating Price: The average of USGC platts oilgram midpoint for USGC Pipeline 
No. 2 74 Grade OIl, multiplied by 42, less the First Nearby NYMEX WTI Crude 
Oil futrures settlement prices

Where is the settlement paragraph?  Something like:

If the Fixed Amount exceeds the Floating Amount for such calculation period, 
the fixed price payor shall pay the floating price payor an amount equal to 
such excess.  If the floating amount exceeds the fixed amount for such 
calculation period, the floating price payor shall pay the fixed price payor 
an amount equal to such excess.

Thanks for you help.

John:  I just wanted to stay in the loop for Japan as to Gary Hickerson's 
FX/rate/equity counterparties.  My understanding from Gary is that  EGM 
(through ENA) will continue to hedge the business originating in Japan, 
subject to tax and any regulatory input.  I don't know if this has 
necessitated an agency arrangement  between Japan and Houston (or another 
office, similar to London or Australia).  Also, for netting reasons, Japan 
would not duplicate existing counterparty  ISDA's with ENA, and to the extent 
Japan is transacting with a bank having an agreement with ENA, we could amend 
the agreement for multibranch purposes if necessary (e.g., Bank of Montreal 
if the bank is transacting from multiple locations that need to be added to 
ENA's agreement).

Please advise if you have already had these discussions with Mark Taylor.  I 
look forward to hearing from you.  Sara  "

Sara/Mary,

Koch Energy Trading, Inc. has contacted me several times over the past couple 
of weeks in order to request that we change our Confirmation procedures.  
Currently, per the Master Agreement, we send our form of Confirmation and 
they sign and return those to us.  With the volume being well over 50 deals 
per day with Koch, they are now seeing this as cost prohibitive on their end, 
as they are doing all of the work related to Confirmations (Comparing details 
to their system and return faxing).  Now, Koch would like to go to both 
Counterparties sending confirms, comparing each other's paper to the system 
and notifying only in the case of discrepancies.  I suggested to Koch that we 
might try using a system similar to Sempra's in which we send our Confirms 
and they return a one-page fax which lists our deal numbers and their 
agreement or disagreement with those deals.  Still, they considered this to 
be very manual on their end and leaves them responsible for notifying of any 
discrepancies.  I'm sure the legal departments will be getting involved soon, 
so I wanted to get your thoughts on changing our current process before it 
comes to that.

Thanks,

John:  I just wanted to stay in the loop for Japan as to Gary Hickerson's 
FX/rate/equity counterparties.  My understanding from Gary is that  EGM 
(through ENA) will continue to hedge the business originating in Japan, 
subject to tax and any regulatory input.  I don't know if this has 
necessitated an agency arrangement  between Japan and Houston (or another 
office, similar to London or Australia).  Also, for netting reasons, Japan 
would not duplicate existing counterparty  ISDA's with ENA, and to the extent 
Japan is transacting with a bank having an agreement with ENA, we could amend 
the agreement for multibranch purposes if necessary (e.g., Bank of Montreal 
if the bank is transacting from multiple locations that need to be added to 
ENA's agreement).

Please advise if you have already had these discussions with Mark Taylor.  I 
look forward to hearing from you.  Sara  "

Alan, and Sara,
We had spoken about a month ago that the Credit and Convertible Books may be 
moved into Enron North America from ECT Investments Inc..
Please advise what we need to do to do this.  At the prime Brokers we can 
move these separate books to the ENA grouping of books.  What do we need to 
do from a Corporate structure side since ECT Investments, Inc. is a wholly 
owned sub of ENA at this time?

Enron Credit.com is currently using the ENA entity for deals with US 
courterparties. 

Thanks, Sheila

All:  Just a status update on the growing number of brokerage agreement 
requests, and, I will circulate an updated list shortly.

On 8/8/00, Mike requested agreements for Market Axess, LIMITrader Securities, 
Inc. and Trading Edge on behalf of EnronCredit.com Limited.  We have sent 
comments to the first two.  
Sheila requested a Morgan Stanley agreement for EnronCredit.com Limited (low 
priority).
ENA sent comments to Ing Barings (fka Furman Selz) some time ago and has not 
heard back.  We were going to dupe for ECT Investments, Inc.
Denis is the responsible lawyer for EnronCredit.com Limited..
If in fact these electronic agreements should be in the name of ECT 
Investments, Inc., then we'll negotiate from Houston (or divide and conquer!)
Sheila, your email of 8/18 seemed to refer to BuySideDirect's agreement with 
ECT Investments, Inc. (and not the agreements requested by Mike).  Also, you 
should note that BuySideDirect requires use of its designated broker, Weiss, 
Peck & Greer (I believe to take the other side of the trade or broker the 
deal with a third party)...We have received a copy of that agreement as well.

My goal here is to make certain that we are all on the same page and can 
continue to approach these agreements in an organized manner.  Please let me 
know your comments or questions.  

Thanks.  Sara"

Willie received a call from Mike Billings, the trader at Dow,
and he requested that deal #EY0963.1 from 6/15/99 be revised
from Dow Hydrocarbons to Dow Chemical.

He is currently signing and sending back the other trades that were
changed.  

Is it okay to change this deal also, and on a ""going forward"" basis, all
trades must be through Dow Hydrocarbons...

let me know...thanks...mgg

to understand the LLC intent and toward that end was advised that Kaye Mann 
was the lawyer to speak with.  Kaye has not returned email or voice mail and 
I have once again requested her response.  Willl you be handling credit for

Sara

As you know, Peoples has been eagerly awaiting templates (ISDA, Guarantees, 
L/Cs) from Enron for the MEH JV. At this point, their credit officer is 
leading the charge with People's legal department and moving forward to 
create something!  I have shared that we do not want to utilize the existing 
People's agreement as a standard.

Do you have templates we could give them now and explain they are under 
revision?  They have wanted to begin reviewing and are now anxious.   Don't 
we want Enron to lead the way for these templates?  Please advise.

Thank you
Molly

Stuart advises that his request equally applies to the option to purchase 
Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. capital stock held by Sundance Assets, 
L.P. ( not the dreaded spark spread option which you worked on in the same 
transaction, which spark spread option was repurchased and terminated some 
months ago ). Let me know when you would like to discuss the matter. The 1997 
Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the option was originally granted 
was signed today ( we are still waiting on an attachment to that agreement to 
be delivered by the other side before we release the document to them), and 
we did modify the option and some transfer restrictions in that Agreement 
that will apply to the Raptor analysis. A registration statement registering 
the CCSI common stock that would be acquired upon exercise of the option was 
filed yesterday with the SEC. Let me know when you would like to meet to 
discuss this matter.

Does the request apply as well to options to purchase? There is an option in 
the Catalytica transaction - recently renegotiated ( we are signing the deal 
up today) to purchase 500,000 plus CCSI shares on a cashless basis. The share 
number is subject to adjustment in a stock split to occur upon the spin off 
of CCSI prior to the merger of its parent sometime before year end. The

If any of the Raptor investments for which you are responsible is comprised, 
in whole or in part, of warrants, please provide a copy of the warrants (and 
any related documentation which governs the exercise of the warrants) to 
either Sara Shackleton or Mary Cook.  For the public companies this should be 
done ASAP (i.e. no later than the end of business today) and for the privates 
this should be done by the end of the week.  Also, please arrange to meet 
with either Mary or Sara to provide a brief explanation as to how the 
derivatives work (they need to understand the nature of the derivatives in 
order to properly structure the Raptor hedge).  Once again, I apologize for 
the short notice but hope that each of you recognizes that the internal 
pressure to push investments into Raptor has increased exponentially.  Thanks 
in advance.

Stuart

Let's eliminate future problems with Dow and their trader Mike Billings.

Credit has given the O.K. to trade in the name of The Dow Chemical Company.  
We will document trades on the ""omnibus"" UNLESS we are able to negotiate an
 ISDA with the counterparty.

Tell Mike Billings that we will not keep changing from ""Dow Hydrocarbons and 
Resources, Inc."" to the parent company.  We waste too much time and energy.

 Call if you have questions.  Sara"

The ISDA Master  does not circumscribe the trade term or trade parameters. 
The issue which we discussed is authority.  The Merced resolution of March 
16, 1999 specifically authorizes the general manager ""...to develop and 
provide appropriate information, and certifications for completing Master 
Trading (ISDA) Agreements with energy vendors and execute Master Trading 
(ISDA) Agreements and appropriate vendor Schedules to the ISDA Agreement for 
the purpose of acquiring energy and stabilizing energy costs.  Such 
executions are subject to Counsel review of the agreement and schedules as to 
form.""  There is no specific mention of authority to enter into transactions 
(by Merced's traders).
Intuitively one could draw the conclusion that the ISDA Master contemplates 
transactions, Merced authorized the ISDA Master and therefore Merced 
authorized transactions under the ISDA Master.  Since Merced is a 
governmental entity, the safer view is that we should not assume that Merced 
authorized transactions.  Merced probably intended to authorize transactions, 
and if so, should not have an issue with specifically providing a clarifying 
resolution.

Russell:  Thanks for the info.  I do need to send a REMINDER to the credit 
group about the authority issues raised by municipals (governmentals, cities, 
etc.) entering into financial trades.  Where can I obtain the most recent 
list of credit people (you know how those credit people are) who deal with 
financial trading?  Thanks.  Sara

P.S.  the early production payment docs typically conveyed an undivided 90 % 
interest in the producer's net revenue interest in particular properties.  
The other 10 % was considered ""excess"" for purposes of you know what.

Sara,

According ot Financial Settlements, the City of Dublin transaction that I 
told you could have some legal risk because it is a municipality, was 
actually the trigger to a physical transaction.  I asked if they could book 
this in the system as a Physical Swap so we show no financial exposure.

Julie,

This is the Instinet install.  Who do you think is the best person to 
coordinate the install?  Please forward this to them and ask them to contact 
me on ext. 3-5534 in London.

Laurel,

Please be aware that we are wanting to add european equity trading to the 
existing Instinet contract.  Although it may change at a later date, we would 
like for this activity to be done in the name of ECT Investments so I am not 
sure how much the contract will change.  As I have mentioned, there is a 
chance that we may have to have such trading done out of another entity but 
we can worry about changing any contracts when that happens.  I want to get 
the technological kinks worked out during the ""down time"" so that as soon as 
we have figured out how this activity is going to be structured we can begin 
trading immediately.  I will direct the Instinet contract contact to you as 
soon as I find out who that is.

Thanks and regards,
John

Hi John,

Thanks for taking the time to chat with me regarding your new London office.
You are very smart to start setting up the equipment ahead of time.  My
colleague in London is Mark Freeman.  He will be calling you to discuss the
details of your account.  If you need to reach Mark in London call 44 207 680
3191.

As we discussed on the phone, we will need to pass your account through credit
committee at Instinet London.  It sounds like Enron Houston is the same entity
as Enron London.  Hopefully this will make the legality issues simple.  In
addition, you mentioned that the phone lines to Reuters have been installed.  
We
can usually hook the Instinet terminal right up to the Reuters phone line.
Please let me know once you have the name of the technician handling the 
account
so we can contact him/her.

I ran you through some of the functionality Instinet provides on the
international side.  We should probably talk about this in more detail soon.  
I
will be in London the week of 9/11-9/15 so perhaps I could bring your new
coverage person over to meet if you think that makes sense.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, comments or concerns please 
contact
me on 212 310-7268.  As I mentioned, I am still on jury duty but hope to be 
off
by next Tuesday.  I always check messages from the road.  Good luck with the
apartment search.  You can not go wrong in Chelsea it's fantastic.  Have a 
great
weekend!!!

Jenn

Sara -

I have made the changes you marked on the draft master.  I know we were 
discussing some things on Thurs and were interrupted.  Do you want me to send 
out the draft or do you want to discuss it further?

Thanks.

Hello Sara,

I talked to Chuck Kaufmann in Cinergy's credit dept. concerning the ongoing 
issues.  Basically, he has agreed to the cross-default levels of 50/100 
million.  He is going to look further into the guaranty issue and get back to 
me on this. I will keep you updated.



Thanks
Russell

Since Scott Neal's phone call with the counterparty was July 23 I believe 
that should be the correct date.  The call made by Julian and Federico on 
July 20 was not effective to bind ECT.  Please confirm this with Sara and 
Scott and make sure everyone is on board with this.  I am sure Scott was just 
using the draft deal ticket Julian prepared and Julian used the date they 
called rather than the date that Scott did the deal.

Brent,

One last question on the Central Puerto S.A. doc.  We currently have the 
Trade Date as July 23, but the tickets we received say July 20th.  Is July 
20th correct?  

Thanks,

		 Subject: Trading Edge / Bond Link Agreement

The IT Contract group has been involved in reviewing documents for Trading 
Edge's Bond Link online bond trading site.  George Weber, who has since moved 
into another area, discussed various issues with Trading Edge early this 
year.  Laine Borgman, a contract administrator in the IT Contracts group, has 
become involved in the Trading Edge review during the past week.  Attached 
below are Trading Edge agreements and their responses to issues raised by IT 
Contracts.  

The primary issues Laine and I discussed yesterday are as follows:

Jurisdiction:   
Our preference is Texas, but we would accept New York.  Trading Edge's 
response is unclear, although I believe they will readily agree to New York.

Indemnification (similar to issues with Buy Side Direct):  
Agreement assigns no liability to 3rd parties which the agreement describes 
as ""providers of software"".  As Trading Edge is the nominal counterparty for 
all trades, this may be acceptable if the agreement held Trading Edge liable 
for settling trades.  However, I do not see where section 11 addresses 
Trading Edge's liability for trades.   
We would also like assurances / liability regarding the accuracy of order and 
trade information.  

Limits of Liability:
Review language in both the Access and TIPs agreements (per Trading Edge, 
they will not agree to modify the TIPs Agreement, which is dictated by a 3rd 
party).

Assignment:  
Trading Edge's agreement does not allow Enron to assign the agreement to 
other parties.  Initially, only EnronCredit.com personnel in Houston and 
possibly London would use Trading Edge's site, so this would not be an issue 
initially.  Although we would prefer that the ability to assign be included, 
this issue could be addressed later as needed.
 
Electronic Mail (#18):
We do not want to accept email communication in the event of a lawsuit.  From 
the tone of their previous response, I believe they will agree to include 
lawsuits in the definition of extraordinary matters, for which email will not 
be employed.  

Sara, how would you suggest we proceed with the Trading Edge review ?  I will 
speak with Sheila Glover regarding the involvement of Credit and Risk Control 
in our request to utilize Trading Edge's trading platform.

Thanks.

Mike

Mary,

Per your e-mail, I would like to delete (ii) in the defininition of 
""reasonably withheld"" as there is only one party that has a possibility to 
have a material unhedged position (ie. Enron).  

Thanks,

Ryan

The (i) Termination Date and (ii) each date specified as such in a written 
notice from either party to the other party with respect to a designated 
Number of Shares specified in the notice (the ""Notice""), to which the party 
receiving such notice consents, which consent shall not be unreasonably 
withheld.  For purposes of this Confirmation, the parties agree that consent 
shall be deemed reasonably withheld (i) if the party receiving the Notice has 
a reasonable business purpose for maintaining the Transaction (excluding any 
business purpose relating specifically to the existing or anticipated value 
of the Transaction or any other Transaction subject to the Agreement) or (ii) 
if consenting to the Notice would result in a material unhedged exposure or 
liability for the party receiving the Notice.  For the avoidance of doubt, a 
Notice shall be sent from either party to the other party on the Termination 
Date.

Kristina, please forward as you deem necessary to EBS persons for final 
approval.  Thank you.

Please see attached language concerning the Raptor swaps in respect of the 
Valuation Date mechanism and advise me as soon as possible of your approval 
or comments, if any.  We are trying to finalize all public swaps (save Active 
Power) today, so your timeliness will be GREATLY appreciated by me!  Mary

(1)  Will the ISDA be negotiated prior to execution of your trade?
(2)  Are the trade terms correct?  You did not send me a deal ticket.  Who is 
the trader?  Who will be responsible for payments under the swap (i.e., will 
it be you)?
(3)  What happened to comments on the Schedule?
(4)  Who is reviewing the Schedule from a credit perspective?

Could you please refax my comments to your Schedule?  I have misplaced my

Attached are the transaction documents for Project Tahiti.  Each of the 
documents is marked to show revisions against the version circulated last 
Wednesday, August 30.  As we discussed on the phone, we have incorporated the 
business agreement reached between CIBC and Enron, as follows:

The Tahiti Series Trust Agreement has been revised to require the consent of 
all certificateholders (which includes Fiji Z LLC, which can only consent 
with the consent of its Class B Member - CIBC) prior to (i) the creation of 
any series after December 31, 2000 (see definition of Series Supplement) and 
(ii) making any amendments to the purpose provision (which specifically 
limits the purposes of the Trust to holding Trust Property - defined as the 
warrants) or the definition of Series Supplement.

The Subscription Agreement has been revised to provide that CIBC's commitment 
to fund on December 31, 2000 will be terminated if the Bali Trust receives 
any funds except in connection with the issuance of debt of the Bali Trust 
(which would require the consent of CIBC as the beneficial owner) or funds 
received from CIBC.

Please be aware that because of the revisions described above, it was not 
necessary to incorporate  all of Tim Elwood's comments received September 3, 
2000.

Cyrus/Julie,

Can you please coordinate with Jamie White at ITG on this install.  I don't 
really care how I get it.  I would presume that someone in our IT group 
worked with ITG to determine the best delivery method on the original 
install.  If so, please use the same architecture.  If not, please consider 
the options and if we think there exists a better method than the one being 
in Houston, let's upgrade the one in Houston concurrently with the London 
install so the two sites are in synch.

This install will initially be for European equity trading only but we may 
want to incorporate US equities at a later date as well.  Any activity on 
this setup will be governed by the same agreements currently in place as it 
will be done on behalf of both ECT Investments and Enron North America until 
further notice.

Thanks and regards,
John

		 Subject: Trading Edge / Bond Link Agreement

The IT Contract group has been involved in reviewing documents for Trading 
Edge's Bond Link online bond trading site.  George Weber, who has since moved 
into another area, discussed various issues with Trading Edge early this 
year.  Laine Borgman, a contract administrator in the IT Contracts group, has 
become involved in the Trading Edge review during the past week.  Attached 
below are Trading Edge agreements and their responses to issues raised by IT 
Contracts.  

The primary issues Laine and I discussed yesterday are as follows:

Jurisdiction:   
Our preference is Texas, but we would accept New York.  Trading Edge's 
response is unclear, although I believe they will readily agree to New York.

Indemnification (similar to issues with Buy Side Direct):  
Agreement assigns no liability to 3rd parties which the agreement describes 
as ""providers of software"".  As Trading Edge is the nominal counterparty for 
all trades, this may be acceptable if the agreement held Trading Edge liable 
for settling trades.  However, I do not see where section 11 addresses 
Trading Edge's liability for trades.   
We would also like assurances / liability regarding the accuracy of order and 
trade information.  

Limits of Liability:
Review language in both the Access and TIPs agreements (per Trading Edge, 
they will not agree to modify the TIPs Agreement, which is dictated by a 3rd 
party).

Assignment:  
Trading Edge's agreement does not allow Enron to assign the agreement to 
other parties.  Initially, only EnronCredit.com personnel in Houston and 
possibly London would use Trading Edge's site, so this would not be an issue 
initially.  Although we would prefer that the ability to assign be included, 
this issue could be addressed later as needed.
 
Electronic Mail (#18):
We do not want to accept email communication in the event of a lawsuit.  From 
the tone of their previous response, I believe they will agree to include 
lawsuits in the definition of extraordinary matters, for which email will not 
be employed.  

Sara, how would you suggest we proceed with the Trading Edge review ?  I will 
speak with Sheila Glover regarding the involvement of Credit and Risk Control 
in our request to utilize Trading Edge's trading platform.

Thanks.

Mike

I am trying to finalize this master during Carol St. Clair's absence.  I have 
a few questions prior to our comments.  They are:

(1)  Have you already commented on the new form of Letter of Credit 
Provisions which Carol sent to you?  This is referred to as Exhibit A to 
Paragraph 13 of Annex A.  I did not see your response.

(2)  Have you reviewed the latest Letter of Credit format?  I did not see 
your response.

(3)  What is the genesis of Part 5, Section 18 of your redline.  I know that 
DB acquired Bankers Trust, but did Carol ever review this provision?  Have 
both parties agreed as to existing transactions?

Please let me hear from you.  Thanks.  Sara"

Here's your answer.  We need to put an IMMEDIATE halt to the booking of 
EnronCredit.com Limited trades with ENA (as well as the others).  Sara

P.S.  Lynn:  Is there someone we need to notify with Enron Development or 
Enron Netherlands?

Hopefully, none of these transactions have been ""booked"" for ENA by a trader 
located in a foreign country.  That said, the general rule is that 
intra-company transactions are generally booked directly to RMT rather than 
to ENA and then back to RMT.  I have cc'd Rhett Jackson on my reply so that 
he can confirm this since Rhett has become the ""keeper"" of the RMT technology 
for our group.  Sorry for the delay in responding.  Steve.

Sharon:  Thanks for your fax and markup of the Schedule dated Sept. 6.  There 
is a major issue which we need to discuss and that is the counterparty 
identity itself.  It appears that you have identified a DIFFERENT party to 
the agreement, namely, a limited liability company named ""SITA"", which is not 
the entity which we originally proposed,.  This does not appear to be the 
credit which we evaluated.  

Also, we insist upon a Credit Support Annex.  As you know, the agreement 
contemplates multiple transactions and the posting of collateral is a major 
issue, particularly for long-dated pulp deals.  

Can you call me tomorrow?  We need to address the major issues upfront.  You 
can reach me at 713-853-5620.  Thank you.  Sara"

Sara, long time no see.  I won't be over for this autumn's ECT conference but 
hope to be around next year.  

Please do me a favour and look through the doc attached below, which is 
governed by New York law (in particular the reps under Section 2(d) and the 
governing law language/jurisdiction language).  The contract gives rise to 
some issues (e.g. deficient default language), which I thought I could 
address myself.  The matter is somewhat urgent.  Tks.

Subject: Re: Instinet Corporation  

Thanks for being on top of this.  As I mentioned in my voice mail to you on 
Friday, no trader should conclude a transaction on behalf of ENA while 
located in a foreign country.  On several discrete occasions we have 
sanctioned exceptions to this rule but each such case had unique facts that 
permitted us to conclude that those transactions were OK.  Further, any 
physical presence by ENA is a foreign country is generally a bad idea because 
it supports a foreign tax authority's argument that ENA is doing business in 
their country.  Thus, because of that general concern, no Instinet terminal 
should be put in place on behalf of ENA in a foreign country (especially 
since for what purpose would such a thing be used - trading?) but, rather, an 
appropriate foreign affiliate of Enron should contract for such service (in 
this respect, you should speak with Janine Juggins in our London tax group - 
Janine is our resident trading tax expert in London and will be very familiar 
with the things described in this E-mail).  I will be out of the country this 
week (returning the week of the 18th) and can be reached at the Vancouver 
Hotel in Vancouver, British Columbia.  Best regards.  Steve.

Sara,

Please do not have anyone do any work on this aside from the install 
agreement.  I am waiting on a ruling from London's tax group and no trading 
will be done whatsoever until that point.  There is indeed a question as to 
what entity our London activity will be done out of but this is already being 
considered by the correct individuals herre in London.  I am waiting 
anxiously for the ruling on it as it is the only thing holding up my being 
able to start trading.  

The reason I am setting up a desktop in London under existing documents is 
that I want to begin trading as soon as I get the go ahead from tax and 
legal.  In other words, I do not want to get to the point where everyone has 
signed off on the structure only to be held up by technology constraints.  I 
fully expect that additional documentation/agreements will be required once 
we know exactly which entity we will be operating out of and have told 
Instinet (as well as ITG and eventually Autex) this. 

Please let me repeat: no activity will be executed on these systems until we 
get a final ruling from London's tax, legal and regulatory personnel.  Please 
do not have anyone do any additional work aside from signing the agreement 
for the install.

Thanks and regards,
John

Sharon Lewis asked me to contact you about this.  Our client has instructed 
us that it is SITA which will enter into the ISDA master agreement.  SITA as 
the main company must have a better credit than the company that you 
identified.

We cannot agree to a credit support document.

We suggest that you evaluate the credit of SITA and then get back to us.

Kind regards
Susan

Sharon:  Thanks for your fax and markup of the Schedule dated Sept. 6.
There is a major issue which we need to discuss and that is the
counterparty identity itself.  It appears that you have identified a
DIFFERENT party to the agreement, namely, a limited liability company named
""SITA"", which is not the entity which we originally proposed,.  This does
not appear to be the credit which we evaluated.

Also, we insist upon a Credit Support Annex.  As you know, the agreement
contemplates multiple transactions and the posting of collateral is a major
issue, particularly for long-dated pulp deals.

Can you call me tomorrow?  We need to address the major issues upfront.
You can reach me at 713-853-5620.  Thank you.  Sara

Dear Sara,

I have been given the negotiation of the ISDA Master Agreement between
Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc, and Enron North America Corp. The
last correspondence was forwarded to you from Megan Duffill on 7 August
2000 replying to your proposed draft schedule. Despite numerous follow
up calls we have not received a reply. I have resent these comments to
Matthew Dawson in an attempt to get a response and progress this
negotiation.

Can you please advise when you will be in a position to respond to our

Do not hesitate to contact me with any queries you may have relating to
our comments.

Have you sent our form of guaranty since we're wasting time reviewing several 
different formats?  This should always be our first approach.  Also, you had 
best advise the company that we will not provide an unlimited guaranty 
(unless you've agreed otherwise). SS "

Please review the attached sample swap confirmation.
Like I said, Rob Scheuer is trying to create the Lumber Market and would like 
to use ISDA documents in the future.  
He will be passing this sample swap confirmation out to many potential 
customers.
If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.

Many thanks and kind regards,

Mike and Sara,

There is generally ""no give"" on the Enron language regarding affiliates 
language which I have provided below.  

""The following entities shall also be deemed to be included in the term 
Subscriber and shall have the right to use the Service:  Subscriber's 
wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliated companies and those affiliated 
companies in which Subscriber or one of its subsidiaries or affiliated 
companies own an equity interest and which is under the direct or indirect 
control of Subscriber or one of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies.  
Furthermore, Subscriber shall also be allowed to have any agent or third 
party service company or facility manager of Subscriber's IT functions to 
assist it to the degree necesssary so that the Subscriber can fully access 
and utilize the Service.""

I will be happy to discuss any procedures we utilize and/or provisions in the 
document.   It is also my understanding that Mike is expecting more contracts 
of this nature so standardized and acceptable language will be to our 
advantage.  Sara, our legal counsel is Mark Holsworth and he is ""charged with 
reviewing all the IP documents"".  

Let me hear from you soon.

Sharon Lewis asked me to contact you about this.  Our client has instructed 
us that it is SITA which will enter into the ISDA master agreement.  SITA as 
the main company must have a better credit than the company that you 
identified.

We cannot agree to a credit support document.

We suggest that you evaluate the credit of SITA and then get back to us.

Kind regards
Susan

>>> <Sara.Shackleton@enron.com> 9/11/2000 20:28:17 >>>
Sharon:  Thanks for your fax and markup of the Schedule dated Sept. 6.
There is a major issue which we need to discuss and that is the
counterparty identity itself.  It appears that you have identified a
DIFFERENT party to the agreement, namely, a limited liability company named
""SITA"", which is not the entity which we originally proposed,.  This does
not appear to be the credit which we evaluated.

Also, we insist upon a Credit Support Annex.  As you know, the agreement
contemplates multiple transactions and the posting of collateral is a major
issue, particularly for long-dated pulp deals.

Can you call me tomorrow?  We need to address the major issues upfront.
You can reach me at 713-853-5620.  Thank you.  Sara

Weiss, Peck and Greer (WPG) has addressed the fee and margin issues noted in 
my previous email.

Fees:  We will not be assessed any fees from WPG.  Thus, I suggest that 
section 9 state this, or be removed.  

Margin:  Section 14 should note that margin for our transactions through Buy 
Side Direct would be maintained at our prime broker.  WPG would only request 
margin if our prime broker disaffirms a trade.  

Has the WPG attorney agreed to a time to discuss their agreement ?

Thanks.

Subject: Weiss, Peck & Greer Agreement

My only suggestion regarding your comments on the WPG agreement would be not 
to change the 2nd line of 5a from ""your Prime Broker"" to ""the exchange"".   

Mike Minnich emailed you and me the following language to incorporate WPG's 
obligation as our nominal counterparty: 

WPG is responsible for the clearance and settlement of all affirmed trades
executed on the BuySideDirect trading system.

This appears reasonable to me (unless you or Sara feel that this could be 
interpretted as excluding trades for which the other counterparty fails).

Rather than waiting until my issues regarding fees (#9) and margin (#14) are 
resolved, I suggest that you forward your comments to Mike Minnich (who will 
provide to WPG's attorneys) and note that we have requested an opportunity to 
discuss fees (#9) and margin (#14) with Mike Minnich and WPG.  We suggest 
deleting #9 as our understanding is that we would not incur charges from 
WPG.  Regarding #14, we would incorporate our Buy Side Direct trading 
activity into our margin account with our prime broker.    Jason, I'll 
provide additional feedback after I discuss these issues with WPG. 

Please call me (713-853-9990) if you would like to discuss.  

Thanks.

Mike

working away (next to Dan Lyons, I might add) in my own little world.  We are

		 Subject: Online Trading Agreements - Credit Exposure

The online bond trading sites we are evaluating have stated that they and 
their clearing broker are our nominal counterparties.  However, I was 
informed yesterday by Weiss, Peck & Greer that our exposure on affirmed 
trades is to our prime broker.  (Our prime broker has exposure to the site's 
clearing firm.)  We confirmed this with our prime broker and with Sheila 
Glover.    

Thus, statements that 1) transactions will be cleared through our prime 
broker and 2) the site is responsible for the accuracy of terms of offers and 
executed trades (as Buy Side Direct added) may sufficiently address the issue 
of our exposure.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss.

Thanks.

Subject: Weiss, Peck & Greer Agreement

Weiss, Peck and Greer (WPG) has addressed the fee and margin issues noted in 
my previous email.

Fees:  We will not be assessed any fees from WPG.  Thus, I suggest that 
section 9 state this, or be removed.  

Margin:  Section 14 should note that margin for our transactions through Buy 
Side Direct would be maintained at our prime broker.  WPG would only request 
margin if our prime broker disaffirms a trade.  

Has the WPG attorney agreed to a time to discuss their agreement ?

Thanks.

Subject: Weiss, Peck & Greer Agreement

My only suggestion regarding your comments on the WPG agreement would be not 
to change the 2nd line of 5a from ""your Prime Broker"" to ""the exchange"".   

Mike Minnich emailed you and me the following language to incorporate WPG's 
obligation as our nominal counterparty: 

WPG is responsible for the clearance and settlement of all affirmed trades
executed on the BuySideDirect trading system.

This appears reasonable to me (unless you or Sara feel that this could be 
interpretted as excluding trades for which the other counterparty fails).

Rather than waiting until my issues regarding fees (#9) and margin (#14) are 
resolved, I suggest that you forward your comments to Mike Minnich (who will 
provide to WPG's attorneys) and note that we have requested an opportunity to 
discuss fees (#9) and margin (#14) with Mike Minnich and WPG.  We suggest 
deleting #9 as our understanding is that we would not incur charges from 
WPG.  Regarding #14, we would incorporate our Buy Side Direct trading 
activity into our margin account with our prime broker.    Jason, I'll 
provide additional feedback after I discuss these issues with WPG. 

Please call me (713-853-9990) if you would like to discuss.  

Thanks.

Mike

Sara:
 Thanks for your note and sorry that I haven't called recently.  I have 
joined some day time tennis leagues at our club and between that, Charles, 
Arthur etc.  life has been fairly hectic.  I keep trying to pick a good day 
to come up to the office, but so far have not found a day that works for both 
Bill and I but hopefully I'll see everyone soon.  By the way, you and anyone 
else in the group are always welcome to come out here!!  I know that it is 
far and that you all are busy but feel free to plan something if you want.

How are the legal assistant's and the rest of the group?  How are you doing?  
I must say that I am enjoying my time away from the office.  Charles is doing 
great.  He is now 13 pounds, 6 ounces and allot 23 inches.  He is growing 
like a weed and eats often which keeps me busy round the clock although he 
has started to sleep some more at night.  We are slowly but surely getting 
into a routine with him and I feel blessed to have Bill here to help.  It's 
hard to believe that 2 months has already gone by!  Time flies when you are 
having fun.

Anyway, hang in there and keep me posted.  Say hi to Mike for me and if he 
ever wants to play some tennis, please call us.

Hi, Susan!  I work with the FX/rate desk and Darren Delage is currently 
residing in Tokyo and trading.  I have a conversation this evening with Alan 
Aronowitz, John Viverito and Darren to discuss Japan issues.  

At the moment, Darren has exeacuted several trades.  These are being 
documented in Houston AS ENRON NORTH AMERICA CORP. trades.  I had assumed 
that all trades would be done in the name of the Japanese financial trading 
entity; I have no idea who is handling back office functions.  

Can you update me?  Thanks.  Sara

P.S.  We MUST confirm all trades."

Hi Sara--

There are open issues regarding the L/C faciltity, so Carol and I decided not 
to comment on specific clauses until those issues were resolved.  I believe 
Carol was ok with Section 18, but it was added shortly before she left for 
maternity leave.  Because we are still trading with you under the existing BT 
ISDA, the clause is simply meant to sweep-in any exisiting BT-Enron trades 
under the new DB-Enron facility.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.  My understanding is 
that we are now scheduled to talk on Wed. at 11am NY time. I look forward to 
talking with you then.

Regards,

Steve

Steven:

I am trying to finalize this master during Carol St. Clair's absence.  I have 
a
few questions prior to our comments.  They are:

(1)  Have you already commented on the new form of Letter of Credit Provisions
which Carol sent to you?  This is referred to as Exhibit A to Paragraph 13 of
Annex A.  I did not see your response.

(2)  Have you reviewed the latest Letter of Credit format?  I did not see your
response.

(3)  What is the genesis of Part 5, Section 18 of your redline.  I know that 
DB
acquired Bankers Trust, but did Carol ever review this provision?  Have both
parties agreed as to existing transactions?

Please let me hear from you.  Thanks.  Sara

Bill:  I am resending my earlier message which identifies the correct legal 
entities with which Enron Corp. would like to execute ISDA Master Agreements 
(for the purpose of entering into equity trades).  In addition to the 
entities listed below, we need to include ""Merrill Lynch International"" 
(""MLI"").  ENA just negotiated an agreement with MLI, so the Enron Corp. 
master should be fairly simple.  Also, Clint and Jeff are interested in 
transacting with Toronto Dominion Bank.  In that regard I note that Enron has 
an Interest Rate and Currency Agreement with Toronto Dominion Bank, New York 
Branch.  I'll review this agreement to see if it requires amendment.

Jeff/Clint:  Do want to deal with a specific Toronto Dominion branch?

All:  I will expect that Bill will provide credit worksheets and I'll either 
begin the ISDA process or change ""ENA"" to Enron Corp. on those agreements 
which have previously been sent.

Thanks.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Sara

All:  Before Rod became a Brit, we were working with Enron Corp. treasury to 
put in place some masters in the name of ENA for the following parties:

Bear, Stearns Internaitonal Limited
Credit Agricole Indosuez
CSFB International
Lehman Brother Finance S.A.
Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.
Deutsche Bank

These masters will be used to for equity deals on ENE stock.  The Treasury 
group has concluded together with Rex Rogers and V&E, that Enron Corp. is the 
appropriate swap counterparty for these masters and NOT ENA.

Who in credit will be available to assist me in this process?  Thanks.  Sara"

My understanding is that the following issues are outstanding with regard to 
the Buy Side Direct agreements:

Buy Side Direct Agreement:

Notice - Sara is developing proposed guidelines for notification (how + who 
should receive).

Indemnity (#6) - Jason and Sara will discuss.  

I would encourage you to discuss these issues without me unless you prefer 
that I participate.   

Weiss, Peck & Greer Agreement:

Fees:  We will not be assessed any fees from WPG.  Thus, I suggest that 
section 9 state this, or be removed.  

Margin:  Section 14 should note that margin for our transactions through Buy 
Side Direct would be maintained at our prime broker.  WPG would only request 
margin if our prime broker disaffirms a trade.  

Mike Minnich noted that WPG had agreed to our other comments.  Have we 
received a revised WPG agreement with these changes ?

As noted below, I have asked Sheila to provide information required for the 
BSD and WPG agreements.  

Please let me know if there are other issues which I should be involved in 
discussing.  

Thanks.

It appears that we are close to resolving outstanding legal issues regarding 
the agreement to allow online bond trading through Buy Side Direct.   Sheila, 
is your group the appropriate area to complete the Subscriber Application and 
Attachment 2 documents provided below ?  

We will also execute an agreement with Buy Side Direct's clearing firm 
(Weiss, Peck & Greer) which will direct them to clear our trades through the 
prime broker we designate.    Sheila, I will leave you a paper copy of the 
preliminary version of this agreement.  Is your group the appropriate area to 
complete the information this agreement requires on pages 7 and 8 - 
essentially, tax ID # and account # ?

Eric / Tom, please handle any communication required with our prime broker 
required before we initiate trading on Buy Side Direct.

Sara / Jason, please let me know if I am overlooking any other information 
that we will require from Sheila's group related to Buy Side Direct.  

(Approval from our Credit group is expected this week.)

Thanks.

I made the two remaining changes:

1. added limits on clearly erroneous policy time limits.  We will promptly
notify other side and will make a decision within 4 hours of the issue being
raised or by 6PM whichever is sooner.
2. deleted first sentence from 5.4

I am still trying to get further resolution from WPG with regard to your
insert #6.

I apologize for the delay.  I made the changes as discussed except:

1.  I did not put a limit on the Clearly erroneous policy--not because I
didn't agree, but because I did not see an obvious answer in the Nasdaq
agreement.  I will look at it more tomorrow, but I wanted to get this to you
rather than delay further.
2.  Striking first sentence in 5.4--I have not heard back from our lawyers.
Hopefully tomorrow.

Also, I attach the broker dealer attachment 2 which you said you didn't
have.

I think we resolved most of your WPG questions.  WPG is OK with all of your
changes except Insert 6.  I will try to get further resolution as to why
they object so that you can negotiate further if you like.

If all goes well, hopefully this can be wrapped up tomorrow.

Regards,

Mike

Sara,

Attached is a draft of the language that needs to be placed in all Michael 
Petroleum deals.  Janelle agreed with the counterparty that they will settle 
on the last day of the calendar month instead of our usual 5th Business Day.  
She is charging 6.5 % annual interest on payments they make to us for the 
days beyond the 5th Business Day.

I__________________________________________________________________I
(5th B.D.)       6.5% interest  
..............................................................................
....    (last B.D.)


Please let me know as soon as you can if this is ok. to put in the 
confirmations.  Call me if you need me to go up there.




THANK YOU SOOO MUCH!

Melba

Attached are two updated forms of the equity swaps we have created thus far 
for warrants and shares with public/private options, and language to cover 
conversions of preferred, or rights to exercise warrants, that are not 1 to

Stock Purchase Agreement ( I did not independently make the calculation), and 
that you may want to delete the reference in any case. I went ahead and 
returned the attached to Lisa Mellencamp without waiting for your response as 
they are trying to get these all in today, but if the 6% should come out, I 
can rerun the Proposal Sheet to delete it, or if it is correct or otherwise 
is immaterial, we can leave the Proposals alone on that point. Let me and

Sara,

Attached is a draft of the language that needs to be placed in all Michael 
Petroleum deals.  Janelle agreed with the counterparty that they will settle 
on the last day of the calendar month instead of our usual 5th Business Day.  
She is charging 6.5 % annual interest on payments they make to us for the 
days beyond the 5th Business Day.

I__________________________________________________________________I
(5th B.D.)       6.5% interest  
..............................................................................
....    (last B.D.)


Please let me know as soon as you can if this is ok. to put in the 
confirmations.  Call me if you need me to go up there.




THANK YOU SOOO MUCH!

Melba

verify that all changes were accepted.  I'll help with the application.  
Let's have Gary sign in the early a.m. (or tonignt, if possible) because CSFB 
cannot open the account this evening.  Also, per my vm, we need to ensure 
that the traders on my email to you (from Ellen Su) appear on the authorized

Attached is my suggested language.  The confirms already provide for Market 
Quotation and Second Method; the Optional Early Termination provision should 
be the only exception for using the Calculation Agent for termination 
purposes.  Of course, the Calculation Agent will determine AECO prices for 
payment purposes, but that is not related to termination.

I noticed we have a master with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C.  I 
am under the impression that there is another master with Duke that is being 
negotiated because the business guys said that the negotiations on an ISDA 
master agreement is holding up another power trade that the Duke entity down 
here wants to do through its US subsidiary ECT is negotiating with.  Could 
you update me on what is being negotiated with any of the other Duke 
entities.  Also where is Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C. located 
and what types of trades does the master cover?  Thanks for your help.

Party A may transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in

We typically don't resrict the jurisdiction of our Affiliates.

Mark-

Today, we received IBJ's responsive comments to the points that have been=
=20
raised, which are set forth below for your review.

IBJ has stated ""In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral=
=20
operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA.""  During our recent=20
meeting they did not deny that IBJ had entered into CSAs with financial=20
institutions.  I note that IBJ also raised the point that Enron had a loan=
=20
from IBJ of roughly US$ 100,000,000.
Jonathan Whitehead has raised this issue with John Suttle to receive his=20
input. =20

IBJ's specific responses are quoted below as follows:-

""Part 1

(a)  Agreed not include Affiliates of PartyA.

(g)  We prefer to terminate the Transactions when as a result of merger as=
=20
for a party, a surviving party of such becomes materially weaker than befor=
e.

Part 3

We usually accept to deliver a copy the list of authorized signatures only.

Part 4

(f)Even though deleting the word ""not"" in this provision, we can net the=20
payments with respect to the same Transaction.   Due to our system=20
incapability, we are not able to net the payments with respect to two or mo=
re=20
Transactions in the same currency.

(h) Agreed.

Part 5

(a)  If your suggested language is included, a Non-defaulting Party has to=
=20
continue to make payment to a Defaulting Party with no payment obligation,=
=20
which does not seem realistic.  We prefer to terminate Transactions when an=
=20
Event of Default occurs.  We do not like to include the provision which=20
releases a technical error.

(c)  Agreed.

(e)  We propose 5 business days instead.

(g)  We do not think the definition of the Affiliate includes a party's=20
branch offices. If our branch have a deal with Enron Japan, we will amend=
=20
this Master Agreement to include such branch as Multibranch Office.  We hea=
rd=20
that in most jurisdictions of the world,  it is not effective to set-off th=
e=20
obligations between a party and the other party's Affiliate.

(i)  Agreed to include this provision.

(j)  We do not prefer that a party could transfer its rights and obligation=
s=20
without the other party's consent to even its Affiliates. We might not get=
=20
approval of the transfer from our Credit Department or such transfer might=
=20
cause an additional payment of tax or other cost.

(k)  We will revert to you later.

(m)  Agreed.

(n)  Agreed to include this provision.

Part 6

We still prefer to include the provisions relating to the Commodity=20
Transactions in the respective Confirmations.""

I look forward to receiving your input.  I note that Jane McBride has start=
ed=20
here at Enron Japan, therefore I have copied her on this correspondence. =
=20
Looking forward to seeing you in Houston soon.

=09=09 Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT

 I had a brief conversation this morning with John Suttle (Credit) and it=
=20
looks like he's going to insist on the CSA.  We are going to talk tomorrow=
=20
and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments.  While =
we=20
have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a=20
master agreement, the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy.  Many=
=20
of these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have=20
trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents.  It would be=
=20
helpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a=20
mark-up.

Following are my points responsive to their revisions:

Part 1 (a)  The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the=
=20
possible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes (for=20
example, this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy=
=20
this agreement would be in default).

(g)  This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk=
=20
to the other party.  It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a=
=20
reason to remove it.

Part 3 The language inserted is much to vague.  Our original version spells=
=20
out exactly what is expected of the parties.  If the documents we listed ar=
e=20
not acceptable, IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we=
=20
agree we will put it in the agreement.

Part 4 (f)  By deleting the word ""not"" in this provision, IBJ is saying tha=
t=20
payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne=
t=20
(i.e. if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating, we each have to=
=20
make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o=
ne=20
payment).  This is not acceptable.

(h) If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent, we should use Enron Corp or E=
NA.

Part 5 (a) Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to=20
receive payments due even though technically in default under another=20
provision of the agreement.  Our position is that if there are no other=20
possible payment requirements due from the purchaser, the option should be=
=20
honored.

(c)  The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same=
=20
city.  For many markets in which we participate, it is very difficult, if n=
ot=20
impossible, to find multiple market makers in the same city.=20

(e)  The change to 10 business days is much too long.  This means we can no=
t=20
have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks!  We can go=
=20
as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market=20
practice.

(g)  Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t=
o=20
multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with each=
=20
IBJ branch as a separate entity.  This may not be an issue if we will never=
=20
trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we=
=20
will never do business with any other branch of IBJ.  We usually don't like=
=20
to restrict ourselves that way.

(i)  We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions.  If=
=20
there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu=
t=20
wholesale deletion is out of the question.

(j)  As with Part 1 (g) this section adds flexibility to both parties while=
=20
maintaining flexibility within the corporate family.  Given the frequency=
=20
with which Enron moves businesses around within the family, this section is=
=20
important to us.

(k)  This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha=
t=20
went into bankruptcy (and therefore default) while they were in the money. =
=20
We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement (without o=
ur=20
revision) we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds - a rathe=
r=20
high rate given their status as a bankrupt.  We feel the non-default rate i=
s=20
more appropriate.

(m)  I can't imagine why they wouldn't want this section included - it=20
protects us both.

(n)  You know more about this than I.

Part 6  These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them=20
individually if they object for some articulated reason.  If these provisio=
ns=20
are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation (a=
=20
significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it)=
=20
and we need to know now if they object to any of them.

Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects.  =
I=20
hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long.  I'm happy to discus=
s=20
any of these issues at greater length if you want.  It sounds to me like=20
IBJ's expectations regarding execution of documents are a bit high given th=
e=20
volume and nature of their comments.

Dear Mr.Viverito

Attached Word file is ISDA draft amended by our legal desk.
(please take the amended points as our comment on your draft)
Please check it all and kindly reply ASAP.
(CSA is not acceptable as I mentioned you before, and we'll check your
LETTER OF CREDIT after
the schedule is almost agreed)

In your draft, we cannot understand the meaning of ""EDGAR"" on page4,
so please show us what it is.

We are very hoping to conclude this process rapidly.
So, I very much appreciate it if you could send back your comment before
Holiday in U.S.(4th Sep)
(it's ok if only the rough prospects of concluding ISDA)

Best regards,
Konishi IBJ Tokyo

It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of eCommerce will ha=
ve=20
a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad=
=20
array of industries.  Through EnronOnLine, Enron has quickly become a major=
=20
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries. =
=20
EnronOnLine has been an enormous success since its launch.  Since launch, w=
e=20
have completed 67,043 transactions on line, with a total dollar value of ov=
er=20
$25 billion.  EnronOnLine is now the largest eCommerce site in the world.

We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very=
=20
specific reason.  In addition to providing a web-based platform for=20
transactions, Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the=20
site.  We stand ready at all times, in any market conditions, to buy and se=
ll=20
at the posted price.  This converts a =01&bulletin board=018 (the more typi=
cal=20
eCommerce concept) into a true market.  There are very few, if any,=20
competitors that can provide this capability.

We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be=20
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies.  If we are=
=20
correct, this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enro=
n.

Accordingly, we are initiating a major new effort to capture this=20
opportunity.  Effective today we are creating a new business, Enron Net=20
Works, to pursue new market development opportunities in eCommerce across a=
=20
broad range of industries.  It is likely that this business will ultimately=
=20
be our fifth business segment, joining transmission & distribution,=20
wholesale, retail and broadband services.

Included in this business will be our entire IT and technology group along=
=20
with significant talent and resources in market making and finance. =20
Initially, North America will provide primary direct support for staff=20
services and back office, however, over time we will be requesting support=
=20
services from virtually all Enron units to ensure continued growth and=20
success.  To facilitate the combining of commercial capabilities with these=
=20
new eCommerce platforms, Enron Net Works will work closely with the merchan=
t=20
functions of North America, Europe, South America, CALME, Asia and Broadban=
d.

Enron Net Works will be headed by Greg Whalley, Chief Executive Officer; Mi=
ke=20
McConnell, Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff McMahon, Chief Commercial=20
Officer.  These individuals will comprise the Office of the Chairman for=20
Enron Net Works and remain on the Executive Committee of Enron Corp. =20
Replacing Greg Whalley as President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron=20
North America is Dave Delainey, who will also join Enron=01,s Executive=20
Committee.

Global Technology will remain intact but will now be a part of Enron Net=20

as=20
an Enron global function.  Philippe Bibi will remain the Chief Technology=

Officer for all of Enron Corp. and continues to be responsible for the=20
development of worldwide technology standards and platforms.

EnronOnLine, headed by Louise Kitchen, will also remain intact and will now=

After my discussion with Julia I thought I'd try to clarify the documents 
that need to be generated.

1. Confirmation of the trade between ECT and Citibank under the existing 1992 
Master ISDA Document
2. New Master ISDA Document between Garden State LLC and Citibank with a 
Performance Guarantee from Enron Corp. and confirmation of the trade.
3. Master netting agreement that nets obligations under the Master in 2. 
above with those in 1. above without having to modify the Master in 1. above.

We are trying to target first drafts to have discussions with the Bank on 
Monday afternoon.  Please let me know if this is too aggressive to have a 
first cut.
Thanks,

I noticed we have a master with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C.  I 
am under the impression that there is another master with Duke that is being 
negotiated because the business guys said that the negotiations on an ISDA 
master agreement is holding up another power trade that the Duke entity down 
here wants to do through its US subsidiary ECT is negotiating with.  Could 
you update me on what is being negotiated with any of the other Duke 
entities.  Also where is Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C. located 
and what types of trades does the master cover?  Thanks for your help.

After my discussion with Julia I thought I'd try to clarify the documents 
that need to be generated.

1. Confirmation of the trade between ECT and Citibank under the existing 1992 
Master ISDA Document
2. New Master ISDA Document between Garden State LLC and Citibank with a 
Performance Guarantee from Enron Corp. and confirmation of the trade.
3. Master netting agreement that nets obligations under the Master in 2. 
above with those in 1. above without having to modify the Master in 1. above.

We are trying to target first drafts to have discussions with the Bank on 
Monday afternoon.  Please let me know if this is too aggressive to have a 
first cut.
Thanks,
Rodney"

Attached are the swap forms we have utilized in round one of the raptor off 
balance sheet swap project.  I have tried to clean them, and have also 
incorporated comments received thus far from Kirkland & Ellis, firm for 
Talon.  Please review these forms and provide any further comments or 
suggestions to them by Tuesday morning of next week.   As I mentioned, we 
plan to forward to you proposal sheets as and when received for all the 
remaining swaps to be placed into the raptor vehicles for preparation of the 
swaps by your firm.  We should know more about the timing of the next round 
of swaps next week.  As other and varied investments may be placed in the 
vehicles, we will ask that your firm develop the forms to be used on the 
basis of the proposals and any documents applicable to the underlying 
investment.  Finally, please finalize the memorandum on termination and 
forward to my attention next week, if possible.

Thank you for your continued assistance.  Please confirm receipt and ability 
to have comments to me by Tuesday.

Pat,
The swap is currently in ECT's books. We are working to see how we can get 
into our books, probably by entering into a swap between EI and ECT.

John:  The ""signature block"" for ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. trades done 
through the U.K. agent actually looks different.  It should read something 
like ""Company X, as agent for ENA"", for example.  Therefore, Insitnet needs 
to see the agency agreement between Company X and ENA (which is in the 
process of being drafted).  You are correct in that the original ENA/Instinet 
agreement will be utilized.  However, Instinet needs to review the agency 
arrangement before proceeding.

You are also correct about the ITG agreement.  In fact, ENA DOESN'T have an 
executed agreement with POSIT.  I spoke with the POSIT lawyer several months 
ago and was shocked that the service would operate without anything in 
writing.

Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

As ENA and ECT Investments, Inc., will be the entities where all trades are 
actually booked, I would not think that any new agreements would need to be 
signed between the new ""agent"" entitiy and any outside vendors (ie, brokers, 
online trading platforms, etc.)  The new entity will never take actual 
ownership of the securities.  Therefore, I would presume that the Instinet 
agreement should just be an addendum to existing documentation.  The 
Posit/ITG agreement will have to be an entirely new agreement because the 
ownership structure of ITG Europe is different than that of the States.  This 
agreement, however, should reflect exactly the same sort of 
structure/language as was used to negotiate the contract between ITG and ENA 
and ECT Investments, Inc. 

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks and regards,
John

For clarification.
Deutsche Bank is the new Name..  ENA currently has an agreement in place with 
BT Alex Brown who has been assumed by Deutsche. 
It apprears that only an agreement  with ENA was set up previously.  ECT 
Investments should have one,  as well.

or termination of any collar between Elektro and WestLB (since RMT was not a 
party to that transaction). Also, we have been unable to internally trace the 
source of the $387,250.00 received by RMT.  We are trying to trace this

Paul/Alan,

We need to have someone check into the legal issues associated with our 
trading equities in each of the respective countries we are interested in 
trading.  We need to get rulings on shares, futures and options for both 
exchange traded and over the counter activity for each country.  This 
""research"" should be performed in much the same way as when we began trading 
in Australia.  Some of the countries involved may have already been ""green 
lighted"" a few years ago.  The countries we need to look into initially are:

Germany
France
Italy
Norway
Netherlands
Spain
United Kingdom


Once we get feedback on these countries we should continue on to secondary 
countries which include:

Austria
Belgium
Denmark
Ireland
Israel
Sweden
Switzerland
Portugal
Turkey


I will leave up to yourselves to decide where this project should be 
coordinated from but as we are a US coporate and ECT Investments, the 
principal booking entity, is a US entity I would imagine it should be handled 
from the States.  Please let me know if anyone has any questions or would 
like to discuss issues associated with this request. 

Thanks and regards,
John

All:

Attached is a draft of a term sheet for a financial resid-power spread option 
purchase by EPMI from FPL for NEPOOL.  I am hoping to share this term sheet 
with the customer sometime early-mid afternoon on Tuesday 9/26, so I'd 
appreciate any comments you all might have.  I will be out of the office in 
the morning at a customer meeting, but will be available by cell 978-314-5614 
or pager 877-246-3206 (i'll be in the car for a good 3-4 hours between 8 AM-2 
PM Eastern traveling to and from the mtg).   If you have trouble reaching me, 
please feel free to go through Joe Gordon at 5-8956; Joe is an Associate 
newly assigned to the Northeast mid-market team (Joe will only be around in 
the AM though).  

Some specific points I'd like to raise:

Oil price index/curve -- Pearce Hammond (structuring) and I spoke with Dave 
Botchlett (our resid trader) Monday about:  (1) the most appropriate resid 
oil index to use; and (2)  the ""correct"" resid curve consistent with that 
index.   Dave did not sufficiently answer these two questions, so I called 
Paul Racicot and asked him what he thought.  Paul suggested using the Platts 
Daily New York Harbor Resid Cargo Mean index (which i've included in the term 
sheet attached), as that was probably the most hedegable index.  Other 
alternitives that I am aware of include Platts Daily New York Harbor Barge 
Mean and perhaps others.    We have the daily option to ""dispatch"" the energy 
or not, so I think we want to use a daily oil index rather than a first of 
the month index, etc.  Paul Broderick - do you have any thoughts on this?  
Assuming the Cargo Mean is the right index, we then need to make sure the 
resid curve we use is consistent with that index.  Pearce - could you perhaps 
connect with Dana/Paul Broderick/Ed Baughman/Joe Gordon to see if we can come 
to aggreement on index and appropriate curve.
Resid-power coorelation -- Dana - what coorelation do you want to assume;  
Pearce, please connect with Dana to confirm that number.
Janice/Ed -- if it's not evident, this proposed transaction is with the 
unregulated marketing sub of Florida Power & Light, not the regulated 
utility.  We have done other trades with this entity so I'm assuming we're 
all set with Master Agreement, etc.  Does our basic Master cover financial 
structures like the one outlined in the attached?

Any comments/feedback you have would be much appreciated.  Thanks

Regards
John

oil index to use; and (2)  the ""correct"" resid curve consistent with that 
index.   Dave did not sufficiently answer these two questions, so I called 
Paul Racicot and asked him what he thought.  Paul suggested using the Platts 
Daily New York Harbor Resid Cargo Mean index (which i've included in the term 
sheet attached), as that was probably the most hedegable index.  Other 
alternitives that I am aware of include Platts Daily New York Harbor Barge 
Mean and perhaps others.    We have the daily option to ""dispatch"" the energy 
or not, so I think we want to use a daily oil index rather than a first of 
the month index, etc.  Paul Broderick - do you have any thoughts on this?  
Assuming the Cargo Mean is the right index, we then need to make sure the 
resid curve we use is consistent with that index.  Pearce - could you perhaps 
connect with Dana/Paul Broderick/Ed Baughman/Joe Gordon to see if we can come 
to aggreement on index and appropriate curve.
Resid-power coorelation -- Dana - what coorelation do you want to assume;  
Pearce, please connect with Dana to confirm that number.
Janice/Ed -- if it's not evident, this proposed transaction is with the 
unregulated marketing sub of Florida Power & Light, not the regulated 
utility.  We have done other trades with this entity so I'm assuming we're 
all set with Master Agreement, etc.  Does our basic Master cover financial 
structures like the one outlined in the attached?

Any comments/feedback you have would be much appreciated.  Thanks

Regards
John

It has been agreed between ENA, ECTRIC and the c/p referred to below to, by 
way of novation, replace ECTRIC with ENA in a weather transaction.  Pls 
advise me of any particular form used in Houston for the purpose of such 
novation. Tks.

Steve, Catherine,

Please have your legal teams for ENA and ECTRIC speed up the process to put 
the
two ISDA Master agreements in place.
That should avoid future problems with documenting our trades.

Thank you in advance.

Attached is a first draft of the swap for the Raptor 2 structure.  Please 
consider the following questions and I will amend the confirmation 
accordingly:

1.  I have bracketed the concept of multiple notices for purposes of multiple 
partial terminations and therefore multiple Valuation Dates.  Before we 
eliminate this concept, I just want to make certain that everyone is in 
agreement as to how this swap will terminate.  [Do we want partial 
terminations based upon partial asset sales?]

2.  Assuming that termination occurs upon sale of 100% of the assets, I need 
to be sure that the word ""sale"" is sufficient.  Should we use ""financial 
close"" or some other term of art?  I have concerns that a sale may be 
contingent or subject to some waiting period.

Folks,

National Bank of Canada has forwarded the attached draft documents for our 
review.  I asked if they had electronic versions of the ENA - NBC  documents 
and they have apparently gone a step further and actually generated the draft 
Garden State - NBC documentation without the confirms.  Finley will continue

attached documents by mid-day tomorrow so that we can possibly get this in 
place.

Pat,

That's a good question. Actually we are still defining prices with Eden to 
see what we are going to offer Siderca.

Following steps:
Eden and Enron to agree on structure and pricing;
Eden will present the structure to Siderca;
Siderca has to agree to the proposed structure and prices and will start 
negotiating documents.

I suggest that we hold on until we agree with Eden on point 1, and once that 
is decided, we can start working on it.

Regards,

Rolo

---------------------------------



Pat,

Fede and I met this morning with Eden. For the time being, we are going to 
work with them on another deal (which I will explain below) and we will 
suspend the Swap deal that we were currently working on..

Eden - Siderca - Enron Deal

Eden has a full-requirement PPA (140MW) with a TOP of around 50 MWs with 
Siderca that ends on May 31st, 2006. The contract price is approximately $30 
/Mwh (adjusted with a formula) clearly out of the money.   The contract also 
states that Siderca will have to pay $12MM penalty to Eden in the event 
Siderca wants to early terminate the contract. We have proposed to Eden the 
following structure:

Enron will pay Eden an upfront payment of $12MM so that Eden terminates the 
contract with Siderca, and then Enron can transact with Siderca. Enron will 
sign a MSA with Siderca selling (financially) for around 70 MW flat during 
the term of the agreement.
Enron will sign a MSA with a Generator (possibly CTSN - an AES Co. - or 
Central Puerto) to buy (financially) 70 MW flat during the term of the 
agreement.
Siderca will sign a physical power contract with a generator for 70 MW @ spot 
prices.
Term of the agreement: Nov '99 - March '06.

One important point is to determine what will the concept for the Upfront 
Payment that Enron will make to Eden. Fede and I
thought about two options:
Dummy Option or,
Direct Payment to the Main Shareholders of Eden on an off-shore basis

I am attaching a slide were the transaction is described. If you have any 
questions about the deal structure, do not hesitate to call either Fede or 
myself.

Rolo

Nicholas:

Henry Steuart asked me to forward to your attention the revised draft ISDA
Schedule which I previously sent to Ms. Flynn. As I mentioned in my last note 
to
Ms. Flynn, the attached draft incorporates all of Morgan's comments and should
be self-explanatory. The motivation behind many of our comments was a 
conscious
effort to keep the credit terms nearly identical to those already agreed to 
with
other Enron entities.

Please review the attached and feel free to call, fax or e-mail me with any
questions or comments.

Duke trader is John Miller (713/260-6541). 
I am told by our confirm desk that the faxing of the confirm was attempted on 
September 11 and every day thereafter until September 26 when the Duke fax 
lines were open.  Upon receipt, John Miller called our confirm desk alleging 
that he never did the deal (the EOL ""back office user"" shows that the trade 
WAS done).
Please let me know if you need legal assistance.

FOR THE CITIBANK/ENA CONFIRMS:

Optional Termination:  Either party may, upon sixty (60) days written notice

Steve,
As discussed I have enclosed most of the documentation required.

1) Master ISDA between Citibank and Garden State Paper Company LLC - 
boilerplate ISDA will follow by hand delivery.
2) Schedule to the Master ISDA between Citibank and Garden State Paper 
Company LLC.



3) Letter agreement for netting and set off purposes between the Citibank - 
Garden State Master ISDA and the Citibank - ENA Master



4) Sample Trade Confirmations for the ONP & NP swaps between Citibank and ENA
     


5) Sample Trade Confirmations for the ONP & NP swaps between Garden State and 
Citibank

   


We are still working through the final numbers for the confirmations but I 
thought it would be helpful to get up to speed on the language in them and 
the netting letter now.  Also the right to terminate the trades as we 
discussed is in each of the confirmations.

 If there are any questions don't hesitate to call.  Let me know as soon as 
possible if you think there is going to be any difficulty in getting this 
closed by Friday.

Thanks,
Rodney

Folks,

National Bank of Canada has forwarded the attached draft documents for our 
review.  I asked if they had electronic versions of the ENA - NBC  documents 
and they have apparently gone a step further and actually generated the draft 
Garden State - NBC documentation without the confirms.  Finley will continue 
to drive forward on the confirms.  I would appreciate any comments on the 
attached documents by mid-day tomorrow so that we can possibly get this in 
place.

Thanks,

		 Subject: Garden State - Plan B & C

This should clarify my voice mails from earlier today.  I am a little nervous 
that Citibank may not come through and as a reault need to create a backup up 
plan.  The backup plan is to B) do the ONP & NP swap with National Bank of 
Canada or C) do the ONP swaps with Waste Management and the NP swaps with 
National Bank of Canada.   In order to do this we will need to create the 
following documentation:

1) New Master ISDA with National Bank of Canada and Garden State Paper LLC.  
There will be no netting side letter and no special optional termination 
event.  The Master ISDA should match the ENA - NBC Master exactly except that 
the collateral threshold needs to be $1million dollars.  Finley will create 
the confirmations.

2) New Master ISDA with Waste Management and Garden State Paper LLC.  There 
will be no netting side letter and no special optional termination event.  
The Master ISDA should match the ENA - Waste Management exactly.  Finley will 
create the confirmations.

Please let me know ASAP if there will be any problems in getting these doc's 
prepared for mid morning tomorrow.

Thanks for all the hard work on a tight time frame.

John:  I spoke with  Kevin Meredith this morning.

1)  Trade Date was 9/11.  EOL system generated confirm 9/12.  All fax 
attempts failed until 9/26 when fax went through.

2)  EOL daily volume excessively heavy (approx. 1400 confirms per day).  Duke 
volume extremely heavy as well. All Duke faxing  unsuccessful.

3)  Duke called Kevin and said ""haven't received any confirms since 9/14.""  
Kevin hand faxes all confirms since 9/14.  Duke makes no mention of confirms 
prior to 9/14.  Confirm desk runs a ""fax failed"" report on 9/25 and picks up 
the missing confirm.

4)  When Duke receives EOL 415670, John Miller (who seems to be the TRADING 
SUPERVISOR) calls Kevin (who signed confirm as agent) several times.  Miller 
says that he has spoken with the traders and no one did this deal.  However,

John:  Per our conversation, attached is the copy of the Duke confirm.  The 
Duke trader is John Miller (713/260-6541). 
I am told by our confirm desk that the faxing of the confirm was attempted on 
September 11 and every day thereafter until September 26 when the Duke fax 
lines were open.  Upon receipt, John Miller called our confirm desk alleging 
that he never did the deal (the EOL ""back office user"" shows that the trade 
WAS done).
Please let me know if you need legal assistance.
Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

The Duke trader that selected this deal is KRBARBER.  This is how the

With so much paper distributed last night, is it prudent to have a call 
whenever possible this morning with the three banks and all of the internal 
people on the line to sign off on the documentation and develop a plan for 
obtaining execution of all the paper?  I would think we need to have 
everything signed today in order to initiate the wire transfers tomorrow, 
which means we are basically out of time on negotiating the paper.

Let me know what you think.

Greg

Sara, I am forwarding this to you because as you will notice your last name 
has been misspelled.  I have been speaking with Peoples recently about the 
potential sale of some financial options via Enovate.  This has brought up to 
issue of the ISDA agreement.  I don't know if you are the one working on this 
specific ISDA, but I got your name off a document showing you as the person 
working in general on ISDA agreements between Enovate and third parties.

I will call shortly to insure you receive this, and one more to follow, and 
that you are the appropriate person.  If you need to reach me, my extension 
is 36900.

Thanks,

Steve

And so, for all of us, our families & our friends we ask:

    May we get a clean bill of health from our dentist, our psychiatrist, our
ophthalmologist, our cardiologist, our gastroenterologist, our urologist, our
proctologist, our gynecologist, our podiatrist, our plumber and the IRS.

     May our hair, our teeth, our facelift, our abs, our honey cakes, and our
stocks not fall and may our blood pressure, our triglycerides, our
cholesterol,
our white blood count, our weight and our mortgage interest rates not rise.

    May we find a way to travel from anywhere to anywhere in the rush hour in
less than an hour and when we get there, may we find a parking space.

    May we all relax about the third millennium of the common era, and realize
that we still have 239 years until the dawn of the sixth millennium of the
Hebrew calendar by which time the computer will be long since obsolete and so
will we.

    May G-d give us the strength to get through this presidential campaign and
may some of the promises made be kept. May we believe at least half of what
the
candidates propose and may those elected fulfill at least half of what they
promise and may the miracle of reducing taxes and balancing budgets come to
pass.

    May we be awe-struck by G-d's sense of humor as we realize that a
professional wrestler could have become president of the United States and
that
an Orthodox Jew has risen to prominence in American politics while remaining
true to his Jewish roots. It is my belief that G-d's joyous humor is the
reason
he really does not want us to touch our toes while exercising or he would have
put them further up our bodies; and, the reason so many of us take up jogging
is
to hear heavy breathing again.

    May what we see in the mirror delight us and what others see in us,
delight
them.  May someone, as well as G-d, love us enough to forgive our faults, be
blind to our blemishes and tell the world about our virtues.

    May the telemarketers wait until after we finish dinner to call us.

    May our checkbooks and budgets balance and may they include generous
amounts
for charity.

    May we remember to say ""I love you"" at least once a day to our spouse, our
child, our parent, all of our significant others but not our boss, our intern,
our nurse, our masseur, our hairdresser or our tennis instructor.

    And may the Messiah come this year, and if he does not, may we live as if
he
has, in a world at peace, with awareness of G-d's love in every sunset,
flower,
baby's smile, lover's kiss, and every wonderful astonishing beat of our heart.
May we smile and laugh throughout the year.

L'Shana Tova.    Sam

?Investing Wisely in Volatile Markets
When markets turn volatile, we have a tendency to turn our heads away for=
=20
fear of facing the ugly reality.=20

In the age of online investing, when we have so much information about the=
=20

=20
how is it that we miss opportunities that seem so clear in 20/20 hindsight?=
=20

The four following investment principles can make it easier for you to see=
=20
when the time is right for you to take action:

 1. Keep your interest in the market fresh
 2. Have a sell rule
 3. Diversify, but don't overdo it
 4. Have an accumulation plan=20

Sharon Lewis asked me to contact you about this.  Our client has instructed 
us that it is SITA which will enter into the ISDA master agreement.  SITA as 
the main company must have a better credit than the company that you 
identified.

We cannot agree to a credit support document.

We suggest that you evaluate the credit of SITA and then get back to us.

Kind regards
Susan

Sharon:  Thanks for your fax and markup of the Schedule dated Sept. 6.
There is a major issue which we need to discuss and that is the
counterparty identity itself.  It appears that you have identified a
DIFFERENT party to the agreement, namely, a limited liability company named
""SITA"", which is not the entity which we originally proposed,.  This does
not appear to be the credit which we evaluated.

Also, we insist upon a Credit Support Annex.  As you know, the agreement
contemplates multiple transactions and the posting of collateral is a major
issue, particularly for long-dated pulp deals.

Can you call me tomorrow?  We need to address the major issues upfront.
You can reach me at 713-853-5620.  Thank you.  Sara

Dear Susan -

As per our phone conversation of last week, attached for your review please 
find
a revised draft (both clean and blacklined) of the Schedule to the ISDA Master
Agreement. The attached draft incorporates all of Morgan's comments and should
be self-explanatory. The motivation behind many of our comments was a 
conscious
effort to keep the credit terms nearly identical to those already agreed to 
with
other Enron entities.

Please review the attached and feel free to call, fax or e-mail me with any
questions or comments.

Sincerely yours,
Mike Stolfi

     Attached for your review and comment is a draft of the Schedule and 
Credit
Support Annex to the referenced agreement.  It is our intention to replace the
existing Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated as of May 28, 1992 between
Enron Risk Management Services Corp. (now known as Enron North America Corp.)
and Morgan Guaranty  (the ""Existing Master Agreement"") with the ISDA Master
Agreement.   Under the exisiting Master Agreement, Enron Corp. executed a
$50,000,000  Guaranty in favor of  Morgan Guaranty. The draft ISDA Master
Agreement includes our updated form of Guaranty.  We can either amend the
exisiting form of Guaranty or amend and restate the exisiting Guaranty with 
our
updated form of Guaranty.

     Should you have any questions or comments, please  call either Sara
Shackleton (attorney) at (713) 853-5620 (email address:
sara.Shackleton@enron.com) or me (paralegal) at (713) 853-0975 (email address:

Dear Dan,  I have attached the updated PWD with the changes that you and I
discussed the other day.  I apologize for the wait, I ended up being covered
up by an avalanche for the last several days.  I hope that your trip was
good.

We are excited about how things are turning out with the project.  It looks
like the final project is going to be fantastic.

Thanks for all of your help.  Call me if you have any questions.

Lamar

I believe that, as you requested, I have now had executed and returned to you 
by fax copies of the commodity swaps between Enron Canada and each of RBC, TD 
Bank and Risk Management as well as the two rate swaps between Enron Canada 
and each of RBC and TD.  I believe the only other confirm requiring Enron 
Canada's execution in this transaction is the back-to-back rate swap between 
Enron Canada and ENA, whereby Enron Canada swaps the floating rate for the 
fixed rate with ENA.  You can send that confirm directly to my attention by 
e-mail and I will get it signed and sent back to you.  I understand that you 
will be attending to obtaining counterparty execution of these confirms.  
Could you do me a favor and, when you receive the fully executed confirms 
back from the respective counterparties, fax fully executed copies of all the 
confirms to my attention at 403-974-6707.  I am aggregating copies of all the 
documents relating to this financing for our files and will need the executed 
confirms as part of that process.

Sara, I am forwarding this to you because as you will notice your last name 
has been misspelled.  I have been speaking with Peoples recently about the 
potential sale of some financial options via Enovate.  This has brought up to 
issue of the ISDA agreement.  I don't know if you are the one working on this 
specific ISDA, but I got your name off a document showing you as the person 
working in general on ISDA agreements between Enovate and third parties.

I will call shortly to insure you receive this, and one more to follow, and 
that you are the appropriate person.  If you need to reach me, my extension 
is 36900.

Thanks,

Steve

Sara, I am forwarding this to you because as you will notice your last name 
has been misspelled.  I have been speaking with Peoples recently about the 
potential sale of some financial options via Enovate.  This has brought up to 
issue of the ISDA agreement.  I don't know if you are the one working on this 
specific ISDA, but I got your name off a document showing you as the person 
working in general on ISDA agreements between Enovate and third parties.

I will call shortly to insure you receive this, and one more to follow, and 
that you are the appropriate person.  If you need to reach me, my extension 
is 36900.

Thanks,

Steve

Sara,

We were trying to finalize the ISDA between PEC and Enovate.
Fred is going to be out of the office until Thursday, but I wanted to
forward the ISDA information he has been working on.
Based on the ISDA materials attached, do you know how close (best quess:
number of days, weeks or months) we are to finalizing the contract?

Thanks,
Brian

Hi Sara

We are Enron Trading Services Inc. (FCM) in New York. We came along with the 
MG purchase and report through London. 

We handle clear/broker US Futures and act as an IB for Enron Metals Ltd. Our 
client base is the Americas with an overlap to Houston. 

We would like for funds and commercial clients to have one Swap document 
including several commodities and Enron units. For example we understand from 
Per that you are working a document for Catequil that should include metal.

Justin

 Could you advise

Thanks

I spoke with Kim and she would like for Tim to explain the rationale.  He is 
traveling today.  She thinks this provision ""will not hurt"" to have in the 
agreement since Harvard does not want to change its form!  Also, why don't we 
say what type of entity Harvard is?  I think it are created by Mass. state 
law.  How does it go bankrupt?

Sara:

In answer to your question, Harvard makes and expects to get the
representation from its counterparts that they are financial institutions
under FDICIA because of the additional argument  we think it offers a
non-defaulting counterparty for netting and setting off obligations. The
regulation says that a party may rely on the representation of its
counterparty in determining whether or not FDICIA applies, giving it the
rights created by FDICIA to net and set off the obligations created under
the swap contract.

Harvard makes the rep, and it seems that Enron should be able to because

we ""engage in financial contracts as a counterparty on both sides of one or
more financial markets"" and we believe we meet one (or both but only one is
required to make the rep) of the following financial tests

 1. had contracts with a total gross dollar value of at least
$1billion in notional principal with counterparties that are not its
affilitates and
 2.  had total gross mark-to-market positions of at least $100
million in one or more financial contracts with counterparties that are not
its affiliates.

This rep has been made for some time in all relevant trade documentation and
is therefore a matter which is well known by senior management.I hope that
this addresses your concerns in this regard. Please do not hestitate to call
if you should have further questions.

The relevant regulation is found in Title 12 of the Code of Federal
REgulations Chapter II Federal Reserve System Subchapter A Board of
Governors of the Fed... Part 231 Netting Eligibility for Financial
Institutions Regulation EE.

Thanks

Kim Noble

this provision was necessary if we EVER decided to net physical/financial.

either amend all of our masters or put a separate netting agreement in

Since you're out the rest of the week from noon tomorrow, we'd really

can deliver it to LJM for their review. Then, we can hopefully sign the 
confirm on Monday. Thanks!

Per my voice mail. you need to insure that the right people in London keep me 
updated on execution and delivery of the appropriate service agreements to 
permit the U.K. arranger to act for both ENA and ECT Investments, Inc.

Also, you need to advise me of new platforms you are seeking as well as 
CONTACT NAMES and PHONE/FAX numbers.  In that regard,

(1)  What is Autex?  You have never mentioned this one to me.
(2)  I am contacting Instinet but will need the agency agreement which was 
requested earlier.
(3)  I am reviewing ITGL/ITG Europe.  (NOTE that Posit in the U.S. has no 
written arrangement with us)

Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

According to Mahesh, the London equity trading agent entity (Enron Investment 
Services, ""EIS"") has been established.  Therefore, once the agency agreement 
language between EIS and ECT Investments has been finalized we should be able 
to begin trading in London.  Instinet, Autex and ITG/Posit are all very 
important to our process and, where necessary, we need to get agreements 
between EIS and the vendors executed as soon as possible.  Who will be our 
contact in Legal regarding all of these agreements in your absence?

Thanks and regards,
John

 Office of the Chairman
As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and wil=

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=

program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=

=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
=20
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=

Please see the attached currency description for USD/JPY and EUR/USD. Unlike
the USD/CAD par forwards, these products are very straighforward - they are
simple exchanges of currencies at a specific rate on a specific date. For
example, the counterparty agrees to pay USD and receive JPY at 107.00 for
10/31/00. Just a simple forward transaction for internal counterparties
only.

Sara, please review/modify. Our goal is to have these approved so that they
can be added to EOL on Monday or Tuesday of next week.

Thanks,

Stuart

Bill:  To my knowledge, Enron Corp. has never provided a ""true comfort 
letter"" in these situations.  ENE has written a vague letter of ENE's 
relationship to its sub.  It is possible that the current ENE corporate 
viewpoint on providing ""comfort letters"" has changed.  Let me know what you

Sara,

John Glotzbach at Prudential (312-588-5613) has been calling me for credit 
support to back futures trading for oil, gas and financial trading.  I am not 
aware of where our broker agreements stand but it is my understanding that we 
will provide a letter of comfort from Enron Corp backing ENA and not a 
guaranty.  Has this position changed?

Let me know.

Thanks,

Further to my fax of 3 October we have SITA's instructions.

1 - Credit Support Annex :

SITA's position is unchanged. SITA does not wish to have a Credit Support 
Annex.  SITA have asked that ENRON come up with a proposal on the term and 
volume of the transactions on the basis of no Credit Support Annex.

2 - SITA does not provide investment services ancillary to its main 
activities. Do you have any news regarding ENRON on this point?

Bill:  The Enron Corp. board passed a resolution last week authorizing equity 
transactions on ENE stock.  Clint and Jeff are anxious to proceed with the 
negotiation of ISDA Master Agreements with the parties we have been 
discussing.  Please send credit to me for preparation of documentation.  As 
always, please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara

		 Subject: Enron Corp. ISDA Master Agreements

Bill:  I am resending my earlier message which identifies the correct legal 
entities with which Enron Corp. would like to execute ISDA Master Agreements 
(for the purpose of entering into equity trades).  In addition to the 
entities listed below, we need to include ""Merrill Lynch International"" 
(""MLI"").  ENA just negotiated an agreement with MLI, so the Enron Corp. 
master should be fairly simple.  Also, Clint and Jeff are interested in 
transacting with Toronto Dominion Bank.  In that regard I note that Enron has 
an Interest Rate and Currency Agreement with Toronto Dominion Bank, New York 
Branch.  I'll review this agreement to see if it requires amendment.

Jeff/Clint:  Do want to deal with a specific Toronto Dominion branch?

All:  I will expect that Bill will provide credit worksheets and I'll either 
begin the ISDA process or change ""ENA"" to Enron Corp. on those agreements 
which have previously been sent.

Thanks.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Sara

All:  Before Rod became a Brit, we were working with Enron Corp. treasury to 
put in place some masters in the name of ENA for the following parties:

Bear, Stearns Internaitonal Limited
Credit Agricole Indosuez
CSFB International
Lehman Brother Finance S.A.
Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.
Deutsche Bank

These masters will be used to for equity deals on ENE stock.  The Treasury 
group has concluded together with Rex Rogers and V&E, that Enron Corp. is the 
appropriate swap counterparty for these masters and NOT ENA.

Who in credit will be available to assist me in this process?  Thanks.  Sara

I believe the ISDA is ready to be signed, and credit has been approved. Sara, 
do we have signature pages yet? I think we want to confirm it under the ISDA 
but not until we have signature pages.

The DRAFT on this trade was sent in (executed) ISDA form. We are we 
anticipating a signed ISDA Master Agreement ? How should I confirm this trade?

Has Credit approved the transaction?

Hi Sara -

Hope we get to see you next time you're up here! I don't know when we'll be 
able to ship direct to TX - it's too dicey right now, but there are lawsuits 
underway that will hopefully change all that in the not too distant future. 
As to the sales tax issue in selected other states: in NY,
FL, & MI the only way to ship there is through a shipper that is also a 
licensed wholesaler & retailer in that state, and to do so they must charge 
the local sales tax to run it through the three-tier system within that 
state. In Louisiana, wineries must have a permit to ship there, and
they have just (in the last few weeks) made it a condition of the permit that 
the winery must collect LA sales tax and file reports with the state every 
month. What a pain! Someday soon this will all get a lot easier, we hope...

Thanks so much for your interest, and your order - enjoy the wine!

All the best,

Scott & Martha Wright

Hi Sara

We are Enron Trading Services Inc. (FCM) in New York. We came along with the 
MG purchase and report through London. 

We handle clear/broker US Futures and act as an IB for Enron Metals Ltd. Our 
client base is the Americas with an overlap to Houston. 

We would like for funds and commercial clients to have one Swap document 
including several commodities and Enron units. For example we understand from 
Per that you are working a document for Catequil that should include metal.

Justin

 Could you advise

Thanks

Jordan:  Congratulations on your promotion!  

I am forwarding to ;you one of the Raptor 2 hedges which was to be finalized 
earlier this month.  My most recent draft was dated October 5 and I never 
received comments until this morning (from Ryan Siurek) which prompted the 
revisions attached.  Ryan is also expecting comments from Rodney Faldon.  

I don't know if you have been updated on the various Raptor swaps which have 
been created over the past few months.  The attached is to hedge ESA assets.  
I'd be glad to give you a brief overview, as would Ryan.  Thanks.  Sara

John:  The Duke issue has arisen once again in connection with the 
settlements group.  Did you ever resolve the issue?
Apparently, two (2) identical trades were executed online on 9/11/00, one at 
1:14 pm and the second at 1:28 pm.  Duke agrees wtih the first trade but not 
the second.  Please bring me up to date.  Thanks.  Sara

		 Subject: EOL Duke Deal - commercial resolution  FOLLOWUP

John:  I spoke with  Kevin Meredith this morning.

1)  Trade Date was 9/11.  EOL system generated confirm 9/12.  All fax 
attempts failed until 9/26 when fax went through.

2)  EOL daily volume excessively heavy (approx. 1400 confirms per day).  Duke 
volume extremely heavy as well. All Duke faxing  unsuccessful.

3)  Duke called Kevin and said ""haven't received any confirms since 9/14.""  
Kevin hand faxes all confirms since 9/14.  Duke makes no mention of confirms 
prior to 9/14.  Confirm desk runs a ""fax failed"" report on 9/25 and picks up 
the missing confirm.

4)  When Duke receives EOL 415670, John Miller (who seems to be the TRADING 
SUPERVISOR) calls Kevin (who signed confirm as agent) several times.  Miller 
says that he has spoken with the traders and no one did this deal.  However, 
this deal shows up on the ""back office user.""

Let me know if you need anything further.  Kevin's number is 39555.  Sara

John:  Per our conversation, attached is the copy of the Duke confirm.  The 
Duke trader is John Miller (713/260-6541). 
I am told by our confirm desk that the faxing of the confirm was attempted on 
September 11 and every day thereafter until September 26 when the Duke fax 
lines were open.  Upon receipt, John Miller called our confirm desk alleging 
that he never did the deal (the EOL ""back office user"" shows that the trade 
WAS done).
Please let me know if you need legal assistance.

Ellen asked me to check with you regarding where we stand on the Warburg 
Dillon Read repo agreement.  Could you let me know?

Also,  I had faxed a BNP Paribas confirm to legal for review last Thursday, 
and I believe Tana or Kaye was going to put in on your desk.  Have you had a 
chance to review this document?  Let me know if we need to make any changes.  
Thank you.

Hope you had a good vacation!

Bill:  I am resending my earlier message which identifies the correct legal 
entities with which Enron Corp. would like to execute ISDA Master Agreements 
(for the purpose of entering into equity trades).  In addition to the 
entities listed below, we need to include ""Merrill Lynch International"" 
(""MLI"").  ENA just negotiated an agreement with MLI, so the Enron Corp. 
master should be fairly simple.  Also, Clint and Jeff are interested in 
transacting with Toronto Dominion Bank.  In that regard I note that Enron has 
an Interest Rate and Currency Agreement with Toronto Dominion Bank, New York 
Branch.  I'll review this agreement to see if it requires amendment.

Jeff/Clint:  Do want to deal with a specific Toronto Dominion branch?

All:  I will expect that Bill will provide credit worksheets and I'll either 
begin the ISDA process or change ""ENA"" to Enron Corp. on those agreements 
which have previously been sent.

Thanks.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Sara

Bear, Stearns Internaitonal Limited
Credit Agricole Indosuez
CSFB International
Lehman Brother Finance S.A.
Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.

These masters will be used to for equity deals on ENE stock.  The Treasury

		 Subject: Merrill Lynch Confirmation

Good Afternoon Sara,

Here is the original confirmation created for the FX trade that took place on 
9/26/00. The comments provided by Merrill are as follows:

1) The want to reflect ""Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc., New 
York""(MLCSNY) rather than ""Merrill Lynch International Bank"" (MLIB).

2) They want to reference the Master Agreement dated 12/2/92 rather than 
7/1/95

3) They want to change the wire instructions to correspond with Merrill Lynch 
Capital Services, Inc., New York.

They penciled in there comments and returned the comments via fax. 

The questions are as follows:

1) Is this acceptable?

2) If so, should we just countersign on the version wherein they made their 
corrections and return to them?

3) If not, should we recreate a new confirm with the requested changes?

4) Going forward if there is a Merrill Lynch London trade, should we be using 
MLCSNY or MLIB?

We have historically only booked Interest Rate Swaps with MLCSNY until now.

Looking forward to your response.

Have a great weekend!

Regards,

Jorge

Brent:  

In order to track the proliferation of electronic trading agreements, 
licensing/software agreements and electronic platforms, we (Sam, Stephanie 
and me) have established a ""process"" which includes the following:

1.  sending immediate email to Ted Murphy, legal and credit (Bradford) from 
the commercial group identifying the Enron party needing the agreement, and 
necessity for agreement

2.  depending on the type of agreement, credit may or may not need to get 
involved.

3.  the paralegals enter the agreement onto Lotus Notes so that we can track 
the process.

4.  upon execution, a copy of the agreement is kept in a red file (near Sam's 
desk), a copy is sent to Ted Murphy, and the original is sent to global 
contracts.

Good Afternoon Sara,

Here is the original confirmation created for the FX trade that took place on 
9/26/00. The comments provided by Merrill are as follows:

1) The want to reflect ""Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc., New 
York""(MLCSNY) rather than ""Merrill Lynch International Bank"" (MLIB).

2) They want to reference the Master Agreement dated 12/2/92 rather than 
7/1/95

3) They want to change the wire instructions to correspond with Merrill Lynch 
Capital Services, Inc., New York.

They penciled in there comments and returned the comments via fax. 

The questions are as follows:

1) Is this acceptable?

2) If so, should we just countersign on the version wherein they made their 
corrections and return to them?

3) If not, should we recreate a new confirm with the requested changes?

4) Going forward if there is a Merrill Lynch London trade, should we be using 
MLCSNY or MLIB?

We have historically only booked Interest Rate Swaps with MLCSNY until now.

Looking forward to your response.

Have a great weekend!

Regards,

Jorge

(1) I have a message into Mark Seffinger at ING Barings with respect to item 
1.

(2) I left a message with Mark Elliott.  I still have not heard from him.

>>> <Sara.Shackleton@enron.com> 10/24/00 05:32PM >>>
Jason:  (1)  You were going to verify whether or not arbitration (for the
executing brokers) is mandatory.  Have you heard anything?

(2)  Did you ever speak with Mark Elliott about ITG?  Are you still having
problems connecting with him?

Sara

transacting on EOL (for the legal department).  He was asking about 
arbitration and other items.  He didn't specifically ask for GTC's so you may 
want to inquire.  Thanks.  Sara

Jim:

Pursuant to our recent conversation, I have attached below a DRAFT of ENA's 
standard (1) municipal ISDA Schedule and (2) Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit 
Support Annex.  These two documents are intended to supplement the 
boilerplate for the ISDA Master Agreement and the ISDA Credit Support Annex.  
The forms are generic, that is, they have not been tailored for use by a 
specific municipal counterparty; they would necessarily be the subject of 
specific negotiations.  

Energy New England's agency relationship with the various municipalities 
appears to cover physical trading.  Notwithstanding the agency agreement, the 
financial trading world requires much more specificity, including but not 
limited to, evidence of authority to execute a master financial agreement and 
transactions thereunder.  Additional information, including a legal opinion, 
is also required.  

I assume from our prior conversation that you already have in your possession 
copies of the ISDA boilerplate.  Please advise otherwise.

You should feel free to contact Ed Sacks with questions regarding collateral 
support documentation.  As I mentioned, the attached Paragraph 13 has not 
been customized.

Please feel free to call if you have any questions.

Sara

Confirming receipt of the draft Schedule and
the Credit Support Annex to the ISDA Master
Agreement.

I have talked to Joe Gordon this afternoon
regarding the credit & collateral issues.

It is my understanding that Enron would
prefer to have the agreement in place &
we would hold back on transactions pending
further credit discussions with Ed Sacks.

I am out of town on Thursday & Friday; I will
touch base with you on Monday.

Thanks again for your assistance in this regard.

Attached, in Word Perfect, are the initial drafts of the closing documents 
necessary for the new Hawaii II 125-0 two year facility.  The documents are 
marked against the original Hawaii 125-0 facility entered into in March of 
this year.

Please note that it is the intention of Enron to roll over all of the 
tranches in the current Hawaii facility into this two year facility on the 
closing date.  Accordingly, we have utilized the existing trust and merely 
amended and restated the trust agreement (renaming the trust Hawaii II 
125-0).  Because we are utilizing the same trust, I believe that we can roll 
over the existing tranches with minimal paperwork - perhaps one omnibus 
amendment for each series, setting forth the appropriate references to the 
new Nov 15 documents.

I will send Hawaii I 125-0 Facility documents, marked against the Hawaii 
II125-0 Facility documents on or before Monday morning.

The attached documents are identified as follows:

Closing Checklist (266026)
Second Amended and Restated Trust Agmt (265272)
RADA (265275)

All:  I spoke with Kim this morning and although she is anxious to meet 
everyone, we decided that it would be more productive to try to schedule a 
luncheon meeting to discuss current issues related to the confirmation desk.  
I understand that Joe Hunter, Melissa Murphy and David Dupre will be 
providing Kim with a list of ""issues"" and we have been invited to add to that 
list.

Please send me your list of any confirmation issues that you would like 
raised with Kim which I will cumulate and forward.

You may ignore the message below.  Thanks.  Sara

this ISDA and I left a message today with her to see exactly when she sent it 
out.  She is out of her office until Wednesday so, I may not receive a

When I spoke to her on July 28th, she said that they were sending the

Steve:  I don't believe that I have seen a revised forward confirmation since 
our conversations in mid-September.  I have only a ""draft"" confirmation dated 
May , 2000 which I marked and which served as the basis of further 
discussions.  Also, I thought that CSFB was going to send language addressing 
concerns raised by EITF Issue No. 00-19.  FYI, I have not received comments 
from Mike Enerson.

Is someone in your shop preparing a revised confirmation?  

Thanks.  Sara "

Actually, I can't.  I just checked my calendar and I have a meeting at
