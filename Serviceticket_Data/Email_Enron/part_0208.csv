Subject: Memo to Colin Jackson re: Australia

Attached please find a draft memo to Colin Jackson regarding his role in 
Australia. I have tried to combine the tax and legal concerns into one memo 
so it will be easier for everyone to keep track of. I hope I have accurately 
reflected all relevant points - if not please feel free to make amendments. 




If possible, please respond with any comments by the end of business on 
Thursday, Sept. 9th.  

Many thanks, 

Shari

guaranty you attached was the correct form. I understand you talked to Kris
and agreed that the original form distributed was not the preferred
document. Was the attached guaranty another copy of the first form of
guaranty distributed, or is the updated version?"

Bob:  I haven't commented on preferred guaranty formats, I only asked Kris to 
fax the form of guaranty which Ed Wood had sent originally.  I thought that 
the e-mailed guaranty was the same as Ed Wood had distributed but I hadn't 
verified that item prior to sending.  I have not had a chance to review 
Kris's fax   If you have your own form, please send and we can review.  Sara

BRAZIL: INB EXPORTS NUCLEAR FUELS AND PARTS
Gazeta Mercantil, 12 Apr 2000, p. A-9:-
 The Brazilian state-owned nuclear power company INB (Industrias Nucleares do 
Brasil) is exporting fuels elements (modules for uranium tablet storage in 
nuclear power stations) to the US company Westinghouse.
The company also has a contract to export uranium powder to the German 
company Siemens, being 150 tonnes in 5 years.
INB is also negotiating with the French company Cogema to export the excess 
production of its plant in the city of Resende (state of Rio de Janeiro), 
expecting to sign the contract soon. The plant has capacity to produce 160 
tonnes of uranium powder yearly, power stations Angra 1 and 2 of INB only 
consume 50 tonnes yearly. INB started to produce uranium powder on April 11th 
2000.


BRAZIL: ANEEL TO EXPLAIN ELECTRICITY PRICE
O Estado de S.Paulo, 12 Apr 2000, p. b-10:-
 A request of the deputy Renildo Leal will be voted on April 11th 2000 by the 
Energy and Mining Commission of the Brazilian House of Representatives by 
which the criteria which were used to concede prices increases to Brazilian 
electricity generation and distribution companies will have to be explained 
by the director general of the Brazilian National Electric Energy Agency 
(Aneel), Jose Mario Abdo.


BRAZIL: CPC INTERESTED IN OIL/GAS EXPLORATION
Folha de S.Paulo, 12 Apr 2000, p. 2-2:-
 The Chinese Petroleum Corporation (CPC) paid the amount of US$ 150,000 on 
April 11th 2000 to participate of the tender for the concession to explore 
and produce oil and natural gas in an area in the Brazilian Campos Basin, in 
the state of Rio de Janeiro. This tender will be held on June 7th.


ARGENTINA: CARREFOUR ADVANCES IN PETROL
America Economia, 6 Apr 2000, p. 25-27:-
 The French hypermarket chain, Carrefour, wants to sell its own brand of 
petrol in Argentina. Although reluctant to give details, the company says it 
will respect its current contract with Eg3 until it runs out. Carrefour 
currently has 12 self-service petrol stations adjacent to hypermarkets in the 
country selling between 20,000 and 30,000 litres daily at a cost 12% below 
the market average. With 4 more stations to be added soon, Carrefour is 
paving the way to repeat its success in France. Although economic advisors to 
Repsol/YPF (owners of Eg3) maintain that Carrefour can not make money from 
selling petrol at cheaper prices, a Carrefour spokesmen maintained that if it 
were not profitable, they wouldn't be doing it. 
Petrol sells at US$ 1.13 the litre in Argentina, the highest in Latin 
America. The big players there, Repsol-YPF, Shell and Esso, tend to adjust 
prices upwards when international prices rise but not the reverse when they 
go down. Carrefour plans are being applauded by the government and consumers 
alike.


BRAZIL: VENEZUELAN OIL REFINING IN BRAZIL
O Estado de S.Paulo, 12 Apr 2000, p. B-2:-
 There is a rumour affirming that the project to install a refinery of the 
Venezuelan oil company PDVSA in the Brazilian Northeast region began to be 
discussed again when the Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
visited Venezuela.
But such rumour is not confirmed by the Brazilian state-owned oil company 
Petrobras.


URUGUAY: UTE-ANCAP ALLIANCE
El Observador, 11 Apr 2000, p. on line:-
 Uruguay's state-owned energy firm UTE and this country's oil company ANCAP 
will have to create an alliance to play as a holding in the negotiations they 
will face with the companies that are currently constructing the gas pipeline 
Cruz del Sur, which will link Argentina and Uruguay. The combined force of 
both companies may allow Uruguayan consumers to be benefited with lower 
prices and tariffs. The alliance was encouraged by Uruguay's president Jorge 
Batlle. UTE also announced it prefers to construct a new thermal station in 
Paysandu, Uruguay, instead of transforming one of its plants located on the 
Atlantic coast. The move will allow UTE to obtain reduced prices from gas 
suppliers, mainly Pan American Energy, TGS and British Gas, all of them 
partners in the Cruz del Sur project. UTE is studying three different 
alternatives of power stations. First, a 120 MW-180 MW thermal station, 
second, a 240 MW-340 MW station or a 800 MW thermal station in association 
with international firms interested in trading electr
icity to South Brazil.


BRAZIL: AZURIX KEEPS FORTIFYING
Gazeta Mercantil, 12 Apr 2000, p.C-6:-
 Azurix, a subsidiary of the American group Enron, keeps using the strategy 
of small investments to fortify in Brazil.
Geoplan, the subsidiary of Azurix which won the tender for water and sewerage 
supply in the city of Sao Jose do Rio Preto (Brazilian state of Sao Paulo), 
will start an audit, which was a condition for the concession, in the 
regional sanitary division of the city. The contract will be signed 15 days 
after the end of the audit.
According to the president of Azurix in Brazil, Flavio Godinho, although the 
company was not pre- qualified for the tender of privatisation of the 
Brazilian sanitation company Manaus Saneamento, Azurix will try to acquire 
Embasa (sanitation company of the state of Bahia) and Compesa (sanitation 
company of the state of Pernanbuco), which may have their tenders held by the 
end of 2000.


MEXICO: ENRON WIL BUILT NEW POWER PLANT
Excelsior, 11 Apr 2000, p.:-
 The new power plant of Enron in Monterrey, Mexico, will start its operations 
by the beginning of 2002.
The plant will have an installed capacity of 245 megawatts/hour and 210 
ton/hour of steam. The Groups Vitro and Imsa are the first companies in 
signing an agreement with Enron. Mr. Max Izaguirre, president of Enron 
Mexico, said that there is still power capacity for a few other industrial 
companies that may be interested.
The companies signing the agreement will have to pay the monthly fee for the 
service and have to get at least one share in the Enron project, which does 
not mean that they have to be co-investors.
The Mexico power demand grows by an average of 6% every year. During the 
first quarter of 2000 the demand has grown substantially by 7.5%. The 
government projects the increase of the power generation by 22,000 megawatts 
within the next 7 to 8 years.

In reply to your enquires:

Infinity number 10300 is a hedge that was put on with SBPL.  This is to 
remain in place
Infinity number 25556 is a hedge that was put on for SBFL.  This is to remain 
in place.


The other deal that you enquired about was a simple passthrough of cash.  
This was a spot deal and has matured.

Subject: Re: About to trade Weather on Thursday  

Raymond can we discuss. 

(a) This is definitely a possibility. We could back the trade out to EAF 
through an ISDA Agreement we have with RMT (an Enron company based in 
Houston).  
(b) This is also an alternative from an Australian regulatory perspective. 
(c)  Conceptually no reason why not except EAF  has no underlying ISDA 
Agreement with SG USA. Also I suspect this would be less tax effective than 
either one or two. 
(d) Another alternative - We have an ISDA Agreement between EAF and SG 
Australia Ltd . Could these entities be the contracting parties?

Raymond it is really a tax call as to which is the most effective contracting 
structure. I have copies in Susan Musch (our Houston based tax expert). Susan 
have you any ideas. I suspect also there will be some Enron management 
determinations as to the identity of the Enron entity entering into the 
trade. 

One other point Raymond if ENA is the contracting party it really is outside 
my jurisdiction. I would request  Sara Stackleton (who recently assumed took 
overe from Shari Shackleton) assist.

Dear David,

We are about to do a weather trade with SocGen or Aquila on Melbourne 
temperature
Expected trade date is Thursday - 13 April.
Steven Vu, Head Weather trader in Houston will transact with above thru a 
broker in US.

Premium approx 700k AUD.


What is the best way in terms of regulations and tax - assume limits in place 
!
Houston is to take a  portion of the deal too.

(a) ENA trades with SG USA, then back to back transact between ENA & En Aust ?

(b) ENA trades with SG USA, then gives p&L to  En Aust ?
can this P&L be real income or shadow only ?

(c) En Aust trades with SG Usa ( thru Oz arm of US broker or thru US broker)

or any other suggestions ???

Pls revert :o)
Thx,  Raymond
12 April

Raymond

I am meeting with Susan Musch (APACHI's tax expert) and we will get back to 
you on the tax issues. Immediately I can tell you that back to back deals 
(with no spread) will not work. This raises transfer pricing issues. If the 
deal is SocGen on Melbourne temperatures, why is the counterparty not SocGen 
Aust? Is the deal pure trading, or is it being done to hedge a real exposure 
for Soc Gen. If the deal is being treated in any way as 'insurance' there can 
be issues with the cross border nature. 

I am in 2014 in 3AC if you are around and want to chat about it tonight.

Heidi

Raymond attached is the CDD confirmation form. I have gone through the 
comments on the draft Jerven gave me. The only change I made is the inclusion 
of a weather station number in addition to a name. There was a question mark 
next to the website reference and a comment that there is no quality control 
for public access. Is the website reference OK?

Sara this confirmation follows the ENA model. The changes  only relate to the 
differing measurement references. We also included a  paragraph 5 to further 
reduce the possibility of the trade being characterised as insurance. If ENA 
is the counterparty then it should be enough to reference the relevant ISDA 
Master Agreement and change the references to EAF to ENA.

Damian -

Actually we will need a set of agreements for both entities:

Enron North America Corp.
and
ECT Investments, Inc.

as both do equity trading. I have doublechecked and we did agreements for
both entities when negotiating the US - GS & Co. documents.

With regard to the signature page, can you just duplicate it and make one
for Enron North America Corp.?

Please call if you have any questions (713-853-9477). Thanks!

Sara, could we schedule a time to talk about the margin loan agreement and
the form of guaranty? I can do it anytime tommorrow (Friday) afternoon.
Kris will not be on the call. I would like to see what points we can
resolve before we resort to the business people. Thanks.

I'm on someone else's computer - I'm having all sorts of e-mail problems 
today.

The business person on the  EES side to be signing this letter would be Mark 
S. Muller.  He is a Managing Director of EES LLC.

I don't necessarily have a problem with the description of the back-to-back 
obligations, but I'd like to know Gareth's opinion as to whether the language 
is too broad.

Raymond can we discuss. 

(a) This is definitely a possibility. We could back the trade out to EAF 
through an ISDA Agreement we have with RMT (an Enron company based in 
Houston).  
(b) This is also an alternative from an Australian regulatory perspective. 
(c)  Conceptually no reason why not except EAF  has no underlying ISDA 
Agreement with SG USA. Also I suspect this would be less tax effective than 
either one or two. 
(d) Another alternative - We have an ISDA Agreement between EAF and SG 
Australia Ltd . Could these entities be the contracting parties?

Raymond it is really a tax call as to which is the most effective contracting 
structure. I have copies in Susan Musch (our Houston based tax expert). Susan 
have you any ideas. I suspect also there will be some Enron management 
determinations as to the identity of the Enron entity entering into the 
trade. 

One other point Raymond if ENA is the contracting party it really is outside 
my jurisdiction. I would request  Sara Stackleton (who recently assumed took 
overe from Shari Shackleton) assist.

Dear David,

We are about to do a weather trade with SocGen or Aquila on Melbourne 
temperature
Expected trade date is Thursday - 13 April.
Steven Vu, Head Weather trader in Houston will transact with above thru a 
broker in US.

Premium approx 700k AUD.


What is the best way in terms of regulations and tax - assume limits in place 
!
Houston is to take a  portion of the deal too.

(a) ENA trades with SG USA, then back to back transact between ENA & En Aust ?

(b) ENA trades with SG USA, then gives p&L to  En Aust ?
can this P&L be real income or shadow only ?

(c) En Aust trades with SG Usa ( thru Oz arm of US broker or thru US broker)

or any other suggestions ???

Pls revert :o)
Thx,  Raymond
12 April

Raymond

I am meeting with Susan Musch (APACHI's tax expert) and we will get back to 
you on the tax issues. Immediately I can tell you that back to back deals 
(with no spread) will not work. This raises transfer pricing issues. If the 
deal is SocGen on Melbourne temperatures, why is the counterparty not SocGen 
Aust? Is the deal pure trading, or is it being done to hedge a real exposure 
for Soc Gen. If the deal is being treated in any way as 'insurance' there can 
be issues with the cross border nature. 

I am in 2014 in 3AC if you are around and want to chat about it tonight.

Heidi

Would you please look over this omnibus option template that I took from TAGG

Many thanks,

This particular deal is for a paper DRAFT, but I thought  we should have the

****************************************************************
Brilliant; congratulations to the whole SmartPortfolio.Com team!
This is exactly the kind of newsletter I wished for. It is
written in a concise and precise way, just about right for those
who are participating in the market. It allows me to react in
proper time, and far more important, it supplies me with a
second opinion.

Chris Medernach

Let me tell you how impressed I am with SmartPortfolio's
reports. They are so informative, easy to understand and
amazingly accurate. Truly sound investment advice, which I and
my 401(k) self-directed account are thankful for.

Kirsten Strand


I 'm a ""short & sweet"" decision maker both as portfolio manager
and as CEO. My instincts are well-honed. All I need are
pertinent facts, the core elements of a given situation and
SmartPortfolio gives me exactly what I want. Nothing more,
nothing less, ASAP.


William L. Morgan, CEO
HATIS Corporation


It is perhaps somewhat unusual nowadays for one to comment on a
good or a service unless the comment is in the form of a
complaint, but I have to veer from what perhaps is the norm to
say...

**Great newsletter**...

I find the format and the information to be concise, incisive,
and of a great benefit in digesting the day's market action.
Plus, the letter contains informative, relevant news which is
not all that available.  All in all, you do an outstanding job
in disseminating information which I find to be invaluable for
my investment strategy.

Keep up the good job.

Jim Freyer


I am delighted to have the opportunity to tell you how terrific
I believe your reports are.  They are extraordinarily well-
researched, detailed and accurate.  I have recommended them to
so many people that I have lost count.   Again, SmartPortfolio
is the best product of its ilk on the Net or anywhere else!

Many thanks,

P.S.
This particular deal is for a paper DRAFT, but I thought  we should have the

Dear David,

Thanks to you for your prompt attention and to Jerven for finding Christian's 
corrected document.

Nick has commenced the process to put a global confirm which can be used 
woeldwide by Enron for weather derivatives, 
He has contacted Paul Simons , ex Clifford Chance , ISDA board member, and 
SFC compliance officer to kick off.

In the meantime, we will use the document below { CDD 13-04-00.doc }
but changes will still be further required - sorry :o(  

A.
Payment Date(s)

want to say that final payment from any adjustment is no later than 20 biz 
days after end of 95 days.
Avoids continual payments if temp is revised frequently in the 95 days.


B.
in Floating amount for 
time, and tighter defn of temperature
and base temp is 18

C.
Data Sources
I want to make the Final payment dependent not on website ( because website 
is not updated when a correction occurs)
but rather the final
Data Source is  ""daily temp and climate archive"" of the National
climate centre ( NCC) of BoM

Do you want me to type up changes for you to peruse or shall i chase up 
directly with Sara ?
Who OKs the wording of the confirm. ?


Thx, Raymond

Paul,
as per my voicemail - here is a draft confirm for weather - on the deems ISDA 
basis preparred by the guys downunder. Would like you professional input to 
help them with an interimsolution on this contract.

Further down the line (and this should also be encompassed in the web stuff) 
we need to have alegal group that works toward producing a master contract 
confirm that can be used for all Weather deriv structures and used in a 
global marketplace.  Just a quick job for a supremo like you!!! 

I'll talk to you on Monday when I get back into London about the politics!!!

have a great weekend

Subject: CDD Confirmation

Raymond attached is the CDD confirmation form. I have gone through the 
comments on the draft Jerven gave me. The only change I made is the inclusion 
of a weather station number in addition to a name. There was a question mark 
next to the website reference and a comment that there is no quality control 
for public access. Is the website reference OK?

Sara this confirmation follows the ENA model. The changes  only relate to the 
differing measurement references. We also included a  paragraph 5 to further 
reduce the possibility of the trade being characterised as insurance. If ENA 
is the counterparty then it should be enough to reference the relevant ISDA 
Master Agreement and change the references to EAF to ENA.

Marie:  I would like to schedule a meeting with you and others to review the 
agreement process, your contacts, account information, record retention 
(physical files and Lotus Notes), reporting procedures, any forms which you 
have developed and helpful tips.  I know that you are working on a memo which 
will address this information and it would be extremely helpful if we could 
learn from your experience. I would also like to discuss Ted Murphy's 
expectations.  I think this will take about an hour.  Please give me a 
suggested time during the week.  Thanks.  Sara  "

Dear David,

Thanks to you for your prompt attention and to Jerven for finding Christian's 
corrected document.

Nick has commenced the process to put a global confirm which can be used 
woeldwide by Enron for weather derivatives, 
He has contacted Paul Simons , ex Clifford Chance , ISDA board member, and 
SFC compliance officer to kick off.

In the meantime, we will use the document below { CDD 13-04-00.doc }
but changes will still be further required - sorry :o(  

A.
Payment Date(s)

want to say that final payment from any adjustment is no later than 20 biz 
days after end of 95 days.
Avoids continual payments if temp is revised frequently in the 95 days.


B.
in Floating amount for 
time, and tighter defn of temperature
and base temp is 18

C.
Data Sources
I want to make the Final payment dependent not on website ( because website 
is not updated when a correction occurs)
but rather the final
Data Source is  ""daily temp and climate archive"" of the National
climate centre ( NCC) of BoM

Do you want me to type up changes for you to peruse or shall i chase up 
directly with Sara ?
Who OKs the wording of the confirm. ?


Thx, Raymond

Paul,
as per my voicemail - here is a draft confirm for weather - on the deems ISDA

help them with an interimsolution on this contract.

Further down the line (and this should also be encompassed in the web stuff) 
we need to have alegal group that works toward producing a master contract 
confirm that can be used for all Weather deriv structures and used in a 
global marketplace.  Just a quick job for a supremo like you!!! 

I'll talk to you on Monday when I get back into London about the politics!!!

have a great weekend

Subject: CDD Confirmation

Raymond attached is the CDD confirmation form. I have gone through the 
comments on the draft Jerven gave me. The only change I made is the inclusion 
of a weather station number in addition to a name. There was a question mark 
next to the website reference and a comment that there is no quality control 
for public access. Is the website reference OK?

Sara this confirmation follows the ENA model. The changes  only relate to the 
differing measurement references. We also included a  paragraph 5 to further 
reduce the possibility of the trade being characterised as insurance. If ENA 
is the counterparty then it should be enough to reference the relevant ISDA 
Master Agreement and change the references to EAF to ENA.

Due to the timing differences I had a crack at including these changes.   

Attached is an amended confirmation. The only change I was not sure about was 
tightening up the temperature definition. Do you mean moving to greater 
precision in rounding? No problem but we are following the UK approach. 

I would be most interested in any comments Paul would have. By way of

Paul,
as per my voicemail - here is a draft confirm for weather - on the deems ISDA 
basis preparred by the guys downunder. Would like you professional input to 
help them with an interimsolution on this contract.

Further down the line (and this should also be encompassed in the web stuff) 
we need to have alegal group that works toward producing a master contract 
confirm that can be used for all Weather deriv structures and used in a 
global marketplace.  Just a quick job for a supremo like you!!!

Subject: CDD Confirmation

Raymond attached is the CDD confirmation form. I have gone through the 
comments on the draft Jerven gave me. The only change I made is the inclusion 
of a weather station number in addition to a name. There was a question mark 
next to the website reference and a comment that there is no quality control 
for public access. Is the website reference OK?

Sara this confirmation follows the ENA model. The changes  only relate to the 
differing measurement references. We also included a  paragraph 5 to further 
reduce the possibility of the trade being characterised as insurance. If ENA 
is the counterparty then it should be enough to reference the relevant ISDA 
Master Agreement and change the references to EAF to ENA.

Sara,

Org chart attached.

Per conversation with Jeff Kinneman who was in London this week, London Credt 
Trading will be trading in Bank default swaps .  The name of the entity is 
still to be determined.  Jeff will be authorized to execute trades for the 
entity and the trades will be in the name of the entity and not back-to-back 
with our books.

Maybe every other week.... or when we have a specific agenda item we want to 
cover in between (e.g. debt confirmations).
I would include Laurel who is probably impacted more than anyone.

Thanks Sara. I called John late yesterday and left a voice mail saying that 
we could begin pricing the deal while the lawyers worked on the ISDA.  I have 
not heard from him yet, either.  I will let you know if anything progresses 
on the deal side.  Will you let me know what progresses on the ISDA and legal 
side.  Also, if I am around, will you let me know when the conference call 
with the lawyers is.   I would like to sit in on the call.  Hopefully,  I 
will speak with John today and hear more about it.  Since I inherited this 
account from someone who recently left Enron, I don't know John as well as I 
would if he had been my client all along.  Of course,  I am not complaining - 
always happy to inherit a client ready to do a deal.

Thanks again for your help.

Subject: SEMPRA

It has recently emerged that we have concluded financially-settled trades 
from London with Sempra in the name of ECT (Houston).

Unfortunately, this could create a significant tax issue for ECT (Houston) 
i.e. a taxable presence in the UK.

Therefore, if we wish to continue trading with Sempra from London, we must 
trade in the name of ECTI (aka ECTRIC), but not ECT (Houston). 

This principle applies generally  - London should not bind ECT (Houston) to 
trades with counterparties.

Please call Janine Juggins or myself if you would like to discuss this.

Best regards

Paul

As part of the Sutton Bridge unwind, Trena has executed a foreign exchange

The business person on the  EES side to be signing this letter would be Mark

Attached is a ""high volume"" counterparty list for two categories.  With 
respect to the first category, Carol is handling BPAmoco and I am speaking 
with Cargill.  Should we address Neumin?  And should we actively try to 
replace existing ECT masters with ISDA's?  Sara

Anytime will be okay with me.  I have a 9:00 Lotus Notes training session 
this morning which should last until about 10:00, but I think I'm free the 
rest of the week.  Just let me know.  Erica is making minor revisions to one 
of the lists and the rest are ready, so I just have to do my short memo re 
procedures.

I've checked my notes and spoken to Heidi and it appears the delay was 
settling the mark up (107.5%) in the Agreement. Heidi believes that this 
figure can be reduced to 100% (which is current practice). If everyone is 
agreeable I will arrange execution.

going on!
I am trying to refresh myself on the type of trading activity which is 
currently taking place in Singapore (physical vs. financial, types of 
commodities) and the confirmation procedures (what is confirmed in Singapore 
vs. what is confirmed in London).  Is there a written set of procedures that 
I can see?  Should I be asking this question of Paul Simons? anyone else?

Sara,
Last week we spoke about a process to make sure we have Broker Agreements in 
place.
I spoke with John last week.  We will initiate the following immediately. 
 When we utilize a new executing broker, John will provide to us the name for 
entry into the middle office system and Kelly Templeton will follow up with 
the executing broker to get a customer agreement from the broker and forward 
to you in Legal for review.  
Kelly is currently following up with Hambrecht & Quist and Thomas Weisel 
Partners.  

John and I also discussed the level of risk related to different broker 
relationships and the required documentation:
Executing Broker: We do not have an account open with the broker nor do we 
hold positons .  We only have a trade settlement risk.
OTC Activity:  An ISDA agreement should be in place to cover the derivative 
activity.
Service Agreements: Instinet, Posit
Prime Broker/Futures Account:  Hold postions and dollars in account 

thanks. sheila

figure can be reduced to 100% (which is current practice). If everyone is

Attached is the Aquila/ENA weather HDD confirmation. A couple of points to 
note.

The Aquila company listed on the Confirmation is the one having an ISDA with 
Enron. I'm not sure if ENA is the Enron counterparty.
If we elect we can put a specific payment date in or just leave it to as 20 
Business Days after the Floating Amount is detetmined.
If there is an Aquila/ENA ISDA then that should be referenced  in Paragraph 1.

Paul:  Enjoyed your talk in San Antonio.  Now for the real issues:  could you 
send to me the confirmation templates that you have devised for credit 
derivatives in the UK?  Also, are there any other materials which might be 
helpful in the credit derivatives area?  Shari has passed this on to me and 
I'm reviewing a couple of Deutsche Bank transactions executed last month.  
Thanks.  Sara"

Attached is the Aquila/ENA weather HDD confirmation. A couple of points to 
note.

The Aquila company listed on the Confirmation is the one having an ISDA with 
Enron. I'm not sure if ENA is the Enron counterparty.
If we elect we can put a specific payment date in or just leave it to as 20 
Business Days after the Floating Amount is detetmined.
If there is an Aquila/ENA ISDA then that should be referenced  in Paragraph 1.


Will you pass it on

Marty:  I will have a response to setoff shortly.  With respect to the CSA 
and calculation of the ""Credit Support Amount,"" our change should not create 
any inconsistencies in the calculation of that amount among your 
counterparties since it would only change IF the calculation yielded a 
negative number.  The only reason for ""specifying otherwise"" in Paragraph 13 
is to capture the situation where the Pledgor MIGHT be holding Independent 
Amounts (if there are ever any specified in a particular Transaction) of the 
Secured Party as cushion (which is not meant to be returned until termination 
of Transactions) and subtraction of that amount would create a negative 
number when calculating the Credit Support Amount.  By specifying that the 
Credit Support Amount will be ""the higher of"" the amount calculated (deemed 
to be zero if a negative number) or the sum of the Pledgor's Independent 
Amounts, the latter would prevail.  This calculation method will make a 
difference if, for example, the Secured Party asks for a Return Amount when 
the Pledgor intends to retain any Independent Amounts as cushion (such that 
only Posted Credit Support exceeding the sum of the Independent Amounts will 
be returned).  I hope this helps.  Sara

     Hi Sara,
     Confirming or conversation, only 2 issues remain unresolved.

     1.  Please remove subclause (B) in Part 5(g) Setoff.  As we discussed,
         this contemplates including all kinds of ""obligations of any kind
         whatsoever"" and it is our intent to include only Energy trading
         under this Agreement.

     2.  Please explain the reasoning for modifying the definition of
         ""Credit Support Amount"" in Paragraph 13(b)(C) of the Credit
         Support Annex.  We would prefer to retain the intent of ISDA's
         definition to maintain consistency in the way this amount is
         determined among our counterparties.

     Thank you for all your assistance and I look forward to receiving
     execution copies of the Agreement if these two issues can be resolved.

     Best regards,
     Marty Oelmann

Sara,

When I sent you the following message on April 12th, I thought it was clear 
that Enron Australia Finance Pty Limited should not act as principal for 
entering into the non-power futures agreement with ABN AMRO.  Sorry for the 
confusion.  Rather, ABN AMRO should enter into the agreement with ENA.  
(Shane should only enter into trades under the futures agreement acting 
pursuant to the services agreement.  Of course, based on David's e-mail 
messages, it appears that the services agreement needs to be executed 
following resolution of the questions regarding the mark-up.)

Note further that as stated in my September 9, 1999 memo that I sent you in 
the April 12th e-mail (and that is re-attached below), our Australian tax 
advisor advised that if a master contract must be executed in Australia, it 
should be executed by an independent agent (such as a lawyer) having a power 
of attorney from ENA.

Hope this helps.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any further 
questions.

Best regards,
Susan

Subject: Australian Financial Trader Tax Issues - Revised Memo

Sara,

As we discussed, attached is the memo that I wrote last September on the tax 
implications of having a financial trader in Sydney.  As you will note, we 
followed a service fee approach to reimburse the Sydney office on a cost-plus 
basis for the costs incurred by the financial trader (including his 
remuneration).  Important in this arrangement is that the Sydney financial 
trader is not the principal in the trades but is only acting in a preparatory 
or auxiliary manner for the ENA financial trades.

As we discussed yesterday, I will forward the latest draft of the service 
agreement to you by e-mail.  David, could you send Sara and me conforming 
copies of the executed agreement?

Also, we should probably also discuss the status of the documentation 
relating to these trades.

I will be happy to discuss this memo with you in more detail at your 
convenience.

Best regards,
Susan

I am attaching my September 9, 1999 memo on the tax issues associated with 
the financial trader in Sydney.  It clearly summarizes not only our internal 
discussions at that time but also the advice that PWC-Sydney gave regarding 
using a mark-up.  Please let me know when you and Heidi would be available to 
discuss the mark-up in more detail so that we can quickly resolve this issue 
and execute the agreement.

Best regards,

recommend, if this hasn't already been done, that legal bless the guaranty 
language by Conectiv.

If you should have any comments or questions, please contact me at x5-7712.

Rgds,

 Tracy, as we have discussed, the CP's attorney wants to get this assignment 
in place before the end of April.  The CP's attorney calls almost daily to 
check the status of the assignment.   I know you are busy, but could please 
take a look at this document today?   Thanks!

Subject: physical option - proposals, term sheets, pricing


Group - we need to address the due diligence for executing the "" first "" 
physical option transactions in Brasil and for Direct Sales ( and Wholesale 
).  The initial industrial candidates are: 

Owens Corning ( 1.6MWs firm ). 1 site,  peaking unit.  break-even R$182/MW - 
5 year term
Carbocloro ( 10 MWs firm ). 1 site 3rd part re-sale(Copel) , monthly call 
option. supplanting product sales, estimate minimum incentive strike R$ 
125/MW  - 3 or 4 year term,  
O Globo. (1-3MWs) 2 sites, peaking units.  awaiting summary terms and 
conditions. 
White Martins (10-15MWs ).   8 sites (MG), intersite flexibility to adjust 
product between sites and maximize energy re-sale.  3rd party re-sale 
(Cemig). short-term capacity basis indutrial demand for gases short-term 
variable price - 2 or 3 year

In all four cases, Enron is buying the right to buy power and all 3 are 
executable in Q2/Q3.  We are expecting (hoping) to transact paying no premium 
- with the focus on the strike price itself being the profitability incentive 
to the customer.  However, we'll need to guage our pricing ability ( and 
appetite from a book and risk control point of view ) for option length and 
the forward curve, not to mention getting the terms and conditions into 
reasonably standardized and legally binding contracts.  

Wholesale. Am including Wholesale on the wire given both the synergies on 
contracting and pricing and given the significant potential ( benefit and 
opportunity to Enron's regional trading effort ) to launch the physical and 
financial option product line into the commercial Wholesale effort.  

Note:  Particularly to put options - how many LDCs would we expect to charge 
us anything for our right to sell them power at R$30 or R$40/MWh ( or have 
charged us  3-5 months ago for the right to sell closer to R$50-60.  

We're having first sit down with Remi and Sami this afternoon, Wed Apr 19; 
please shoot any/all additional inputs, insights.

Hi, Shane.  Here's a quick update.  As you can see, the Westpac ISDA is a 
done deal.  Susan Bailey (paralegal) had been holding the Commonwealth ISDA 
because she didn't have an address.  I asked her to email you for the info.  
I am working on ABN AMRO.  I' m also trying to keep up with you other trading 
activity.  Let me know if you ever have any questions.  Sara

I tried again to get comments from Gareth but had no luck.  Let's go ahead 
and print it out and get it signed.  Please be sure to insert Mark S. Muller 
as the signee for EES.  His title is Managing Director.

Sara,

I'm on someone else's computer - I'm having all sorts of e-mail problems 
today.

The business person on the  EES side to be signing this letter would be Mark 
S. Muller.  He is a Managing Director of EES LLC.

I don't necessarily have a problem with the description of the back-to-back 
obligations, but I'd like to know Gareth's opinion as to whether the language 
is too broad.

I am pleased to announce that as detailed below, we now have an ISDA in place 
between Westpac and ENA. Trading between these parties can resume as far as 
Legal is concerned.

David Minns is working on finalizing the ISDA between Enron Australia and 
Westpac based on the above agreement. I would expect that to be concluded 
shortly.

Subject: EOL -Enserco Energy

Brant, Tom

Enserco Energy busted on line today.  Although we are collateralized with 
L/C's, our exposure is increasing due to the size of the on line volume they 
have been doing.  ENA sent an ISDA draft to them a few weeks ago, with no 
response.  Today I spoke to their Credit Manager, Don Perkins, and informed 
him that we can not take on additional volume unless we have an executed 
ISDA. He is going to review, with his legal, the contract and will get back 
to me.  At this point I feel we should not take on any further transactions 
until the ISDA is signed.  Please let me know your thoughts.

Russell

Please forward this e-mail on to the appropriate EOL people so they are aware 
of Enserco's status.

Sara,

I tried again to get comments from Gareth but had no luck.  Let's go ahead 
and print it out and get it signed.  Please be sure to insert Mark S. Muller 
as the signee for EES.  His title is Managing Director.

If the letter is alright, I can have it printed formally.  I never heard back 
from Gareth with respect to any comments.  Just let me know what you would 
like to do.  Sara

it has not been completed and signed.

Sara,

I'm on someone else's computer - I'm having all sorts of e-mail problems 
today.

The business person on the  EES side to be signing this letter would be Mark 
S. Muller.  He is a Managing Director of EES LLC.

I don't necessarily have a problem with the description of the back-to-back 
obligations, but I'd like to know Gareth's opinion as to whether the language 
is too broad.

David

Tanya:  I left you a voice mail earlier this week on the single outstanding 
issue:  paragraph (B) of our setoff language.  This provision allows the 
nondefaulting party to withhold any payment it might owe to the defaulting 
party under the master until the nondefaulting party can be certain IN ITS 
REASONABLE DISCRETION  that ANY other payments owed to it (under ANY other 
agreements between the parties)  by the defaulting party have been paid.  
Cargill does not want to ""comingle"" its business.  Remember, we have already 
given in on ""affiliate setoff"".  [the lawyer never raised the paragraph (B) 
issue until this week!] 

Also, Cargill has requested that we change our Credit Support Amount 
definition (but I provided them with an explanation) AND Cargill has decided 
to issue transferable L/C's.

Please let me hear from you so that we can finalize.  I do not know if this 
is a deal breaker."

dealing with the exploration side of the company last year.  We agreed to (1) 
mark up the Flying J form AND (2) reissue the Industrial Master that had been 
negotiated last year (with our form changes).  John Scales (exploration side) 
wouldn't agree to the MAC at the last minute.  Do you want to handle?  Just

I called the publication and they told me they publish every Friday.  They 
don't take any months off.  She said they publish all 52 weeks.

If you have any questions please give me a call.

Thanks,

Hey, Sam:  Great to hear from you and I'm thrilled that your golf game is as 
good as ever.  Have you been playing in Palm Springs or Amelia Island or  The 
Boulders?  I was in Phoenix last year and thought it was wonderful except for 
the fact that people age faster.  I didn't go to Baton Rouge for Passover 
since the seders were in the middle of the week.  But I know that my sister 
ordered everything from the Second Avenue Deli in N.Y. and various other 
Manhattan establishments.  My niece has been accepted at that high school in 
Natchitoches for smart kids and Deb is really happy (and sad).  Jennifer is 
only 15.  My nephew is tall, handsome and driving Steve crazy.  My parents 
are fine and my Dad is going to have a knee-cap replacement sometime soon.  
He'll be 83 in June.  I've decided on in-house training for my dogs and the 
trainer thinks that CHLOE needs the most ""help"" since that sweet little 
bichon may try to bite strangers (and maybe friends!) in my home.  Otherwise, 
I'm rocking along.  You know, I never called Helen but I still have her 
number and I'll do it this week.  Hope all is well.  Do you keep up with 
Ron?  Love, Sara"

David and Heidi,

Hope you enjoyed your Easter holiday and your Anzac holiday!

With respect to your question of whether the financial trader services can =
be=20
charged at cost or must have a 7.5% mark-up, I received advice from Chris=
=20
Catt at PWC-Sydney last summer that there needed to be a mark-up for these=
=20
services.  Given the skills required by the financial trader and the risk=
=20
associated with the transactions, Chris advised that there needed to be a=
=20
mark-up over cost based on a recent ruling by the ATO.

The ATO issued TR 1999/1 in January 1999, which provides a safe-harbor for =
de=20
minimis services that are provided by an Australian company and meet certai=
n=20
monetary limitations.  Under the de miminis safe harbor, where the costs=20
associated with all services provided by Enron Australia Pty Limited to=20
offshore affiliates do not exceed A$500,000 in a year, the safe harbor=20
mark-up of 7.5% may be available.  Paragraph 86 of the ruling sets forth th=
e=20
requirements as follows:

""As mentioned in paragraph 77, the Commissioner will apply a similar=20
administrative practice in de minimis cases where the total direct and=20
indirect costs of supplying services to Australian or foreign associated=20
enterprises, as appropriate, is not more than $500,000 in a year.  The=20
practice applies to all intra-group services supplied or acquired where the=
=20
relevant cost limit is not exceeded.  Therefore, in some cases, it might be=
=20
applicable to all intra-groups services both supplied and acquired.  The=20
transfer prices that must be used, and the conditions for their use, are th=
e=20
same as those specified in paragraphs 82 to 84.  As for the practice in=20
relation to non-core services, all taxpayers in a group must use the same=
=20
mark-up, for incoming and outgoing services, in respect of each foreign=20
jurisdiction, but the mark-up may vary from country to country, within the=
=20
limits described above.

Example

An Australian subsidiary of a foreign based multinational group receives=20
marketing and technical assistance from a foreign associate. No other=20
services are acquired by any Australian member of the group from its foreig=
n=20
associated enterprises.  The total direct and indirect costs of providing t=
he=20
services to the Australian subsidiary for the year are $200,000.  As long a=
s=20
the amount actually charged for the services is not more than $215,000 (or=
=20
$220,000 in the circumstances outlined in paragraph 83), the Commissioner=
=20
would not require the taxpayer to establish an arm=01,s length price for th=
e=20
services.""

Based on discussions we had late last summer, we thought that the A$500,000=
=20
threshold could be met.

To my knowledge, the recent changes and proposed changes to the Australian=
=20
tax rules would not affect TR 1999/1.  Please let me know if you have seen=
=20
anything to the contrary.  Consequently, to my knowledge, we are still unde=
r=20
these guidelines.  I=01,m not sure, David, what you mean by 100% being curr=
ent=20
practice as stated in your April 18th e-mail.  I am guessing that you are=
=20
referring to the services provided under the cost sharing agreement.  Under=
=20
that agreement, office costs are being shared by Enron Australia Pty Limite=
d=20
and 3 other Australian entities.  Here, services are being provided to an=
=20
off-shore affiliate.  As a result, it appears that TR 1999/1 would require =
a=20
mark-up.

I will be happy to discuss this with you both at your convenience.

Best regards,
Susan

Subject:  Igaras Prepay - Next Steps

The structure for the financial prepay doesn't seem  to work under the 
Brazilian regulation therefore we need to come up with a different structure. 
David has put together a couple of different structures but basically all of 
them will run into the same problem and the Central Bank won't accept those.

We (Gustavo and I) had lunch last Thursday with a Mr. Jose Lavia owner of 
Fair Corretora (a brokerage house that I've worked with) basically he thinks 
that the financial prepay structure is not going to work because the Central 
Bank wants to see benefits for the country and impacts in the country's 
current balance.
He asked us to send him a draft of the structure and he will discuss with his 
partners to see if they came up with different ideas.

Below are the comments of the next steps and ideas from Antonio Felix 
(Tozzini Freire).


Central Bank:
As recommended by Antonio Felix from Tozzini Freire, we need to decide if 
this is a deal/structure we want to continue to pursue. If so we should 
schedule a meeting with the International Operations Director of the Central 
Bank in Brasilia and make a presentation covering the following points:

- The overall structure
- Market need
- Benefits to the companies involved (petrochemical, pulp and paper) - 
Benefits to Brazil ? (if any)

We should approach this not as a single transaction but as a new product, 
with specific characteristics, without any similar in the market, that Enron 
developed in the US and is trying to ""sell"" in Brazil.


Swaps:
A swap in Brazil can be arranged between two local parties and neither one 
needs to be a financial institution. If we want we can have a brokerage house 
or bank in the middle to register the contract with the BM&F (Mercantile 
Exchange).
The other possibility is to have a swap contract between a local and an 
offshore entity, in this case the offshore entity needs to be a financial 
institution.
Is one of the Enron companies in the US considered to be a financial 
institution ?

A specialist form Tozzini should be sending us some paper covering swap 
contracts. I hope to have a better understanding of the requirements for swap 
contracts after we receive that.

Yao Apasu: Andrea mentioned that you were involved with some swap contracts 
in Brazil. If you have anything about that (presentation, regulation) would 
you please forward  to us.



I think that we can structure the prepay mergin a simple loan and 
fix/floating swap, if the swap is something we are allowed to do under the 
Brazilian regulation.

Please add comments,

Andre

Sara,

Carol and Rod are working on the ISDA comparison for a potential ISDA between 
ENA and Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  Last week, Cregg Lancaster furnished 
Reliant's newest form of Schedule and Paragraph 13 for our review.  You may 
want to visit with Carol as to the status.

Also, it is my understanding that once we have the ISDA between ENA and 
Reliant in place, that that form of agreement would be used for the ECC and 
Reliant Canada agreement (with the exception of the provisions specific to 
Canadian entities).

Hope this explanation help.

FYI

Per Sheila's inquiry and at Sara's direction, I called Ken Raisler at 
Cadwalader to determine if using the word ""exchange"" in a corporation's name 
would create any regulatory problems with the CFTC.

Per Ken, there has been some historical sensitivity about the use of the word 
""exchange"" .  As we may have noticed though, a lot more companies are doing 
so without concern.  He said there was no regulatory problem with the CFTC in 
using ""exchange"" in your corporate name, however, putting ""exchange"" in a 
company's name may put you on the CFTC's radar and get you more scrutiny.

He also said that there may be regulatory conerns in Singapore and Hong Kong, 
so if we ever anticipate doing business there, it might not be a good idea."

Harry Arora (e-commerce group) wants to take a look at Goldman's online 
trading operation.  His motive is to explore/navigate the site during the 
next 30 days (but not trade).  I told Harry that I would need to review the 
agreement and negotiate with Goldman just as I would any agreement in order 
to not set any precedent with Goldman for future agreements.  Although Harry 
does not intend to trade at all, and we could terminate the agreement when he 
is done, I suppose Gary may want to trade with Goldman online in the future.  
We could negotiate another agreement at a later date.

Let me know if you would agree to accept Goldman's agreement ""as is"" for the 
limited purpose of allowing Harry to navigate the site, with the intention of 
terminating the agreement when he is done.  Although ENA would have a 
password, access could be limited to Harry [and whomever he needs to 
assist?].  Please let me know your decision.  Thanks.  Sara"

Here's the comparison chart. We've gone as far as we can with SSB. The ball 
is in the traders' court to look at, and approve, the numbers. I don't know 
when, if ever, they'll do that. They don't seem as interested as they once 
were. I think we're more or less on hold waiting for them. SSB is aware of 
the development and said they will push the traders independently.

My schedule is fairly flexible so let me know when you'd like to meet.

I have attached a copy of the Media News Confirmation. They agree to 
everything but want to add one more condition.

If ENA closes on the KPM Lasara L.P. newsprint mill before the expiration 
date of the Swaption, and all the other conditions in the current agreement 
are met, then ENA must give Notice of Exercise to Counterparty. I am not sure 
about all of the details of the KPM Lasara L.P. newsprint deal. It is my 
understanding that Kafus is raising money to build the mill and we are 
helping them out. If you have any questions about the project contact Joe 
Jure ext. 30658 (he is the deal maker on this Transaction) or Dick Robinson, 
ext 36657, he is working on the KPM Lasara project, you can also talk to Bob 
Crane.

I will be out tomorrow so if you have any questions please leave me a voice 
mail or contact Gordon Heaney, ext 58175. I will be back in the office on 
Friday.


Thank you,

Hello there!  I know that you are out of the country.  Thanks for forwarding 
the message from Andre Cangucu.  I have been through your materials but do 
not find any involvement you may have had with specific swaps; the items I 
found were generic and were in the form of law firm memoranda (e.g., 
""Derivatives and FX Transactions in Brazil"", ""Trading with Brazilian 
Counterparties"", etc.).  Am I missing something?  Look forward to seeing you 
soon.  Sara"

Hi Sara,

I work for Harry Arora and I just like to follow-up on whether
we are ready to open an account with Goldman
Sachs Web.ET website.  This is a website where they have
primary issuance and secondary trading of fixed income 
securities.  I understand that Harry already spoke to you about
this.

Please give me a call on what I can do to facilitate opening an 
account with Goldman Sachs because
we are pursuing an aggressive deadline with regards to
our Direct Finance project.

Best regards,

Roy Ibasco

Sara I agree that the confirmation should be in a form that is acceptable to 
ENA. We attempted to put use an ENA confirmation format. I have incorporated 
your comments into our latest draft. I did this with some caution as there 
appears to be slight differences between it and the draft you sent me. I 
suggest if you find our section 2 satisfactory then you lift it and place it 
in your standard confirmation. On the issues you raised.
1 October is correct as the termination date as time is measured from 9am 
each day. Hence 30 September finishes at 8:59am on 1 October   
The Payment Date should be at least 20 Business Days after the BoM readings 
to determine the Floating Amount. An alternative wording could be ""the 
earlier of the [specified date] or 20 Business Days after...."" 
 The ""Strike Amount Differential"" and  ""Payment Amount"" could be worded 
alternatively as in the pro forma ENA confirmation attached.  


Would you forward your final wording.

Hi Pushkar,

I spoke with Sara yesterday and she told me that she can expedite the process 
of
registering for Goldman Sachs' Web ET site.

Would you please send Sara the name and telephone number of your contact
at Goldman Sachs.  She would need to get in touch with their legal counsel 
and 
your contact could provide her the information.  Many thanks.

Regards,

Subject:  Igaras Prepay - Next Steps

The structure for the financial prepay doesn't seem  to work under the 
Brazilian regulation therefore we need to come up with a different structure. 
David has put together a couple of different structures but basically all of 
them will run into the same problem and the Central Bank won't accept those.

We (Gustavo and I) had lunch last Thursday with a Mr. Jose Lavia owner of 
Fair Corretora (a brokerage house that I've worked with) basically he thinks 
that the financial prepay structure is not going to work because the Central 
Bank wants to see benefits for the country and impacts in the country's 
current balance.
He asked us to send him a draft of the structure and he will discuss with his 
partners to see if they came up with different ideas.

Below are the comments of the next steps and ideas from Antonio Felix 
(Tozzini Freire).


Central Bank:
As recommended by Antonio Felix from Tozzini Freire, we need to decide if 
this is a deal/structure we want to continue to pursue. If so we should 
schedule a meeting with the International Operations Director of the Central 
Bank in Brasilia and make a presentation covering the following points:

- The overall structure
- Market need
- Benefits to the companies involved (petrochemical, pulp and paper) - 
Benefits to Brazil ? (if any)

We should approach this not as a single transaction but as a new product, 
with specific characteristics, without any similar in the market, that Enron 
developed in the US and is trying to ""sell"" in Brazil.


Swaps:
A swap in Brazil can be arranged between two local parties and neither one 
needs to be a financial institution. If we want we can have a brokerage house 
or bank in the middle to register the contract with the BM&F (Mercantile 
Exchange).
The other possibility is to have a swap contract between a local and an 
offshore entity, in this case the offshore entity needs to be a financial 
institution.
Is one of the Enron companies in the US considered to be a financial 
institution ?

A specialist form Tozzini should be sending us some paper covering swap 
contracts. I hope to have a better understanding of the requirements for swap 
contracts after we receive that.

Yao Apasu: Andrea mentioned that you were involved with some swap contracts 
in Brazil. If you have anything about that (presentation, regulation) would 
you please forward  to us.



I think that we can structure the prepay mergin a simple loan and 
fix/floating swap, if the swap is something we are allowed to do under the 
Brazilian regulation.

Please add comments,

Andre

Robert:  Susan Flynn told me that your client is objecting to the deletion of 
the first part of the first sentence in the ""Setoff"" language.  I just wanted 
to explain why we are requesting this change.  In reviewing our forms during 
the latter part of 1999, we made a number of changes to both our ISDA 
Schedule and CSA.  One of these changes was the deletion of  the preamble 
language contained in the setoff provision.  We concluded that the phrase 
""Without affecting ...., all payments will be made without setoff 
...;provided, however,"" actually negated the effect of setoff which we WANT 
to occur UPON THE DESIGNATION OR THE DEEMED DESIGNATION of an Early 
Termination Date.  What purpose do you think the phrase serves if left in the 
setoff provision?  Please feel free to give me a call at 713/853-5620.  
Thanks.  Sara "

Subject: Assignmemt/Amendment

Robert:  Susan Flynn told me that your client is objecting to the deletion of 
the first part of the first sentence in the ""Setoff"" language.  I just wanted 
to explain why we are requesting this change.  In reviewing our forms during 
the latter part of 1999, we made a number of changes to both our ISDA 
Schedule and CSA.  One of these changes was the deletion of  the preamble 
language contained in the setoff provision.  We concluded that the phrase 
""Without affecting ...., all payments will be made without setoff 
...;provided, however,"" actually negated the effect of setoff which we WANT 
to occur UPON THE DESIGNATION OR THE DEEMED DESIGNATION of an Early 
Termination Date.  What purpose do you think the phrase serves if left in the 
setoff provision?  Please feel free to give me a call at 713/853-5620.  
Thanks.  Sara

Carol:  Per your voice mail I am attaching a portion of a memo that has not 
been circulated yet, but it summarizes the requirements, approvals and 
notifications required by Corp and ENA Legal policy regarding Standstills, 
Nohires and Noncompetes in confidentiality agreements.  This is the portion 
relating to Nohires.
 The memo I've been working on is a summary of Jim Derrick's 10/27/99 memo 
regarding required approvals plus other ENA policies and language re these 
provisions.    THis language is the same as the memo from Lance that you 
mentioned.
 Regarding approvals, since business persons (Detmering, Metts) must make 
them there is much feeling among attorneys I work most with that business 
persons should secure these approvals.

Let me know if you have comments, questions or need anything else.

show you. How about another trip to Amelia with Pat Mooney! I still have
great memories of that trip. I usually play in Atlanta. Not too many out of
town golfing trips but I would love to go on one with you! Phoenix is great
and we could go to some of the same places that you probably went to with ole
what's his name! Are you still dating that guy? Dump him and let's go out! We
can go to New York and bring Deb back some more Deli stuff. Enron is doing
great. Love those stock options, huh?  Helen is living with my sister Bev in
memphis and would love to hear from you if you feel like
calling(901-682-0269) I would love to hear from you too if you feel like
calling me (404-261-2164).
I assume you know that Ron and Peggy have separated many months ago and are
getting divorced!?    CALL ME!!!!!   Love (and I mean it), Sam"

Thanks for the following email regarding our ability to remove Cargill in our

May we discuss the possibility of closing the account with Cargill?

They added approximately $20,000 to our margin account by mistake on April 
7th.
They reversed this yesterday but didn't take out the entire amount, so it 
appears to be
creating additional work for our margin accounting group. Gerri Gosnell in

Hi,

We discussed closing the Cargill account yesterday possibly but you said that 
you wanted to keep it for
additional trades. We will leave it open as long as you need it.

I talked to Bank One this morning and they said that initially only NG would 
be traded; however,
if you want me to talk to them about rates for doing CL trades, I will.  
Legal should have the paperwork
set up within the next 2 weeks.

My contact at Bank One is Linda Bergdahl, 312-408-8333.

Regards,
David

Subject: Cargill, Incorporated

Tanya:  I left you a voice mail earlier this week on the single outstanding 
issue:  paragraph (B) of our setoff language.  This provision allows the 
nondefaulting party to withhold any payment it might owe to the defaulting 
party under the master until the nondefaulting party can be certain IN ITS 
REASONABLE DISCRETION  that ANY other payments owed to it (under ANY other 
agreements between the parties)  by the defaulting party have been paid.  
Cargill does not want to ""comingle"" its business.  Remember, we have already 
given in on ""affiliate setoff"".  [the lawyer never raised the paragraph (B) 
issue until this week!] 

Also, Cargill has requested that we change our Credit Support Amount 
definition (but I provided them with an explanation) AND Cargill has decided 
to issue transferable L/C's.

Please let me hear from you so that we can finalize.  I do not know if this 
is a deal breaker.

copy of this email, I ask that you touch base with Tana Jones in Houston who 
will verify the status of ENA's ISDA with Kellogg Company and send you copies

Paul Radous asked me to get in touch with you in connection with a proposed 
ISDA Master Agreement with Kellog Supply Services (Europe) Limited.  I should 
be grateful if you would send me by e-mail all documents relating to the ISDA 
recently executed between ENA and Kellog's as Paul would like us to use 
similar provisions.

In passing, I should point out that both I and my colleague, Michael 
Khajeh-Noori, will be dealing with this matter.  I am in the office on 
Mondays and Tuesdays and Michael is in the office on Thursdays and Fridays.  
I should therefore be grateful if you would address any e-mails to both of us 
(we can both be contacted on the same extension: 34539).

If you have any questions, please let me know.

With kind regards

Deepak

Paul: will you be preparing a credit worksheet for this entity?

We have recently concluded an ISDA with The Kellogg  Company in the USA. Now 
their European entity, Kellogg Supply Services (Europe) Limited of The 
Kellogg Building, Talbot Road, Manchester M19 0PU, UK, would like to see an 
ISDA Mastera and Schedule.

Can you look at this entity from a credit point of view please? I do not have 
separate financials for them, but if you need them will ask for a latest set.

Thanks

Did you get the Sappi International financials? And have you made any

John:

I have attached a memo regarding the issues that our respective credit
departments discussed.  Since negotiations began with Enron, we have updated
our ISDA form, so I will be forwarding to you today our updated version of
the ISDA Schedule.  I think the best approach at this point would be for you
to get back to me on some of the sticking points.  Maybe we can overcome the
more difficult issues first and then move to the Schedule.

I am available at your convenience to discuss the documentation.  I would
like to finalize this as soon as possible so we can start doing business
together.

Thanks,
Megan

Susan:  I wanted to clarify  whether Enron Australia Pty. Ltd. needs to 
execute ISDA Master Agreements with the SAME counterparties which already 
have agreements with ENA (and vice versa).  As an example, I can only rely 
upon tax advice ENA has previously received in connection with the services 
agreement between ENA and ECT Canada.  For book and tax purposes, the trade 
is recorded on the risk books of the Enron affilate ultimately booking the 
trade but the transaction is actually documented in the name of the Enron 
affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterpary.  The Enron 
affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterparty then transacts 
with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through a bulk swap arrangement).  The 
credit risk remains with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through an internal 
back to back transaction with the ""booking"" Enron affiliate)  for which the 
""booking"" Enron affiliate will presumably pay a fee pursuant to the services 
agreement.

Consider:  ENA is negotiating an agreement with Commonwealth Bank of 
Australia.  Will Enron Australia require a separate master with Commonwealth 
Bank of Australia?  Or will the services agreement permit the hereinabove 
described arrangement?"

Just to give a head's up,

In case I'm not here and you have to get something signed for EnronOnline, 
Louise Kitchen absolutely does not want any other officer signing documents 
for her group.  The only two signatories for EnronOnline are Louise and Andy 
Zipper, Vice President.  FYI, we do have a resolution in place that allows 
certain individuals to sign password applications (only!) on behalf of 
EnronOnline."

Sara,

I hope that you have now received the fax of my memo addressing the questions 
whether the Southern Ute Indian Tribe qualifies as an ""eligible swap 
participant"" and whether the swap agreement will have to be reviewed and 
approved by the Secretary of the Interior.  That memo was faxed to your 
office last evening.  Please feel free to call with any questions you may 
have.

We will now work on proposed language for the ISDA  Agreement to address the 
Indian law issues and the enforceability of the agreement.  As we discussed 
earlier, we will get that language to you by no later than the end of next 
week.

Sara,

The financial trader in Sydney should not be entering into master agreements 
for the trades he's doing for ENA-Houston.  The master agreement should be 
executed by ENA in Houston.  If that's not possible, our outside Australian 
tax advisor suggested having an independent agent (such as a lawyer) having a 
power of attorney from ENA and executing the trade (rather than Enron 
Australia).

This means that if ENA has already entered into a master agreement with the 
same counterparty, it would need to enter into a new master agreement with 
that counterparty.  Consequently, with respect to ENA negotiating an 
agreement with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Enron Australia will not 
need to execute a separate master for the trades that it is doing on behalf 
of ENA.  In this instance, ENA is considered the principal and Enron 
Australia is just performing services pursuant to the services agreement it 
has with ENA.

Please feel free to give me a call if you would like to discuss this further.

Best regards,
Susan

Susan:  I wanted to clarify  whether Enron Australia Pty. Ltd. needs to 
execute ISDA Master Agreements with the SAME counterparties which already 
have agreements with ENA (and vice versa).  As an example, I can only rely 
upon tax advice ENA has previously received in connection with the services 
agreement between ENA and ECT Canada.  For book and tax purposes, the trade 
is recorded on the risk books of the Enron affilate ultimately booking the 
trade but the transaction is actually documented in the name of the Enron 
affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterpary.  The Enron 
affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterparty then transacts 
with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through a bulk swap arrangement).  The 
credit risk remains with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through an internal 
back to back transaction with the ""booking"" Enron affiliate)  for which the 
""booking"" Enron affiliate will presumably pay a fee pursuant to the services 
agreement.

Consider:  ENA is negotiating an agreement with Commonwealth Bank of 
Australia.  Will Enron Australia require a separate master with Commonwealth 
Bank of Australia?  Or will the services agreement permit the hereinabove 
described arrangement?

Subject: Brazilian Regulations for Swaps & Prepays

Antonio Felix,

As Enron is finding several opportunities involving financial derivatives in 
Brazil, we would like to get from Tozzini Freire Law Firm a summarized but 
concise read on the ""cans and cannots"" of these type of transactions in 
Brazil. Here is my understanding of the regulations from the memo you have 
already sent to us regarding swaps and prepays as well as a list of the most 
common examples of deals that Enron would be encountering in the marketplace. 
I would appreciate if you could comment on what is written here and also add 
further information so Enron can have some sort of menu of deals of this 
nature that can be pursued. I would like to ask you to add your comment in 
this same message to make the review process a little easier. Thank you 
inadvance for your attention.

Swaps (Pulp & Paper, Petrochem, Power)

OTC Swaps

The Central Bank regulates swap transactions involving local financial 
institutions acting either as dealers for their own account or as 
intermediaries to the contracting parties. When the financial institutions 
act as intermediaries, the agreements are in fact private agreements 
negotiated by two non-financial companies, but become subject to the 
requirements and regulations normally applicable to swaps involving financial 
institutions. According to regulations currently in force, such swaps can 
relate to exchange rates, interest rates, gold and price indices.

All of the swap agreements involving financial institutions must be 
registered with CETIP or with another custody and clearing system authorized 
by the Central Bank or the CVM (Brazilian SEC). As a matter of practice, the 
agreements used by the banks that participate in the swap market do not 
follow a standard form, since normally each bank has a particular sample form 
with which it feels more comfortable.

Derivatives
In addition to exchange-traded derivatives and OTC swaps involving financial 
institutions, there is no legal impediment, in principle, to derivatives 
transactions being privately negotiated and entered into between two 
interested parties. As a general rule in Brazil, as long as no specific 
prohibition is found in the law, parties are free to negotiate agreements 
that best suit their interests.

International Hedge 
Central Bank regulations authorize that Brazilian companies enter into 
transactions abroad, either in exchanges or having a financial institution as 
their counterpart, to hedge against the fluctuation of interest rates, 
exchange rates or commodity prices in the international markets. 

Such hedge transactions must refer to payments in foreign currency scheduled 
to be made by or to the Brazilian company in respect of commercial or 
financial rights or obligations, or to payments in local currency arising out 
of certain financial obligations subject to the variation of exchange rates 
and payments relating to imports, exports or local transactions involving 
commodities priced according to their valuation in foreign exchanges. The 
commercial market exchange rates are applicable to foreign exchange 
agreements referring to remittances of currency in connection with hedge 
transactions.

When the underlying obligation/right is registered with the Central Bank, the 
corresponding hedge transaction must be informed to the Central Bank within 
10 days of its execution. When there is no registration with the Central 
Bank, the banks executing the foreign exchange agreements relating to the 
hedge transaction must verify the existence of the obligation/right being 
hedged.

Examples

Commodity swap between two Brazilian companies:
As per what has been said above, there is nothing that precludes Enron Brazil 
of entering into a swap with another Brazilian company regarding any 
commodity traded by Enron (Pulp, Paper, Petrochem products, Power, Gas). 
Enron does not need to be a financial institutions to provide swaps 
transactions. On the other hand, I am not sure yet on the following points: 
(1) Does such swap agreement should be registered with CETIP or any other 
clearing system to be valid under Brazilian regulations? (2) What are the 
taxes involved in a swap?

Commodity swap between a Brazilian company and an offshore company:
This kind of deal seems to be also available in the Brazilian market and the 
only difference from example 1 would be the fact that it must be registered 
with the Central Bank and it would involved transfer of foreign currency.

Commodity swap between two offshore companies but involving Brazilian exports:
I am not sure if Brazilian regulations would have anything to do with a 
transaction like this one. I would assume that a Brazilian exporter would 
sell to their offshore subsidiary and such subsidiary would sell to their end 
customer. Enron would step in and offer a swap agreement for the offshore 
subsidiary of the Brazilian company therefore Enron would not have any 
involvement with Brazilian regulations because it would not be dealing with 
Brazil. 


Prepays (Pulp & Paper, Petrochem, Power)

The regulations currently in force governing export prepayments, especially 
Central Bank of Brazil's Carta-Circular 2624, of February 14, 1996, establish 
that all repayments of principal under such transactions must necessarily be 
made by means of shipments of the relevant exported goods.  Carta-Circular 
2624 allows cash remittances abroad only in regard to payments of interest 
under the facility.  Therefore, it is not possible to structure a transaction 
where the repayment of principal will be made only in cash or where the 
borrower has the ability to choose between paying cash or exporting the goods.

A transaction that involves structuring a direct loan to the Brazilian 
company where the value of the principal of which would be tied to the price 
of the relevant commodity is very difficult to be approved.  Under a direct 
loan registered with the Central Bank the borrower may remit all due amounts 
of principal and interest in accordance with the schedule of payments 
attached to the certificate of registration. The problem with such 
alternative is that, although there are no express regulations preventing it 
to do so, the Central Bank will most probably not issue a prior authorization 
for such type of loan, as it only normally issues authorizations for normal 
loans where the principal is a fixed amount and the interest rate is either a 
fixed rate or a floating rate (normally based on LIBOR or US Treasury).  It 
should also be noted that generally speaking all interest payments under such 
an agreement are subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% p.a.

CC 5 Account

A possible alternative way to structure a prepay would be by using a 
non-registered loan with the Central Bank.  Under such alternative, the funds 
disbursed by Enron under the loan would be remitted to Brazil through an 
international transfer of Brazilian currency, as allowed by Circular 2677 of 
the Central Bank of Brazil. The international transfer of Brazilian currency 
(""International Transfer"") is a system which uses a non-resident current 
account in Brazil and the Brazilian interbank foreign exchange market to 
effect remittances of funds to and from Brazil.  Under such system, a lender 
that wishes to disburse funds to a Brazilian borrower makes a foreign 
currency deposit with a bank located outside of Brazil (""offshore bank"")  and 
instructs the offshore bank to deliver such dollars to a Brazilian bank in 
exchange for Brazilian currency.  Such Brazilian currency is then deposited 
in a non-resident account held by the offshore bank in Brazil and thereafter 
transferred to the borrower. The repayments follow the inverse procedure, 
i.e. the borrower deposits the amount in a non-resident account of an 
offshore bank and instructs it to exchange the funds into foreign currency 
and deliver them to the lender abroad.

The main differences between the registered loans and the non-registered 
loans are that the non-registered loans are not subject to prior approval by 
the Central Bank of Brazil (and therefore not subject to scrutiny as to their 
minimum tenors and applicable interest rates) and the applicable foreign 
exchange rate to non-registered loans is the floating rate (as opposed to the 
commercial rate of exchange). All transfers of funds to Brazil as 
International Transfers are subject to a Financial Transactions Tax (""IOF"") 
at the rate of 2% on the amount transferred, plus a bank fee that normally 
ranges from 0.4% to 0.6% of such amount.  Any interest payments under a 
non-registered loan are subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% (or 25% 
if the lender is located in a tax-haven jurisdiction).

I don't think this type of transaction is the best way to circumvent some of 
the Brazilian regulations regarding prepayment given the bad press that deals 
via the CC 5 Account mechanism would bring to Enron but I have it addressed 
just in case someone does not share the same opinion. 

Examples

Financial prepay between two Brazilian companies
Not allowed unless the company providing the prepay qualifies as a financial 
institution as per Brazilian law. Since it will not be the case in Enron's 
cases, we should not focus in these kind of transactions.

Financial prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company
As it has been mentioned before it is allowed as long as Enron can structure 
the prepay in way where there is a pre-established amortization schedule for 
principal and interest. It is very hard to structure a prepay with specific 
split between principal and interest because the objective of the prepay is 
to lock on a certain volume of a product and not on a specific price. 
Therefore, if Enron prepays for a specific product on a floating basis the 
attached value of that commodity can go up or down as the market fluctuates 
as well as the total value associate to the deal. Such value can be either 
principal or interest and it is impossible to determine what it will be.

Financial prepay between two offshore companies but one being a subsidiary of 
a Brazilian entity
I think there is no restrictions in this case given the whole deal will be 
closed offshore and the Brazilian authorities are not going to be involved. 
It will most likely be a deal involving three parties: a company in Brazil, 
its offshore subsidiary and Enron.

Physical prepay between two Brazilian companies
No restrictions.

Physical prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company
No restrictions as long as there is physical deliveries.

Physical prepay between two offshore companies but  involving Brazilian 
exports
No restrictions. It would also involve three parties: a company in Brazil, 
its offshore subsidiary and Enron.

Thanks,

Gustavo

Greetings to you both!  It has been awhile since we last spoke.  I would like 
to
finalize the matrix which we have been discussing since the latter part of 
1999.
Although we were awaiting new Central Bank regulations, I am beginning to 
think
that the Central Bank revisions will not impact the matrix except with respect
to transactions which may be entered into by entities that are the subject of
the Central Bank regulations.  Please let me know whether or not you agree or
can offer any suggestions.  Thanks and regards.  Sara

Thanks for the redraft!  I am looking at the agreement now.  Also, I thought 
you would be interested in Mark's comment.  I would like to use arbitration 
in lieu of jurisdiction.  Please make that change and forward to me.  I will 
mark up with comments.  Thanks so much for your help.  Sara

The Enron policy for our English law Master is for arbitration - although I 
have to say, for purely financial contracts, I myself always prefer the 
Courts.

Tanya:  There's no short answer with these people!  I think we are fine with 
their setoff language (part A only) because the NDP always has the option to 
permit setoff to other agreements between the parties as to amounts payable 
by the Payee to the Payer (where the Payer owes money under the ISDA to the 
Payee).  So here's my recommendation:

(1)  Call your friend Andre and hear what he has to say.  He has some kind of 
suggestion about Part (B) and limiting the NDP's payment to the DP to be 
based upon satisfaction that ""nondisputed"" amounts having been paid by the 
DP.  Will he also raise the ""other agreements"" issue here?  Not a clue.

(2)   If Cargill leaves part A in tact and we agree to change part B, I'M 
FINE.  (I'm fine without part B, actually)

(3)  The potential problem is that Cargill and ENA view part A differently, 
right off the bat.  I think Cargill is wrong because they don't read part A 
as applying to ""other agreements between the parties"".  But Cargill proposed 
part A and it DOES apply to ""other agreememts between the parties.""  I don't 
want to start off on the wrong foot so I'm sure I'll have to discuss this 
again with Marty.

Thanks for your continued help.  Sara"

We are terminating the only outstanding transaction and the cp is no longer

(Sara must not be aware of it) and she has indicated to me that she will keep 
this negotiation.  It is not a high priority.

I guess Shari will be punting this counterparty now that she has left the

counterparty on legal's part.  Should Sara or Carol take up an active 
position on this c/p?

Susan:  Attached are the electronic agreements for ENA trading with Goldman.  
Not much to do here because we'll need only  a signature (get Gary Hickerson 
to sign).  I have two changes to the Client Access Agreement which I will 
give you to add.  We do not need certificates or our typical authorized 
trader list to send back.  However, we will have to authorize password 
applicants on Goldman's form.  How does EOL keep track of this?  We will have 
to track because Harry Arora will be the password applicant (there may be 
more) and I think he's still ENA.  I know that we will want to receive the 
password very soon.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara

In advance of your calling me later this afternoon, I set out below some 
thoughts the issues to be discussed:

1. Jurisdiction - under the English law Annex the preferable route is 
recourse to the courts - I can confirm that this is Enron London's policy.

2, Non-reliance:  From our telephone conversation yesterday, I understood 
that you said that the CP would be relying on us.  I believe that this should 
not be the case and the usual non-reliance provisions should apply.  If this 
is not the case, then

3. the additional para. (h) that you faxed me earlier today, I am informed, 
is unnecessary.  I also understand that the practical effect of those 
provisions might be to scare the CP.

Please call me so that we can discuss any of the above and/or to confirm that 
you are happy for the documents to go out to the CP.

Thanks
Michael

Dear Ms Lavergne

Further to my email of 14 April 2000 attaching the first drafts of the 
Schedule and the CSA to the Agreement and the Parent Guaranty, I attach 
revised first drafts blacklined against the previous version to show changes.

These contain minor changes predominantly resulting from changing the Enron 
counterparty entity from Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. 
to ENA..

I look forward to hearing from  you.  If I am unavailable please contact my 
colleague, Deepak Sitlani who is also working on this matter (also on

Brent;

Today I had a meeting with the originators with respect to their intentions 
to structure call & put option deals in Brazil.  I have asked Luiz Maurer 
(Regulatory) to attend the meeting as each deal they want to structure has 
different specifics.  We still have a lot to discuss from a regulatory 
standpoint.  Basically, Enron Marketer (""buyer"") would enter into a call 
option agreement with a company (""seller"") who, for example, is contracted 
for 100MW but is only using 90MW at its industrial facility (seller's 
decrease of use of power is due to a reduction of its production line).  
Seller is contracted on a TOP basis with a LDC.  We are having discussions 
whether such transaction would be treated as a financial and physical 
transaction (like a normal PPA) or a financial transaction only (the 
so-called Brazilian ""Bilateral Contract"").  Also,there are discussions with 
respect to delivery point (seller's substation/busbar in case of a normal PPA 
OR center of gravity for a financial transaction only).  There are other 
deals to be studied such as a seller being contracted on a TOP basis with a 
LDC and having a turbine available at its facilities.  Buyer could enter into 
a call option agreement with seller, but the specifics of the deal would be 
different from a regulatory standpoint.

One of my questions deals with the re-selling of such energy.  If Seller can 
re-sell such energy at the spot price at any time he wants, why would Seller 
contract a call option with Buyer at a lower price ?

Anyway, we still have a lot of issues to discuss internally.  I will keep you 
posted as discussions progress.

Regards,

Sami

Here are two confirm formats for a put and a call option.  These transactions 
would be subject to a master agreement that would already be in place.  Let 
me know if you want to see the master agreement as well.

Susan:  I would like to have this agreement (all three parts) executed early 
Monday and faxed to Goldman.  Gary Hickerson can sign for Enron North America 
Corp. together with Ted Murphy as the second signatory.  Please prepare an 
addendum or annex for the Client Access Agreement with the following inserts 
for Paragraph 9:

INSERT 1 to Paragraph 9(g) after the word ""enjoined"":  ""upon proof of any 
such breach""

INSERT 2 which will replace the second and third sentences in Paragraph 9(h) 
:  ""Any dispute between the parties relating to this Agreement shall be 
resolved pursuant to the ARBITRATION provision contained in Schedule A to 
this Agreement.""

For purposes of the password ID application, we must verify that Harry Arora 
is still authorized to trade for ENA (and employed by ENA).

Roy Ibasco is coordinating for Harry.

After signing, we can fax to Goldman and I have the fax info.  Thanks.  Sara "

Hi, Sami!  Sorry we missed the call yesterday.  I just wanted to update you 
on some of the financial trading issues in Brazil (and I have added you to 
the working group list).  I am going to finalize our ""swap matrix"" for 
Brazil.  On the physical trading side, I had asked a physical trading lawyer 
to call you and am wondering if Elizabeth Sager ever called or emailed.  
Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara

Dear Sara:

Thank you for your message below. Please find attached hereto free 
translation into English of new foreign investor's regulations in Brazil. We 
are preparing a memo to you in connection with such new regulations and are 
finalizing the matrix prepared last year. We will send them to you shortly.

AFAC and Marcelo:  I hope this message finds you both well.  I would like to
finalize the matrix which was prepared last year so that we can create a
""baseline"" for future updates.  Please feel free to date the matrix as of
December, 1999, if you wish.  Please forward any recent changes to me for
comment  and I will respond immediately.  Then we can move on to other things!
Thanks for your help and attention to this mattter.  Regards.  Sara

Greetings to you both!  It has been awhile since we last spoke.  I would like 
to
finalize the matrix which we have been discussing since the latter part of 
1999.
Although we were awaiting new Central Bank regulations, I am beginning to 
think
that the Central Bank revisions will not impact the matrix except with respect
to transactions which may be entered into by entities that are the subject of
the Central Bank regulations.  Please let me know whether or not you agree or
can offer any suggestions.  Thanks and regards.  Sara

Hello there!  I know that you are out of the country.  Thanks for forwarding 
the message from Andre Cangucu.  I have been through your materials but do 
not find any involvement you may have had with specific swaps; the items I 
found were generic and were in the form of law firm memoranda (e.g., 
""Derivatives and FX Transactions in Brazil"", ""Trading with Brazilian 
Counterparties"", etc.).  Am I missing something?  Look forward to seeing you

Shari, Westpac have contacted me re putting in place an ISDA with EAF. As far 
as we ar concerned it will cover just power trades and commodities. A couple 
of questions. 

Our credit sheet required a MAC trigger (fall below BBB-) for additional 
credit support. Was this changed? The ISDA Schedule Westpac sent me has no 
such provision?  
Can I have a copy of the Enron Corp.guaranty you finally settled with 
Westpac?  

 Thanks

David,

Further to our telephone conversation, please find attached a draft copy of 
the
Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement.  I have based this draft on the 
recently
completed agreement between Westpac and Enron North America Corp and your 
draft
sent to me in September last year.

I would be grateful if you could review this draft and advise me of any 
comments
that you may have.  If you require a copy of the American Schedule, please let
me know and I will be happy to forward one to you.

As a  Guarantee is to be provided by Enron Corp, I would be grateful if you
could supply a copy of this document for our review.

Please do not hesitate to contact me on any  of the numbers below should you
have any questions.

Thank you for your assistance and I look forward to hearing from you very
shortly.

Regards

Sara --  As discussed last Friday, attached is the referenced agreement 
reflecting the power group's most current thinking, though it has not yet 
been finalized or rolled out.  I also attach the 'long form confirmation' 
used for trading wholesale power with counterparties who have not executed a

Subject: Re: HDD Swap between ENA and Aquila Risk Management Corporation  

Sara I agree that the confirmation should be in a form that is acceptable to 
ENA. We attempted to put use an ENA confirmation format. I have incorporated 
your comments into our latest draft. I did this with some caution as there 
appears to be slight differences between it and the draft you sent me. I 
suggest if you find our section 2 satisfactory then you lift it and place it 
in your standard confirmation. On the issues you raised.
1 October is correct as the termination date as time is measured from 9am 
each day. Hence 30 September finishes at 8:59am on 1 October   
The Payment Date should be at least 20 Business Days after the BoM readings 
to determine the Floating Amount. An alternative wording could be ""the 
earlier of the [specified date] or 20 Business Days after...."" 
 The ""Strike Amount Differential"" and  ""Payment Amount"" could be worded 
alternatively as in the pro forma ENA confirmation attached.  


Would you forward your final wording.

		 Subject: Re: ISDA with The Ospraie Portfolio Ltd.





Susan,

Thank you for the revised drafts. My comments are as follows:

(1) Please date the Master Agreement as of February 1, 2000.

(2) Part 1(a) -Specified Entities. As Enron Corp guarantees the performance of
Enron NAC's obligations under the Agreement, please add the words ""Enron Corp,
but only to the extent that Enron Corp is a Credit Support Provider"". This 
seems
reasonable.

(3) Please re-number the pages so that the Schedule starts on page 19 and the
Paragraph 13 starts on page 11.

(4) Part 1(e) - Payments on Early Termination. I am checking with Tudor as to
whether they are agreeable to Loss for trades going out beyond two years. I
would say, however, that I am not aware that they have agreed to this with any
other counterparty. That said, Per's point that the trades are much shorter 
than
this is noted.

(5) Part 2(b) - Payee tax reps. Ospraie never makes payee tax reps other than
relating to its place of incorporation.  If this is an important point for 
you,
I will get out tax group involved.  However, Tudor prefers that neither party
makes payee tax reps.

(6) Part 3(b) - Documents to be Delivered.  Party B annual financials - should
read ""... 120 days after the end of its fiscal year"".

(7) Part 3(b) - legal opinion. Please confirm that you will pay the costs of
Cayman counsel.

(8) Part 4(h) - Jurisdiction.  I am checking with Tudor as ""any court"" is much
broader than the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the NY courts.

(9) Part 5(b)(g) - Commercial User rep. Tudor cannot make this rep. Please
replace with the following: ""Party A represents, with respect to Options, that
it is a producer, processor, commercial user of, or merchant handling, the
commodity subject to the Transaction or the products or byproducts thereof, 
and
is entering into each Option Transaction solely for purposes related to its
business as such"".

(10) Part 5(f) - Procedures for Entering into Transactions. Please remove the
word ""deemed"" in the last line. This is no longer relevant.

(11) Part 5(i). I am checking with Tudor. Is the ""no consequential damages""
consistent with Part 7 which expressly provides for the payment of out of 
pocket
expenses, the costs of a delta hedge etc. on non-payment of premium in a
currency option?

(12) Part 5(k) - Transfer.  For the part of the paragraph relating to Party A,
please change the proviso to read ""and provided that such transfer will not 
give
rise to adverse tax consequences to Party B or to a Termination Event or an
Event of Default, and the proposed transfer would not adversely affect Party 
B's
existing netting or set-off rights or under applicable law"".  The part of the
paragraph relating to Party B should provide: ""Party B may transfer its rights
and obligations under this Agreement with the prior written consent of Party 
A,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.""  These amendments are intended 
to
be reasonable and fair to both sides.

(13) Part 6 - line 2 ""Definitions"" - typo.

(14) Part 7(b) - please remove the reference to ""ISDA"". The FX Definitions are
previously defined in Part 5(e).

(15) Para 13(b)(ii). Please include longer term Treasuries. My understanding 
is
that this is what has been agreed, but please let me know if this is not your
understanding and I will check with Tudor.

(16) Para 13 (b)(iii). Please remove the reference to L/Cs.

(17) Para 13(d) - Specified Condition (Tax Event) should refer to Section
6(b)(ii) and Specified Condition (TEUM) should refer to Section 6(b)(iii).

(18) Para 13(g). I will check with Tudor.

(19) Para 13(g). I think references to ""Downgraded Party"" and ""Credit Rating
Event"" are inappropriate. Please clarify. Is there any way you will agree to 
the
provisions of Paragraph 6(c) without more? What seems to be important is that
the Secured Party is not a Defaulting Party - i.e. Para 13(g)(i)(1) (not (2)).
This is consistent with Para 6(c) of the pre-printed form. Para 13(h) is 
related
to this issue.

(20) Para 13(i) and (j) - please remove. L/C-related provisions are no longer
relevant.

I look forward to receving revised drafts of the Schedule, Paragraph 13 and
guarantee in due course.

Kind regards.

Hi, Andrea!  Attached are updated power trading forms currently in use by 
ENA.  I thought these may be useful.  I have forwarded these already to 
Sami.  Let me know if I can be of any assistance or if you have a recent 
English translation of a current deal.  Regards.  Sara

Subject: Revised U.S. Wholesale Power Bilateral Master Agreement

Sara --  As discussed last Friday, attached is the referenced agreement 
reflecting the power group's most current thinking, though it has not yet 
been finalized or rolled out.  I also attach the 'long form confirmation' 
used for trading wholesale power with counterparties who have not executed a 
master agreement or other sort of enabling agreement with EPMI.  The latter 
document has not been updated in about nine months' time and thus may not 
reflect all proposed changes to the master.   The formatting may also be out 
of kilter on Annex  A of the latter document but I believe it should be 
usable by the person you are assisting in Brazil.  Please  contact me if you 
have any questions.  --David

It seems that there are only a few issues for me to respond as to and these 
are below.  You can handle the rest, I think.  Also, he jumped on the L/C 
removal language that we discussed.

[references are to numbered paragraphs below]
(2)  OK
(5)  Did you ever receive a response from Rhett?
(7)  Per already responded to you.  Please find out if CP has Cayman counsel.
(11)  These are two separate issues.  Short of a conversation, it sounds like 
he is confusing payments on Early Termination with consequential damages.  
The former will capture unpaid premiums in the event of an Early Termination 
based upon failure to pay.
(12)  Need to be consistent for both parties.
(14)  Is he right?
(15)  Verify with Rod.
(17)  I think I reviewed this point already, didn't I?
(19)  Check with Rod and I'll also review.

Susan,

Thank you for the revised drafts. My comments are as follows:

(1) Please date the Master Agreement as of February 1, 2000.

(2) Part 1(a) -Specified Entities. As Enron Corp guarantees the performance of
Enron NAC's obligations under the Agreement, please add the words ""Enron Corp,
but only to the extent that Enron Corp is a Credit Support Provider"". This 
seems
reasonable.

(3) Please re-number the pages so that the Schedule starts on page 19 and the
Paragraph 13 starts on page 11.

(4) Part 1(e) - Payments on Early Termination. I am checking with Tudor as to
whether they are agreeable to Loss for trades going out beyond two years. I
would say, however, that I am not aware that they have agreed to this with any
other counterparty. That said, Per's point that the trades are much shorter 
than
this is noted.

(5) Part 2(b) - Payee tax reps. Ospraie never makes payee tax reps other than
relating to its place of incorporation.  If this is an important point for 
you,
I will get out tax group involved.  However, Tudor prefers that neither party
makes payee tax reps.

(6) Part 3(b) - Documents to be Delivered.  Party B annual financials - should
read ""... 120 days after the end of its fiscal year"".

(7) Part 3(b) - legal opinion. Please confirm that you will pay the costs of
Cayman counsel.

(8) Part 4(h) - Jurisdiction.  I am checking with Tudor as ""any court"" is much
broader than the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the NY courts.

(9) Part 5(b)(g) - Commercial User rep. Tudor cannot make this rep. Please
replace with the following: ""Party A represents, with respect to Options, that
it is a producer, processor, commercial user of, or merchant handling, the
commodity subject to the Transaction or the products or byproducts thereof, 
and
is entering into each Option Transaction solely for purposes related to its
business as such"".

(10) Part 5(f) - Procedures for Entering into Transactions. Please remove the
word ""deemed"" in the last line. This is no longer relevant.

(11) Part 5(i). I am checking with Tudor. Is the ""no consequential damages""
consistent with Part 7 which expressly provides for the payment of out of 
pocket
expenses, the costs of a delta hedge etc. on non-payment of premium in a
currency option?

(12) Part 5(k) - Transfer.  For the part of the paragraph relating to Party A,
please change the proviso to read ""and provided that such transfer will not 
give
rise to adverse tax consequences to Party B or to a Termination Event or an
Event of Default, and the proposed transfer would not adversely affect Party 
B's
existing netting or set-off rights or under applicable law"".  The part of the
paragraph relating to Party B should provide: ""Party B may transfer its rights
and obligations under this Agreement with the prior written consent of Party 
A,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.""  These amendments are intended 
to
be reasonable and fair to both sides.

(13) Part 6 - line 2 ""Definitions"" - typo.

(14) Part 7(b) - please remove the reference to ""ISDA"". The FX Definitions are
previously defined in Part 5(e).

(15) Para 13(b)(ii). Please include longer term Treasuries. My understanding 
is
that this is what has been agreed, but please let me know if this is not your
understanding and I will check with Tudor.

(16) Para 13 (b)(iii). Please remove the reference to L/Cs.

(17) Para 13(d) - Specified Condition (Tax Event) should refer to Section
6(b)(ii) and Specified Condition (TEUM) should refer to Section 6(b)(iii).

(18) Para 13(g). I will check with Tudor.

(19) Para 13(g). I think references to ""Downgraded Party"" and ""Credit Rating
Event"" are inappropriate. Please clarify. Is there any way you will agree to 
the
provisions of Paragraph 6(c) without more? What seems to be important is that
the Secured Party is not a Defaulting Party - i.e. Para 13(g)(i)(1) (not (2)).
This is consistent with Para 6(c) of the pre-printed form. Para 13(h) is 
related
to this issue.

(20) Para 13(i) and (j) - please remove. L/C-related provisions are no longer
relevant.

I look forward to receving revised drafts of the Schedule, Paragraph 13 and
guarantee in due course.

Kind regards.

Susan:
I'm not sure that what I told you to do in the CSA Annex with respect to 
Custodians and their qualifications work so for now let's keep it out and go 
back to our old language.

Sara and Mark:
Shari had a counterparty point out to her that in our CSA Annex language 
where we talk about the circumstances under which a party can ""hold"" 
collateral, all of our triggers are based on something happening to our 
counterparty and nothing is said about what would happen if a Custodian holds 
the colateral and fails to be creditworthy.  Do you have any thoughts on 
this?  At first I thought that we should require the Custodian to be a 
Qualified institution but I'm not sure that that is the right approach.  Let 
me know what you think.

Shari:
I am negotiating an ISDA with Dresdner Bank and I have the following 
questions concerning their mark-up of the FX/Currency Option language:

1. In the EMU Protocol language they want to add a reference to Section 6.  
I'm not sure why but wanted your thoughts on this.  Are there any 
circumstances under which we do not adopt the Protocol provisions?

2. They want to define the FX Definitions as the 1998 FX and Currency Option 
Definitions as amended and supplemented by the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions.  
Is this okay?  What is the effect of this?  Should we change our form to do 
this?  With respect generally to the FX and Currency Option Definitions, as a 
general rule are they always incorporated by reference into the terms of any 
FX and Currency Option transaction even if it is electronically confirmed?  
They wanted to add language to that section of our form specifically stating 
this.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Here are 6 attachments.? In order of appearance they are

1.? (04)???????????????? Master Netting Agreement
2.? (USCUSTST)??? The Terms of Business Agreement (TOB)
3.? (20)???????????????? LME Guide
4.? (21)???????????????? LME Guidance Letter
5.? (22)?????????????????LME Guidance Letter
6.? (23)??????????????? Payment and Settlement Instructions


The TOB is the standard trading agreement and is the most important.? The
Master Netting Agreement simply
avoids the country by country and state by state possibility of cherry
picking in a default/bankruptcy event. The
3 Guidance letters are LME requirements. Payments are self explanatory.

Again, I think the TOB is a simple document and applies to regular exchange
cleared LME client business.? Not only is it simpler and applicable for this
transaction, but also the regular cleared contracts which are invloved, fall
into PART 30? Exemption of the CFTC. This exemption requires Sogemin to
protect 100% of any resulting client profits by means of an updated bond
(Bankers Trust). This guaranty is only for profits generated by US
companies. The benefit to Enron is that you receive full credit coverage for
your profits, above and beyond the brokers net worth.

I hope this TOB method helps expidite our business. We very much look
forward to showing off our superb price execution for Enron.

Regards,
Richard Hirsch

any questions you may have with respect to the following items:

(1)  I am having the Representative Agreement executed by ENA and will return 
an original to your attention.  Shari suggested that Susan Musch initial the 
agreement and Susan is out until May 22.
(2)  The ENA/Aquila weather deal has not been finalized ONLY because I have 
been waiting to actually view the Floating Price source materials which our 
traders have never been able to produce or cite a reference to (so that I 
could view).  There is no problem with the deal.
(3)  As a policy matter for Enron Australia Finance Pty. Limited, do you 
always agree to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South 
Wales as opposed to arbitration?  I am negotiating the ENA/ABN AMRO 
(Australian branch) futures agreement and am trying to determine appropriate 
jurisdiction.
(4)  ENA is attempting to draft an ISDA Master Agreement with a company 
incorporated in New Guinea (which may have a US office).  I don't know a darn 
thing about New Guinea law.  Do you happen to know if we've ever dealt in New 
Guinea, any lawyers located in New Guinea, what law is used (I guess New

John,
We are having difficulty in getting Executing Broker Agreements in place with 
Thomas Weisel Partners and Hambrecht & Quist.  We would like your help in 
calling your contact and getting the name of a legal person Sara can talk to.
Thomas Weisel has never called Sara back and for Hambrecht & Quest we sent 
our comments to the agreement to them and they just sent back the original 
one we reviewed.

Thanks. Sheila"

Thanks, Sara. We have some deals brewing but nothing has been signed since 
Moema. I believe I have sent you a copy of the Moema Agreement, right? If 
not, let me know and I will forward one to you.

Subject: Revised U.S. Wholesale Power Bilateral Master Agreement

Sara --  As discussed last Friday, attached is the referenced agreement 
reflecting the power group's most current thinking, though it has not yet 
been finalized or rolled out.  I also attach the 'long form confirmation' 
used for trading wholesale power with counterparties who have not executed a 
master agreement or other sort of enabling agreement with EPMI.  The latter 
document has not been updated in about nine months' time and thus may not 
reflect all proposed changes to the master.   The formatting may also be out 
of kilter on Annex  A of the latter document but I believe it should be 
usable by the person you are assisting in Brazil.  Please  contact me if you 
have any questions.  --David

We recently did about 20 weather trades with Vitol and I ""confirmed"" these 
under the 1995 energy price swap master (bad for weather) but incorporated 
ISDA definitions.  I think we should work toward replacing this master with 
an ISDA to eliminate the problem.  We did the same with Aquila which solved 
the weather problem (and I realize the Aquila is a bigger trading partner 
than Vitol).  Can someone generate credit?  Thanks.  Sara"

With regard to your questions, I have written my answers in red below: 

1. In the EMU Protocol language they want to add a reference to Section 6.  
I'm not sure why but wanted your thoughts on this.  Are there any 
circumstances under which we do not adopt the Protocol provisions?

This is something that should be run by Paul Simons in London as our EMU 
wording came straight from him. He would know what Section 6 refers to (I 
don't) and whether we should agree to its inclusion.

2. They want to define the FX Definitions as the 1998 FX and Currency Option 
Definitions as amended and supplemented by the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions.  
Is this okay?  What is the effect of this?  Should we change our form to do 
this?  With respect generally to the FX and Currency Option Definitions, as a 
general rule are they always incorporated by reference into the terms of any 
FX and Currency Option transaction even if it is electronically confirmed?  
They wanted to add language to that section of our form specifically stating 
this.

I didn't even know that the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions existed and I wonder 
what the purpose is.  Seeing as how the 1998  FX and Currency Option 
Definitions came out in 1998 (the same year as the Euro Definitions) one 
would think that any necessary euro/FX/currency  language would have been 
incorporated in the 1998 FX Definitions, instead of making a separate 
definitional booklet.  You might ask Dresdner what they think it adds to make 
reference to the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions. You might also look on the ISDA 
Website or ask Paul Simons (in case he knows)  to see if ISDA intended for 
the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions to supplement the 1998  FX and Currency Option 
Definitions. 

If we did include such a reference to the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions, then 
they would be deemed to apply to any FX or Currency Option Transaction, where 
relevant.  

With regard to electronically confirmed transactions, this point is addressed 
in clause (a) of our FX language.  This wording is something everyone wants 
to have in their Agreement since most FX trades and some Currency Option 
trades are confirmed over an electronic messaging system that doesn't use 
ISDA style confirms, and thus doesn't refer to any ISDA Definitions. 

Hope this is helpful - call me if you want to discuss anything.

Shari

Sara Shackleton is in the trading group in Houston.  She is in the same legal 
group as Brent Hendry and Andrea Calo.  To my knowledge she is not dedicated 
100% to South America.

I would be happy to share with you what I know about how the reorganization 
will impact the legal department structure.  Please come by the office when 
you can.  As it relates to trading activities in the region, it does not 
appear that there will be any material change in the structure.  Brent and 
Andrea Calo will continue to report to a trading group ultimately headed by 
Mark Haedicke.  We will continue to work closely together in the way we have 
been.

On Brazil matters, continue to go to Andrea Bertone as the ""generalist."" When 
we have financial or other trading issues, Brent Hendry (and whomever else he 
thinks appropriate in Houston or elsewhere) will be involved.  Brent, Andrea 
B and Andrea C are communicating virtually every day; therefore, I would just 
assume Andrea and Brent are communicating on each deal.  Feel free, however, 
to call Brent directly if you like.  Andrea Bertone is given the ""point""  for 
the convenience of your guys.  She is not to function as the
""gatekeeper.""

Brent and I are together on this, and I spoke with him today. Hope this is 
helpful, but let's discuss.

since I will be moving to Houston. I will be rotating into the former EI

David:  I will try to call you before I leave work today to follow up with 
any questions you may have with respect to the following items:

(1)  I am having the Representative Agreement executed by ENA and will return 
an original to your attention.  Shari suggested that Susan Musch initial the 
agreement and Susan is out until May 22.
(2)  The ENA/Aquila weather deal has not been finalized ONLY because I have 
been waiting to actually view the Floating Price source materials which our 
traders have never been able to produce or cite a reference to (so that I 
could view).  There is no problem with the deal.
(3)  As a policy matter for Enron Australia Finance Pty. Limited, do you 
always agree to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South 
Wales as opposed to arbitration?  I am negotiating the ENA/ABN AMRO 
(Australian branch) futures agreement and am trying to determine appropriate 
jurisdiction.
(4)  ENA is attempting to draft an ISDA Master Agreement with a company 
incorporated in New Guinea (which may have a US office).  I don't know a darn 
thing about New Guinea law.  Do you happen to know if we've ever dealt in New 
Guinea, any lawyers located in New Guinea, what law is used (I guess New 
Guinea!) or whether it's similar to other PacRim countries?

Would you be able to email over to us the Enron Corp. that was provided to 
Westpac a couple of months ago? I agreed to provide a guaranty in exactly the 
same form for our ISDA Agreement. I have a faxed copy but it would be more 
efficient if we didn't have to copy type.

I have checked with Matt Brown, book administrator for the Crude Oil account

as Mark Fondren, his supervisor, for any outstanding issues with Cargill and
nothing has appeared to need discussion.

Please let me know if I may be of any assistance in this effort,

Thanks for the following email regarding our ability to remove Cargill in our 
reporting
system and replace their name with another broker.

May we discuss the possibility of closing the account with Cargill?

They added approximately $20,000 to our margin account by mistake on April 
7th.
They reversed this yesterday but didn't take out the entire amount, so it 
appears to be
creating additional work for our margin accounting group. Gerri Gosnell in 
our margin accounting
group may be contacted at 3-4898 if you need further information.

Please advise,

Hi,

We discussed closing the Cargill account yesterday possibly but you said that 
you wanted to keep it for
additional trades. We will leave it open as long as you need it.

I talked to Bank One this morning and they said that initially only NG would 
be traded; however,
if you want me to talk to them about rates for doing CL trades, I will.  
Legal should have the paperwork
set up within the next 2 weeks.

My contact at Bank One is Linda Bergdahl, 312-408-8333.

Regards,
David

Sara: 

Would you mind to handle this one?  It appears that ETOL is the entity 
involved in the Watershed deal you worked on back in December.

I have been sent a copy of a proposed  ECT-ETOL ISDA Schedule and it is very 
specialized and unlike (despite what Mark Evans wrote) the Riverside 6 
transaction I am working on.   Maybe it is the Schedule used in the Watershed 
deal?? Anyway, I will bring it to you. 

Many thanks,

Subject: Re: ETOL ISDA


Shari,

this has been sent to you because of the similarities with the Teesside 
Riverside 6 swap which you are dealing with. Perhaps you or Mark could let us 
know whether you or someone else will be taking this forward.

The deal is that Enron is providing swap support to the deal which is an 
Enron structured financing to get ETOL off balance sheet. ETOL (Enron 
Teesside Operations Limited) owns the power station at Wilton which we bought 
from ICI at the end of December 1998.

The main factor to bear in mind is that (as in Riverside 6) the swap has to 
be seen in the context of the deal  as a whole and thus there may be 
non-standard provisions in the documentation  which  are deal specific and 
which Enron has to accept in the context of the deal.

Let's speak about this as soon as we know that you will be the person to take 
this forward.

Thanks


     Mark

Shari

ETOL is Enron Teesside Operations Holdings Limited, a company we bought in 
December last year.   We are currently arranging the sale of subordinated 
debt and equity in this company to a group of US institutional investors.   
Since the underlying cash flows are sterling but the investors want US$, we 
have entered into a currency swap with Trena and Harry.   The ISDA that 
Jurgen has sent to you has been drafted by Milbank Tweed, counsel to the 
Investors.  Mark Evans is the Enron legal person on the transaction, and our 
outside counsel are Slaughter & May.

The underlying transaction is, I believe, similar to the Teesside deal, in 
that it is subordinated to the investors investment.   The underlying swap is 
for 10 years, but in certain circumstances, largely relating to default by 
ETOL, the swap might be accelerated.

My understanding from Slaughters is that the ISDA is standard for the first 
10 pages and thereafter is specific to the current transaction.

I would suggest that if you feed your comments back via either Mark or 
myself.  My number is +44 171 970 7438.

If you have any further questions, please call.

Regards, Robina

Dear Robina- 

I have received the belowmentioned document from Jurgen.  Can you pls explain 
what or who ETOL is? Do you know who drafted this ISDA Schedule? ECT 
(Houston) Legal? ECTRI (London) Legal? Who am I supposed to neogiate with at 
ETOL? 
What are the underlying transactions that this document governs?

I am the attorney working on the Teesside ISDA and it does not resemble this. 

Any information you can give would be appreciated.

Many thanks,

Robina Barker-Bennett from our London treasury group asked me to forward to 
you an ISDA Master agreement from ETOL Trust.  I am going to send you this 
document by air mail.
It seems you have recieved already similair agreements from us. Robina 
mentioned the Teeside ISDA in this context.
Please give either Robina or me a call if you have questions.Thanks

P.S.: I talked to Gunnar from SEB lately about the ISDA and they really seem

Section 13(b) of the UCP which sets forth the amount of time that the issuing

Rick:  With a little luck, I can attach the first page of each of the 
foregoing documents and the signature block for the ISDA Master Agreement (at 
the bottom of the first page of the ISDA Master Agreement).  The full set of 
signature documents comprises four pieces:
(1)  [BOILERPLATE] ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency - Cross Border)
(2)  Schedule to the Master Agreement [previously emailed to you]
(3)  [BOILERPLATE] ISDA Credit Support Annex  [NOTE:  the document contains 
12 paragraphs]
(4)  Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex [previously emailed to you]

When we are ready to execute documents, we generally send out a complete

Clement attached is another guaranty that I would request you arrange 
execution on behalf of Enron Corp. It is in favour of  Westpac Banking 
Corporation and follows the exact form of a guaranty provided Westpac last 
month in respect of a Westpac/ENA  ISDA Agreement.

Thanks.

Jarrod:  Attached is the price correction language.  There is a 60 day true 
up with a 30 day notification period after the correction is announced.  Upon 
notification by a party, there is a 3 Business Day period for payment.  This 
language tracks the ISDA so that our approach in each instance will be 
identical.  We will need to add ""Calculation Agent"" to the confirmation.  
Please call if you have any questions.  Sara

P.S.  you should use a paralegal for Annex B purposes and if the omnibus is 
for a cross-border transaction"

Tana:  I've already spoken with Clem this morning and he is on board with 
this form.  The changes we are making are not substantive so let's make 'em 
(marked in yellow on the hard copy I've delivered to you) and get this signed 
right away.  Clem is going on vacation Friday.  We should also email a copy 
to Jack Foley when the revisions are made.  PG&E will send execution copies 
to me.  The paralegal handling this is Maryann Friel at (415) 973-4599.  
Thanks for your help.  Sara

Sara,

I am attaching our guarantee format for your review.  Please note that I
have inserted the ""cap"" at $ 10 million.

If you have any questions, please call me.

Jack:  I just spoke with Karola and she tells me that you want to talk about
the
guaranty.  I didn't recall if you had ever reviewed our proposed format.
Also,
I am aware that Enron Corp. previously issued a ""General Guarantee
Agreememt"" on
behalf of Enron North America Corp. (formerly, Enron Capital & Trade
Resources
Corp.) on January 28, 1998.  Which format are you interested in using?  Our
cap
for financial transactions with PG&E is, I believe, $10 million.  Please
give me
a call as I am the first point of contact for negotiating the guaranty.
Thanks.

Weyerhaeuser Company Limited, a company located in Ontario, wants to change 
the standard securities rep that we have in our current ISDA Schedule to the 
following:

""It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities 
Commission, Rule 91-505 Over-the-Counter Derivatives.""  Our current rep is 
attached.  Is this something that we can agree to?

When ENA enters into an ISDA Master with a Canadian counterparty, is that 
counterparty expected to make the ESP and Options rep?  Does ENA make the 
Canadian Securities Act rep?

Subject: Re: HDD Swap between ENA and Aquila Risk Management Corporation  

Sara I agree that the confirmation should be in a form that is acceptable to 
ENA. We attempted to put use an ENA confirmation format. I have incorporated 
your comments into our latest draft. I did this with some caution as there 
appears to be slight differences between it and the draft you sent me. I 
suggest if you find our section 2 satisfactory then you lift it and place it 
in your standard confirmation. On the issues you raised.
1 October is correct as the termination date as time is measured from 9am 
each day. Hence 30 September finishes at 8:59am on 1 October   
The Payment Date should be at least 20 Business Days after the BoM readings 
to determine the Floating Amount. An alternative wording could be ""the 
earlier of the [specified date] or 20 Business Days after...."" 
 The ""Strike Amount Differential"" and  ""Payment Amount"" could be worded 
alternatively as in the pro forma ENA confirmation attached.  


Would you forward your final wording.

Hi, David!  Hope all is well.  Since the referenced swap has been documented 
by ENA, I am now reviewing the Transaction.  I have a number of questions, 
many the result of my unfamiliarity with your Australian Reference/Fallback 
weather stations and a few other comments.  I thought I would mark this up 
and fax it to you which I will do shortly.  Sara

Good afternoon Sara,

Please accept my apologies for not responding earlier.  With regard to the pre
printed terms of the  PSA/ISMA Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA) 
please
find enclosed one copy, herein, for your information
(See attached file: PREPRINTED TERMS OF THE GMRA DATED AS MAY 2000.doc)

In addition, you did mention about the existing repo doc with  Enron North
America.  Please note that the negotiations of the BMA (former PSA) are 
handled
by our New York head office, so I shall check with my colleague and revert.
Could you please advise what you require me to do: are you checking to find 
out
if we have a BMA in place ?  or do you need an executed copy of the BMA?

Please advise.
With best regards,
Monica

Nothing since that report.  There was a proposal earlier last year that we 
should look into this again but Harry Arora then said that this was not going 
to proceed through London and so we never proceeded with an up-date.

I have attached the Media News Confirmation for your review. I highlighted 
one phrase because the fax was hard to read. I also left a blank on Section 
(iv) (ii) because there was a blank on your fax. Please advise.

Subject: Re: HDD Swap between ENA and Aquila Risk Management Corporation  

Sara I agree that the confirmation should be in a form that is acceptable to 
ENA. We attempted to put use an ENA confirmation format. I have incorporated 
your comments into our latest draft. I did this with some caution as there 
appears to be slight differences between it and the draft you sent me. I 
suggest if you find our section 2 satisfactory then you lift it and place it 
in your standard confirmation. On the issues you raised.
1 October is correct as the termination date as time is measured from 9am 
each day. Hence 30 September finishes at 8:59am on 1 October   
The Payment Date should be at least 20 Business Days after the BoM readings 
to determine the Floating Amount. An alternative wording could be ""the 
earlier of the [specified date] or 20 Business Days after...."" 
 The ""Strike Amount Differential"" and  ""Payment Amount"" could be worded 
alternatively as in the pro forma ENA confirmation attached.  


Would you forward your final wording.

Hi, David!  Hope all is well.  Since the referenced swap has been documented 
by ENA, I am now reviewing the Transaction.  I have a number of questions, 
many the result of my unfamiliarity with your Australian Reference/Fallback 
weather stations and a few other comments.  I thought I would mark this up 
and fax it to you which I will do shortly.  Sara

Good afternoon Sara,

Please accept my apologies for not responding earlier.  With regard to the pre
printed terms of the  PSA/ISMA Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA) 
please
find enclosed one copy, herein, for your information
(See attached file: PREPRINTED TERMS OF THE GMRA DATED AS MAY 2000.doc)

In addition, you did mention about the existing repo doc with  Enron North
America.  Please note that the negotiations of the BMA (former PSA) are 
handled
by our New York head office, so I shall check with my colleague and revert.
Could you please advise what you require me to do: are you checking to find 
out
if we have a BMA in place ?  or do you need an executed copy of the BMA?

Please advise.
With best regards,
Monica

lementation is gaining momentum. Given the breadth and scope ?of the requir=
ed efforts, several Task Forces have been created or are about ?to be creat=
ed. ??The Task Forces are in general responsible for further detailing  the=
 market ?rules and/or project management of specific implementation efforts=
. Some of ?those task forces are joint ONS-MAE efforts.?? Regulatory Affair=
s from both Enron and Elektro has participated in some of ?the Task Forces,=
 but many of them are not being covered. We think Enron ?should have a broa=
der coverage in more ot the workstreams. However, ?Regulatory Affairs does =
not have sufficient resources to participate more ?actively in all the requ=

) It is easier to influence and change directions at the early stages of th=
e ?process?b) The Technical Commitee does not have a good coordination mech=
anisms across ?all Task Forces. Unless one participates   directly, we lose=

 close contact with ONS - Enron does not ?have a seat at the ONS Board??The=
refore, we are requesting your support to help Enron participate more ?acti=
vely, by assigning specific professionals from your departent to the Task ?=
Forces more related to your current or future responsibilities. We assume ?=
that the average workload is about 1 day a week for each Task Force.??The P=
roject Charters and responsibilities are described as follows. As an ?initi=
al thought, we think the most relevant groups are: ??1) Trading - ""b"", ""l""?=
2) Legal - ""d"", ""m""?3) Integrated Projects - ""a"", ""f"", ""n""?4) Elektro - ""b""=
, ""f"", ""g""??Once we have a few suggested names, Regulatory Affairs will be =
in charge of ?making sure the participants ""hit the ground running"" and for=
 coordinating ?the efforts across teams. ??a) Optimization and Pricing Mode=
ls (led by Sheilly Contente - Coelba) - It is ?a joint task force (MAE-ONS)=
, examining in detail all existing and future ?optimization models (most of=
 them ""black boxes"" produced by CEPEL). Those ?models will also be key to s=
et the MAE spot price on a half-hourly basis. ?Jos, Lucio Reis is participa=
ting. ??b) AMPs (Authorized Market Procedures) - (led by Alexandre Magno - =
Cachoeira ?Dourada) - it is a Task Force working with PriceCoopers to detai=
l all future ?procedures to be used by the MAE. Those procedures include Co=
ntract Register, ?Data Submission, Energy Accounting, and many others. This=
 group is also ?examining the interim procedures to be adopted as soon as t=
he MAE starts to ?develop the settlement and accounting functions (formerly=
 developed by GCOI). ?this Task Force is responsible for updating the GCOI =
rules, taking into ?acount the breakdown of the supply contracts into T and=
 G components (Initial ?Contracts) and some other recommendations on settle=
ment being made by ANEEL. ?Enron has had an ad hoc participation in some me=
etings. This is an area ?particularly important to the Trading activities.?=
?c) Implementation  - (led by Jean Thebault - Light) - This Task Force is ?=
examining the overall work plan to implement the MAE, to make sure all the =
?pieces fit together. MAE implementation requires a good orchestration betw=
een ?MAE Rules, ONS System Development, Metering and Metering Protocols, ?A=
ccounting and Settlment Systems and many others. There is a general feeling=
 ?that many of those pieces are dangling. Dates and responsibilities are al=
so ?very fragmented. No one from Enron is participating.??d) Legal (led by =
Rosane Magalh?es - CERJ) - this task forces examines all ?legal  and tax as=
pects on the MAE implementation. It also supports other task ?forces, when =
legal issues are involved. Currently, no one from Enron ?participating. We =
think that having a lawyer from Enron or Elektro engaged in ?this Task Forc=
e is essential.??e) Capacity Fee (led by Luiz Maurer - Enron) - this Task F=
orce is further ?detailing the implementation of this subject, already appr=
oved by COEX. Work ?involves the setting of a capacity fee for peaking plan=
ts, as well as the ?establishment of criteria on who should pay, who and ho=

ve analysis. Fred ?Sampaio (Elektro) has also participated  ??f) MAE Algebr=
aic Rules (led by Sureck - Gerasul) - this Task Force has ?examined in deta=

ial Contracts energy should be profiled on a ?half-hourly basis. Luiz Maure=
r has participated in the initial phased, in ?charge of examining the propo=

Enron representative.??g) Allocation of Transmission Surplus - (led by Paul=
o Born - Metropolitana) - ?this Task Force need to quantify the US$ volumes=
 involved in the surplus and ?propose ways to distribute it. Some general g=
uidelines have already been ?proposed while the Initial Contracts are effec=

decisions. Kleinworth Benson and CEPEL have been hired to ?support the effo=
rt. Luiz Maurer is participating.??k) Cost of Rationing - (led by Wellingto=
n - ANEEL) - this Task Force is ?reviewing the traditional cost of energy d=
eficit used by electric sector, ?which is currently US$ 540/MWh. Studies ar=
e being developed to define the ?energy deficit as a step function, whose c=
ost of deficit will depend on the ?magnitude of the energy rationing. CEPEL=
 has been hired to support the ?quantitative analysis. The group will also =

 to calculate the capacity fee. No ?one from Enron is currently in this tas=

s of Oct 01, all ?the accounting and settlement has to be developed by ANEE=
L. This Task Force ?is related to Task Forces ""b"" and ""c"". Therefore, it ma=

As a result of Jeff Nogid's request, here is a recap of the Morgan Stanley 
situation:

(1)  Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.
 This is the entity for commodity trading.
 (i)  ECT has a Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated 6/16/92
 (ii)  ECTRIC has an ISDA dated 3/2/99, but eff. 8/27/97

(2)  Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.
 Jeff Nogid requesting new master for fixed income transactions

(3)  Morgan Stanley International Limited
 This is the entity for equity trading.  Will Nogid or Kinneman ever need 
this one?

Each of these companies has a different lawyer to negotiate the agreement.

Each Morgan Stanley entity might require a separate guaranty.  Anne Clark in 
legal (Cap Services) will let me know.

I will put (2) in place.  Do you want to pursue upgrading (1)(i) or 
addressing (3)?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara"

As promised, here is an update of the deals we have planned to close this 
quarter:  

1. We will be rolling the Alchemy transaction into the Hawaii 125-0 
structure.  We are not sure if the current structure will be unwound 
completely and reconstituted into new entities in the Hawaii structure or if 
the current Alchemy entities will be used.  Regardless, I'm fairly sure that 
the original swap will be unwound and a new confirmation will be done using 
the Hawaii Master Agreement.  We are hoping to close by May 31st. 

2. Resco II/McGarret B - We are doing part two of the first transaction in 
the Hawaii Structure.  EES has requested that we put additional warrants of 
an entity they call Resco into the Hawaii structure.  This should close 
around June 15th. I am sending Resco I/McGarret A documents for the 3/31 
transaction to Sara today.

That is all we know about so far. Gareth is working on both of these deals.   
Blackbird has been put on indefinite hold. I will keep you posted on any 
other information I get about any transactions involving swaps.

Call if you need any more info.  I will make sure you are on the distribution 
list for docs.

Mark and Paul:  ENA has just finalized an ISDA Master Agreement with 
Statoil.  I had advised you several months ago that Statoil also wanted to 
negotiate with ECTRIC, using the ENA agreement as a model.  Chuck O'Brien is 
the inhouse counsel and can be reached via email or phone (203/978-6988).  
Please contact Chuck and let me know if there is anything that I can do to 
help.  Regards.  Sara

     Hi.  I was hoping you could arrange for someone from Enron Capital and
Trade Resources International Corp. in London to contact me regarding 
executing

with Enron UK.

		 Subject: FASB 125 deals for 2nd quarter

As promised, here is an update of the deals we have planned to close this 
quarter:  

1. We will be rolling the Alchemy transaction into the Hawaii 125-0 
structure.  We are not sure if the current structure will be unwound 
completely and reconstituted into new entities in the Hawaii structure or if 
the current Alchemy entities will be used.  Regardless, I'm fairly sure that 
the original swap will be unwound and a new confirmation will be done using 
the Hawaii Master Agreement.  We are hoping to close by May 31st. 

2. Resco II/McGarret B - We are doing part two of the first transaction in 
the Hawaii Structure.  EES has requested that we put additional warrants of 
an entity they call Resco into the Hawaii structure.  This should close 
around June 15th. I am sending Resco I/McGarret A documents for the 3/31 
transaction to Sara today.

That is all we know about so far. Gareth is working on both of these deals.   
Blackbird has been put on indefinite hold. I will keep you posted on any 
other information I get about any transactions involving swaps.

Call if you need any more info.  I will make sure you are on the distribution 
list for docs.

Thanks,
B

will arrive Monday night and leave Wednesday morning.  Andrea Bertone and I 
determined today that it would be best if I came next week rather than the 
week after.  She and I will be meeting to go over the information each of us 
has regarding physical and financial trading in Brazil and she wants to set 
up some meetings with some of the commercial group to discuss some of the 
alternative deal structures for a few transactions that are being considered. 
Please let me know if I need to block out some time, other than for the chief 
counsel meeting, for you, Andrea and I to meet to discuss trading issues in 
Brazil.  As soon as I know what your schedule is Andrea can set up the other
meetings.  I look forward to seeing you next week."

As we discussed last Friday during our meeting,
I am sending a fax to you as this is being written.

The two-page fax depicts our margin account information and zero
open positions. Since we haven't traded with them since last summer, the 
traders
have decided to close their account. 

Cargill has made errors recently in our margin account, which Gerri Gosnell
maintains, and it would be to our advantage to close the account to prevent
further potential errors on their part.

I've received the approval of the traders and book administrators.

Please let me know what our next step should be.

Thanks

Mark:  Barbara Gray and Shonnie Daniel worked on a Q1 deal between Enron and 
Texaco to create a JV called BL.  I believe that the ownership is 60/40, 
respectively.  BL has its own employees drawn from both companies and 
elsewhere but is still requiring additional services.  The swap group has 
already opened two futures accounts for BL and drafted resolutions, 
authorized trader lists, etc.  Before the closing, there was an 
""understanding"" that Enron would assist BL for a short time (until June, 
2000).  However, credit (through Bill Bradford) negotiated a 3-year services 
agreement for credit services to BL (I believe based upon 1 full-time person 
run through an entire budget).  Randy Curry (BL's president) has requested 
that legal (swaps group) consider a short-term services arrangement (I am 
told by credit this would be for approx. 6-9 months; BL looking for approx. 
20 ISDA's).  By the way, ENA is trying to negotiate an ISDA with BL but we 
have no one to negotiate with!  BL has not yet hired an in-house lawyer.

Are you interested in pursuing this request?  Sara"

Financial Power deals were to be done with this C/P.  Please advise.

Brent, Andrea and I had a ""status"" conversation this afternoon.  Brent will 
go to Sao Paulo on July 20 to meet with Andrea, Randy and commercial people.  
Andrea has requested that you and I go to Brazil after July 28 when the 
outside lawyer is back from vacation.  In general, the three of us are 
conforming and updating physical resolutions (final and proposed) and 
identifying additional research necessary to address the financial trading 
issues.  These are related to specific deals originating in Brazil (which are 
truly settled financially, e.g., a purported prepay where no physical 
commodity was to be delivered) and issues arising here in Houston (e.g., the 
Hickerson request for fixed income, FX and equity trading).  Brent will be 
discussing pending transaction structures while in Sao Paulo. 

It appears  that Brent is the ""point person"" for dealing directly with the 
Sao Paulo office and he will bring me in as necessary (although I will be 
dealing frequently with Andrea).

Carol:  I've been meeting with Jarrod about confirm templates.  Prior to the 
departures of Shari, Lynda, et al, there was a move afoot to create an annex 
of weather definitions which could be incorporated by reference into the 
confirms (or added to the Schedule), either of which approaches would shorten 
the confirms considerably.  Jarrod advises that the EOL T&C's for the 
varioius weather products contain the basic information which can be drafted 
in the annex.  Jarrod will send us the EOL T&C's.  I think it's a great idea. 

Jarrod will also send the existing  weather templates (which may be slightly 
different from those Shari gave us earlier).  We should verify that the 
weather rep appears in the weather option templates (since we have agreed to 
remove that rep from the Schedule).  Also, shouldn't we verify that all 
weather trades are executed under NY law (they probably are anyway) since we 
now have the opinion from the NY Office of General Counsel?

There are many different variations of the ""ILOVEYOU"" computer virus still 
being reported.  The IT Infrastructure team is continually updating our virus 
software as new versions become available, but it is extremely important that 
you do not open any attachments that you do not regularly receive from 
business associates.  Even business associates you are very familiar with 
could be sending you the virus without knowing it, so unless you are 
expecting an email from them with an specified attachment please do not open 
it.  If you are unsure whether to open an attachment please do not open it.  
Call your HelpDesk to ask any questions and to get verification if required.

We may need you to log out and log back in during the day as new anti virus 
updates become available.  We appreciate your cooperation while we all work 
to keep Enron's computing environment secure.

Please note the following Enron Policies regarding viruses: 

Email

Malicious Code (Virus) Screening
In addition to the Enron requirement for email attachments (received and 
sent) to be screened for malicious code (viruses, Trojan Horses, etc.), users 
of Enron information resources are required to detach email attachments that 
are received on to their hard drive for local virus screening purposes. 

All executables (*.bat, *exe, *.com, *.vbs) files should never be launched 
from email without first consulting with IT. 

Virus Alerts
The Internet is constantly being flooded with information about computer 
viruses and Trojan Horses. However, within among real virus notices are 
computer virus hoaxes. While these hoaxes do not infect systems, they are 
still time consuming and costly to handle. It only wastes bandwidth and 
unnecessarily alarms other computer users.

Please, do not perpetuate unconfirmed warnings about viruses and Trojan 
Horses. If you receive an invalidated warning, don't pass it to all your 
friends, pass it to your IT computer security manager to validate first.

Sara: 

Would you mind to handle this one?  It appears that ETOL is the entity 
involved in the Watershed deal you worked on back in December.

I have been sent a copy of a proposed  ECT-ETOL ISDA Schedule and it is very 
specialized and unlike (despite what Mark Evans wrote) the Riverside 6 
transaction I am working on.   Maybe it is the Schedule used in the Watershed 
deal?? Anyway, I will bring it to you. 

Many thanks,

Subject: Re: ETOL ISDA


Shari,

this has been sent to you because of the similarities with the Teesside 
Riverside 6 swap which you are dealing with. Perhaps you or Mark could let us 
know whether you or someone else will be taking this forward.

The deal is that Enron is providing swap support to the deal which is an 
Enron structured financing to get ETOL off balance sheet. ETOL (Enron 
Teesside Operations Limited) owns the power station at Wilton which we bought 
from ICI at the end of December 1998.

The main factor to bear in mind is that (as in Riverside 6) the swap has to 
be seen in the context of the deal  as a whole and thus there may be 
non-standard provisions in the documentation  which  are deal specific and 
which Enron has to accept in the context of the deal.

Let's speak about this as soon as we know that you will be the person to take 
this forward.

Thanks


     Mark

Shari

ETOL is Enron Teesside Operations Holdings Limited, a company we bought in 
December last year.   We are currently arranging the sale of subordinated 
debt and equity in this company to a group of US institutional investors.   
Since the underlying cash flows are sterling but the investors want US$, we 
have entered into a currency swap with Trena and Harry.   The ISDA that 
Jurgen has sent to you has been drafted by Milbank Tweed, counsel to the 
Investors.  Mark Evans is the Enron legal person on the transaction, and our 
outside counsel are Slaughter & May.

The underlying transaction is, I believe, similar to the Teesside deal, in 
that it is subordinated to the investors investment.   The underlying swap is 
for 10 years, but in certain circumstances, largely relating to default by 
ETOL, the swap might be accelerated.

My understanding from Slaughters is that the ISDA is standard for the first 
10 pages and thereafter is specific to the current transaction.

I would suggest that if you feed your comments back via either Mark or 
myself.  My number is +44 171 970 7438.

If you have any further questions, please call.

Regards, Robina

(Houston) Legal? ECTRI (London) Legal? Who am I supposed to neogiate with at

What are the underlying transactions that this document governs?

I am the attorney working on the Teesside ISDA and it does not resemble this.

It seems you have recieved already similair agreements from us. Robina

Please give either Robina or me a call if you have questions.Thanks

I have two questions:

(1)  If the ECC financial trading business is to be confirmed in Canada, 
won't Greg Johnston need a ""short course"" on ISDA/omnibus, etc.?  I was 
thinking of practical issues as well as Tana's more formalized training.

(2)  Have you spoken with Mary Solomson about Anthony?  I'm not sure if Tana 
has organized her lunch with global contracts, but it sounded as though 
Anthony was part of the problem and that Mary should be at the lunch."

Richard:
In reviewing our ISDA forms we had the following questions for you with 
respect to the arbitration and process agent language:

1. Do any changes need to be made to our arbitration language?  I have 
enclosed what we currently use.  Also, should we keep in waiver of jury trial 
even if arbitration is chosen for situations where the award needs to be 
enforced in court?  Is it necessary to have a statement that the award can be 
enforced in court?

2. We have assumed that there is no need to add our appointment of process 
agent language if our counterparty is either organized in the US or Canada or 
maintains a branch or office in the US or Canada.  Is this a correct 
assumption?  Enclosed is our process agent language.

I look forward to hearing from you.  As we discussed last week, we will 
arrange a time that you can talk generally to our group about arbitration 
issues and questions.

Carol

Greg:
Can you help me answer this question?  Also, we have been through our ISDA 
forms and had the following questions with respect to Canadian law matters?

1. We have assumed that for all ISDA Masters where Canadian law applies, we 
should not insert our arbitration provision.  Is this correct?

2. With respect to the Trade Option exemption and Eligible Swap Participant 
reps that we normally insert in our form (which I have enclosed below), we 
have assumed that the only time that these reps should not be inserted is 
when the Master is between ECC and a Canadian or Foreign counterparty?  Is 
this correct?  What we are unsure about is whther these reps are needed when 
ECC's counterparty is a US entity.  We look forward to hearing from you.
Carol

Sorry for getting this to you late, but we didn't get this until Friday

I do not know when we will be receiving the rest of the documents.  Please

Jarrod looks fine. For completeness I have noted one minor inconsistency in 
(v) of the Fallback Data provisions that dates back to my first draft. Our 
rounding of degrees celsuis is to one decimal point. Hence the reference to 
whole numbers may not be apropriate in all cases. In practical terms it is so 
immaterial I question the need to redo the confirmation. Anyway please put 
together the the confirmation between between Enron Australia Finance Pty. 
Ltd. and RMT. I have copied in Susan (Tax) and Heidi (Finance) to double 
check they are fully aware of this arrangement.

David,

I have attached a copy of the Confirmation that we sent to Aquila. They have 
read it and returned a signed copy to me. Please let me know if you think 
this document is acceptable. If it is I will go ahead and put together the 
Transaction between RMT and Australia. If we need to make any changes, I will 
send a revised copy to Aquila and then do the back to back transaction.

Thank you,

Jason:  Please review (I have others for you to see).  Also, Paul and I spoke 
with Cadwalader this morning.  Please continue to check the international 
exchanges online to see if you can locate clearinhouse rules for each 
exchange.  Perhaps you can also find information on the regulatory scheme for 
the jurisdictions.  I suspect we will have to hire outside counsel in each 
country to answer our concerns.  Let's talk.  SS

All:  Sheila and I have been trying to coordinate the account(s) to receive 
the shares of the above entity.  I can't locate the company on the corporate 
database.  My understanding is that CF First Boston will receive the shares 
and then transfer to our Morgan account (upon our instructions).  

CF First Boston has an Enron Corp. account (pre-1994) and can open a 
subaccount for EIplc.  However, two (2) items are required:
(1)  a letter of beneficiary ownership
(2)  Is EIplc a regulated UK company?  If the answer is no, then it (or the 
company reporting for it) must provide a net  asset valuation

Has someone in London already handled these issues?  If not, can one of you 
supply me with that information?  We have spoken with Andrew Bracken in 
London (0207 888 3196) at andrew.bracken@csfb.com

Thanks for your help.  Sara"

Sara,
I left a message for Ketan and spoke to our service rep at Morgan.
He said there should not be a problem setting up a new company, Enron 
Investments PLC, which is UK based, and holding UK shares in that account 
which are fully funded.

Sara and Ann,
I have spoken with Morgan Stanley regarding opening up an account for Enron 
Investments PLC which is a  UK based company, and will receive UK shares on 
Settlement date, Tuesday, 5/30.  

We would like to have DVP delivery at Morgan on 5/30.  Therefore, we will 
need to fund the Morgan Stanley account with GBP on 5/50 for the settlement 
balance.  

Please call if questions. 
Thanks. Sheila

Is there a CACS/DASH signed to authorise the flow of funds?

Sara,
I left a message for Ketan and spoke to our service rep at Morgan.
He said there should not be a problem setting up a new company, Enron 
Investments PLC, which is UK based, and holding UK shares in that account 
which are fully funded.

My understanding from Gary Hickerson a few minutes ago is that CS First 
Boston will be making the payment on the shares for us.
I have a call into John McGiver at CS First Boston, London, to verify.

Sara and Ann,
I have spoken with Morgan Stanley regarding opening up an account for Enron 
Investments PLC which is a  UK based company, and will receive UK shares on 
Settlement date, Tuesday, 5/30.  

We would like to have DVP delivery at Morgan on 5/30.  Therefore, we will 
need to fund the Morgan Stanley account with GBP on 5/50 for the settlement 
balance.  

Please call if questions. 
Thanks. Sheila

Sara,
Ketan said that you can call Sheung, 212-762-5232, to assist in getting the 
Morgan Stanley account set up.

All:  Sheila and I have been trying to coordinate the account(s) to receive 
the shares of the above entity.  I can't locate the company on the corporate 
database.  My understanding is that CF First Boston will receive the shares 
and then transfer to our Morgan account (upon our instructions).  

CF First Boston has an Enron Corp. account (pre-1994) and can open a 
subaccount for EIplc.  However, two (2) items are required:
(1)  a letter of beneficiary ownership
(2)  Is EIplc a regulated UK company?  If the answer is no, then it (or the 
company reporting for it) must provide a net  asset valuation

Has someone in London already handled these issues?  If not, can one of you 
supply me with that information?  We have spoken with Andrew Bracken in 
London (0207 888 3196) at andrew.bracken@csfb.com

No, but we have considered recently our exposure to brokers where they hold 
our money.  The analysis is more a function of applicable law/regulation (SFA 
or CFTC rules) than clearing house rules as I understand it.  We did not take 
outside advice or prepare memoranda, but Justin may have done so in the past 
(Justin?).  Please call me or Ed if you'd like to discuss.

Recently, Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Treasurer of Enron

Jeff's many accomplishments at Enron Global Finance (""EGF"") include over $30 
billion of closed financings and an upgrade of Enron's credit rating by 
Moody's to Baa1.  We wish Jeff well in his new endeavor.

Ben Glisan, Vice President and head of EGF's Structured Finance business,

No, but we have considered recently our exposure to brokers where they hold 
our money.  The analysis is more a function of applicable law/regulation (SFA

Jarrod it seems the reference to Sydney time for a Melborne weather 
transaction could lead to an inconsistency this year. So if a time zone is to 
be referenced it should be Melbourne.

Subject: Re: Yipes - Syd vs Melbon - HDD swap  

I agree this change could cause problems. During September 2000  daylight 
saving will start early in Sydney during the Olympics. As a result there will 
be a 1 hour time difference between Sydney and Melbourne.  The local time as 
reported by the Bureau of Meteorology is Melbourne time. Hence if there is to 
be a reference to a time zone it should time zone applicable to that 
location. More generally we should put a definition of ""LST ""in documentation 
as meaning the time at the relevant weather station. We could have a 
circumstance of reference weather stations in difference time zones (eg 
basket of cities).

Heidi can you handle?

Since Jared has replaced LST with Sydney time -

The confirmation I have received below looks to be the deal we were talking 
about when I was in Houston. Is this correct? At that stage, were we not 
talking about there being a significant premium payable at the start of the 
deal. It appears from the confirmation below that this is now a swap rather 
than a bought option.  Can you please confirm that this therefore the same 
deal.

Jarrod looks fine. For completeness I have noted one minor inconsistency in 
(v) of the Fallback Data provisions that dates back to my first draft. Our 
rounding of degrees celsuis is to one decimal point. Hence the reference to 
whole numbers may not be apropriate in all cases. In practical terms it is so 
immaterial I question the need to redo the confirmation. Anyway please put 
together the the confirmation between between Enron Australia Finance Pty. 
Ltd. and RMT. I have copied in Susan (Tax) and Heidi (Finance) to double 
check they are fully aware of this arrangement.

I have attached a copy of the Confirmation that we sent to Aquila. They have 
read it and returned a signed copy to me. Please let me know if you think 
this document is acceptable. If it is I will go ahead and put together the 
Transaction between RMT and Australia. If we need to make any changes, I will 
send a revised copy to Aquila and then do the back to back transaction.

Sara,

I concur totally with Paul.  I did some work re the OMLX as a clearing house 
when we prosecuted ENA's membership of the OMLX.  As comes through in Paul's 
note, what is crucial is to ascertain is:

Is one's collateral, etc., properly segregated from one's clearer's assets on 
the one hand, and also from the clearing House's assets on the other hand, 
under the locally applicable insolvency provisions??????

As Paul says, if you would like to contact Paul or Ed on this please feel 
free - I can also assist you if you would like me to.

Kind regards

Mark

Mark, Jason and Sara:

Deutsche Bank has requested that we make various ""Securities Act"" reps in the 
ISDA Schedule in the event that we do equity derivatives.  These reps require 
us and them to say:

1. To the extent that a Transaction involves the purchase and sale of 
securities, it will not be registered and the securities cannot be sold 
except pursuant to a reg statement or exemption.

2. Each party is a QIB or an accredited investor.

3. Unless otherwise set forth in a Confirmation, any securities that a party 
is required to deliver shall not at the time of delivery constitute 
restricted securities or be subject to restrictions on transfer.

What do you think about this?

I refer to our recent conversation relating to the progress of ISDA 
negotiations with the above counterparty.

I have just spoken to Carine Lavergne at SITA.  She informs me that SITA does 
not feel adequately equipped or informed to progress the negotiations 
internally and therefore intends to appoint external counsel (I urged her to 
do this as soon as possible).  Despite this intended appointment, she assured 
me that SITA wishes to enter into the ISDA as soon as possible and is keen to 
keep negotiations to a minimum.

Either I or Michael Khajeh-Noori will keep you updated as to the progress.

For your information, I also attach a status report with respect to the 
counterparties with whom Michael and I are currently negotiating.



Let me know if you need anything else.

Regards
Deepak"

Carlos, 
This confirms our discussion this morning that CSFB will wire 17,539,200.25 
GBP to Enron Investments PLC's account at Morgan Stanley.  Enron Investments 
PLC will then receive 6 million shares DVP.  This provides the best trail for 
the transaction.  Settlement will be on Tuesday, 30/5/2000.  

Laurel Adams will e-mail you instructions for wiring funds to the Morgan 
Stanley account.  Please provide to her settlement instructions for the 
shares.
Laurel's direct number is 713-853-7035.

Thanks. Sheila

Ladies,

On Tuesday, May 30th, we will be receiving GBP 17,400,000 into Enron 
Investments PLC prime brokerage account at Morgan Stanley.  We will need to 
immediately wire the sterling back out to CSFB.  As part of the account set 
up paper work, we need to be sure that we set up signatories for fund 
transfers as well.  I will need to notify Morgan by Thursday, May 25th  in 
order the get the payment out to CSFB, so I will need an authorized signatory 
list by that time.   Please let me know if I can do anything to assist in 
this process.  

I'm not sure who we are considering for commercial contacts to transfer 
funds, BUT, Jeff Kinneman, Gary Hickerson and John Greene are all out of the 
office for the rest of the week.  Do we need to commercial signatures, or can 
we set it up as two back office signatures for one time authority only?  "

We still have outstanding issues under French law.  Netting Transactions may 
not be possible (i.e., may not be enforceable)  with any of the French 
counterparties even if you have an ISDA in place.  If netting is not a 
concern, then we can have separate and unrelated transactions.  Are you going 
to push an ISDA for SITA?   Let's discuss.  Michael will have to encourage 
his counterparties to respond to our French counsel; SITA never did.  Sara

Attached are the initial drafts of a closing checklist and the related 
closing documents to pay off and unwind Project Alchemy and place the asset 
into the Project Hawaii structure.  This transaction is structured as a trust 
to trust transfer, which is contemplated in the Amended and Restated Hawaii 
125-O Facility Agreement.  The anticipated closing date for this transaction 
is May 31, 2000.  The only significant missing information in the documents 
is the maturity date and the related auction dates.  Please advise as to the 
maturity date and I will calculate the auction dates.

The documents attached are clean versions in Word.  Immediately following 
this e-mail, I will send a follow-up e-mail with clean versions of each 
document in Word Perfect.  Following that, I will send two e-mails attaching 
copies of the documents marked against the Project Blackbird Unwind and 
related Hawaii 125-O Danno A documents, in both Word and Word Perfect.

Please review the attached documents and call me with any comments or 
questions.  My direct line is 214-659-4461 and my direct fax is 
214-659-4784.  Please let me know if any additional people should be a 
recipient of future e-mails for this transaction.  Also, please forward this 
e-mail to anyone that you are aware of who needs to review the documents and 
has not received this e-mail.

trading.  We previously sent a draft to these guys on 1/13/99.  The only

Sara

I refer to our recent conversation relating to the progress of ISDA 
negotiations with the above counterparty.

I have just spoken to Carine Lavergne at SITA.  She informs me that SITA does 
not feel adequately equipped or informed to progress the negotiations 
internally and therefore intends to appoint external counsel (I urged her to 
do this as soon as possible).  Despite this intended appointment, she assured 
me that SITA wishes to enter into the ISDA as soon as possible and is keen to 
keep negotiations to a minimum.

Either I or Michael Khajeh-Noori will keep you updated as to the progress.

For your information, I also attach a status report with respect to the 
counterparties with whom Michael and I are currently negotiating.



Let me know if you need anything else.

Regards
Deepak"

Subject: Pre-Hedge of STG PATS


     Clint -

     As per your conversation with Tim, attached is a draft confirmation
     for a ""pre-hedge"" of the STG PATS option.  Below is an example that
     describes the mechanics of this proposal using hypothetical dates
     and rates:

     1. On May 19, 2000 Enron will sell to UBS a 3yr call option on the
     UKT 6.00% due 12/28.  The call option will have an expiry date and
     cash settlement date of May 19, 2003 and the strike will equal
     4.90%.  The upfront premium owed by UBS to Enron is STG 14,000,000.
      The upfront premium will be paid on July 19, 2000 (2 months from
     trade date).  Enron will have the right to change the cash-settle
     date to any Business Day between May 19 and July 19, 2003.

     2. We assume that on June 19, 2000 the STG PATS bond is priced and
     we look to unwind the existing option with Enron and enter into the
     real STG PATS option with the trust.  The new STG PATS option will
     have an expiry date and cash settlement date of June 19, 2003 and a
     strike of 4.90%.  The upfront premium payable by UBS to the Trust
     is STG 10,000,000.

     3. Enron will exercise a clause in the original trade that allows
     the Company to change the cash settlement date of the option to
     June 19, 2003 such that it matches the date on the STG PATS option.
     Now the two options will have an identical STG 10,000,000 value.

     4. Enron and UBS will unwind the existing option for STG
     10,000,000.  That amount will be netted against the STG 14,000,000
     UBS owes as upfront premium, resulting in a net payment by UBS to
     Enron of STG 4,000,000.

     5. Enron will receive the STG 4,000,000 from UBS for the unwind of
     the original option and STG 10,000,000 from the Trust (by way of
     UBS) from the sale of the STG PATS note for a total amount of STG
     14,000,000.

Definitely want to upgrade #1 - its on my list of ISDA upgrades as follows:

Done:  TXU, JAron
In Progress:  El Paso, Occidental, Reliant
To Do:  Morgan Stanley, Dynegy, Statoil, Vitol, Valero, Sempra

Can your dept provide a breakdown of type of executed masters? There are (as 
of today) 423 masters - can we break out which ones are old ECT masters?  
That may give us some insight in to any others that need upgrades.  Also, the 
confirm desk should be able to tell us the level of activity (as they did 
before) to determine priority.  Eventually, we would like to get to all of 
these; however, establishing new documents where we have none (Cargill, 
Mieco, Idacorp, PanCanadian) is my first priority.

Rod should be able to address #3.

Thanks,
Tanya

Subject: Various ""Morgan Stanley"" master agreements

As a result of Jeff Nogid's request, here is a recap of the Morgan Stanley 
situation:

(1)  Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.
 This is the entity for commodity trading.
 (i)  ECT has a Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated 6/16/92
 (ii)  ECTRIC has an ISDA dated 3/2/99, but eff. 8/27/97

(2)  Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.
 Jeff Nogid requesting new master for fixed income transactions

(3)  Morgan Stanley International Limited
 This is the entity for equity trading.  Will Nogid or Kinneman ever need 
this one?

Each of these companies has a different lawyer to negotiate the agreement.

Each Morgan Stanley entity might require a separate guaranty.  Anne Clark in 
legal (Cap Services) will let me know.

I will put (2) in place.  Do you want to pursue upgrading (1)(i) or 
addressing (3)?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara

Subject: Enron Investments plc (""EIplc"") - new brokerage account

All:  Sheila and I have been trying to coordinate the account(s) to receive 
the shares of the above entity.  I can't locate the company on the corporate 
database.  My understanding is that CF First Boston will receive the shares 
and then transfer to our Morgan account (upon our instructions).  

CF First Boston has an Enron Corp. account (pre-1994) and can open a 
subaccount for EIplc.  However, two (2) items are required:
(1)  a letter of beneficiary ownership
(2)  Is EIplc a regulated UK company?  If the answer is no, then it (or the 
company reporting for it) must provide a net  asset valuation

Has someone in London already handled these issues?  If not, can one of you 
supply me with that information?  We have spoken with Andrew Bracken in 
London (0207 888 3196) at andrew.bracken@csfb.com

Thanks for your help.  Sara

I  would love it if we could meet.  We have made a little bit of headway in 
this effort, but quite frankly, not much.  In fact, I have seen DASH's that 
is indicating the purchase of public equity and I am trying to find out who

Hi Sara,  the financial companies attachment above is all companies that we

indicated whether we have a financial contract with the company or not (to my

Let me know if you need anything else.

There are two companies in the attachment with similar names.  PPL 
Corporation and PPL Electric Utilities Corporation.  I am about to call my 
contact at PPL to determine if the deals under PPL Electric Utilities should 
be changed to PPL Corporation.  We are selling on both deals under PPL 
Electric Utilities Corporation so hopefully they will sign our confirms.  
They have already signed one of our confirms but I may have to change the 
name on the confirm and re-send it."

Sara,

I have attached draft Confirmation of a Collar with Rand Whitney. They want 
to go live with this deal today and send out an executable Confirmation. 
Tanya wants to put a provision in the confirmation that states that the deal 
is subject to Credit approval. If we do not get credit approval Tanya will 
kill the deal. I have left a message with Tanya asking her exactly what she 
wants to say in the Confirmation. Please let me know what you think of the 
Collar the way it is writtne and if we have any language to use for the 
credit provision. I have a meeting at 3:00 an should be back at my desk by 
4:00. 


Thanks,

Jarrod

Subject: Re: Update on Petron Hedging Program

Well, it looks like we might have a shot at an ISDA w/ a PHilippines 
company.  One issue that discussed w/ Manuel but he does not mention in his 
note is that we would probably require an enforceability opinion from Petron 
(a compnay jointly owned by the PHilippines govt and Saudi Aramco).  I'm not 
sure which credit dept. would handle this deal, but Cynthia Schnedier has 
some familiarity w/ Petron.   I'll leave it to Mark, Alan and Anita to 
determine whether Anita will handle the ISDA or whether it will be someone 
from Houston (Sara S. did the original legal due diligence on the 
enforceability of commodities derivatives contracts in the PHilippines).

Manuel,

Thanks for the update and we look forward to meet Petron traders/risk 
management team during our next visit to Manila, probably during our first 
cargo of gasoil to FGH, currently planned for end August / early September. 
Kindly let us know on new developments. For your information, John is away on 
home leave and will be back in office only after mid - August.  

Best regards,

Subject: Update on Petron Hedging Program




Dear John,

Yayette Ventigan of Petron informed me yesterday that the energy derivatives 
course conducted by Paradigm in Manila from July 7 to 10 was well-received.  
I sensed that the course was not deemed easy by the Petron participants.  
Further, Yayette indicated that they could have easily used up more time for 
the same amount of material.

Given the Paradigm course (and the Citibank course which Yayette attended in 
Australia), Yayette indicated that the Petron Board will most likely give the 
marching orders to Petron management on July 27 to (1) develop an initial, 
basic and conservative hedging program for Petron?s fuel oil and gasoil 
supplied to the National Power Corporation and (2) go out to the market (most 
likely through a bid process) and execute a financial risk management 
contract (ISDA).

Yayette indicated that Petron looks forward to the working meeting with 
Enron?s Singapore traders.  I indicated to Yayette that end of August to 
early September would probably be convenient for us.  Yayette could not yet 
determine an appropriate time for Petron.

With respect to legal expectations, Petron appears to be at ease with the
following:

?  In general, the concept of disassociating the financial risk management 
contract from the Philippines with the exception of Petron Corporation (a 
Philippine corporation) being a party to the contract.

?  Petron executing a financial risk management contract with an offshore 
counter-party like Citibank Australia or ECT Singapore.

?  Petron physically executing the contract outside the Philippines.

?  The contract to be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

I did point out to Yayette the need for offshore collateral in the form of a 
Letter of Credit, which is consistent with the risk of non-enforcement for 
collateral in the Philippines.  Yayette indicated that she would raise this 
issue in her discussions with Petron treasury.

More later as I receive more feedback from Petron.

Best regards,
Manuel

agreed to sign an ISDA within 20 days.  Would you please prepare a credit

agreed to use Enron Corp. as the swap counterparty.

Also, you left the chart for the PATS-2000 deal in my office (you, bum!).  I

Subject: Re: Contacts

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EPCA's accounts, EPCA will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

CATALYTICA, KAWASAKI, AND ENRON ANNOUNCE GAS TURBINES WITH XONON(tm) FOR
DISTRIBUTED POWER PROJECT

        Mountain View, CA (May 17, 2000) - Catalytica Combustion Systems,
Inc., a subsidiary of Catalytica, Inc. (NASDAQ - CTAL), Kawasaki Motors
Corp., U.S.A., an affiliate of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd., and Enron
Energy Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Enron Corp. (NYSE - ENE), announced
today their intent to furnish three Kawasaki M1A-13X gas turbines for a
distributed generation power project to be installed in the Northeastern
United States. The engines will be equipped with Catalytica's Xonon Cool
Combustion technology-the only system that enables gas turbines to achieve
ultra-low emissions without the use of burdensome exhaust gas cleanup
systems.  The project is expected to enter service in late 2001.
Kawasaki's commercial introduction of Xonon-equipped engines marks a
milestone in Kawasaki's program to expand the presence of its family of
small gas turbines in the North American market.  Mr. Hiro Matsumura,
general manager of the Kawasaki Motors Corp., U.S.A. Gas Turbine Division
stated, ""We are pleased and excited that Enron has chosen us as a partner
for this distributed generation project.  We believe that the combination of
this proven, reliable and cost-effective engine with the unparalleled
advantage of Xonon's ultra-low NOx performance will permit users to take
advantage of the economies of on-site generation with virtually no
environmental impact.""
Catalytica Combustion Systems' President and CEO, Dennis Orwig, said,
""Xonon's ultra-low emissions will facilitate the siting of new power
generation units in urban and suburban areas. This should reduce both the
need for new power transmission lines and the environmental impact of our
power supplies.""  He continued, ""We are proud to be working with these two
leading organizations to bring the benefits of clean, reliable energy to the
high growth distributed generation market.""
Tom White, vice chairman of Enron Energy Services, commented, ""Xonon is a
key element of Enron Energy Services' distributed generation solution to
supplying clean energy to meet the increasing energy demands of the growing
US economy.  Further, Kawasaki's products can effectively meet the
challenging requirements of this emerging market and we expect that
additional opportunities to use the M1A-13X will be forthcoming.""
Catalytica's Xonon Cool Combustion technology is a patented pollution
prevention system that avoids the formation of nitrogen oxide (NOx), a
primary contributor to smog, by reducing localized combustion temperatures
while achieving equivalent combustion efficiency and performance.  Xonon has
demonstrated NOx emissions of well under 2.5 parts per million (ppm) and it
also dramatically reduces emissions of carbon monoxide and unburned
hydrocarbons. Xonon is the only combustion system demonstrated to meet
California Air Resources Board and South Coast Air Quality Management
District emissions guidelines for new gas turbines without the use of an
exhaust cleanup system.
Kawasaki Motors Corp., U.S.A. Gas Turbine Division (www.kawasaki.com.),
located in Grand Rapids, Michigan, provides a full line of gas turbine
packaging, parts, overhaul and field maintenance support, and customer
service. Its affiliate corporation, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.,
recognized as one of the world leaders in the gas turbine industry,
established this division in early 1999 to provide better customer service
to its North American clients.
Enron Energy Services is a subsidiary of Enron Corp., one of the world's
leading electricity, natural gas and communications companies.  Enron owns
approximately $33 billion in energy and communications assets, produces
electricity and natural gas, develops, constructs and operates energy
facilities worldwide, delivers physical commodities and financial and risk
management services to customers around the world and is developing a
nationwide internet-based communications network.  Enron's internet address
is www.enron.com, and the stock is traded under the ticker symbol, ""ENE.""
Catalytica, Inc. (www.catalytica-inc.com) finds new pathways to improve
processes-reducing time, waste and costs.  It operates through three
subsidiaries: Catalytica Combustion Systems, Catalytica Pharmaceuticals, and
Catalytica Advanced Technologies. Catalytica Combustion Systems' unique
Xonon Cool Combustion technology enables gas turbines to produce essentially
pollution-free power.  Catalytica Pharmaceuticals applies innovative and
patented catalytic technologies and other chemical processes to improve the
steps for manufacturing pharmaceuticals and finds better and more efficient
ways to produce products in commercial scale quantities.  Catalytica
Advanced Technologies serves as the incubator for new catalytic technologies
for industrial applications.

This news release contains forward-looking statements regarding
incorporation of Catalytica's Xonon combustion system into the Kawasaki
M1A-13X turbine, the supply M1A-13X gas turbines by Kawasaki to Enron, the
ability of Enron to place Xonon-equipped M1A-13X turbines at project sites,
the demand for distributed power projects, and the competitive position of
the M1A-13X, Xonon, Kawasaki and its affiliates, Enron and its affiliates,
Catalytica, and Catalytica Combustion Systems.  Actual results could differ
and such differences could be material.  These statements involve risks and
uncertainties, including without limitation, the fact that there may be
unanticipated technical, commercial, or other factors related to the
incorporation of Xonon into the M1A-13X turbines or the arrangements between
Kawasaki and Enron for the supply of M1A-13X gas turbines, that marketing,
project development, and installation timelines and regulatory review
outcomes are uncertain, and that opportunities may differ from those stated.
Enron and Catalytica undertake no obligation to update publicly any
forward-looking statements to reflect new information, events, or
circumstances after the date of this release.  Investors are encouraged to
review SEC filings for factors that could affect Enron's future performance
and Catalytica's SEC Form 10-K filing for the year ending December 31, 1999,
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for additional factors
that could affect Catalytica's future performance.

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EDIDE's accounts, EDIDE will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Sara,

I have attached draft Confirmation of a Collar with Rand Whitney. They want 
to go live with this deal today and send out an executable Confirmation. 
Tanya wants to put a provision in the confirmation that states that the deal 
is subject to Credit approval. If we do not get credit approval Tanya will 
kill the deal. I have left a message with Tanya asking her exactly what she 
wants to say in the Confirmation. Please let me know what you think of the 
Collar the way it is writtne and if we have any language to use for the 
credit provision. I have a meeting at 3:00 an should be back at my desk by 
4:00. 


Thanks,

Jarrod




P.S. SITA? you were going to take a look at the governing law."

Hello all,

Carol, I have sent to you copies of all confirmed deal activity currently 
evidencing live deal activity.  Let me know when I can discuss the below 
agreement with NGTS, as they are currently shut down on EOL and telephonic 
trading and the position continues to grow.

Thanks
Brant

Brant and Sara:
Here is a very rough draft of a proposed letter agreement for NGTS.  It 
requires some work but hopefully it's a start.  It cannot be finalized until 
we see all of the physical and financial confirms and agreements and should 
NOT be sent to NGTS until Sara and I are comfortable that it works.

 Attached for your review and comment is a draft of the Schedule and Credit 
Support Annex to the referenced agreement.  It is our intention to replace 
the existing Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated as of May 28, 1992 
between Enron Risk Management Services Corp. (now known as Enron North 
America Corp.) and Morgan Guaranty  (the ""Existing Master Agreement"") with 
the ISDA Master Agreement.   Under the exisiting Master Agreement, Enron 
Corp. executed a $50,000,000  Guaranty in favor of  Morgan Guaranty. The 
draft ISDA Master Agreement includes our updated form of Guaranty.  We can 
either amend the exisiting form of Guaranty or amend and restate the 
exisiting Guaranty with our updated form of Guaranty.

 Should you have any questions or comments, please  call either Sara 
Shackleton (attorney) at (713) 853-5620 (email address:  
sara.Shackleton@enron.com) or me (paralegal) at (713) 853-0975 (email

At the request of the CP, we would like to redraft the ISDA with the 
suggested tiered threshold structure (see attached credit worksheet).  Other 
credit terms (ie. guaranties) may need to be amended as described in the 
worksheet attached.  We will simultaneously be amending our exiting Master 
Power Purchase and Sale Agreement with a similar tiered threshold structure.  
If you should have any comments or questions, please contact me at x5-7712.

Gareth:  My comments are generally directed toward the Schedule to the ISDA 
Master Agreement between the Trust and UBS.  Please note that UBS is aware of 
the 12/9/97 master executed between Swiss Bank Corporation and ENA (as it was 
attached to the original fax).  The confirms are pretty straightforward.

(1)  Is the Trust an eligible swap participant?
(2)  The Schedule is missing some ""standard"" Enron type provisions (which 
were in the Swiss Bank master).  These include:
 limitation of liability
 confidentiality
 setoff  
 isn't the Trust an Enron affiliate?  this could impact our approach.
(3)  Enron does not agree to the ISDA standard jurisdiction language (which 
is non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of NY state and the federal court 
in Manhattan; waiver of all objections).  Enron's preference is arbitration.  
With GC consent, we agree to other provisions (e.g., specifice courts, waiver 
of jury trial, so specific court and no waiver of objections, etc.).  In the 
Swiss Bank master, we agreed to NY law, neither party waived any objections 
to venue/forum, and parties could sue anywhere.
(4)  Is this master to be limited to this transaction only?  If the Trust 
intends to use this agreement for future currency, rate, or other 
transactions, we need to consider the impact of caving on our usual terms.  
What eventually happens to the Trust?

Also, Rod Nelson in credit is currently reviewing Enron exposure to UBS.
Call if you need anything else.  Sara"

Hello my Esteemed Doctors,

I am in Rodney Malcolm's Commercial Transaction Group focusing on selling 
energy outsourcing relationships to industrial consumers. 
Based on the list of executed master agreements that was provided to us 
recently, many of our targeted industrial customers have not signed our 
master swap agreement. 

In preparation for our transacting with these customers, would you send me as 
soon as possible a copy of our Master Swap Agreement language, a copy of the 
more intermediate ""Omnibus"" Short form Swap agreement, and a copy of the one 
or two page confirmation agreement.  I will forward to my group so that they 
can become more familiar with the language, and I will also accumulate the 
industrial customers that we are closest to closing deals.  I will then 
forward the names of those customers to you so that we can get these 
documents to the customers in advance of the deals.

If you have any questions or comments, please call me at x35583.  Thank you, 
Tim

Hello Bob and Ed.

What is the most efficient way for us to get Master Swap Agreements in place 
with our industrial consumers.  With the commodity energy market going 
through the roof, many of the industrials are asking us to concentrate on 
solving their short term commodity exposure and look to establish a  greater 
outsourcing opportunity in the future.  We do not seem to have Master Swap 
Agreements in place with industrials such as IMC Global, AK Steel, WR Grace, 
and our solutions will involve financial swaps.

Subject: Re: Contacts

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EPCA's accounts, EPCA will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

Tim,

Once you have put your list of targeted customers together, please send it to 
me or Bill Bradford in Credit Risk Management, as CRM is responsible for the 
credit review and approval process.  Additionally, CRM will determine the 
appropriate credit terms for legal to incorporate into the ISDA document.  
Once we have completed our review, we will forward the terms to legal for 
drafting.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at 
X3-3263.

Thanks,
Tanya

Hello my Esteemed Doctors,

I am in Rodney Malcolm's Commercial Transaction Group focusing on selling 
energy outsourcing relationships to industrial consumers. 
Based on the list of executed master agreements that was provided to us 
recently, many of our targeted industrial customers have not signed our 
master swap agreement. 

In preparation for our transacting with these customers, would you send me as 
soon as possible a copy of our Master Swap Agreement language, a copy of the 
more intermediate ""Omnibus"" Short form Swap agreement, and a copy of the one 
or two page confirmation agreement.  I will forward to my group so that they 
can become more familiar with the language, and I will also accumulate the 
industrial customers that we are closest to closing deals.  I will then 
forward the names of those customers to you so that we can get these 
documents to the customers in advance of the deals.

If you have any questions or comments, please call me at x35583.  Thank you, 
Tim

Hello Bob and Ed.

What is the most efficient way for us to get Master Swap Agreements in place 
with our industrial consumers.  With the commodity energy market going 
through the roof, many of the industrials are asking us to concentrate on 
solving their short term commodity exposure and look to establish a  greater 
outsourcing opportunity in the future.  We do not seem to have Master Swap 
Agreements in place with industrials such as IMC Global, AK Steel, WR Grace, 
and our solutions will involve financial swaps.


Thank you. Tim

I  would love it if we could meet.  We have made a little bit of headway in 
this effort, but quite frankly, not much.  In fact, I have seen DASH's that 
is indicating the purchase of public equity and I am trying to find out who

need me to. I will bring somebody from my group to help and learn so we

Jeff and Larry:  Last year, Mary Gosnell prepared a one page summary which 
was used by legal and credit to target the preparation of ISDA Master 
Agreements.  The summary was divided into two parts:  ""Without Master 
Agreements"" and ""With ECT Master Agreements"" and included the number of 
trades for the first half of the year.  It is our objective once again to put 
new agreements into place and upgrade existing ECT Master Agreements to ISDA 
Master Agreements.  I don't know if EOL trades have impacted the numbers this 
year and I'm not sure whether we need to create a line item for EOL (I'll

I refer to our recent conversation relating to the progress of ISDA 
negotiations with the above counterparty.

I have just spoken to Carine Lavergne at SITA.  She informs me that SITA does 
not feel adequately equipped or informed to progress the negotiations 
internally and therefore intends to appoint external counsel (I urged her to 
do this as soon as possible).  Despite this intended appointment, she assured 
me that SITA wishes to enter into the ISDA as soon as possible and is keen to 
keep negotiations to a minimum.

Either I or Michael Khajeh-Noori will keep you updated as to the progress.

For your information, I also attach a status report with respect to the 
counterparties with whom Michael and I are currently negotiating.



Let me know if you need anything else.

appointed local counsel as the legal department is currently busy acquiring 
an Australian subsidiary.  

I will chase again next week.

I refer to our recent conversation relating to the progress of ISDA 
negotiations with the above counterparty.

I have just spoken to Carine Lavergne at SITA.  She informs me that SITA does 
not feel adequately equipped or informed to progress the negotiations 
internally and therefore intends to appoint external counsel (I urged her to 
do this as soon as possible).  Despite this intended appointment, she assured 
me that SITA wishes to enter into the ISDA as soon as possible and is keen to 
keep negotiations to a minimum.

Either I or Michael Khajeh-Noori will keep you updated as to the progress.

For your information, I also attach a status report with respect to the 
counterparties with whom Michael and I are currently negotiating.



Let me know if you need anything else.

Regards
Deepak

All -

I'll be happy to do the legal due dliligence and ISDA documentation from here.

Bill/Cynthia:
Please let me know who in Credit will be handling this so that I can 
coordinate with them when the need arises.

Sara:
When Janice mentioned the legal due diligence with regard to commodity 
derivatives in the Philippines, did she mean the legal survey done by Allen & 
Overy?  If so , I've got copies of all that and can take it from here. If 
that isn't the case and you've done more ISDA work in the Phillipines since 
then, I'd be forever grateful if you could send over whatever copies of the 
stuff which you have for me to suss out the situation there.

Mark T. /Janice:
Is there any particular law firm whom we should work with this time round?

Thanks, all.

Rgds,
Anita

Subject: Re: Update on Petron Hedging Program

Well, it looks like we might have a shot at an ISDA w/ a PHilippines 
company.  One issue that discussed w/ Manuel but he does not mention in his 
note is that we would probably require an enforceability opinion from Petron 
(a compnay jointly owned by the PHilippines govt and Saudi Aramco).  I'm not 
sure which credit dept. would handle this deal, but Cynthia Schnedier has 
some familiarity w/ Petron.   I'll leave it to Mark, Alan and Anita to 
determine whether Anita will handle the ISDA or whether it will be someone 
from Houston (Sara S. did the original legal due diligence on the 
enforceability of commodities derivatives contracts in the PHilippines).

Manuel,

Thanks for the update and we look forward to meet Petron traders/risk 
management team during our next visit to Manila, probably during our first 
cargo of gasoil to FGH, currently planned for end August / early September. 
Kindly let us know on new developments. For your information, John is away on 
home leave and will be back in office only after mid - August.  

Best regards,

Subject: Update on Petron Hedging Program




Dear John,

Yayette Ventigan of Petron informed me yesterday that the energy derivatives 
course conducted by Paradigm in Manila from July 7 to 10 was well-received.  
I sensed that the course was not deemed easy by the Petron participants.  
Further, Yayette indicated that they could have easily used up more time for 
the same amount of material.

Given the Paradigm course (and the Citibank course which Yayette attended in 
Australia), Yayette indicated that the Petron Board will most likely give the 
marching orders to Petron management on July 27 to (1) develop an initial, 
basic and conservative hedging program for Petron?s fuel oil and gasoil 
supplied to the National Power Corporation and (2) go out to the market (most 
likely through a bid process) and execute a financial risk management 
contract (ISDA).

Yayette indicated that Petron looks forward to the working meeting with 
Enron?s Singapore traders.  I indicated to Yayette that end of August to 
early September would probably be convenient for us.  Yayette could not yet 
determine an appropriate time for Petron.

With respect to legal expectations, Petron appears to be at ease with the
following:

?  In general, the concept of disassociating the financial risk management 
contract from the Philippines with the exception of Petron Corporation (a 
Philippine corporation) being a party to the contract.

?  Petron executing a financial risk management contract with an offshore 
counter-party like Citibank Australia or ECT Singapore.

?  Petron physically executing the contract outside the Philippines.

?  The contract to be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

I did point out to Yayette the need for offshore collateral in the form of a 
Letter of Credit, which is consistent with the risk of non-enforcement for 
collateral in the Philippines.  Yayette indicated that she would raise this 
issue in her discussions with Petron treasury.

More later as I receive more feedback from Petron.

Best regards,
Manuel

Carol:  I missed this deal the other day which was originally assigned to 
Marie.  In our last legal/credit meeting, Brant was going to call Christina 
Tice, the CP credit manager.  Maybe this is a good one for Tana to stay on 
top of Brant.  Your name is on this one.

Also, nothing happened with credit on Friday.  Although Richard inquired 
about Palladium.  I let him know that we drew on the LC's last week 
(according to Tanya).  Sara"

No, you are not subject to the ""backup"" of documents.  To get them out of

		 Subject: CAPEX

Rod/Sara: last week we met with Capex and everything is advancing very well.
They see the signing of the ISDA as a very simple process, as they have 
several of them signed. But we need to take into account the following:
They want to sign 2 ISDAs, 1 with CAPEX and another one with CAPSA, because 
LPG, Oil and power are traded from the different entities
They have a Fiduciary Assignment Agreement with IFC that we need to look at 
and if necessary add some language in the ISDA

We are sending you the IFC Agreement for your review and comment. It will go 
by courrier cause of it's length. Once you receive it pls. review, and if we 
need to discuss anything with Capex, coordinate with Patrick to arrange a 
conference call.
Patrick will be involved in the process as he needs to fully understand the 
ISDA document due to EOL which is scheduled to  come on later this year.

Sara, we will need an ISDA for CAPSA as well. It will be identical to the 
CAPEX I believe. Rod pls provide your input to Sara on credit for Capsa, 
considering the no threshold issue.

I am a derivatives lawyer with ENA in Houston and obtained your name through 
one of my traders who is transacting with Jay Carr in Houston (please see 
attached message below).  When I spoke with Jay earlier this month, I asked 
him for the name of a lawyer but was advised that all Vitol lawyers were in 
New York and that he would pass my message along to a lawyer.  I am assuming 
that you are the trading lawyer who can assist me with negotiating an ISDA 
Master Agreement between our respective companies.  If not, please let me 
know and feel free to pass this message on to the appropriate attorney.  On 
April 12, 1995, Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp., predecessor in title 
to ENA, and Vitol S.A., Inc. entered into a Master Agreement which is one of 
ENA's early energy price swap agreements.  Since our companies are currently 
trading weather derivatives, I think you would agree that it would be prudent 
to supersede the existing agreement with an ISDA Master Agreement.  This 
relates to my conversation with Jay in that we confirmed our weather deals 
under the existing master but incorporated the 1991 and 1993 ISDA definitions 
into the confirms of our weather trades.  Please let me hear from you.  You 
can reach me via email, phone (713/853-5620) or fax (713/646-3490).

no one else could help.  I would like to speak with a Vitol lawyer about (1) 
replacing our existing financial master with an ISDA (to accommodate a 
broader range of products) and (2) specifically incorporating the relevant 
ISDA definitions into the recent weather transaction confirmations even 
though the master is an early master energy price swap agreement.  Please

There was a flurry of activity in March, 1997 involving Petron but it was on 
the physical side and we never made it to the swap issues.  Again in April, 
1998, Manuel and John Enerson began looking into the issue of gaming statutes 
in an effort to attack legislation in the Philippines.  No further legal work 
was ever attempted.  Hope this helps.  Regards.   SS

I'll be happy to do the legal due dliligence and ISDA documentation from here.

Please let me know who in Credit will be handling this so that I can 
coordinate with them when the need arises.

Sara:
When Janice mentioned the legal due diligence with regard to commodity 
derivatives in the Philippines, did she mean the legal survey done by Allen & 
Overy?  If so , I've got copies of all that and can take it from here. If 
that isn't the case and you've done more ISDA work in the Phillipines since 
then, I'd be forever grateful if you could send over whatever copies of the 
stuff which you have for me to suss out the situation there.

Mark T. /Janice:
Is there any particular law firm whom we should work with this time round?

Thanks, all.

Well, it looks like we might have a shot at an ISDA w/ a PHilippines 
company.  One issue that discussed w/ Manuel but he does not mention in his 
note is that we would probably require an enforceability opinion from Petron 
(a compnay jointly owned by the PHilippines govt and Saudi Aramco).  I'm not 
sure which credit dept. would handle this deal, but Cynthia Schnedier has 
some familiarity w/ Petron.   I'll leave it to Mark, Alan and Anita to 
determine whether Anita will handle the ISDA or whether it will be someone 
from Houston (Sara S. did the original legal due diligence on the 
enforceability of commodities derivatives contracts in the PHilippines).

Subject: Update on Petron Hedging Program




Dear John,

Yayette Ventigan of Petron informed me yesterday that the energy derivatives 
course conducted by Paradigm in Manila from July 7 to 10 was well-received.  
I sensed that the course was not deemed easy by the Petron participants.  
Further, Yayette indicated that they could have easily used up more time for 
the same amount of material.

Given the Paradigm course (and the Citibank course which Yayette attended in 
Australia), Yayette indicated that the Petron Board will most likely give the 
marching orders to Petron management on July 27 to (1) develop an initial, 
basic and conservative hedging program for Petron?s fuel oil and gasoil 
supplied to the National Power Corporation and (2) go out to the market (most 
likely through a bid process) and execute a financial risk management 
contract (ISDA).

Yayette indicated that Petron looks forward to the working meeting with 
Enron?s Singapore traders.  I indicated to Yayette that end of August to 
early September would probably be convenient for us.  Yayette could not yet 
determine an appropriate time for Petron.

With respect to legal expectations, Petron appears to be at ease with the
following:

?  In general, the concept of disassociating the financial risk management 
contract from the Philippines with the exception of Petron Corporation (a 
Philippine corporation) being a party to the contract.

?  Petron executing a financial risk management contract with an offshore 
counter-party like Citibank Australia or ECT Singapore.

?  Petron physically executing the contract outside the Philippines.

?  The contract to be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

I did point out to Yayette the need for offshore collateral in the form of a 
Letter of Credit, which is consistent with the risk of non-enforcement for 
collateral in the Philippines.  Yayette indicated that she would raise this 
issue in her discussions with Petron treasury.

More later as I receive more feedback from Petron.

Best regards,
Manuel

Sara,

When we met a week or so ago we discussed shortening the Weather 
confirmations to one page by amending the ISDA. I sent you the EOL GTC's and 
was wondering how we are coming along on that project. The volume is really 
growing and and it would help out greatly if we could get these to one page.

Subject: REGULATORY AFFAIRS DATABASE

Regulatory Affairs=01, electronic Database:  http://ei-sp-data 01/regulator=
y

Considering communication as one of Enron=01,s most important values, we ar=
e=20
pleased to announce the new Brazilian Regulatory Affairs=01, electronic=20
Database. The aim of this database is much more than a collection of=20
information. Instead, it was created to make our work easier, more efficien=
t=20
and more effective by stimulating the exchange of ideas on the main=20
regulatory issues throughout the company.=20


The new database is a web site already available in Enron=01,s intranet. To=
=20
access it, all you have to do is type the address=20
http://ei-sp-data01/regulatory in your browser. The site is divided into si=
x=20
parts, which are:

1)   Pertinent Legislation
In this link you will find the Brazilian Federal Constitution, emphasizing=
=20
the most important articles for Regulatory Affairs, some Federal Laws,=20
Decrees and  =01&Portarias=018 from  Ministry of Mines and Energy;

2)   Documents
Contains Concessions (Elektro=01,s  Contract),  Authorizations (EPE, ECE),=
=20
Procedures, Resolutions, other documents from ANEEL, MAE and  ONS as well a=
s=20
those sent by Regulatory Affairs;

3)   Discussion Room
In this link you can contribute messages to the regulatory topics being=20
discussed. You can also begin a new internal discussion by creating a new=
=20
topic. Your message will be displayed in the topic form so everyone=20
interested can read it. You should be aware that all Enron=01,s employees w=
ill=20
have access to view it;

4)   Links
Here you will find links to many pertinent sites such as ANEEL, ELETROBRAS,=
=20
CSPE, Diario Oficial da Uni?o, MAE, MME, ONS and news through Panorama=20
Setorial;

5)   Current Activities of Brazilian Regulatory Affairs at EISC
This link contains the current month=01,s weekly events as well as monthly =
and=20
annual reports;

6)   Give your feedback=20
If you have a suggestion about how to improve the system, and we hope you=
=20
will, this is where you will make it. In order to suit our needs, this=20
database is going to be modified based on the users=01, comments.

All pieces of information and documents, when  possible and economically=20
viable, will have both English and Portuguese versions.

It was intended to create something basic, make it available to everybody =
=20
and receive feedback from the users. The next step will be the development =
of=20
a =01&search engine=018 and the inclusion of more information. The system i=
s quite=20
easy to navigate but we will be more than happy to answer any questions you=
=20
have regarding the database.=20

Please feel free to call Carlos Gustavo Azevedo at 011 5503-1295 or via=20
e-mail.

FYI - This Database was developed by Carlos Gustavo (Regulatory Affairs) an=
d=20
Adriano Pereira, items 3 and 6 ( Information Systems).

I am a derivatives lawyer with ENA in Houston and obtained your name through
one
of my traders who is transacting with Jay Carr in Houston (please see
attached
message below).  When I spoke with Jay earlier this month, I asked him for
the
name of a lawyer but was advised that all Vitol lawyers were in New York and
that he would pass my message along to a lawyer.  I am assuming that you are
the
trading lawyer who can assist me with negotiating an ISDA Master Agreement
between our respective companies.  If not, please let me know and feel free
to
pass this message on to the appropriate attorney.  On April 12, 1995, Enron
Capital & Trade Resources Corp., predecessor in title to ENA, and Vitol
S.A.,
Inc. entered into a Master Agreement which is one of ENA's early energy
price
swap agreements.  Since our companies are currently trading weather
derivatives,
I think you would agree that it would be prudent to supersede the existing
agreement with an ISDA Master Agreement.  This relates to my conversation
with
Jay in that we confirmed our weather deals under the existing master but
incorporated the 1991 and 1993 ISDA definitions into the confirms of our
weather
trades.  Please let me hear from you.  You can reach me via email, phone
(713/853-5620) or fax (713/646-3490).

Jay:  I am a lawyer with Enron.  I called for you on Friday, you're out, and
no
one else could help.  I would like to speak with a Vitol lawyer about (1)
replacing our existing financial master with an ISDA (to accommodate a
broader
range of products) and (2) specifically incorporating the relevant ISDA
definitions into the recent weather transaction confirmations even though
the
master is an early master energy price swap agreement.  Please call me at
713
853-5620 with the information so that we can move quickly.  Thank you for
your

Sara

Firstly, thanks for the message. I am indeed the right person for ISDA's in
Vitol. I did meet with your credit people in London ( David Hardy and Lee
Munden) and we did discuss the idea of replacing the existing agreement. I
am at present in our office in Rotterdam, but will be back in Geneva
tomorrow. I therefore do not have the existing agreement with me, but I seem
to remember that it is just signed with Vitol SA Inc, which is the US branch
office of the main trading company in the Vitol Group, Vitol SA, which is a
Swiss company registered in Geneva. I would suggest that you send us a
proposal for an ISDA agreement with Vitol SA, set up as a multibranch
company about to trade out of its Geneva and Houston office, and with Vitol
Holding BV (the ultimate parent company of the group) as the credit support
provider. I would hope that once we have agreed terms for the basic schedule
and credit support annex, we can then easily add other Vitol or Enron
companies as appropriate.

Regards, David

I am a derivatives lawyer with ENA in Houston and obtained your name through
one
of my traders who is transacting with Jay Carr in Houston (please see
attached
message below).  When I spoke with Jay earlier this month, I asked him for
the
name of a lawyer but was advised that all Vitol lawyers were in New York and
that he would pass my message along to a lawyer.  I am assuming that you are
the
trading lawyer who can assist me with negotiating an ISDA Master Agreement
between our respective companies.  If not, please let me know and feel free
to
pass this message on to the appropriate attorney.  On April 12, 1995, Enron
Capital & Trade Resources Corp., predecessor in title to ENA, and Vitol
S.A.,
Inc. entered into a Master Agreement which is one of ENA's early energy
price
swap agreements.  Since our companies are currently trading weather
derivatives,
I think you would agree that it would be prudent to supersede the existing
agreement with an ISDA Master Agreement.  This relates to my conversation
with
Jay in that we confirmed our weather deals under the existing master but
incorporated the 1991 and 1993 ISDA definitions into the confirms of our
weather
trades.  Please let me hear from you.  You can reach me via email, phone
(713/853-5620) or fax (713/646-3490).

I agree with your proposal but would like to add that in order to determine 
the MAC for Vitol Holding BV, in the absence of a Rating from S& P etc, we 
need to receive details of existing bank covenants which I believe you were 
going to forward to us.

We also need to consider the netting issue between the various entities 
involved in UK Power / Gas / Oil 

Please give me a call if you have any questions

Tanya:  Please see Vitol response below.  Do you generate the credit 
worksheet?  How does London credit fit in here?  Another interesting feature 
here is the use of the multibranch provision for a trading company (Vitol 
isn't a bank, or is it?).  I have never seen this utilized in practice for a 
non-bank entity and have resisted the idea for us.  There is very little 
written about the application of the multibranch party and I think that is 
because it has been understood as applying to banks.  However, would this 
master be a ""multibranch master"" for us as well?  Sara

Firstly, thanks for the message. I am indeed the right person for ISDA's in
Vitol. I did meet with your credit people in London ( David Hardy and Lee
Munden) and we did discuss the idea of replacing the existing agreement. I
am at present in our office in Rotterdam, but will be back in Geneva
tomorrow. I therefore do not have the existing agreement with me, but I seem
to remember that it is just signed with Vitol SA Inc, which is the US branch
office of the main trading company in the Vitol Group, Vitol SA, which is a
Swiss company registered in Geneva. I would suggest that you send us a
proposal for an ISDA agreement with Vitol SA, set up as a multibranch
company about to trade out of its Geneva and Houston office, and with Vitol
Holding BV (the ultimate parent company of the group) as the credit support
provider. I would hope that once we have agreed terms for the basic schedule
and credit support annex, we can then easily add other Vitol or Enron
companies as appropriate.

Regards, David

I am a derivatives lawyer with ENA in Houston and obtained your name through

derivatives,
I think you would agree that it would be prudent to supersede the existing

I agree with your proposal but would like to add that in order to determine 
the MAC for Vitol Holding BV, in the absence of a Rating from S& P etc, we 
need to receive details of existing bank covenants which I believe you were 
going to forward to us.

We also need to consider the netting issue between the various entities 
involved in UK Power / Gas / Oil 

Please give me a call if you have any questions

Dear Ms. Shackleton:

Thank you for your recent order placed at
www.bravo.com.  Bravo 20 has recently merged with OFFI
& Company.  During this transitional period, our time
between order receipt and shipping is longer than
usual, as we are in the midst of manufacturing and
re-stocking.

Due to this delay, the approximate shipping date for
your order is 7/25/00, although we hope the actual
ship date will be earlier.  Please do not hesitate to
contact us at 800-383-OFFI(6334) or offiweb@yahoo.com
if you have any questions or if we can be of further
assistance.

Thank you,
OFFI & Company

Thank you for the confirmation.  I assume that I am not charged until you 
ship.  Is this correct?

Dear Ms. Shackleton:

Thank you for your recent order placed at
www.bravo.com.  Bravo 20 has recently merged with OFFI
& Company.  During this transitional period, our time
between order receipt and shipping is longer than
usual, as we are in the midst of manufacturing and
re-stocking.

Due to this delay, the approximate shipping date for
your order is 7/25/00, although we hope the actual
ship date will be earlier.  Please do not hesitate to
contact us at 800-383-OFFI(6334) or offiweb@yahoo.com
if you have any questions or if we can be of further
assistance.

Thank you,
OFFI & Company

Paul:  I finally got your address right!  Why are YOU listed in the Enron 
Corp. address book?  Tanya and Rod can be accessed through the ECT 
directory!  I spoke with David Mitchell this morning.  He will prepare a 
short memo summarizing our recent discussion (NYMEX), probably by the end of 
this week or early next week.  Then we can decide whether additional 
conversations are necessary and how to proceed in general.  Also, please send 
credit worksheets to BOTH Susan Bailey and Susan Flynn.  They divide up the 
booty.  We have a new paralegal starting on Monday named Samantha Boyd.  She 
will eventually be thrown into the fray.  We'll be sending a new message to 
everyone in credit soon.  Thanks for your help.  Sara

Cargill in 1993.  I am advised that there has not been any activity with 
Cargill for many months.  It appears that we had subaccounts for trading 
crude, nat gas, unleaded gas.  We do not have any margin residing with 
Cargill.

As of 5/23/00, I see only 13 active futures accounts.  The following accounts

I am inclined to close inactive accounts.  Can you contact the owner of the 
account and find out if there is any reason to keep it open?  Otherwise, I 
think we should inform them we want to close the account.
Comments?
Do we have an identified Business Owner of the active accounts?

Sara,

As discussed, ECC hopes to transact with ATCO over the next week or so if we 
can agree on pricing.  This is the form of agreement they propose.  It 
represents 
the way their 3-way JV owned plant will sell power offtake to marketers such 
as Enron.  I would be interested in your opinion especially if we are close 
to 
commercial agreement.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Further to our telephone discussion today with Jason Peters who I couldn't 
find on email. I did some checking around. The clause (which incidently 
normally has a paragraph (d))seems  to be only found in the CBA Agreements. 
Its purpose is a little uncertain. If the Broker was holding a Client's money 
then by law he must account for it. 

The reason why there ARN Ambro may be reluctant to accept the clause is 
because the instances it addresses would probably fall within the definition 
of an ""undesirable market event"" under the SFE rules. This would trigger 
action by the Board of SFE to sort out the mess. It may uncertain as to how 
these contractual would fit in     "

Sara, I see no particular issues as to the enforceability in Sweden of 
arbitration under a deemed ISDA.  Incidentally, Sweden has, without 
reservations, signed and ratified the 1958 New York Convention (on the 
Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards) and arbitration has 
also long been used in Sweden and is generally the preferred method of 
settling disputes at the international level.  

The rights of appeal against arbitral awards are limited in Sweden.  Swedish 
law sets out three (exhaustive) grounds for the per se invalidity of an 
arbitral award (wholly or partly):

the award determines an issue which is non-arbitable;
the award, or the manner in which the award arose, violates Swedish public 
policy; or
the award is not in writing or signed by the arbitrators. 

In addition, an arbitral award is challenable under Swedish law where certain 
procedural irregularities have occurred, such violation of due process, 
relief in excess of claim, invalidity of the arbitration agreement, lack of 
legal competence of arbitrators, etc.

I hope that the foregoing will give you the requisite guidance.  Please 
contact me if you require any further info.

Sara,

As discussed, ECC hopes to transact with ATCO over the next week or so if we 
can agree on pricing.  This is the form of agreement they propose.  It 
represents 
the way their 3-way JV owned plant will sell power offtake to marketers such 
as Enron.  I would be interested in your opinion especially if we are close 
to 
commercial agreement.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Regards,

Duncan Croasdale

Further to our telephone discussion today with Jason Peters who I couldn't 
find on email. I did some checking around. The clause (which incidently 
normally has a paragraph (d))seems  to be only found in the CBA Agreements. 
Its purpose is a little uncertain. If the Broker was holding a Client's money 
then by law he must account for it. 

The reason why there ARN Ambro may be reluctant to accept the clause is 
because the instances it addresses would probably fall within the definition 
of an ""undesirable market event"" under the SFE rules. This would trigger 
action by the Board of SFE to sort out the mess. It may uncertain as to how 
these contractual would fit in     "

Here are my initial thoughts on how we can possibly shorten the weather

amend the Masters to include the following definitions which seem to be used 
in each conform:

Payment Date
NCDC
NWS
HDD
CDD
The Fallback Reference Weather Station procedures - the confirm would 
identify just the Fallback Reference Weather Station
Data Sources

Let me know what you think.

Alos, is it necessary to specify bank account information if that is already 
set forth in the Master?

I don't see a problem with this since the language is standard in most of our 
confirms. One thing though - did the revised  Fallback Reference Weather 
Station language get finalized? I was working with Dave Kistler on this and 
have not heard anything from him on this in over a month. You might check w/ 
him or Mark Tawney to make sure that we include the most recent wording. 

One last query - how is the Confirm Desk going to know whether we have 
included the language as part of the ISDA Master?  They also need to keep in 
mind that with some CP's, such as American Re - we have agreed special 
wording with them and so will have to continue using the longer version of 
confirmation.

The confirms desk has asked us to think about a way that we could shorten the

include definitions/provisions that are common to all confirms.  Below is 
what I have come up with.  Do you see any problems with this?

Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EDIDE's accounts, EDIDE will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

Sheila, finally ready to open up the account at Morgan Stanley for EDIDE so 
that EPCA can transfer the correct amount of ADRs.  I have the Corporate 
Resolution from EDIDE.  I understand that the contact at Morgan Stanley has 
changed.  Please advise.

Here are our tax comments on the PATS documents other than the Offering 
Circular.   

Regards,
AnnMarie
___________________________________________________

Remarketing Agreement
1.) Section 5, Fees and Expenses, provides that the Remarketing Agent will 
not be entitled to any compensation or reimbursement for expenses in 
connection with its services under the Agreement, but UBS Warburg and/or 
affiliates of the bank are presumably receiving various fees (e.g., 
structuring, underwriting or placement fees, etc.?) and, to the extent the 
affiliate is foreign and its employees are performing those services in the 
US, we could have a withholding tax issue with respect to those fees.   Can 
we get an itemization of the fees that Enron expects to pay in the deal and 
the status (i.e., foreign or domestic) of the intended recipient(s)?
2.) Section 4(c).  If there is the potential for the remarketed notes to be 
issued in bearer form, are we sure that Enron will have the necessary rights 
to design the notes and monitor the marketing process so as to ensure we 
don't lose our interest deduction and that we don't become subject to 
withholding for payments to foreign holders?  

Trust Agreement
1.) Section 1.1, Definition of ""Opinion of Counsel,"" page 6.   The second 
sentence in this definition which describing that published rulings from the 
IRS can be relied upon in an an opinion from counsel on tax matters seems 
awkward.   Are items not listed here off-limits for reliance?  I would 
propose to delete the sentence entirely. 
2.) Section 2.1(a), page 10.  
 a.) Will the Trust actually be created at the time the Certificateholders 
make their investment or will it be created earlier and then be amended and 
restated at the time the Certificateholders make their appearance?   If the 
latter is true, who will initially hold all the beneficial interests in the 
Trust, e.g., Enron or a third party, and if the latter, whether it is foreign 
or domestic?
 b.) Are there any restrictions on the number of Certificateholders either 
initially or at any subsequent time?   If not, can we be sure that the Trust 
will not treated as a publicly traded partnership for tax purposes?
3.) Sections 4.3 and 4.4, pages 17-18.   We should confirm that the The Bank 
of New York as Trustee will actually be responsible for any tax reporting 
that needs to ge done in connection with the trust, e.g., trust information 
return (Form 1041), or in connection with the certificate holders' ownership 
interest in the trust (Forms 1099-INT (interest) and Form 1099-? (foreign 
currency swap payments)) and/or Forms 1042/1042-S (if the offering becomes a 
Regulation S offering).  I have found in the past that even when documents 
specify that a bank or trust company is supposed to handle these duties, they 
are typically either ill equipped or physically incapable of complying.   
(See also Section 6.11) 
4.) To the extent that Enron is required to handle any of the book 
accounting, tax accounting/reporting, and any other day-to-day activitites 
for the Trust, we need to determine whether that would give the certificate 
holders nexus in Texas for purposes of the Texas franchise tax.   We should 
also check to make sure that the reference to Enron in the name of the Trust 
doesn't affect this analysis especially since Enron is apparently responsible 
for paying the expenses and liabilities of the Trust under Section 3.6, the 
Trustee's fees under Section 9.5(a), and is responsible for indemnification 
of the Trustee, the Paying Agent, and the Certificate Registrar under Section 
9.5(b). 

Purchase Agreement
1.) Section 3, page 8.  What kind of discounted purchase price will be paid 
for the Notes first by the Trust and then by the Initial Purchaser?   
Presumably, the amount will be de minimis, but we need to know for purposes 
of doing an original issue discount (""OID"") calculation.
2.) Section 4, page 8.   We need to know if and when it is determined that 
the Certificates will be offered in a Regulation S offering.

Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  
Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the ""See"" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I

Tudor are prepared to not list Treasuries as Eligible Collateral - so the

Daniel  - We have not sent you a revised draft of the ISDA as our trader is

On the open issues:

(1) Eligible Collateral - Tudor will agree to Cash as the only form of
Eligible
Collateral.

(2) Loss v Market Quotation - Tudor will agree to Loss for those trades
that
still have 2+  years to run on the date of early termination.

(3) Jurisdiction - Tudor will not agree to ""any court"". Tudor will agree to
NON-exclusive jurisdiction of the NY Courts though.

I look forward to receiving revised drafts.

Kind regards.

Team,

I have had a few conversations over the past couple of days with Terry 
Brownrigg at Twister Gas Services, LLC and Todd Tharp with Sanguine, Ltd..  
We transacted with Twister last week and I had sent you a credit worksheet 
for the transaction.  Twister is a broker who transacts on behalf of small 
E&P companies, and in this case, the E&P agreed to post the L/C we quoted for 
the transaction.  After talking to Sara, it sounds like we are going to go 
ahead and send a confirmation to Twister for the deal and attach to the 
confirmation an assignment of the deal from Twister to Sanguine.  It is my 
understanding that both Terry and Todd will need to sign both the 
confirmation and the assignment, so I think we will need to carefully 
coordinate the steps through the Confirmation Desk (Sheetal Patel).

I have attached a worksheet for the transaction (Sanguine agreed to post 
$500K).  Please coordinate with Sara, Sheetal and me in getting this out.

The contact information at Sanguine is:
Todd Tharp
Manager of Gas Contracts
Sanguine, Ltd.
1861 East 71st Street South
Tulsa, Ok 74136

Thanks,

John

Team,

I have had a few conversations over the past couple of days with Terry 
Brownrigg at Twister Gas Services, LLC and Todd Tharp with Sanguine, Ltd..  
We transacted with Twister last week and I had sent you a credit worksheet 
for the transaction.  Twister is a broker who transacts on behalf of small 
E&P companies, and in this case, the E&P agreed to post the L/C we quoted for 
the transaction.  After talking to Sara, it sounds like we are going to go 
ahead and send a confirmation to Twister for the deal and attach to the 
confirmation an assignment of the deal from Twister to Sanguine.  It is my 
understanding that both Terry and Todd will need to sign both the 
confirmation and the assignment, so I think we will need to carefully 
coordinate the steps through the Confirmation Desk (Sheetal Patel).

I have attached a worksheet for the transaction (Sanguine agreed to post 
$500K).  Please coordinate with Sara, Sheetal and me in getting this out.

The contact information at Sanguine is:
Todd Tharp
Manager of Gas Contracts
Sanguine, Ltd.
1861 East 71st Street South
Tulsa, Ok 74136

Thanks,

John

Pursuant to our conversation, the different scenarios for trades in dispute 
are (and may not be limited to) the following:

Trade agreed Trade not booked    No confirm sent
Trade agreed Trade booked  Killed on T/D  No confirm sent
Trade agreed Trade booked  Killed after T/D  No confirm sent
Trade agreed Trade booked  Trade killed  Confirm sent

Trade booked Trade disputed     No Confirm sent
Trade booked  Trade disputed     Confirm sent

Examples:

Scenario 1: the CP calls back one hour after the trade was agreed and states 
they now do not agree with the trade. Essentially, it could be disputed 
wether or not we had a trade, even though our tapes support our position. No 
impact on booking or Confirmation Desk.

Scenarios 2 and 3 occur essentially the same as Scenario 1 with the exception 
that the trade is booked. Scenario 2 and 3 a different based on the pricing 
implication of a trade booked overnight. In both these scenarios, we should 
consider issuing a Termination Agreement which gives some reference to the 
details of the agreed transaction.

Scenario 4 is the most straight-forward. An agreed trade, booked and 
Confirmed, we issue a Termination Agreement.

Scenarios 5 and 6 are different from Scenarios 2 and 3 in that we have booked 
a trade based on our understanding, but OUR understanding of the terms was 
incorrect. The two scenarios are different in that in 5 a Confirmation is not 
sent. In 5, we should consider issuing a side letter stating that a trade was 
booked in error and no such trade exists. In 6 we should consider issuing a 
side letter stating the trade was booked AND the Confirmation was sent in 
error - and ask that they return the Confirmation.

In the interest of time, I have revised our draft ISDA Schedule to conform in 
most material respects to the 1994 (effective 1992) agreement executed 
between ERMS and Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. (""Old ISDA"").  This was 
done to accommadate the Merrill lawyer, Gary Rosenblum (who didn't want to 
read our Schedule!).  The Old ISDA is not identical to the format used by 
Merrill Lynch International today so I'm not sure how hard they will press 
for other changes.  There are two potential credit issues that I see:  (1)  
agreement as to the Enron Corp. guaranty cap (and possible Merrill Lynch 
guaranty cap) and (2) our introduction of a MAC provision in the form of an 
Additional Event of Default (necessary because the Old ISDA had a Credit 
Support Annex and this one does not).  I left a voice mail for Gary Rosenblum 
and asked that he let me know when he was available on Monday to talk AND to 
have his credit person contact Rod Nelson.  Sara

P.S.  I haven't heard from Morgan Guaranty Trust Company or Morgan Stanley 
Capital Services, Inc."

Carol:  Here's my ""short"" list of issues for Mark:

(1)  Swap Group Meeting on Wednesday, June 7:
 (a) reiterate ""rules"" (e.g., office hours, taking personal/vacation time and 
advising the rest of the group, how rotation of masters/confirms/C.A. works 
and   what happens when someone is ill/vacation, timeliness of deemed 
ISDA's/omnibus confirms, confirmation desk, etc.)
 (b)paralegal workload

(2)  Confirmations and need to create a ""writing""
 multiple confirms with the same counterparty 
 confirms with extremely short terms (hourly, under 5 days) - no confirm?
 use of confirms with negative language

(3)  Hiring a clerk to assist paralegals to run errands

(4)  Policy regarding INDIVIDUALS as eligible swap participants

(5)  Method for shortening weather confirms

(6)  Mary and Brent - possible work assignments"

This is the latest state of play. I've copied Rod and Paul so they are in the 
loop. I'd like Paul to get familiar with the Harvard negotiations so he has 
some background for the other funds I'm talking to. The Harvard traders want 
to see us reach agreement by their year end which in June 30th. They're as 
motivated as we are so let me know when the docs are received.
Thanks. Per

Can you please have your lawyers look at this draft of the intercreditor

ISDA Master Agreement.  We need to know if any of the language is 
objectionable so this document can be finalized next week.

Do I have to think?  Well, I say let's do it.  We'll have to monitor and if 
he is ever ineligible, we can cancel the agreement.  Of course, we can always

Tag- your it, 

I let John Arnold know of our trading terms.  I also spoke to Bill Perkins at 
Small Ventures, he is willing to post a $1MM L/C, he also wants to go ahead 
and put an ISDA in place.  What are your thoughts on this?

Carol St Clair has confirmed for me that the GTC does not contemplate a 
'Correction for Prices'. John Suarez states that corrected prices must be 
'flagged' by the ISO with 75 minutes of publication and must be changed 
within 5 days. Since the GTC doesn't contemplate the issue and the mechanism 
is different from ISDA,  I have added some suggested language to the Index, 
as we should contemplate this issue in the Long Description.

My apologies for not having the attachment included in my last e-mail.

Subject: US East Power Financial Swaps

The East Power traders would like to commence transacting on financial swaps. 
We had anticipated this, so the Product Type was already built and has been 
approved. The Index and Loadshape built with this Product were done so based 
on comments from John Suarez (the trader), who has approved the attached.

Leslie - please offer commets/suggestions from the power perspective.

Mark - final approval will need to come from you since this is a financial 
product.

Also, trading wants us to consider price changes for the Product because the 
prices published do change from time to time. I know that the ISDA 
Definitions contemplate a 30-day true-up, but I can't find a like provision 
in the GTC. So - I took a hack at some language to contemplate the issue:

""If the price published (as set forth herein) on any day during a 
Determination Period is subsequently corrected and the correction is 
announced within 30 calendar days of the original publication date, the 
parties agree that the corrected price shall take affect as if it were the 
price published on the original publication date and the Floating Price will 
be adjusted accordingly. Payments of the adjusted Floating Amount will take 
place 5 business days following notification by either party of a change to a 
published price.""

Attached is the deal that Janelle did with the knockout.  The comments she 
added is in red under special provisions.  Please let me know if the change 
is o.k.  She wants to send it out as soon as possible.  I am also working on

Sara,

After looking at the list, we are on top of most of it:

aquila risk - we should be assigning all the trades to the new Utilicorp ISDA 
and terminating Aquila Risk master
jaron - we have a new ISDA; Jeff probably just isn't reflecting it yet
el paso - Brant is currently negotiating the new ISDA

The following are in negotiation and are Top 10s:
- idacorp
- wps
-pancanadian
-duke energy mktg ltd (i think this one is all but signed)
- mieco
-dynegy canada

I know you have had initial discussions with the counterparties and have 
discussed the need to put new documentation in place with:
- morgan
- vitol

Lastly, we were waiting on Reliant to give us an updated draft ISDA; however, 
now that Randy Baker has left Reliant, they are not likely to address for 
awhile.  Tracy can ask Kelly about trying to get something in place.

The others can probably wait until we get some of the above executed. Dynegy 
and Sempra are probably the most important of those left.  Dynegy should not 
be too difficult; however, Sempra is a master financial/physical and will be 
more problematic.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tanya

Add the first one to the ISDA status list.

For the S. Africa entity ENA legal needs to be informed of this as they 
usually deal with S. Africa. Suggest you contact Carol St. Clair as to 
whether she is happy for us to run with this if we are just going to be doing 
deals from Europe.

Paul

We would like to begin to establish ISDA agreements with the following 
entities:

Anglo American plc (www.angloamerican.co.uk) based in London and

Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited.

The annual financial statement  of Anglo American plc can be taken from the 
website above. I have asked the folks at Anglo American in Johannesburg, 
South Africa for the financials for the Anglo American Corporation.

Can you take a look at this for me please?

Thanks

Martin

How are we coming with the ISDA agreement for MP with parental guarantee from 
Heritage?

Also, does MP need to invoice ENA for May SWAP transactions or do you issue a 
credit invoice and wire
transfer payment to MP? (Deal #s NA 1279.1 and 1279.2).

Team,

We have an incoming guaranty from Formosa Plastics Corporation, USA, covering 
its subsidiary, Neumin Production Company, for $15MM.  We would like to amend 
this amount to an unlimited amount.  Unfortunately, miscommunication between 
Fred's group and mine has led to a situation where the counterparty is 
expecting this tomorrow.  Is it possible to get this drafted today, 
signed-off by one of our attorneys and sent to the CP?  If not, I will need 
to get with Fred (which I would rather avoid) and then probably the CP.  

Sorry for the rush, and if it can't be done today, I understand.  Either way, 
please coordinate with me on whether or not it is going out.

Thanks again,

John "

Hi Shari,

I'm sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you.  I had to get a few
people involved and it took a lot longer than I anticipated.  However, I
have things organized now and have summarized my comments below.  In
addition, we reviewed your form of guarantee.  I have attached a mark up of
your guarantee to conform with our form of guarantee and where possible
amended our form of guarantee to conform with yours.  (I believe there were
some conversations between my trader and your credit officer about
increasing the amount under your guarantee to $35,000,000.)

I think it would be helpful if we used my comments below and the blackline
of the guarantees as an agenda for a call to finalize the Agreement.  Please
let me know when you would be available.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Suanne

Part 1(b) Threshold Amount:  I know we agreed in concept to have the
Threshold Amount apply collectively to each party and their Credit Support
Provider, but I'm not sure we get there with your amendment.  May I suggest
the following:

  Threshold Amount means, with respect to Party A and its
Credit Support Provider, collectively, U.S. $100,000,000; and with respect
to Party B and its Credit Support Provider, collectively, U.S. $100,000,000.

Part 1(g) Credit Event Upon Merger:  Thank you for adding the last sentence,
however, may I suggest clarifying it further as follows:

  If such additional Eligible Credit Support is not provided,
or if additional Eligible Credit Support is deemed inadequate by Y in its
sole discretion, then the provisions of Section 5(b)(iv) shall apply without
amendment.

Part 2(b) Payee Representations:  I am still waiting for a response from my
tax department.

Part 3(a) Agreement to Deliver Documents:  (a) The W-8 ECI is not in effect
until next year, so we will only be able to deliver a W-8.  In addition, we
believe the delivery requirements are a little onerous and we would prefer
to deliver the forms upon execution and thereafter upon request.  ECT's
delivery requirements should be substantially similar.  (c) We will provide
you with a copy of DLJIC's Memorandum of Association.  We would also like to
receive similar documentation from ECT evidencing its authority to execute
the Agreement.

Part 4(c) Calculation Agent.  Below please find sample language:

  Calculation Agent.  The Calculation Agent will be Party A
and Party B jointly or, in the event of a dispute, a reputable, unaffiliated
financial institution appointed by the parties.  Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default or Termination Event with respect to a party, the Non-defaulting
Party or the non-Affected Party, as the case may be, or, in the
circumstances where there are two Affected Parties, as agreed between the
parties, shall be the sole Calculation Agent.

Part 4(i) Jurisdiction.  We can agree to this clause provided that you agree
to conduct proceedings in New York City.

Part 5(g) Setoff.  We can agree to your setoff clause with the following
amendments:

  in line 2, insert ""sole"" prior to ""non-Affected Party""

  in line 3 and 5, please insert ""(whether at such time or in
the future or upon the occurrence of a contingency)"" following ""amounts
owed"" in each line

Part 5(r) Consent to Recording.  Please add the following clause as
requested:

  (c) Consent to Recording. The parties agree that each
may electronically record all telephone conversations between them and that
any such recordings may be submitted in evidence to any court or in any
proceeding for the purpose of establishing any matters pertinent to any
Transaction, provided, however, that notwithstanding the terms of this
clause, the parties do not waive any rights they may have under the
applicable rules of evidence.

CSA (b)(ii) Eligible Collateral.  I believe we discussed adding Treasuries
with maturities greater than one year.  We propose Treasuries under one year
with a Valuation Percentage of 99%, 1-5 years at 97% and 5-10 years at 95%.

CSA (b)(iv)(B) Thresholds.  Please remove ""Potential Event of Default""

CSA (d) Conditions Precedent.  We asked that Tax Event and Tax Event Upon
Merger be excluded as Specified Conditions.  There is no reason to stop
collateralizing a Transaction upon the occurrence of these events, because
if at the end of the remedy period the Transaction is terminated, then the
posted collateral will be returned, if applicable, according to the normal
procedures of the CSA.  If the Transaction is terminated and the settlement
amount is not paid, then the non-Affected Party has the right to liquidate
the Collateral to satisfy its claim and you would want all Transactions,
including the affected transaction, to be fully collateralized at that time.

CSA (f) Dispute Resolution.  (i) We can agree to two Local Business Days to
resolve a dispute.  (ii) We suggested that the parties look to market
standard screens before polling dealers to determine Value.  This is our
standard definition of Value:

  Value. For the purpose of Paragraph 5(i)(C) and 5(ii), the
Value of Posted Collateral other than Cash will be equal to the sum of (i)
the face value of the Posted Collateral multiplied by the product of (A)
either (x) the closing bid price as quoted by Bloomberg Financial Markets or
Dow Jones Telerate Services as of Resolution Time or (y) the sum of the
arithmetic mean of the closing bid prices quoted by three mutually-agreed
upon Reference Market-Makers for the relevant security on the relevant date
and (B) the applicable Valuation Percentage plus (ii) the accrued interest
on such security (except to the extent Transferred to a party pursuant to
any applicable provisions of this Agreement or included in the applicable
price referred to in (i) of this clause) as of such date.

(iii) We can agree to transfer only the undisputed amount.

CSA (g) Holding and Using Posted Collateral.  I have several thoughts on
this section.  The Credit Rating for a party should include both S&P and
Moody's and a party's ability to hold Posted Collateral should be based on
the lower of those two.  However, if the Posted Collateral is a letter of
credit, then a party should be entitled to hold the letter of credit
regardless of their Credit Rating.  Under the terms of (g)(i), the party and
it's Custodian are individually entitled to hold Posted Collateral.
However, there are no requirements for a Custodian.  I believe the
requirement of a Qualified Institution should apply to the Custodian.  If
there is a ratings requirement for the party in order for it to hold Posted
Collateral and the party is no longer in compliance with that ratings
requirement, then in order to comply with the general terms of the CSA, the
party would have to transfer the Posted Collateral to a Custodian which met
the requirements of a Custodian or else it would be in breach of the
agreement (which would be an Event of Default if not remedied within 30
days).  Therefore, if you apply the requirements of a Qualified Institution
to a Custodian under (g)(i), then (g)(ii)(2) and (3) can be removed.
Finally, we would like the requirements of the Custodian to be a rating of
at least A/A2 and having total assets of at least US $10,000,000,000.

CSA (h)(iii) Alternative to Interest Amount.  Subparagraph (A) should not
apply.  In the event that the downgraded party is the Secured Party (and
they were at the time of downgrade holding Posted Collateral) and Posted
Collateral is moved to a Custodian, there is no reason why the Pledgor, who
was not downgraded, should be penalized by not receiving interest payments
in the form of cash when they are paid on the Posted Collateral.  As a
matter of fact, it is my understanding that it is more difficult
operationally to reinvest such funds and much easier to pay them to the
Pledgor.

CSA (m) Other Provisions.  The definition of Federal Funds Effective Rate is
not necessary.  Please amend the definition of Letter of Credit to reflect
the requirements of the issuing bank to include a rating of A/A2 and having
total assets of at least US $10,000,000,000.  The definition of Material
Adverse Change should be amended to reflect the rating of both Moody's and
S&P.

Exhibit A Letter of Credit Provisions.  (b) Please delete the parenthetical
in line 3 to 4 and conform (i) to the amended definition of Letter of Credit
with respect to the requirements of the issuing bank.  (d)(ii) Y should be
entitled to draw under the LC in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph
8 of the CSA and not only upon the occurrence of an Event of Default.  The
first sentence of this section should be amended accordingly.  (e) Please
clarify the intent of this section.  It is rather confusing as written.

Schedule I.  The statement to be presented to the issuing bank should
conform to the circumstances under Paragraph 8 of the CSA under which the
Secured Party can demand payment and not just be limited to an Event of
Default.

Is there any way for Goldman to trade through a Bombay broker to sell the 
shares?  Is Enron Distribution Ventures MHC authorized to trade on the Bombay 
exchange?  This deal is going to be a challenge to sort through some of the 
issues.  We have one group in Enron that should be trading equities for the 
Enron companies and I am trying to determine how, given the issues listed 
below, we can accomplish this.  Is it an alternative  to set up a broker 
account in India and have one of the traders from the equity trading group  
listed as authorized to execute trades on behalf of EDV MHC.  I am not 
familiar with India law so the lawyers will need to verify that the entity is 
authorized to trade on the exchange.    What is the time frame on wanting to 
sell the shares?  Donna

Proceeds from sale of Genesys shares must be routed through a Mauritius bank 
account of Enron Distribution Ventures MHC.  This is important to maintaining 
EDV's Mauritius tax residency and therefore qualifying for exemption from 
India capital gains tax under the Indo/Mauritius Treaty.

Subject: Re: Genesys  


A brief background on the company is provided below to answer the questions 
raised:

Genesys International Corporation Limited is an Indian company. It was listed 
on Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) on Monday June 6, 2000 and is traded on the B2 
group on the  (BSE) under ticker code 6109.  We have purchased 190,000 shares 
at Rs. 225 per share (total of Rs. 42.75 million). (The site for the BSE is 
www.bseindia.com.)

1) The shares are owned by Enron Distribution Ventures MHC Limited (Mauritius 
Based). The physical share certificates are with Enron India in a vault in 
a     bank
2) There is no lock up restriction on the shares purchased by us and we are 
free to sell these shares.
3) I am not clear on the materal non-public information and who would need to 
give the certification. Could you clarify where the requirement for the 
certification arises, and send me a copy of the form of the certificate.
4) We would need a broker in India who is authorised to deal on the BSE to 
execute the transactions, A person acting on behalf of Enron Distribution 
Ventures  MHC Limited Mauritius would need to enter into the relevant 
agreements and authorisations
5) I do not think that Goldman Sachs would be able to sell these shares on 
our behalf on the BSE as we would need a broker here in India to execute the 
deal

Under Indian Regulations, the proceeds from the sale of shares on behalf of 
the foriegn company needs to be deposited in a rupee bank account and then 
can be onward remitted to Enron Distribution Ventures MHC Limited account. 
The bank has the responsibility of carrying out the due diligence for 
adherence to the current Reserve Baank of India rules regarding sale of 
shares in the Indian Market by an overseas company.

I hope that I have provided the relevant information required. In addition, I 
have enclosed a copy of the DASH for your reference.

Donna : Would request you to advise us on how to proceed further on this one.

Subject: Re: Genesys  

I have several questions:

1.  Where are the private shares held and in what name?
2. Is there a lock up agreement on our ability to sell our shares after the 
IPO?
3. Does anybody have material non-public info on the company and if not, I 
will need a certification from such people to that effect.
4.  Who is going to be responsible for executing broker agreements & 
preparing corporate resolutions, trading authorizations etc.
5.  Morgan Stanley will not be able to clear the trade, however, Goldman 
Sachs will be able.  We need account information necessary to set it up such 
as name, TIN etc.  John Greene in Kinnemans shop will be actually placing the 
trades and he needs to be listed with trading authorization.  

Before anything can be sold, we need to get the back office stuff set up 
properly. so whoever has appropriate info, please contact me asap.  Thanks

Subbu,
Thanks for the information.
This type of transaction has to go through our securities trading process.  
The first stop is Donna Lowry.  She must be involved in any transaction of 
this type.  She is on e-mail or you can reach her by phone at 713 853 1939.  
She will then direct you to a trader in Jeff Kinneman's group.  Current 
policy is that all market trades must be done through Jeff Kinneman's group.
Generally, Morgan Stanley is used as the custodian.  Their ability to provide 
services for India needs to be sorted out quickly.  Work this out with Donna 
and the trading group.
This will have to move quickly to meet your timeframe.  Please contact Donna 
right away.
Mary

FYI - if you recall, a bank account was not opened for Enron Distribution 
Ventures in Mauritius.  The funds were sent directly by its owner.  Can the 
proceeds of the sale go this way too or do we now need a Mauritius account?  
Let's try to avoid it if we can - let me know.

Hi,

Lena has directed me to you for the documentation required for the 
belowmentioned account opening. We need this account for efffecting the sale 
of the Genesys shares in the secondary market under the existing GoI 
regulations.

A suggestion I have is that in case the Mauritius venture has an account with 
a bank which has an Indian arm, we can open the account with the same bank in 
India as this would save us some trouble while remitting the funds back to 
the Mauritius venture.

I need your urgent help on this one as the shares get listed on Monday and we 
may want to sell some by Tuesday/Wednesday

Thanks and Regards

Subject: ADR

Rahul,
Thanks for the message about the potential purchase of ADR's.  Has this deal 
gotten an approved DASH? Not yet, we will be taking it for approval in a day. 
What is the name of the entity we are buying? Mike/Lauren to advise us.

On the bank account side, just let me know what Mike decides on the tax side 
and we will work to get the appropriate accounts set up.  Is there any chance 
to use the GAIL entity?  It already has a Morgan Stanley account.Mike to tell 
us. I'd like to use that or the Mauritius entity if possible from a tax 
standpoint.

On the trading side, we have a directive that all market trades must be done 
through the securities trading process.  You need to contact Donna Lowry 
first.  She will then get you in contact with the right people on the trading 
side.  They will work with you on the details of how the trade needs to go.  
Be sure to keep Cathy Moehlman involved (she's on my team).  She will make 
sure the money gets where it needs to go.OK, we'll be in touch with Donna and 
Jeff Kinneman

 We use Morgan Stanley here to settle market trades.  As soon as we know 
about the specific entity, that account can get set up.

Talk to you soon.
Mary

I am sending this e-mail message to address several issues related to the
swap and to circulate a proposed confirmation for your consideration.

Before addressing the swap, however, I should note that it is not clear to
me that the project team has finally decided to proceed with a swap rather
than a guaranty.  If we are not, I would appreciate someone letting me know
so that we can stop this process.

Comments on the Draft Schedule:

 1.  Part 1(a) ""Specified Entity"":  A Specified Entity is an entity
other than the parties whose actions can cause an event of default or a
termination event.  The draft schedule does not contemplate a Specified
Entity.  I think we should consider whether EPE and/or SCG should be a
Specified Entity with respect to TBS.

 2.  Part 1(b) ""Threshold Amount"": proposes $1,000,000 for TBS, which
seems low given that Enron Corp. is backing it up.

 3.  Part 1(h) ""Additional Event of Default"":  If we use a swap
arrangement, there will be two: one for 72.5% between TBS and ECT, and one
for 27.5% between TBS and a Shell entity.  If that is the case, do we want
an additional event of default under which a sale by Shell of its interest
in TBS could result in termination?

 4.  Part 2  ""Representations"":  I think that we need someone in tax
to determine whether TBS can make the representations.

 5.  Part 4(d) & (e) ""Credit Support Provider"": Shell will be the
credit support provider under the other swap arrangement, not this one.

 6.  Part 4(g) ""Governing Law"", 4(h) ""Arbitration"": The schedule
proposes Texas law with AAA arbitration to be held in Texas.  It would seem
to me that we would want to use arbitration procedures that are similar to
those in the gas supply agreements, with ICC arbitration, held in Miami,
under New York, with joint arbitration if the same issue arises under one of
the gas supply arrangements (such as the proper calculation of price).

Comment on the Proposed Confirmation:

 I have reproduced the gas supply pricing provisions from the EPE Gas
Supply Agreement under the ""Fixed Amount Details"" but have not done so under
the ""Floating Amount Details"", which cross-references the provisions of the
SCG Gas Supply Agreement, because of the length of those provisions.

 Please let me know if you have any reactions to the above comments
or any comments on the attached confirmation.  I will contact Nasim to
discuss the process for pushing the swaps (or, alternatively, guaranties) to
completion.

Regards, Dean

I believe this to be true.  I spoke with the Utilicorp lawyer when I 
documented the ""Australian"" weather trade and discussed transfer of the

Stewart:  I'll have to review their master to be certain (and insure that 
there is no specific prohibition against weather transactions).  In general, 
there is nothing else required specifically, although we may have to add some 
language to the weather confirmations themselves.  Sara

Sara -
Does Merced need to do anything to enter into financial weather transactions 
(remember that they have a ISDA and have done numerous power swaps for the 
past year)?


Thanks

Dear Ms. Shackleton,

I refer to your fax dated 6th March, 2000.

The seller whether it is an Indian company or a foreign company is not
required to be registered with the BSE for the purpose of selling publicly
traded shares held by it of an Indian Company.  Only brokers and other
intermediaries such as merchant bankers etc. are required to be registered
with SEBI or BSE.

Please note that Vinay Dwarkadas is no longer working with us.

Regards,


S N Talwar

Subject: Re: Contacts

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EDIDE's accounts, EDIDE will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

hello Sara,

I think this should be a high priority once they take on an ISDA attorney.  
Per your recommendation, I contacted Randy Curry, President of Bridgeline and 
passed along your thoughts about Jason.  I gave him your phone number and he 
sounded enthusiastic about wanting to talk with him.  God knows they need an 
attorney.

Right now, I think we can take this off the priority list.

Subject: Swap Agreement



I am sending this e-mail message to address several issues related to the
swap and to circulate a proposed confirmation for your consideration.

Before addressing the swap, however, I should note that it is not clear to
me that the project team has finally decided to proceed with a swap rather
than a guaranty.  If we are not, I would appreciate someone letting me know
so that we can stop this process.

Comments on the Draft Schedule:

 1.  Part 1(a) ""Specified Entity"":  A Specified Entity is an entity
other than the parties whose actions can cause an event of default or a
termination event.  The draft schedule does not contemplate a Specified
Entity.  I think we should consider whether EPE and/or SCG should be a
Specified Entity with respect to TBS.

 2.  Part 1(b) ""Threshold Amount"": proposes $1,000,000 for TBS, which
seems low given that Enron Corp. is backing it up.

 3.  Part 1(h) ""Additional Event of Default"":  If we use a swap
arrangement, there will be two: one for 72.5% between TBS and ECT, and one
for 27.5% between TBS and a Shell entity.  If that is the case, do we want
an additional event of default under which a sale by Shell of its interest
in TBS could result in termination?

 4.  Part 2  ""Representations"":  I think that we need someone in tax
to determine whether TBS can make the representations.

 5.  Part 4(d) & (e) ""Credit Support Provider"": Shell will be the
credit support provider under the other swap arrangement, not this one.

 6.  Part 4(g) ""Governing Law"", 4(h) ""Arbitration"": The schedule
proposes Texas law with AAA arbitration to be held in Texas.  It would seem
to me that we would want to use arbitration procedures that are similar to
those in the gas supply agreements, with ICC arbitration, held in Miami,
under New York, with joint arbitration if the same issue arises under one of
the gas supply arrangements (such as the proper calculation of price).

Comment on the Proposed Confirmation:

 I have reproduced the gas supply pricing provisions from the EPE Gas
Supply Agreement under the ""Fixed Amount Details"" but have not done so under
the ""Floating Amount Details"", which cross-references the provisions of the
SCG Gas Supply Agreement, because of the length of those provisions.

 Please let me know if you have any reactions to the above comments
or any comments on the attached confirmation.  I will contact Nasim to
discuss the process for pushing the swaps (or, alternatively, guaranties) to
completion.

Regards, Dean

Attached please find my revisions to the power financial swap product.  
Please review and let me know if you have any questions or comments.  A 
number of the changes I made are necessary to ensure that the product 
components for the swap are compatible with the physical index product 
components, e.g, the description of the index.

I think that you are absolutely correct in the assessment of the quantity 
description, but this is the language that we use in all the Physical 
Products and I would prefer not to change it - for the same reason that we 
are making the Index and Loadshape language 'match' both Physical and 
Financial Products, I don't want to change something that's already being 
used extensively in the Physical Products. 

However, Mark Taylor and I do suggest that we clarify how the Notional 
Quantity is derived - which I think helps solve the issue; please see the 
attached mark-up.



Sara - please call me ASAP on this.

Dale

All trades were originally confirmed in the name of Dow Hydrocarbons and 
Resources Inc.  The Dow trader (Mike Blillings) subsequently contacted the 
desk and requested that all trades be booked in the name of ""The Dow Chemical 
Company"".  Mary Gosnell contacted Cathy Tudon in credit and Cathy approved 
the changes.  Let me know if you have any comment for the desk.  SS

Carol:  John sent the email to all paralegals after he and I spoke in the 
morning (6/2) since we didn't know who would handle.  I remember, now, I 
checked the log in book while Susan was at lunch and it wasn't there so when 
I asked her about it, she told me she was holding a prior confirm for Twister 
( apparently inactive until further notice) and she was now going to handle 
this one.   I reminded her that I was leaving early to fly to NO so that I'd 
have enough time to review. The rest is history.  Sara

Team,

I have had a few conversations over the past couple of days with Terry 
Brownrigg at Twister Gas Services, LLC and Todd Tharp with Sanguine, Ltd..  
We transacted with Twister last week and I had sent you a credit worksheet 
for the transaction.  Twister is a broker who transacts on behalf of small 
E&P companies, and in this case, the E&P agreed to post the L/C we quoted for 
the transaction.  After talking to Sara, it sounds like we are going to go 
ahead and send a confirmation to Twister for the deal and attach to the 
confirmation an assignment of the deal from Twister to Sanguine.  It is my 
understanding that both Terry and Todd will need to sign both the 
confirmation and the assignment, so I think we will need to carefully 
coordinate the steps through the Confirmation Desk (Sheetal Patel).

I have attached a worksheet for the transaction (Sanguine agreed to post 
$500K).  Please coordinate with Sara, Sheetal and me in getting this out.

The contact information at Sanguine is:
Todd Tharp
Manager of Gas Contracts
Sanguine, Ltd.
1861 East 71st Street South
Tulsa, Ok 74136

Thanks,

John

Sara and I met with Richard Sanders today to resolve some questions that we 
had concerning the arbitration and process agent language in our forms and 
here is what we concluded needed to be done:

1. If arbitration is chosen, there is no need to insert Waiver of Jury Trial 
language

2. Pending discussions that he will be having with Mark Haedicke and Jim 
Derrick, no chnages need to be made to our arbitration language.

3. Our Process Agent language will be revised such that under all 
circumstances it will say the following:

Party A appoints as its Process Agent , ____________, having an office in 
________________ on the date of this Agreement at __________________.  Party 
B appoints as its Process Agent, __________________, having an office in 
_______________ on the date of this Agreement at ______________.


Susan Bailey,
Could you please get from our corporate secretary's office the information 
that we need to fill in the blanks for ENA and ECC?

If you have any questions, please call me or Sara.

We have received a request from the above counterparty to alter the format of 
the confirmation process on physical and financial deals.  In lieu of signing 
each confirm that is sent to them, what they want to send back to us is a 
letter signed by them in which they describe the confirm and indicate whether 
or not they accept or disagree with the terms thereof and if they disagree 
with such terms, they will return the confirm.  Are you okay with this 
procedure?

Mark and Sara:
Tana came into my office last night and seemed to be very upset about how the 
other 2 legal assistants were treating her, especially Susan Bailey, and also 
about the fact taht Susan Bailey was going to be part of Samantha's training 
and that this was a surprise to her.  On the latter issue, I explained to her 
that given that the 2 Susan's were involved in the day to day routine, it 
made perfectly good sense for 1 of them to handle this part of Samantha's 
training especially since Tana was now out of the day to day stuff.  I am 
very concerned that Tana is going to interfere with Susan's training process 
given her attitude toward the whole thing which I really feel is ridiculous.  
The only possibly valid point that she might have is the fact that we didn't 
tell her that this was going to work this way, but even so, again it's Tana's 
way of not be able to let go and not being a team player.  I explained to her 
that both she and Tana had different roles to play with respect to Samantha's 
training and that they both were important and taht in my opinion, Susan was 
more than qualified to handle this part of Samantha's training.

On the first point, I told Tana that the only way that this group is gong to 
work better is through ""communicating"" to each other.  I firmly believe taht 
there are 2 sides to this and taht all 3 of them are guilty of treating the 
other 2 at time in a not so pleasant way.  Tana of course will not admit 
this.  I have no answers for this issue other than the fact that I am tired 
of hearing about why they can't get along.  I also told Tana taht it was my 
perception that Susan Bailey has been under alot of pressure given her 
increased workload and other things and taht that could explain her attitude 
which even I have noticed has been a little different lately.

I'm letting the both of you know about this because I don't want any of this 
to negatively impact Samantha to the extent that it can be avoided.

Alan,
I spoke with Jeff on Tuesday regarding the overseas vehicle and where we want 
to proceed.   Jeff suggested that we document the current understanding based 
upon all the work which has been done to date.  

We are awaiting Goldman, Sach's preferential margining treatment of Short 
proceeds against longs in our current structure which would lessen the 
benefits of moving overseas at this time. 

Let me know your thoughts.
Thanks., Sheila"

ECT does NOT have a master with The Dow Chemical Company.  Are these trades

Are they all propane?  We need to discuss.  SS

John:

Attached are the ISDA and CSA which reflect our earlier discussions.

As you will see, these documents contemplate L/Cs as collateral. We think
that the L/C provisions as written would work well for both of us, but are
open to your ideas on the form of the L/C and other mechanics in view of the
fact that you probably have more experience with this form of collateral for
ISDA trading relationships than we do.

Please take a look, forward to the appropriate person in the ENRON legal
group and give me a call to discuss.

Best Regards,


Kim Noble

Mark,

I was thinking that it might be helpful for us to take Series 7 exam here in 
the US like our counterparts are taking SFA exam in UK. I did some initial 
research and found that our ""compliance"" group has to open an account with 
NASD (National Association of Security Dealers) in order to take the exam.

I don't know whether we already have sunch an arrangement in US with NASD for 
our other groups. If we do, could you guide me to talk to the appropriate 
person. If we don't than please let me know and we will decide, whether it is 
worth pursuing further.

Thanks and regards
Moazzam

shares in the IPO?  If the Mauritiurs entity was authorized to obtain the 
shares through the IPO, doesn't it then make sense that we can sell the 
shares?
Please let me know your thoughts.

We bought the Genesys shares before the IPO.  It was a private placement.  I 
suspect that someone in India will have the initial offering if that will 
help you any.  Let me know if you want me to run it down.  

I wil have to get back with you on the symbol for Rediff.com.

The confirmation desk recently received a call from Mike Billings who I 
believe is your Dow trader.  Mike is trying to trade financially under the 
name ""The Dow Chemical Company"".   ECT SHOULD CONTINUE TO TRADE FINANCIALLY 
WITH ""DOW HYDROCARBONS AND RESOURCES INC"" (the party that ECT has a Master 
Agreement with).  ECT will NOT agree to change the counterparty on any future 
trades.  When you speak with Mike Billings, you may alert him to this.

Disregard my prior question... Donna Lowry responded below that the 
investor/seller of the shares does not have to be registered with the BSE.
Thanks Sheila

I still would like the ticker of rediff.com if you have it or a copy of the

Dear Ms. Shackleton,

I refer to your fax dated 6th March, 2000.

The seller whether it is an Indian company or a foreign company is not
required to be registered with the BSE for the purpose of selling publicly
traded shares held by it of an Indian Company.  Only brokers and other
intermediaries such as merchant bankers etc. are required to be registered
with SEBI or BSE.

Please note that Vinay Dwarkadas is no longer working with us.

Regards,


S N Talwar

Hi Sara,

Gareth and I were going over the documents this morning and was wondering if
you have any comments on the revised Swaps (the three currency swaps and the
two option swaps).  Could you fax me your comments?

Could you also forward to me the Master Agreement btw UBS and Enron and
Enron's std language with respect to set offs, jurisdiction etc.. (as per
your e-mail two weeks ago).  Thanks.

Hello everyone.

I know you will get tired of these emails, but There are several deals that 
are way overdue.  

There are two tabs - Legal and Credit.  

Legal:  If you need a worksheet, please let Credit know.  I have highlighted 
several deal dates in red that are dated back to May 23, 2000.

Credit:  If these deals are not ready to go out, if you can just drop me an 
informal email about the reason (s) for the delay.

Thanks,

Sheetal :)

""A man with a new idea is a crank until he succeeds.""
-Mark Twain

Innovation, itself, is nothing new.  The word comes to us from the Latin 
innovatus, which is a good indication of how long the concept has been 
around.  People have been searching for the ""next big thing"" for thousands of 
years.

We have quite a tradition of innovation here at Enron.  Although consistent 
innovation may sound like an oxymoron, we pride ourselves on consistently 
outpacing our peers with innovative ideas.

How do you think Enron can maintain its edge into the new century?  What will 
be our ""next big thing?""  Put your best foot forward, visit eMeet and share 
your ideas in ""Creativity and Innovation"" that will keep Enron at the top.

Hi Sara,

Gareth and I were going over the documents this morning and was wondering if
you have any comments on the revised Swaps (the three currency swaps and the
two option swaps).  Could you fax me your comments?

Could you also forward to me the Master Agreement btw UBS and Enron and
Enron's std language with respect to set offs, jurisdiction etc.. (as per
your e-mail two weeks ago).  Thanks.

Sara:

Last week I had sent you a final version of the memorandum regarding pulp and
paper transactions (with attachment).  However, this morning I had an
computer-generated error message regarding that transmission.  I am sending 
you
the files again just in case you didn't receive them or couldn't open them.

If you would like a hard copy, please e-mail me back and I will send you a 
set.
Thanks.

Per discussion with David, Theresa and myself this morning, we have agreed 
that the current most effective approach is for Trena/Jeff K. to do the 
executions for London Credit.com and for Equity/Debt Trading to do the 
settlements.

The trades will be executed in the name of London Credit.com.  We need to set 
up a Morgan Stanley account in the name of London Credit.com to facilitate 
settlements.  

We contacted Ketan Parekh, Morgan Stanley, VP, Prime Brokerage, to discuss 
the impact of housing the account in NY vs. Morgan Stanley London.  Ketan 
said that they have many clients that are settling activity from Europe in 
their NY prime brokerage accounts with no problems.  Since the NY and London 
would be different settlement streams and in light of the current anticipated 
activity, we are requesting we open an account in Morgan Stanley NY.  

Sara, David suggested that Paul Simons would be the contact for account 
opening information.

Please do not hesitate to call if questions.
Thanks. Sheila

clearance services agreement.  They are asking us to fill out the form and 
return to them.  We have reviewed our current listing of executing brokers 
and found that Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner and Smith has already been

I spoke with Eugenie Sibeud at Goldman Sachs who is a local market expert.  
She spoke with someone from Hong Kong.

Per Eugenie, We probably do not need an FII (which takes the 9 months to 
obtain) but we will probably need a FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) Form to 
sell the shares.  This form needs to be approved by RBI (Royal Bank of India) 
taking approximately 3 weeks and is good for a specified period of time (e.g. 
3 months). 

She said that we may be able to complete the sale by opening a cash account 
with Standard Charter Bank (GSs agent) or a special purpose account which 
would stay open only for a month.
Eugenie is going to get back to me and forward to me the specifics which I 
have tried to summarize above.
Thanks. Sheila.

Sara,

I have drafted the attached based on what we did for the GDR acquisition.  
Could you check the non-India trading names and titles to make sure they are 
current.  I checked with Samantha but she said she was having computer 
problems and wasn't familiar with the names.  And, obviously, we will not 
have this done by Monday morning.  Is there anything we can do to get the 
account opened on an expedited basis and then follow up with paperwork later?



Lena,

Once Sara checks the non-India names, may I have your permission to put your 
initials on these documents and get them signed?

Thanks,
Lauren

Rahul,
David did put in a bid  for 330,000 shares with a cap of $12 this afternoon.  
The order was placed with Graham Cook, Goldman Sachs' International Desk,  in 
Chicago.  Daivd also gave him the name and number of Vijay in Hong Kong.
We are working with Lauren and Sara to get an account set up to settle the 
trade for Enron India LLC.  
Please do not hesitate to call if questions.

Hi David & Sheila,

As you will see from the DASH that Rajesh Agarwal is separately faxing to 
you, Rediff.com India Limited is issuing American Depository Shares (ADSs)

As discussed, we would like to bid for $ 4 mn equivalent at the clearing 
price, subject to a maximum price of $12 per ADS. This works out to approx.

Subject: Genesys : Sale of Shares : RBI approvall

Dear Rahul,

Your mail on the above subject refers.

As regards to the approvals to be followed in sale of the Genesys shares by 
Enron Distribution Ventures MHC Ltd., Mauritius, i list below the following:

(A) Approvals required:
Per section 10 B (1) the FEMA Regulations effective 1 June 2000, transfer by 
way of sale by a person resident outside India of the shares / debentures 
held by him to person resident in India will require prior permission of RBI. 
Veena, your activity chart shows that Form TS 1 is to be filed after the sale 
is effected, money received and at the time of remittance of sale proceeds. 
Since, the Act prescribes prior approval, we should sell only after receipt 
of RBI approval and not before.
The requisite form to be filed for seeking approval is Form TS1. 
If we are effecting the sale through a private arrangement , the application 
should be supported with the average quotation of the share price ( average 
of daily high and low) for one week proceeding the date of application, duly 
certified by a Chartered Accountant. If the sale proposed to be effected on 
the floor of the exchange to the general public at the prevailing market 
price, the Chartered Accountant's certification is not required. Since, we 
intend selling at the floor, this certification is not required.

(B) Thinly Traded:
I refer to Veena's query on whether Genesys shares are thinly traded. Per 
section 10 - Explanation i) the share will be treated as thinly traded if the 
annualised trading turnover in that share, on a main stock exchanges in 
India, during the six  calendar months preceding the month in which the 
application is made, is less than 2%( by number of shares) of the listed 
stock.
Though we can take a view that Genesys shares are listed for trading only 
from 5 June 2000, it is to be noted that the new shares issued to (a) the 
erstwhile Genesys shareholders are issued as a result of the scheme of 
amalgamation approved by the High Court, Mumbai & (b)  the applicants of the 
private placement ( incl. Enron) and the new amalgamated company, Genesys 
International Corporation Limited, whose previous name was Aeke Trading and 
Investments Limited, was a listed Company at the Mumbai Stock Exchange. 
Hence, it is advisable to check whether the shares of AEKE were thinly traded 
or not. FYI, the Paid - Up Equity of AEKE prior to the Amalgamation was 
2,40,000 Equity Shares of Rs. 10/- each aggregating Rs. 24,00,000/-. We can 
apply the test as explained above on the AEKE shares prior to Genesys 
amalgamation just to satisfy ourselves that it was not thinly traded.
It is better to check this provision. 

(C) Formalities for remittance:
Per section 11of the FEMA Regulations, remittance of sale proceeds shall be 
made by a authorised dealer upon:
satisfying himself that the security was held by the seller on repatriation 
basis ( we need to submit the Foreign Collaboration Approval Letter No. 3/9 
SIA/NFC 99 NRI to the AD)
submission of the contract note of the Broker effecting the sale and 
submission of a No Objection Certificate/ tax clearance certificate.

(D) Income Tax - NoC / TCC:
I understand from Veena that there is a current thinking that through a 
Chartered Accountants Certificate stating the double taxation treaty, we need 
not obtain the NoC of the IT. In my view, since the regulation stipulates an 
NoC / TCC from the IT Department, i doubt whether it is doable without a BoC 
/ TCC of the IT. 
In the past, this was followed and with an Undertaking from the Company, 
supported with a Chartered Accountants Certificate,confirming there are no 
tax implications in the underlying transaction, one could remit the funds 
without a NoC/TCC from IT. But, given a very specific statement u/s 11 of the 
FEMA Regulations and the same being introduced only from 1 June and hasn't 
been time tested, i doubt whether the Authorised Dealer will accept our view 
and effect fund transfer with an Undertaking and CA Certification. 
In my view, NoC would be a pre requisite. 

(E) Bank Account:
Assuming that the NoC is required, there will be a timing difference between 
we receive the sale proceeds and remitting the money to Mauritius after 
obtaining the NoC from IT. It is certainly not advisable to hold the 
instrument without encashing it. Hence, opening of a Bank Account in India to 
encash the instrument  is warranted. I refer to Mike's mail on allowing the 
Broker to hold the funds in a trust account for EDVMHC. In my view, instead 
of the Broker holding the same, the AD himself can hold it on trust for 
EDVMHC. But this needs to checked and properly documented with the Bank ( 
Authorised Dealer) and as well at EDVMHC. From Due Diligence and Compliance 
point of view, i would suggest to take the route of opening of an rupee Bank 
Account than the trust route. 
Since it is not a demated shares, opening of an custodial account is not 
required. This needs to be checked with the authorised dealer.

(F) Application to RBI / TS 1:
I suggest that while making the RBI Application under TS 1, it is advisable 
to state and seek their concurrence or keep them informed as to point E 
above. We could mention in our application to RBI and seek approval as to (a) 
opening of an rupee account or (b) authorising the AD to hold the same in an 
trust account for EDVMHC. RBI while according its approval, will look in to 
the transaction and accord approval for this as well. 
May be, before filing the application with RBI, we could meet with the 
concerned official in Exchange Control Department and walk him through with 
the transaction so that the approval is obtained at the earliest.

(G) Original Funds:
I understand that while making this investment, the funds have not come in 
from EDVMHC, Mauritius or it has come from a Company from Caymon Islands. Tax 
need to confirm whether the money received from Cayco ( though on behalf of 
an Mauritius Company) would qualify for tax benefits.  

(H) Confirmation by Genesys on non Lock-in:
There are no documents available like the Board Resolution while alloting the 
Shares to EDVMHC or the application to Stock Exchange which would specify 
distinctive numbers of the Lock-in Shares nor it is stated in the Information 
Memorandum as whether shares offered under this IM are freely tradable. 
Though the SEBI Guidelines are clear that if the shares do not form part of 
the Promoters Quoto, they are freely tradable, it is advised that we take a 
certificate from Genesys on this. I have spoken this with Rajesh who 
confirmed that such a certificate from Genesys can be otained without any 
difficulty.

Please feel free and do call me for any further assistance from my end.

Regards

Bhaskar

Subject: Genesys : Sale of Shares : RBI approval

Seems to me from a read of the regulations that we are required 

Clause 10 B (1) to get RBI approval for the transfer on a TS1 form. Please 
note that the TS1 form requires a CA certificate
If we sell on an exchange through a broker, clause 10 B (2) (a) (i) will 
apply. Since the transfer takes place when its recorded on the register held 
by the company, there is time from when the sale order is given to the 
broker. 
Clause 11 (2) provides the conditions by which the AD will repatriate the 
money to Mauritius. Please note the requirement for an IT clearance in clause 
11 (2) (c). Also, it seems from Clause 11 (2) (b) that if we sell through the 
exchange, then approval of RBI under the TS1 is not required for the 
repatriation.

Rahul

Serge,

Attached for your review, please find a blacklined copy of the FPL-Enron ISDA 
marked to show changes to the draft previously provided to us.  Please 
provide us with your comments to the Credit Support Annex at your earliest 
convenience.  I am in the process of obtaining approval to release our long 
form ISDA (it should not be a problem) and I will forward it to you shortly.  
please call me at 713-853-9720 with any comments or questions.

Jason: As you requested I am forwarding a copy of my March note to
Sara with the clean and marked copies of the FPL-Enron ISDA schedule
attached.  I have a small favor to ask too, if I may.  By coincidence
I am updating a form of long-form ISDA confirm for the same client
(i.e., the form used where an ISDA master agreement is not even in
draft yet and a large trade is made).  I have seen and prepared a good
number of these, but I've not seen Enron's.  Since your schedule was
one of the best drawn I've seen (and I've seen maybe 100), I'd
appreciate your sending me a reference copy of your long-form confirm,
if you wouldn't mind.  I'd be happy to reciprocate.  Regards, -Serge

Sara:  Enclosed are clean and marked copies of a revised schedule for
the proposed ISDA master agreement between Enron and FP&L.  I have
only reviewed and commented at this time on the master agreement's
schedule itself (I have left the credit support annex attached within
the same document, as you sent it, but have not yet reviewed or
commented on it, so ignore it for now).  I have reviewed many such
schedules and found your form to be quite good (as you may know, those
of some large market-makers are not so good, so please don't take this
as patronizing; it's a sincere compliment).  Hopefully you will find
the revisions equally acceptable.  I look forward to your comments or
approval.  Regards, -Serge

Hi David & Sheila,

As you will see from the DASH that Rajesh Agarwal is separately faxing to 
you, Rediff.com India Limited is issuing American Depository Shares (ADSs)

As discussed, we would like to bid for $ 4 mn equivalent at the clearing 
price, subject to a maximum price of $12 per ADS. This works out to approx. 
333,333 shares - however if the clearing price is lower, then we would get a 
higher number of shares.

We would appreciate it if you could put in a word to your contact at Goldman 
to let them know that the order is coming in.

Our contact in Goldman Sachs, Hong Kong is Vijay Karnani: +852 2978 1685 (W), 
+852 9188 3719 (M), vijay.karnani@gs.com

Our contact information is :

Hi Sara,

I met with accounting regarding these amounts. I will be forwarding a copy to 
you.

We have a total of .77 cents remaining in our account with Cargill.

Since we have several acounts in addition to Crude Oil, it is my 
recommendation that
we do not cancel the account as traders may want to utilize Cargill for other 
commodities.

Regards,
David

Hi Sara,

I met with accounting regarding these amounts. I will be forwarding a copy to 
you.

We have a total of .77 cents remaining in our account with Cargill.

Since we have several acounts in addition to Crude Oil, it is my 
recommendation that
we do not cancel the account as traders may want to utilize Cargill for other 
commodities.

Regards,
David

Cargill said that we do not have a line of credit nor do we have money 
sitting in an account with them.
The account is inactive at this time.

Let's review our next step when you have an opportunity.
Thanks
David

Sara,

I have drafted the attached based on what we did for the GDR acquisition.  
Could you check the non-India trading names and titles to make sure they are 
current.  I checked with Samantha but she said she was having computer 
problems and wasn't familiar with the names.  And, obviously, we will not 
have this done by Monday morning.  Is there anything we can do to get the 
account opened on an expedited basis and then follow up with paperwork later?



Lena,

Once Sara checks the non-India names, may I have your permission to put your 
initials on these documents and get them signed?

Thanks,
Lauren

Hi David & Sheila,

As you will see from the DASH that Rajesh Agarwal is separately faxing to 
you, Rediff.com India Limited is issuing American Depository Shares (ADSs)

As discussed, we would like to bid for $ 4 mn equivalent at the clearing 
price, subject to a maximum price of $12 per ADS. This works out to approx. 
333,333 shares - however if the clearing price is lower, then we would get a 
higher number of shares.

We would appreciate it if you could put in a word to your contact at Goldman 
to let them know that the order is coming in.

Our contact in Goldman Sachs, Hong Kong is Vijay Karnani: +852 2978 1685 (W), 
+852 9188 3719 (M), vijay.karnani@gs.com

Our contact information is :

Subject: Genesys : Sale of Shares : RBI approvall

Dear Rahul,

Your mail on the above subject refers.

As regards to the approvals to be followed in sale of the Genesys shares by 
Enron Distribution Ventures MHC Ltd., Mauritius, i list below the following:

(A) Approvals required:
Per section 10 B (1) the FEMA Regulations effective 1 June 2000, transfer by 
way of sale by a person resident outside India of the shares / debentures 
held by him to person resident in India will require prior permission of RBI. 
Veena, your activity chart shows that Form TS 1 is to be filed after the sale 
is effected, money received and at the time of remittance of sale proceeds. 
Since, the Act prescribes prior approval, we should sell only after receipt 
of RBI approval and not before.
The requisite form to be filed for seeking approval is Form TS1. 
If we are effecting the sale through a private arrangement , the application 
should be supported with the average quotation of the share price ( average 
of daily high and low) for one week proceeding the date of application, duly 
certified by a Chartered Accountant. If the sale proposed to be effected on 
the floor of the exchange to the general public at the prevailing market 
price, the Chartered Accountant's certification is not required. Since, we 
intend selling at the floor, this certification is not required.

(B) Thinly Traded:
I refer to Veena's query on whether Genesys shares are thinly traded. Per 
section 10 - Explanation i) the share will be treated as thinly traded if the 
annualised trading turnover in that share, on a main stock exchanges in 
India, during the six  calendar months preceding the month in which the 
application is made, is less than 2%( by number of shares) of the listed 
stock.
Though we can take a view that Genesys shares are listed for trading only 
from 5 June 2000, it is to be noted that the new shares issued to (a) the 
erstwhile Genesys shareholders are issued as a result of the scheme of 
amalgamation approved by the High Court, Mumbai & (b)  the applicants of the 
private placement ( incl. Enron) and the new amalgamated company, Genesys 
International Corporation Limited, whose previous name was Aeke Trading and 
Investments Limited, was a listed Company at the Mumbai Stock Exchange. 
Hence, it is advisable to check whether the shares of AEKE were thinly traded 
or not. FYI, the Paid - Up Equity of AEKE prior to the Amalgamation was 
2,40,000 Equity Shares of Rs. 10/- each aggregating Rs. 24,00,000/-. We can 
apply the test as explained above on the AEKE shares prior to Genesys 
amalgamation just to satisfy ourselves that it was not thinly traded.
It is better to check this provision. 

(C) Formalities for remittance:
Per section 11of the FEMA Regulations, remittance of sale proceeds shall be 
made by a authorised dealer upon:
satisfying himself that the security was held by the seller on repatriation 
basis ( we need to submit the Foreign Collaboration Approval Letter No. 3/9 
SIA/NFC 99 NRI to the AD)
submission of the contract note of the Broker effecting the sale and 
submission of a No Objection Certificate/ tax clearance certificate.

(D) Income Tax - NoC / TCC:
I understand from Veena that there is a current thinking that through a 
Chartered Accountants Certificate stating the double taxation treaty, we need 
not obtain the NoC of the IT. In my view, since the regulation stipulates an 
NoC / TCC from the IT Department, i doubt whether it is doable without a BoC 
/ TCC of the IT. 
In the past, this was followed and with an Undertaking from the Company, 
supported with a Chartered Accountants Certificate,confirming there are no 
tax implications in the underlying transaction, one could remit the funds 
without a NoC/TCC from IT. But, given a very specific statement u/s 11 of the 
FEMA Regulations and the same being introduced only from 1 June and hasn't 
been time tested, i doubt whether the Authorised Dealer will accept our view 
and effect fund transfer with an Undertaking and CA Certification. 
In my view, NoC would be a pre requisite. 

(E) Bank Account:
Assuming that the NoC is required, there will be a timing difference between 
we receive the sale proceeds and remitting the money to Mauritius after 
obtaining the NoC from IT. It is certainly not advisable to hold the 
instrument without encashing it. Hence, opening of a Bank Account in India to 
encash the instrument  is warranted. I refer to Mike's mail on allowing the 
Broker to hold the funds in a trust account for EDVMHC. In my view, instead 
of the Broker holding the same, the AD himself can hold it on trust for 
EDVMHC. But this needs to checked and properly documented with the Bank ( 
Authorised Dealer) and as well at EDVMHC. From Due Diligence and Compliance 
point of view, i would suggest to take the route of opening of an rupee Bank 
Account than the trust route. 
Since it is not a demated shares, opening of an custodial account is not 
required. This needs to be checked with the authorised dealer.

(F) Application to RBI / TS 1:
I suggest that while making the RBI Application under TS 1, it is advisable 
to state and seek their concurrence or keep them informed as to point E 
above. We could mention in our application to RBI and seek approval as to (a) 
opening of an rupee account or (b) authorising the AD to hold the same in an 
trust account for EDVMHC. RBI while according its approval, will look in to 
the transaction and accord approval for this as well. 
May be, before filing the application with RBI, we could meet with the 
concerned official in Exchange Control Department and walk him through with 
the transaction so that the approval is obtained at the earliest.

(G) Original Funds:
I understand that while making this investment, the funds have not come in 
from EDVMHC, Mauritius or it has come from a Company from Caymon Islands. Tax 
need to confirm whether the money received from Cayco ( though on behalf of 
an Mauritius Company) would qualify for tax benefits.  

(H) Confirmation by Genesys on non Lock-in:
There are no documents available like the Board Resolution while alloting the 
Shares to EDVMHC or the application to Stock Exchange which would specify 
distinctive numbers of the Lock-in Shares nor it is stated in the Information 
Memorandum as whether shares offered under this IM are freely tradable. 
Though the SEBI Guidelines are clear that if the shares do not form part of 
the Promoters Quoto, they are freely tradable, it is advised that we take a 
certificate from Genesys on this. I have spoken this with Rajesh who 
confirmed that such a certificate from Genesys can be otained without any 
difficulty.

Please feel free and do call me for any further assistance from my end.

Regards

Bhaskar

Subject: Genesys : Sale of Shares : RBI approval

Seems to me from a read of the regulations that we are required 

Clause 10 B (1) to get RBI approval for the transfer on a TS1 form. Please 
note that the TS1 form requires a CA certificate
If we sell on an exchange through a broker, clause 10 B (2) (a) (i) will 
apply. Since the transfer takes place when its recorded on the register held 
by the company, there is time from when the sale order is given to the 
broker. 
Clause 11 (2) provides the conditions by which the AD will repatriate the 
money to Mauritius. Please note the requirement for an IT clearance in clause 
11 (2) (c). Also, it seems from Clause 11 (2) (b) that if we sell through the 
exchange, then approval of RBI under the TS1 is not required for the 
repatriation.

Rahul

I spoke with Eugenie Sibeud at Goldman Sachs who is a local market expert.  
She spoke with someone from Hong Kong.

Per Eugenie, We probably do not need an FII (which takes the 9 months to 
obtain) but we will probably need a FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) Form to 
sell the shares.  This form needs to be approved by RBI (Royal Bank of India) 
taking approximately 3 weeks and is good for a specified period of time (e.g. 
3 months). 

She said that we may be able to complete the sale by opening a cash account 
with Standard Charter Bank (GSs agent) or a special purpose account which 
would stay open only for a month.
Eugenie is going to get back to me and forward to me the specifics which I 
have tried to summarize above.
Thanks. Sheila.

Jen:  This is a good question and I think that the PG&E lawyer may be 
confused here with instructions to her traders.  
The PG&E trader can call either an ECC or ENA trader BUT a transaction will 
ALWAYS be booked and confirmed in the name of ENA under the executed ENA ISDA 
Master Agreement with PG&E.  For internal purposes, the trade will either 
remain on an ENA book or backed to an ECC book.  I hope this answers your 
question.  Sara

Sara;
One last thing is remaining.
Does PG&E have to have an ISDA with ECT Canada in order to trade with them? 
Can't Canada trades be covered under our ISDA. PG&E told me that in order to 
trade with Canada, they would have to trade through us. Can't they just call

Susan,

I received your interoffice mail regarding an ISDA Master Agreement between 
ENA and Southern Ute Indian Tribe, and have the following comments:

1.  Is the Tribe's official name Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern 
Ute Reservation, Colorado?

 Response:   I don't know.  John Suttle of our Credit Department gave us the 
name as it appears on the draft agreement.  I'll have to check with the 
Counterparty.   

2.  What are the payment terms of the Agreement (i.e., how will payments by 
ENA and the Tribe be determined)?

 Response:   Please listen to  the voice mail message Sara Shackleton left 
for you.  If you have any other questions re: payments, please call Sara at 
3-5620.    

2.  I'd like to visit briefly with our outside counsel at Modrall, Sperling 
regarding the language that they proposed in Part 2(b)(ii) of the Schedule to 
the Master Agreement.  Can you provide me with a contact name and number?

 Response:   Contact is William Scott,  phone - (505) 848-1800, fax - (505) 
848-1889.

3.  I suggest that ""None"" in Part 3 of the Schedule to the Master Agreement 
be changed to ""IRS Form W-9.""

 Response:   OK

Please call me at ext. 35777 to discuss.

Best regards,

Jeff

Sara,

Previously we have agreed upon ""CURRENCY REFERENCE DEALERS"" as the first 
disruption fallback, and """"CURRENCY MUTUAL AGREEMENT"" as the 2nd disruption 
fallback.  It appears that EMTA has created a ""BRL Industry Survey Rate"" 
(BRL11).  Merrill feels that this definition is replacing the Currency 
Reference dealers definition--or at least setting out a clear methodology for 
determining the rate.  Also, Shari always preferred that we use the mutual 
agreement rather then calculation agent determination of settlement rate.  
The ISDA template defaults to Calculation Agent.  Do you prefer that we 
continue on asking people for mutual agreement, or are you o.k. with 
Calculation agent determination of settlement rate?  Trading has no 
preference on that matter.  

I am faxing you a current ML non-deliverable deal with this new language in 
it for your review.  Please let me know if the confirm is o.k. to sign, or if 
you have any issues we need to address.  

Thanks!

See the below attachments for the new definition and the history surrounding 
it.

Hi Laurel,

Please take a look at the following documents sent by EMTA.  Only difference
is that we have not included the ""unscheduled holiday"" provisions as there
has not been a clear cut consensus among counterparties whether to use
Preceding or Following.

Please contact me if you have any problems.

I will try to sort through my e-mails if I find additional information on
the BRL templates.

Thank you

Sara,

I have drafted the attached based on what we did for the GDR acquisition.  
Could you check the non-India trading names and titles to make sure they are 
current.  I checked with Samantha but she said she was having computer 
problems and wasn't familiar with the names.  And, obviously, we will not 
have this done by Monday morning.  Is there anything we can do to get the 
account opened on an expedited basis and then follow up with paperwork later?



Lena,

Once Sara checks the non-India names, may I have your permission to put your 
initials on these documents and get them signed?

Thanks,
Lauren

David:

Thank you for the email.  I left a message for you to call (let me know 
what's convenient and I'll make myself available) because we were trying to 
make the language generic enough to include all future products which might 
fall into this category.  We considered the following:

Alternative 1:  ""For purposes of any Transaction in a Commodity for which 
there is either no market or for which the market is illiquid, Party B 
recognizes that (i) this market is less liquid than other OTC derivatives 
markets; . . .""   

Alternative 2:  ""For purposes of any Transaction in which the relevant 
Commodity is traded in a market that is newer or less liquid than other OTC 
derivatives markets, Party B recognizes that (i) such market is newer or less 
liquid than other OTC derivatives markets; . . . ""

We also considered adding some type of statement that specifies newer 
products without limiting future applicability (i.e.. ""including but not 
limited to paper and pulp"").  Also, ""newer market"" may not mean illiquid.  
""No market"" could mean that we are the only market maker.

Your language places the onus on us to continually identify these illiquid 
products either in the Schedule, by amendment to the Schedule or in a 
separate writing.
Can we please discuss?  I am free all afternoon.  Thanks.  Sara"

Hi Sara,

We have a total of .77 cents remaining in our account with Cargill.

Since we have several acounts in addition to Crude Oil, it is my

we do not cancel the account as traders may want to utilize Cargill for other 
commodities.

Sara,
I will send the Guarantee w/i the hour. 99% of the time, I can get the
Guarantee executed in One Business Day or less following the execution of
the Master Agreement. Have you reviewed the Cnf Agr language?. I had one
knit on 5(a) ""Conditions Precedent"", - add ""or delivery"" after ""payment"" and
before ""obligations under Section 2(a)(1)"".
Do you have any comments on the term sheet or Confirmation?

Regards

between you, SusanHelton and Carol St. Clair, because the issues we are 
dicussing at this point in time, relate to both areas:  ISDAs for regular

connection with Enron Mexico Corp.  Please forgive me.  I know that Carol is 
trying to finalize communications with our outside counsel in Mexico.  It may 
be helpful for you to have a conversation with her about your goals, etc. for 
her to include in her discussions. 

I am still handling financial derivatives matters in general for Mexico.

This provision is an election which we have added to the Schedule for 
governmental entities.  I believe that it is intended to eliminate any 
confusion that historically arose during the debate between ""First Method"" 
(one-way payments) and ""Second Method"" (two-way payments) for Early 
Termination purposes.  Although I can't find a good reason to continue to use 
this provision with an ISDA (except that it emphasizes the point), I can 
understand why we may have added it to a pre-ISDA agreement with a 
governmental.  The only example that I could locate was our September 21, 
1995 Master Agreement with Reedy Creek Improvement District.  For those of 
you who have never seen this form, it was one of the two types of master 
agreements developed by ECT before we became conversant with ISDA.  Because 
these forms didn't contemplate municipal counterparties, we had to add many 
of the ISDA U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule provisions.  The Part 
5(b)(k) provision originally appeared in this early agreement.  It was 
included in the ""Event of Change"" section [5F(4)] (which is tantamount to the 
ISDA concept of ""Illegality"", a ""Termination Event"").  I think it was 
probably included because in the ISDA, Second Method is the automatic payment 
method if the parties fail to make a specific designation for Early 
Termination purposes, but there isn't a comparable provision in the old ECT 
form.

Mark, we are attempting to get a broad approval to trade any types of 
products in Australia through EnronOnline. (Currently our ability to trade 
products other electricity through EnronOnline using standardised 
documentation is not beyond doubt). What the Australian regulators are 
looking for is for us to point to a regulatory oversight in the US of Enron's 
trading activities. They hopefully then will back off. Particularly they want 
us to demonstrate  there are some prudential requirements Enron Corp. needs 
to meet in respect of trading activities. Pardon my complete ignorance but 
are there any? Would membership of NYMEX be relevant?

Confidential communication

David

I have just had another call from ASIC (Alan Worseley and Tim Hardman).

It seems that there is a single significant policy concern for the ASIC
policy committee.

This arises because ASIC believes that a significantly wider range of
sophisticated counterparties will be interested in the EnronOnline products
(such as weather and credit) than those that are interested in Australian
electricity derivatives.  As a result, ASIC is not able to simply
""transfer-across"" its approval of EAF under the electricity declaration
without separate consideration as to how EAF can meet the prudential
regulation criteria specified in PS 70.

They have asked for further information in this regard.  Obviously I
mentioned the presence of the Enron Corp guarantee. However, ASIC may
require something further, such as evidence of procedures in place to
prevent an Enron failure.  PS 70 states in this regard (in paragraphs 46 and
47):

 ""The ASC considers that providers of safe harbour market facilities
should be subject to regulation which at least sets minimum capital
standards and ensures regular reporting against them. This is because the
financial stability of a facility provider is a crucial factor in the
stability of any market conducted by that provider. This will ensure that
risks associated with the conduct of a safe harbour market are monitored.
Standard setting and monitoring will contribute to the continued financial
stability of the facility provider. If the facility provider is a
significant participant in other markets, it will also help prevent any
adverse consequences for those markets if the facility provider fails.

 Regulatory supervision of this kind may occur in a number of ways.
For the purposes of the ASC's policy, it is not the identity of a
 particular supervisory authority that is important, but the fact
that the organisation is subject to supervision which produces the results
mentioned in para 46. Regulatory supervision will meet this test only if the
capital standards which it imposes on an organisation take into account the
organisation's derivatives market activities.""

The following paragraphs are also explanatory, particularly as they refer to
certain US licensees.  Are any Enron entities subject to prudential or
similar regulation due to the licences/authorisations which they hold? This
could be a useful starting point.

They also mentioned that there may be difficulty in achieving the 23 June
timetable.  However, the focus of the discussion was the policy issue rather
than timing.

Best regards

My bad; I had made the changes we discussed with the last Product in PROD but 
not in TEST, so when I built the new Product in TEST I got old text. I have 
since corrected TEST (to make sure that this doesn't happen again) and 
double-checked that the text is correct in PROD. Thanks for your review. 

Sara - please review THIS Long Description and offer comments/approval.

I've gone back through the ISDA Credit Support Annex and the ""green book"" and 
my conclusion is that unless we modify the standard form, we have to give an 
Independent Amount back to the counterparty when we go out of the money far 
enough (note that the definition of Exposure results in a negative number 
when we are out of the money reducing the Credit Support Amount below the 
Independent Amount).  The theory there is that as the market moves against 
us, we are cushioned by our ""out-of-the-moneyness"" and will be able to ask 
for support as the market moves back in our favor before we are actually in 
the money.  I'm afraid that Credit has been operating under the assumption 
that we get to keep Independent Amounts until the Transaction terminates.  We 
need to set up a system with Credit so we all know what is meant on the 
credit work sheets -- i.e. whether a cushion or up-front amount should be 
given back to the counterparty as we go out of the money or not (maybe the 
paralegals can suggest something?).  I suggest we add the following language 
(taken from the green book) when we are using Paragraph 13 and Credit tells 
us they don't want to have to give the cushion amount back, no matter how far 
we go out of the money:

 ""Credit Support Amount"" will mean the higher of (i) the amount calculated as 
provided in the definition of that
  term in Paragraph 3(b) and (ii) the sum of the Pledgor's Independent 
Amounts.

I will modify the Force Energy document to include it and, unless you would 
like to suggest alternative language, ask Tana to add it to our list of 
alternatives for Paragraph 13."

between you, SusanHelton and Carol St. Clair, because the issues we are 
dicussing at this point in time, relate to both areas:  ISDAs for regular 
financial transactions and ETAs for EOL...Would tomorow morning work for both

Jaime:  When speaking with you earlier, I completely forgot to mention that 
Carol St. Clair (Ext. 33989) will be addressing EOL issues arising in 
connection with Enron Mexico Corp.  Please forgive me.  I know that Carol is 
trying to finalize communications with our outside counsel in Mexico.  It may 
be helpful for you to have a conversation with her about your goals, etc. for 
her to include in her discussions. 

I am still handling financial derivatives matters in general for Mexico.

Please let me hear from you and I look forward to meeting with you later this 
week.  Regards.  Sara

We are going to use 76-0486649 for the tax id for Enron Distribution 
Ventures.  This is the number of Atlantic Commercial Finance, Inc., the 
parent of Enron Distribution Ventures.  See tax department e-mail traffic 
below.  If the brokerage firm has a problem with this, I guess we will need 
to put our tax people in touch with their legal department.  We can't undo 
our tax treatment just to satisfy the brokerage firm.

Lauren,
The answer was pretty straight forward, a disregarded entity uses the 
Employer ID# of is single-member owner, in this case ACFI (Federal ID #:  
76-0486649).  Fortunately, Cullen is a walking/talking tax code ... he amazes

Enron India LLC (EILLC) is a 'disregarded' sub of Atlantic Commercial 
Finance, Inc. (ACFI).  Both are US entities.
EILLC has today opened a US brokerage account and was asked to furnish its 
EIN on form W-9, Request for Txpr ID#.  

Query:  Do any of you have prior experience with determining whether EILLC 
can simply supply the EIN of ACFI or whether EILLC must apply for its own 
EIN?  If yes, how was your issue resolved?

Annette Glod will check with the Service tomorrow and will be glad to report 
back to this group with the answer.

Dear Susan -

As per our phone conversation of last week, attached for your review please 
find
a revised draft (both clean and blacklined) of the Schedule to the ISDA Master
Agreement. The attached draft incorporates all of Morgan's comments and should
be self-explanatory. The motivation behind many of our comments was a 
conscious
effort to keep the credit terms nearly identical to those already agreed to 
with
other Enron entities.

Please review the attached and feel free to call, fax or e-mail me with any
questions or comments.

Sincerely yours,
Mike Stolfi
212-648-8231

     Attached for your review and comment is a draft of the Schedule and 
Credit
Support Annex to the referenced agreement.  It is our intention to replace the
existing Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated as of May 28, 1992 between
Enron Risk Management Services Corp. (now known as Enron North America Corp.)
and Morgan Guaranty  (the ""Existing Master Agreement"") with the ISDA Master
Agreement.   Under the exisiting Master Agreement, Enron Corp. executed a
$50,000,000  Guaranty in favor of  Morgan Guaranty. The draft ISDA Master
Agreement includes our updated form of Guaranty.  We can either amend the
exisiting form of Guaranty or amend and restate the exisiting Guaranty with 
our
updated form of Guaranty.

     Should you have any questions or comments, please  call either Sara
Shackleton (attorney) at (713) 853-5620 (email address:
sara.Shackleton@enron.com) or me (paralegal) at (713) 853-0975 (email address:
susan.flynn@enron.com).   We look forward to hearing from you.

shares, priced at $12. David said that Goldman Sachs said that we got one of

Hi David & Sheila,

As you will see from the DASH that Rajesh Agarwal is separately faxing to 
you, Rediff.com India Limited is issuing American Depository Shares (ADSs)

As discussed, we would like to bid for $ 4 mn equivalent at the clearing 
price, subject to a maximum price of $12 per ADS. This works out to approx. 
333,333 shares - however if the clearing price is lower, then we would get a 
higher number of shares.

We would appreciate it if you could put in a word to your contact at Goldman 
to let them know that the order is coming in.

Our contact in Goldman Sachs, Hong Kong is Vijay Karnani: +852 2978 1685 (W), 
+852 9188 3719 (M), vijay.karnani@gs.com

Hi Sara,

We have a total of .77 cents remaining in our account with Cargill.

Since we have several acounts in addition to Crude Oil, it is my 
recommendation that
we do not cancel the account as traders may want to utilize Cargill for other 
commodities.

Hello Dale,

I've added ""PJM Interconnect Peak"" load shape to the mapping table.

We need to find out which pub code to map for ""PJM Interconnection"" index 
(there are literally hundreds of pub codes available for PJM).

Hi Shari,

I'm sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you.  I had to get a few
people involved and it took a lot longer than I anticipated.  However, I
have things organized now and have summarized my comments below.  In
addition, we reviewed your form of guarantee.  I have attached a mark up of
your guarantee to conform with our form of guarantee and where possible
amended our form of guarantee to conform with yours.  (I believe there were
some conversations between my trader and your credit officer about
increasing the amount under your guarantee to $35,000,000.)

I think it would be helpful if we used my comments below and the blackline
of the guarantees as an agenda for a call to finalize the Agreement.  Please
let me know when you would be available.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Suanne

Part 1(b) Threshold Amount:  I know we agreed in concept to have the
Threshold Amount apply collectively to each party and their Credit Support
Provider, but I'm not sure we get there with your amendment.  May I suggest
the following:

  Threshold Amount means, with respect to Party A and its
Credit Support Provider, collectively, U.S. $100,000,000; and with respect
to Party B and its Credit Support Provider, collectively, U.S. $100,000,000.

Part 1(g) Credit Event Upon Merger:  Thank you for adding the last sentence,
however, may I suggest clarifying it further as follows:

  If such additional Eligible Credit Support is not provided,
or if additional Eligible Credit Support is deemed inadequate by Y in its
sole discretion, then the provisions of Section 5(b)(iv) shall apply without
amendment.

Part 2(b) Payee Representations:  I am still waiting for a response from my
tax department.

Part 3(a) Agreement to Deliver Documents:  (a) The W-8 ECI is not in effect
until next year, so we will only be able to deliver a W-8.  In addition, we
believe the delivery requirements are a little onerous and we would prefer
to deliver the forms upon execution and thereafter upon request.  ECT's
delivery requirements should be substantially similar.  (c) We will provide
you with a copy of DLJIC's Memorandum of Association.  We would also like to
receive similar documentation from ECT evidencing its authority to execute
the Agreement.

Part 4(c) Calculation Agent.  Below please find sample language:

  Calculation Agent.  The Calculation Agent will be Party A
and Party B jointly or, in the event of a dispute, a reputable, unaffiliated
financial institution appointed by the parties.  Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default or Termination Event with respect to a party, the Non-defaulting
Party or the non-Affected Party, as the case may be, or, in the
circumstances where there are two Affected Parties, as agreed between the
parties, shall be the sole Calculation Agent.

Part 4(i) Jurisdiction.  We can agree to this clause provided that you agree
to conduct proceedings in New York City.

Part 5(g) Setoff.  We can agree to your setoff clause with the following
amendments:

  in line 2, insert ""sole"" prior to ""non-Affected Party""

  in line 3 and 5, please insert ""(whether at such time or in
the future or upon the occurrence of a contingency)"" following ""amounts
owed"" in each line

Part 5(r) Consent to Recording.  Please add the following clause as
requested:

  (c) Consent to Recording. The parties agree that each
may electronically record all telephone conversations between them and that
any such recordings may be submitted in evidence to any court or in any
proceeding for the purpose of establishing any matters pertinent to any
Transaction, provided, however, that notwithstanding the terms of this
clause, the parties do not waive any rights they may have under the
applicable rules of evidence.

CSA (b)(ii) Eligible Collateral.  I believe we discussed adding Treasuries
with maturities greater than one year.  We propose Treasuries under one year
with a Valuation Percentage of 99%, 1-5 years at 97% and 5-10 years at 95%.

CSA (b)(iv)(B) Thresholds.  Please remove ""Potential Event of Default""

CSA (d) Conditions Precedent.  We asked that Tax Event and Tax Event Upon
Merger be excluded as Specified Conditions.  There is no reason to stop
collateralizing a Transaction upon the occurrence of these events, because
if at the end of the remedy period the Transaction is terminated, then the
posted collateral will be returned, if applicable, according to the normal
procedures of the CSA.  If the Transaction is terminated and the settlement
amount is not paid, then the non-Affected Party has the right to liquidate
the Collateral to satisfy its claim and you would want all Transactions,
including the affected transaction, to be fully collateralized at that time.

CSA (f) Dispute Resolution.  (i) We can agree to two Local Business Days to
resolve a dispute.  (ii) We suggested that the parties look to market
standard screens before polling dealers to determine Value.  This is our
standard definition of Value:

  Value. For the purpose of Paragraph 5(i)(C) and 5(ii), the
Value of Posted Collateral other than Cash will be equal to the sum of (i)
the face value of the Posted Collateral multiplied by the product of (A)
either (x) the closing bid price as quoted by Bloomberg Financial Markets or
Dow Jones Telerate Services as of Resolution Time or (y) the sum of the
arithmetic mean of the closing bid prices quoted by three mutually-agreed
upon Reference Market-Makers for the relevant security on the relevant date
and (B) the applicable Valuation Percentage plus (ii) the accrued interest
on such security (except to the extent Transferred to a party pursuant to
any applicable provisions of this Agreement or included in the applicable
price referred to in (i) of this clause) as of such date.

(iii) We can agree to transfer only the undisputed amount.

CSA (g) Holding and Using Posted Collateral.  I have several thoughts on
this section.  The Credit Rating for a party should include both S&P and
Moody's and a party's ability to hold Posted Collateral should be based on
the lower of those two.  However, if the Posted Collateral is a letter of
credit, then a party should be entitled to hold the letter of credit
regardless of their Credit Rating.  Under the terms of (g)(i), the party and
it's Custodian are individually entitled to hold Posted Collateral.
However, there are no requirements for a Custodian.  I believe the
requirement of a Qualified Institution should apply to the Custodian.  If
there is a ratings requirement for the party in order for it to hold Posted
Collateral and the party is no longer in compliance with that ratings
requirement, then in order to comply with the general terms of the CSA, the
party would have to transfer the Posted Collateral to a Custodian which met
the requirements of a Custodian or else it would be in breach of the
agreement (which would be an Event of Default if not remedied within 30
days).  Therefore, if you apply the requirements of a Qualified Institution
to a Custodian under (g)(i), then (g)(ii)(2) and (3) can be removed.
Finally, we would like the requirements of the Custodian to be a rating of
at least A/A2 and having total assets of at least US $10,000,000,000.

CSA (h)(iii) Alternative to Interest Amount.  Subparagraph (A) should not
apply.  In the event that the downgraded party is the Secured Party (and
they were at the time of downgrade holding Posted Collateral) and Posted
Collateral is moved to a Custodian, there is no reason why the Pledgor, who
was not downgraded, should be penalized by not receiving interest payments
in the form of cash when they are paid on the Posted Collateral.  As a
matter of fact, it is my understanding that it is more difficult
operationally to reinvest such funds and much easier to pay them to the
Pledgor.

CSA (m) Other Provisions.  The definition of Federal Funds Effective Rate is
not necessary.  Please amend the definition of Letter of Credit to reflect
the requirements of the issuing bank to include a rating of A/A2 and having
total assets of at least US $10,000,000,000.  The definition of Material
Adverse Change should be amended to reflect the rating of both Moody's and
S&P.

Exhibit A Letter of Credit Provisions.  (b) Please delete the parenthetical
in line 3 to 4 and conform (i) to the amended definition of Letter of Credit
with respect to the requirements of the issuing bank.  (d)(ii) Y should be
entitled to draw under the LC in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph
8 of the CSA and not only upon the occurrence of an Event of Default.  The
first sentence of this section should be amended accordingly.  (e) Please
clarify the intent of this section.  It is rather confusing as written.

Schedule I.  The statement to be presented to the issuing bank should
conform to the circumstances under Paragraph 8 of the CSA under which the
Secured Party can demand payment and not just be limited to an Event of
Default.

> broad
> form whereby it permits transactions of every type (both on and off market
> swaps - off market swaps being swaps involving a lending aspect) and thus
> the underlying document might have to be curtailed.
>
> 2. Documents to be Delivered: For the time being, I have made a reference
> in Part 3 to ""Corporate Documents"" to be given by DLJ. Please let me know
> what these will be.
>
> 3. Calculation Agent: I still need to get the language from you that makes
> the both parties the CA.
>
> 4. Set-Off: As you requested, I had a look at amending our clause to more
> closely reflect the ISDA Set-Off Clause but with the inclusion of the
> Non-Defaulting Party's Affiliates. Upon review - the clause in the
> document
> is very similar to the ISDA clause except for the 1st two sentences which
> bring in the Non-Defaulting Party's Affiliates (which we have agreed to
> have). The only other sentence in the clause that differs from the ISDA is
> the one which talks about conversion of the Early Termination Amounts. Our
> language goes ahead and makes it clear that all amounts need to to be
> converted to the Termination Currency.  I think that is helpful.
>
> Thus I would propose to leave the Set-Off clause unamended.
>
> 5. Securities Rep's: We have been able to incorporate these with just a
> very few minor changes.
>
> 6. Resolution Time (CSA): I have discussed this with my Credit Officer and
> he thinks we really do need to have at least 2 Business Days to resolve a
> dispute.
>
> 7. Transfer of Collateral (all or just undisputed amount): Unfortunately
> my
> Credit Officer was unable to agree to transferring the whole amount
> requested, if part of the amount is in dispute.
>
> 8.Holding & Using Posted Collateral: I have reviewed this and the language
> we have proposed goes a lot further than what is in the printed CSA. For
> instance there is objective criteria contained in our language which is
> helpful to the Pledgor since it sets out that a party must have a certain

Hi Sara, 

I have a question pertaining to Counterparty - Southern Company Energy 
Marketing, L.P.  We have been receiving Executed Financial Confirmation 
Letters with our ISDA Master Agreement Date June 1, 1994 striked through and 
SCEM writes in June 28, 1994 (execution date).  I have been researching with 
Rhonda Denton and we state June 1, 1994 as the effective date, the date that 
is on the Master Agreement.  SCEM wants June 28, 1994 date - when the Master 
Agreement was executed.  I have spoken to Jeff at SCEM and he said it was 
""industry standard"" to use the execution date.    Our confirm states ""This 
Confirmation supplements, forms part of, and is subject to, the ISDA Master 
Agreement dated as June 1, 1994, as amended....   Is EPMI's Date correct or 
are both dates valid.   Please let me know if you need any further 
information. 

Thank you

Attached is our form of confirm with attached Annex A (general terms and 
conditions).  Assume the confirm is governed by Texas law.  Most 
counterparties sign the confirm and fax it back to us WITHOUT the attached 
Annex A.  Is this sufficient under Texas law as having received the 
""executed"" confirmation?  Do we need to modify our language incorporating the 
Annex A?  Thanks.  Sara (713/853-5620)

Please begin using the new ISDA credit worksheet template attached for all 
credit sent to the financial trading legal team.  I have added sections for 
elegible swap participant and specified entity.  If you have any questions as 
to how these new areas (or any of the old areas) are to be filled in, I will 
be happy to walk you through it.

Thanks,
Tanya

Sara,

to clarify--all of our FX trades are being done with J. Aron and Company.  
(That is how they are being booked on the CP side)  

All interest rate swaps are with Goldman Sachs Capital Markets.

Repos/bonds are with Goldman Sachs & Co. 

Previously we had been sending out FX confirmations to Goldman Sachs & co., 
but we will now confirm all FX trades under the master with J. Aron.

Thanks.  

Of course, Stuart and Pushkar still write up all the tickets with Goldman 
SAchs.  But, I have asked Risk to be sure to book the trades to J Aron.  "

Jeff says Floating Price language is ok.  SS

Subject: Re: Merita  

From the contract specification documentation provided by the OM to us I 
would say that for the ""pulpex futures contract"", reference to the term
""Daily Settlement Price"" is the same as reference to ""daily closing price"" or 
""last traded price"" for the Pulpex Futures Contract after reading contract 
specification section 2.1.13 of their documentation.  The OM simply defines 
it as the last traded price on each business day.  However, ""Daily Settlment 
Price"" for the pulpex options contract per contract specification 2.2.6 
defines it as the mid price of the closing bid and offer price.  
Give me your fax number and I'll send the documentation to you for review.

That being said I think your floating price language is OK and we should move 
forward in order to close the books on this one.

Thanks for your help.

Please see my revisions to the PJM Index below.  

The Floating Price during a Determination Period shall be the average of the 
hourly prices listed in the Index (in final, not estimate, form) for 
electricity delivered during Peak hours on each Delivery Day during the 
applicable Determination Period.  The Floating Price for each Determination 
Period shall be calculated utilizing the hourly clearing prices published by 
PJM Interconnection, LLC on its official web site currently located at 
http://www.pjm.com/pub/account/lmp/index.html 
ftp://www.pjm.com/pub/account/lmp/index.html, or any successor thereto, under 
the headings ""PJM - Locational Marginal Pricing Files; Western Hub""  (the 
""Index"").

Please note that we need to change the Pwr Fin Swap description to revise the 
payment terms.  Sara and I have met and discussed this issue with the 
relevant folks in great detail and determined that the current language is 
not reflected in reality.  We also need to change the index definition for 
the ISO NE index to delete the reference to ""in final, not estimate, form"".  
Attached please find the revised long product descriptions for both ISO NE 
and the NYISO.  

Call me in the morning to discuss.  I have a meeting at 10, so try me before 
that time if you get a chance.

Leslie

Below is the response that we received from our Agent.  Please call me at
(2120 902-1930 with any questions that you may have.


This has reference to our telecon. Enclosed is the relevant RBI regulation
for the captioned company (ABC) to sell its stake in the local company. To
effect the sale, ABC would require an approval from Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) even though the stock is listed. The documentation required varies
depending on whether the stock is thinly traded or actively traded. RBI's
definition of thinly traded is included in the regulation.

The company is required to fill out Form TS1 (I  am enclosing the format)
and submit this to RBI. In addition, the RBI requires certain documents
which are detailed in the form itself.

Trust this helps. Any other information that you require, please do not
hesitate to get in touch.

We have just completed a nightmare negotiation involving a confirmation with

them to avoid future problems.  I understand that one is already in existence 
between this c/p and ECT.  I suggest that we could mirror this and send it to 
the cp as a starter.  If you think that this would be appropriate please 
could you send me a copy of the Duke/ECT Schedule, CSA and any guaranties.

Have a great weekend.

Thanks Leslie. I will assume that the Index and Poduct Type descriptions do 
not require any further Legal review.

Eric - Please see the attached changes. Since we are making changes to the 
Product Type description, I will need to put a ticker item on the website 
alerting our customers of the change. This will be done Monday morning so 
customers will see the new ticker item when they sign on. Also, ISO NY has 
been tested - so we can release that on Monday as well. I need one more piece 
of information for the PJM Index in order to be able to TEST that Index - and 
will make every effort to get that done today and have PJM ready to go as 
well.

Paul:  I think you are trying to avoid me!  Hope all is well and you are just 
overworked and overwhelmed.  I am now working with Moazzam Khoja in Houston 
who is part of the enroncredit.com group most of which (as I understand) is 
located in London.  In connection with that group's activities, I have some 
questions and all fingers point to you.

(1)  Do you have credit derivative research that may be applicable for credit 
derivative transactions (including your online ""bankruptcy swap"") in the US?  
I am sure that you've already explored the ""insurance"" issue and I don't want 
to duplicate reasearch, if possible.
(2)  What forms have you devised?  Are they online?   Should I just grab a 
password?
(3)  Are the enroncredit.com traders in the UK required by the SFA to take an 
SFA exam (I'm guessing it's a broker or securities exam)?  Is trading in 
credit derivatives regulated, or regulated differently than other types of 
derivatives?  I am trying to determine whether Moazzam needs to take the 
Series 7 here in the US; our traders taking that exam must be dealing in 
""securites"" for that exam to be necessary.
(4)  Where is enroncredit.com headed?

I would very much appreciate your [PROMPT] reply.  Sara"

Joe Hunter has asked me to draft a form of confirmation reply letter that we 
could send to our counterparties in lieu of signing their confirmations.  
This form of letter with the appropriate chnages could also be used by those 
counterparties that we confirm.  Please let me know if you have any comments 
on this form or any concerns about implementing this process.  Thanks.

Amy:

The timing of this issue is perfect!  I've been working with Sara Shackleto=
n=20
this week to hammer down a number of issues relating to financial power and=
=20
the related indices.  We have revised the index language for PJM, NE ISO an=
d=20
NYISO, and I will provide the revised language to you and Melissa in the ne=
xt=20
couple of days.  The revised language for the PJM index is set out below:

The average of the hourly prices as published by PJM Interconnection, LLC=
=20
(=01&PJM=018) on PJM=01,s official web site currently located at=20
ftp://www.pjm.com/pub/account/lmp/index.html, or any successor thereto, und=
er=20
the headings =01&PJM =01) Locational Marginal Pricing Files; Western Hub=01=
8 for=20
electricity delivered during On-Peak Hours during the applicable=20
Determination Period.=20

Let your contact at Edison Mission know that we are correcting all PJM inde=
x=20
language per the above  and make sure she doesn't have any objections.  Let=
=20
me know if she does object to the language. =20

On Monday or Tuesday, I'm going to get you and Melissa all of the final=20
indices, as well as some additional provisions to add to all index deals. =
=20
After I get you the new language, I would like to correct all confirmations=

for deals yet to flow to replace the old index language with the revised=20
language and to add the new riders.

Sara,

I think we must mention the following as the source of the index price for 
energy: ""Documento de Transacciones Economicas"" (DTE). This is an electronic 
document published by Cammesa, and is available to all participants of the 
Wholesale Electric Market in Argentina. It's a summary of all the economic 
transactions between the participants of the Wholesale Electric Market 
(Generators, Transmission Co, Distributors, Marketers and End Users).

This DTE is published around the 5th or 6th day of each month and reports all 
transactions for the previous month. It is accessed by calling into Cammesa's 
server and replicating the corresponding database.

The attached word file shows you different screens of this electronic 
document. The second zipped file is the DTE for June.

(See attached file: IndexView.doc)(See attached file: dte9906.zip)

Have a look at it and give me a call if you have any questions.

Regards, Julian
 - IndexView.doc - dte9906.zip

Here is a comparison of our form to Clement's.  We need to use our form as it 
ties more closely into the swap agreements that we use.  Legal will dela with 
Clement if this is a problem but I suspect that it won't be.  His form, I 
suspect, is more suited for credit agreements and the like.  I am alos 
attaching our form which we distributed today for both the Enron Guaranty and 
the Counterparty Guaranty.

Jaime,

In connection with our telephone conversation with Susan Helton last Friday, 
I wanted to follow up with you regarding the possibility of Enron North 
America Corp. (""ENA"") assigning some or all of its ISDA agreements entered 
into with Mexican counterparties to an Enron entity formed under the laws of 
Mexico (""Enron Mexico"").  Such a transfer would cause ENA to be subject to 
U.S. federal income tax (at a 35 percent rate) on the value of the contracts 
assigned.

As we discussed, one alternative may be for Enron Mexico to enter into new 
ISDA agreements with the Mexican counterparties, and to allow the ISDA 
agreements entered into by Mexican counterparties with ENA to lapse or, 
alternatively, to cancel such agreements.  While such an alternative may be 
preferable from a U.S. tax perspective, other business concerns must also be 
considered (such as credit issues).

Please contact me at ext. 35777 if you'd like to discuss further.

Best regards,

Jeff

Rod:  I'm thinking ahead with respect to Enron Corp./Hickerson matters.  A 
few current issues include:

(1)  Nogid/Freeland seem to be entering into more equity swaps.  I have asked 
that copes of all equity transactions be forwarded to my attention 
immediately.  The first order of business includes transacting with the 
following parties in the following order:
 1.  Credit Suisse First Boston (""CSFB"").  We have an ECT ISDA with Credit 
Suisse Financial Products which I believe is the predecessor to CSFB.  Can 
you verify?  Do we need to amend or create a new master?
 2.  Bear Stearns (I believe that it will be Bear Stearns International 
Limited because equities are done offshore)
 3.  Lehman Brothers Finance S.A.  (you already provided credit)

Please let me know about 1 and 2 above.

(2)  Credit derivatives and distressed loan transactions

On May 18, 2000, I provided you with a list of the types of transactions 
originating in Kinneman's group by ECT Investments.  Do these guys ever need 
to communicate with credit?  How do you monitor? 

Please let me know who I should be speaking with about these transactions."

In connection with our telephone conversation with Susan Helton last Friday, 
I wanted to follow up with you regarding the possibility of Enron North 
America Corp. (""ENA"") assigning some or all of its ISDA agreements entered 
into with Mexican counterparties to an Enron entity formed under the laws of 
Mexico (""Enron Mexico"").  Such a transfer would cause ENA to be subject to 
U.S. federal income tax (at a 35 percent rate) on the value of the contracts 
assigned.

As we discussed, one alternative may be for Enron Mexico to enter into new 
ISDA agreements with the Mexican counterparties, and to allow the ISDA 
agreements entered into by Mexican counterparties with ENA to lapse or, 
alternatively, to cancel such agreements.  While such an alternative may be 
preferable from a U.S. tax perspective, other business concerns must also be 
considered (such as credit issues).

Please contact me at ext. 35777 if you'd like to discuss further.

Best regards,

Jeff

Last week, Enron Corp. announced a 2-for-1 stock split of its common shares=
=20
for shareholders of record on July 23, 1999. This means that each sharehold=
er=20
will receive one additional share for every share owned.  The anticipation =
of=20
the impending stock split has resulted in a number of questions from=20
employees.  The answers to some of the most frequently asked questions=20
concerning the stock split and how it will affect your stock holdings are=
=20
listed below.

What is a stock split?

A stock split is an increase in the number of shares of Company stock witho=
ut=20
a change in shareholders=01, equity or in the aggregate market value at the=
 time=20
of the split.  For example, one share of stock with a value of $80 will be=
=20
converted to two shares of stock with a value of $40 per share.  The Compan=
y=01,
s total number of outstanding shares will double when the 2-for-1 split=20
becomes effective.

What is the effective date of the stock split?

The split will be effective August 13.  On August 16 (the first business da=
y=20
following the split), the opening market price of Enron Corp. common stock=
=20
will be roughly half of the August 13 closing price. =20

How will the stock split affect my stock holdings?

Stock Options

If you have stock options, you will continue to hold options with an=20
equivalent value after the split.  If you have 1,000 options at a grant pri=
ce=20
of $50.00, after the split you will hold 2,000 options at an adjusted grant=
=20
price of $25.00.  The vesting provisions and the option term will not chang=
e.

Savings Plan/ESOP/Phantom Stock/Restricted Stock

If you hold shares of Enron Corp. common stock or phantom stock through a=
=20
Company-sponsored plan (including holdings in the Employee Stock Ownership=
=20
Program (ESOP) and the Savings Plan), the shares in your accounts will=20
double.  For example, if you hold 100 shares in your ESOP account, you will=
=20
hold 200 following the effective date of the split.  And, if you hold share=
s=20
with a value of $2,500 in your Savings Plan account on August 13, the value=
=20
of your investment will remain essentially unchanged when the market opens =
on=20
August 16 (the first business day following the split).  The number of shar=
es=20
reported on your 3rd quarter Savings Plan statement will reflect the stock=
=20
split.
=20
Other Personal Holdings

If you own shares outright and hold the stock certificates, you will receiv=
e=20
new stock certificates.  Our transfer agent, First Chicago Trust Company,=
=20
will mail stock certificates to shareholders of record on or around August=
=20
13.  Your certificate will be mailed to the address on file with our transf=
er=20
agent, which is the address where you received your latest dividend check. =
=20
To correct your address, contact First Chicago Trust Company directly at=20
(800) 519-3111.  If your stock is held in a brokerage account, the shares=
=20
will be sent directly to your broker.  Note that if you sell your shares=20
between July 23 and August 12, the buyer of the stock is entitled to the=20
split shares.

How will the dividend rate apply to the post-split shares?

The current annual dividend rate is $1.00 per common share.  On a post-spli=
t=20
basis, the annual dividend rate will be $0.50 per common share.

If you have any questions concerning how the split will affect your Stock=
=20
Plan holdings, contact Corporate Compensation.  ESOP and Savings Plan=20
questions should be directed to Corporate Benefits, or your human resources=
=20
representative.

Sara:

    As promised, this email discusses the securities laws issues involved
with equity derivatives, I
then make a few observations about the relationship between the securities
and commodities laws, and I
then makes some comments on the confirmations you sent me (both securities
laws comments and other
comments.

The principal securities laws issues relate to the fact that the equity
derivative itself is a security and to the
issue of whether and to what extent a counterparty=01,s activities in
establishing or unwinding a hedge are
attributable to the issuer.  When Enron enters into a derivative and the
counterparty goes out into the
market to make a purchase, is that purchase attributable to Enron?  When it
unwinds its hedge by making
a sale, is the counterparty=01,s sale attributable to Enron and therefore
required to be registered?  Here are
the principal issues:

1)  Rule 10b-5.  When Enron enters into a derivative, it must be sure it
does
not have undisclosed
material inside information regarding its affairs.  It is my understanding
that the traders are
supposed to check with Rex Rogers on the issue of whether Enron possesses
such information.
Although it could discharge its obligations under Rule 10b-5 by disclosing
the information to the
counterparty, that would probably be unacceptable since the counterparty
would then be in
possession of material inside information and could not engage in a market
transaction to hedge.
Thus, each time it enters into an equity derivative in its own stock, Enron
must be confident that
the public has available to it all material information regarding Enron.

2)  Rule 10b-18.  This rule permits issuers and persons acting in concert
with issuers to repurchase
the issuer=01,s  shares under a =01&safe harbor=018 that says in effect tha=
t if
purchases are made pursuant
to the rule they won=01,t be deemed to be manipulative by reason of the tim=
ing
and amounts of the
bids or purchases.  It is typical for an issuer to require its counterparty
to make purchases
pursuant to the rule.  Sometimes this is a contractual undertaking in the
confirmation, and in
some cases the issuer will simply obtain an oral commitment from the
counterparty to engage in
its hedges pursuant to the rule.  Obviously, it is better to have it in
writing.

3)  Registration of Sales.  If Enron decides to net share settle and issues
shares to the counterparty,
those are obviously restricted securities that cannot be sold by the
counterparty in the absence of a
registration statement.  But what about the resales by the issuer when it
unwinds its hedge that it
has put on by buying shares in the open market?  Are those sales
attributable
to the issuer so
therefore required to be registered?  I have seen lots of counterparties,
based on advice of their
law firms, take different positions on this:

a)  Some counterparties say that they want registration rights covering
resales of shares
purchased in the open market to hedge a derivative with the issuer.  If the
economics of
the derivative are determined based on the net proceeds from the sales, it=
=01,s

a more
difficult case because the issuer itself is realizing benefits and
detriments
from the sales.
b)  Some counterparties say they want registration rights covering resales
of
shares
purchased in the open market to hedge a derivative with the issuer only if
there is a
strong correlation at the onset of the contract between the terms of the
derivative and the
hedge.  It it=01,s a total return swap, for example, there will be a 1:1
correspondence (i.e.
the economics will tell you that the counterparty will buy 100% of the
shares
covered by
the swap immediately upon entering into the swap); but if it=01,s something
like
a collar
with divergent strike prices and involves dynamic hedging where it=01,s not
clear whether
and to what extent the counterparty will make purchases or sales in the ope=
n

market,
then it=01,s not as easy to attribute the counterparty=01,s actions to the =
issuer.

 In those cases
these counterparties look at the correlation and if it=01,s not that great =
they

don=01,t ask for
registration rights.
c)  Some counterparties say they don=01,t want registration rights for resa=
les
of stock
purchased in the open market to hedge their position.

Credit Suisse First Boston falls in category c) with respect to the May 200=
0

confirmation you sent
me. Even though there is a strong correlation between the deal and the hedg=
e

( i.e. even though
in that case they will no doubt immediately purchase 100% of the shares
covered by the
transaction) they are only asking for registration rights with respect to
the
shares that are
delivered by Enron on net share settlement.

4)  Commodities Laws.  Under the commodities laws there are some risks in
doing equity swaps in
that one has to rely on the swaps policy statement rather than the swaps
exemption, but those
risks are probably minimal enough that Enron is willing to take them.  (The
swaps exemption
does not cover equity swaps.)  With respect to equity options, they are
outside the CFTC=01,s
jurisdiction altogether.  Forward contracts present the most difficult
issues
in that there is a lot of
case law and CFTC lore about the distinction between forwards and futures,
and a key distinction
is that forwards are physical delivery contracts that bind the parties to
make and take delivery.
State bucket shop laws outlaw contracts that purport to be contracts for
sale
of a security that are
to be settled based on market price quotations.  So I would counsel Enron
not
to enter into any
forward contract that has a cash settlement alternative.  Although one can
argue that net share
settlement has the same defects, I don=01,t feel as strongly about that bec=
ause

you could get to where
you want to get by physically delivering the  shares and issuing  new share=
s

in payment; the
theory is that you actually delivered shares and just netted them out; that
is not quite as bad as
flying in the face of the case law and CFTC lore on net cash settlement.

The Bear Stearns Confirmation and Cancellation.  I really don=01,t have any
comments on this; I think the
cancellation was effective to cancel the parties obligations.  The
confirmation did not present any
registration issues.  I guess I would say that if you do something precisel=
y

like this you might get them to
agree to make any hedge purchases pursuant to Rule 10b-18, but that=01,s it=
.

The Credit Suisse First Boston Confirmation.  This is an extremely well
written document.  For the
reasons discussed above, I would counsel against entering into this kind of
transaction with the cash
settlement feature, in light of the risk that it could be characterized as
an
illegal, unenforceable futures
contract.  A few other comments: They say automatic early termination
applies, but I think that is a really
bad idea.  Enron had an agreement with a counterparty that took bankruptcy
and Enron did not find out
about it until a few days later, after the market had moved; since Enron di=
d

not know of the termination it
did not unwind its hedge, yet the ISDA said that the amounts payable on
termination would depend on the
termination date pricing.  So Enron took a loss.  You ought to always have
within your control the right to
terminate.  This is especially true of U.S. parties, but I would think the
same would apply to foreign
parties unless there is something peculiar about the law of the jurisdictio=
n

you are dealing with.

Both Confirmations  Both confirmations have language that says that if the
parties have not entered into
an ISDA Master then the counterparties=01, standard form controls.  I think=
 it
is not a good idea to agree to
such language because you are agreeing to something you know nothing about.

Additional Comment.  I think that whenever a counterparty requests
registration rights Rex should be
involved.  I think the CSFB confirmation=01,s provisions relating to
registration are fine, and of course they
can=01,t force us to register because the choice of net share settling is
purely
our choice.  Nevertheless, I
think that Rex needs to be involved so you and Rex need to get this point
across to the business people that
they shouldn=01,t just sign a confirmation and then send it to you and ask =
if
it
is ok.

But my bottom line is the only change I would make would be eliminating the
net cash settlement feature
in the CSFB confirmation.

All -
Just a quick update on where we are with the Sterling PAT financing.  We got 
final word yesterday that Arthur Anderson would not give us the accounting 
treatment we needed for the transaction, so we are currently looking at a  
couple of modifications to the structure that may address their concerns.  
I'll keep you posted on our progress, but at this point, there is not much 
the team (aside from me and the accountants) needs to do.

Carol,

I've been working with Jaime Williams and our outside tax advisors to 
determine the Mexican tax consequences applicable to those products that 
Jaime has informed me will be offered to Mexican counterparties through 
EnronOnLine and, potentially, a separate ENA Mexican entity.  I should be 
able to provide the results by Friday or Monday.  Please contact me at ext. 
35777 if you'd like to discuss in the meantime.

Best regards,

Jeff

As I think you are aware, the Meixco and online group want to implement 
online trading for Mexican counterparties.  Are there any tax issues taht we 
should be aware of?  If we conduct online trades using ENA and telephone 
trades with an Enron Mexican entity, will the exercise of setoff rights 
create any tax issues?   My understanding is that the Enron counterparty will 
be ENA.

Attached are the two (2) sets of assignments with attached trade descriptions.

(1)  the first set (first two docs) is an assignment of trades between ENA 
and HS Resources, Inc.; after execution of the assignment, the trades will be 
between ENA and HS Energy Services, Inc.  subject to the ISDA which we are 
now negotiating [the second doc is an appendix consisting of 5 trades and I 
have asked the desk to confirm that these are the only outstanding trades]

(2)  the second set (last two docs) is an assignment of trades between J. 
Aron & Company and HS Energy Services, Inc; after execution of the 
assignment, the trades will be between J.Aron & Company and ENA subject to 
the 8/14/94 J.Aron/ENA ISDA [the fourth doc is an appendix of all existing 
trades between J.Aron/HS Energy Services, Inc.  I have no idea where this 
came from but I assume it is part of your agreement with HS.  Who is 
verifying the trades and are all trade terms acceptable?  Presently, the 
assignment is drafted such that a conflict between the Master and a confirm 
will be governed by the Master]

Please take a look at the attached confirmation. It is a lumber deal with two 
commodities on one confirmation. This was requested by the Counterparty.

Joe - attached is a first shot at getting a handle on all the differences 
between the proposed and existing margin lines.  I plan to do more analysis 
with respect to covenants and warranties but this hits the main points.  The 
analysis between rates will be very complex and may be something best left to 
the research Group.  We can go through why this is such a complex issue to 
model.  What I do plan to do is update historical info. so that based on the 
past we can make general statements such as over time Fed Funds + X bp <,>,= 
to LIBOR + X bp.

A quick synapses of difficult items:

Commissions vs. Margin lines - will trading desk use facility for many trades 
or less frequent trades for smaller amounts
Short on Financial gas vs. Long on physical gas - cash flow differentials and 
how we can model the cost of cash to fund the working capital (as you 
explained to me today)
What positions the trader take and how our equity position is at that exact 
time.  Will we trade in a similar fashion in the future?


From what I understand the trading desks do not have ready access to the 
above  information in a format which lends itself to modelling of reasonable 
complexity or do not wish to share it with us (understandable considering the 
sensitive nature of the business.)  The ideal situation would be for the 
desks to decide themselves whether a line makes sense for them based on the 
pricing provided.  As mentioned above, I believe that we should be able to 
explain why a certain base rate would be attractive but am not sure how to 
estimate the value of a line to the traders without detailed information.  
Perhaps the best division of labour would be for the desks to decide what 
loan would be most valuable based on the desk's trading patterns while we 
could focus on getting the line in place as quickly as possible.  If you 
disagree, please let me know and I will try to rethink how to model this 
appropriately.

Florencia, we are lacking only one thing to finalize this matter.  We will
need to modify the corporate resolutions that you prepared.  I have asked
Susan Flynn (713-853-0975) to work with you on making the appropriate
modifications to the corporate resolutions.  I left a message at your

modifications.

Susan, thanks for your help.  Robert, I am proceeding as we discussed.

We have decided NOT to proceed with the swap agreement.  Enron and Shell will
each write a guaranty in favor of TBS for their pro rata share of the negative
difference between the gas price received and gas price paid resulting from 
the
differential in the gas price escalators.  Any positive difference in TBS's
favor will run through the TBS accounts to the TBS distribution account and,
subject to the blocking test in the Accts and Disbursement Agmt, will then be
distributed to E & S.
Dean & John: Can you propose a draft guaranty for internal review?  Once we're
happy with it we can send it to Shell for their consideration/sign-off.  
Thanks.

Regards,
     John

Subject:  Swap Agreement




I am sending this e-mail message to address several issues related to the
swap and to circulate a proposed confirmation for your consideration.

Before addressing the swap, however, I should note that it is not clear to
me that the project team has finally decided to proceed with a swap rather
than a guaranty.  If we are not, I would appreciate someone letting me know
so that we can stop this process.

Comments on the Draft Schedule:

     1.  Part 1(a) ""Specified Entity"":  A Specified Entity is an entity
other than the parties whose actions can cause an event of default or a
termination event.  The draft schedule does not contemplate a Specified
Entity.  I think we should consider whether EPE and/or SCG should be a
Specified Entity with respect to TBS.

     2.  Part 1(b) ""Threshold Amount"": proposes $1,000,000 for TBS, which
seems low given that Enron Corp. is backing it up.

     3.  Part 1(h) ""Additional Event of Default"":  If we use a swap
arrangement, there will be two: one for 72.5% between TBS and ECT, and one
for 27.5% between TBS and a Shell entity.  If that is the case, do we want
an additional event of default under which a sale by Shell of its interest
in TBS could result in termination?

     4.  Part 2  ""Representations"":  I think that we need someone in tax
to determine whether TBS can make the representations.

     5.  Part 4(d) & (e) ""Credit Support Provider"": Shell will be the
credit support provider under the other swap arrangement, not this one.

     6.  Part 4(g) ""Governing Law"", 4(h) ""Arbitration"": The schedule
proposes Texas law with AAA arbitration to be held in Texas.  It would seem
to me that we would want to use arbitration procedures that are similar to
those in the gas supply agreements, with ICC arbitration, held in Miami,
under New York, with joint arbitration if the same issue arises under one of
the gas supply arrangements (such as the proper calculation of price).

Comment on the Proposed Confirmation:

     I have reproduced the gas supply pricing provisions from the EPE Gas
Supply Agreement under the ""Fixed Amount Details"" but have not done so under
the ""Floating Amount Details"", which cross-references the provisions of the
SCG Gas Supply Agreement, because of the length of those provisions.

     Please let me know if you have any reactions to the above comments
or any comments on the attached confirmation.  I will contact Nasim to
discuss the process for pushing the swaps (or, alternatively, guaranties) to
completion.

Regards, Dean

Tana,

 I have talked with everyone involved, Anthony Campos, Mark Thorne, etc., and 
everyone is in agreement that original guarantees should now come to credit.  
If you could please, just make sure that they come to my attention so that 
they can be briefed and entered into our Credit Agg System.  If you have any 
questions please give me a call.

Thanks

Just a followup note:

We are still unclear as to whether we should continue to send original 
incoming and outgoing guarantees to Global Contracts (which is what we have 
been doing for about 4 years, since the Corp. Secretary kicked us out of 
using their vault on 48 for originals because we had too many documents).  I 
think it would be  good practice if Legal and Credit sent the originals to 
the same place, so we will be able to find them when we want them.  So my 
question to y'all is, do you think we should send them to Global Contracts, 
to you, or directly the the 48th floor vault (if they let us!).

Sometimes it's the little things that make the biggest impact.

Maybe you've never stopped to think about it, but for many of us, Post-it 
notes may be one of our most frequently used communication tools at Enron.

Because of this, every employee received, or soon will receive, a packet of 
Post-it notes with a thought-provoking quote about communication.  These 
Post-it notes reinforce the importance of communication at Enron.  The 
individuals who are quoted on the notepads personify the true meaning of 
communication.

We hope that as you use these notepads in your daily work, you will think 
about the importance of communication to the continued success of Enron and 
work just a little harder at communicating more openly at Enron.

Please email Gina Taylor (gtaylor@enron.com) for Post-it note distribution 
inquiries.

FOREIGN NARCOTICS KINGPIN DESIGNATION ACT OF 1999

On June 1, 2000, the Treasury Department expanded its list of Specially 
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons under the Narcotics Trafficking 
Sanctions Regulations by adding a large number of Colombian entities and 
individuals designated as ""SDNTKs"" (Specially Designated Narcotics 
Traffickers under the Kingpin Act).  The Kingpin Act blocks all property and 
interests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction, owned or controlled by 
significant foreign narcotics traffickers as identified by President Clinton. 

The targets of this measure are major narcotics traffickers and trafficking 
organizations based in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, the Dominican 
Republic, Laos, Mexico, Pakistan, the People's Republic of China, Peru, 
Russia, and Thailand.

U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in any transaction or dealing in 
property or interests in property of SDNTKs and from engaging in any 
transaction that evades or avoids the prohibition of the Kingpin Act.  These 
prohibitions affect trade transactions as well as accounts, securities, and 
other assets.

Reflecting the concern of many in Congress that current civil penalties 
related to the export control and economic sanctions violations (normally, 
$10,000 to $11,000) do not sufficiently deter prohibited conduct, the Act 
authorizes civil penalties of up to $1,000,000.

You may obtain a copy of the following updates and Executive Order by 
clicking the link below.  General information on several countries such as 
Lybia, Iran, Iraq, Yugoslavia, Cuba, North Korea, Angola, etc., can also be 
accessed at: http://www.ustreas.gov/ofac:

OFAC's Updated Master List, dated June 19,  2000 (the list of blocked vessels 
begins on page 64)

OFAC's Changes to List of SDN dated January 1, 2000 incorporates the must 
recent changes as of June 1, 2000 reflecting SDNs, Blocked Persons, and 
SDNTKs.

prohibitions against transactions with Narcotics Traffickers.

Sara,

I had a call on this from Bob a few weeks ago.  I told him that generally it 
was ok, but that we would need to revise our file should he require a 
definitive position, plus we would need to ensure that advice which we 
ploughed through earlier last year was still current.  He told me not to do 
any more work on this at the time because it was not clear whether there was 
any chance of doing a deal with an Indian counterparty.

I am more than willing to send you ou all my notes, etc, however, which 
crunched through the 1/14/97 opinion with Crawford's and asked supplemental 
questions.

Kind regards

Mark

fyi.  also, I just spoke with Sarah Wesner (ext. 35261) who will coordinate 
with you.  You can review the note with her and let's talk about their 
guaranty (will our guaranty format work?).  Also, I'm almost inclined to go 
with their commitment letter (if revised) in lieu of a lengthier agreement.

Joe - attached is a first shot at getting a handle on all the differences 
between the proposed and existing margin lines.  I plan to do more analysis 
with respect to covenants and warranties but this hits the main points.  The 
analysis between rates will be very complex and may be something best left to 
the research Group.  We can go through why this is such a complex issue to 
model.  What I do plan to do is update historical info. so that based on the 
past we can make general statements such as over time Fed Funds + X bp <,>,= 
to LIBOR + X bp.

A quick synapses of difficult items:

Commissions vs. Margin lines - will trading desk use facility for many trades 
or less frequent trades for smaller amounts
Short on Financial gas vs. Long on physical gas - cash flow differentials and 
how we can model the cost of cash to fund the working capital (as you 
explained to me today)
What positions the trader take and how our equity position is at that exact 
time.  Will we trade in a similar fashion in the future?


From what I understand the trading desks do not have ready access to the 
above  information in a format which lends itself to modelling of reasonable 
complexity or do not wish to share it with us (understandable considering the 
sensitive nature of the business.)  The ideal situation would be for the 
desks to decide themselves whether a line makes sense for them based on the 
pricing provided.  As mentioned above, I believe that we should be able to 
explain why a certain base rate would be attractive but am not sure how to 
estimate the value of a line to the traders without detailed information.  
Perhaps the best division of labour would be for the desks to decide what 
loan would be most valuable based on the desk's trading patterns while we 
could focus on getting the line in place as quickly as possible.  If you 
disagree, please let me know and I will try to rethink how to model this 
appropriately.  

Sarah

Hi Sara, I added some counterparties to your document.  All counterparties 
that we have done hourly financial trades with are in the above document.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,

Kevin Meredith is comparing the deals.  I've let him know to send the list to 
both of you when finished.  We'll also include the remaining HS Resources 
deals not on their spreadsheet.

Attached is our revision to the draft ISDA schedules for the HSES/Enron ISDA 
with changes marked.  My approach was simply to make changes consistent with 
the HS Resources ISDA other than items specific to their different credit 
status.  Please call me with any comments or questions.

This is a heads up about a NEP deal that may be coming to EPMI Friday 
afternoon (6/23).  John Llodra (mid-marketer, part of Ed Baughman's group) 
would like to be ready to send out our paper if we are selected as the 
winning bidder.  Our bid contained two alternatives (physical or financial), 
and NEP could pick either one.  We've prepared a physical contract and wanted 
to alert you that there may be a need for a financial one -- which I assume 
would be in the form of an ""Omnibus"" agreement (as far as I can tell, we do 
not have an ISDA in place w/ NEP).  John will let us know tomorrow either 
way, so we'll be in touch.  In the meantime, please let me or John know if 
you have any questions.  Thanks for your help.

Susan,

The below e-mail/Telex was sent to our Trading desk as MG's Confirmation for 
a Copper Transaction we have traded with them.  Per the desks instructions I 
have not sent our form of Confirmation for several reasons as follows:

1) Trader wrote on ticket that MG was to Confirm the Transactions
2) We were unsure of MG's Legal entity name
3) No contact @ MG

My question for you is are we going to accept this as a form of Confirmation?

Thanks,
Joe

Pushkar:  Here's the language suggested by Merrill for use in NDF's.  I am 
not familiar with the frequency of our trades, but I'm sure Laurel can fill 
in the blanks.  I thought that the process being implemented by the EMTA 
seemed reasonable but let me know if this is a fallback that you would agree 
to use if the PTAX rate is not available for settltment.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

Previously we have agreed upon ""CURRENCY REFERENCE DEALERS"" as the first 
disruption fallback, and """"CURRENCY MUTUAL AGREEMENT"" as the 2nd disruption 
fallback.  It appears that EMTA has created a ""BRL Industry Survey Rate"" 
(BRL11).  Merrill feels that this definition is replacing the Currency 
Reference dealers definition--or at least setting out a clear methodology for 
determining the rate.  Also, Shari always preferred that we use the mutual 
agreement rather then calculation agent determination of settlement rate.  
The ISDA template defaults to Calculation Agent.  Do you prefer that we 
continue on asking people for mutual agreement, or are you o.k. with 
Calculation agent determination of settlement rate?  Trading has no 
preference on that matter.  

I am faxing you a current ML non-deliverable deal with this new language in 
it for your review.  Please let me know if the confirm is o.k. to sign, or if 
you have any issues we need to address.  

Thanks!

See the below attachments for the new definition and the history surrounding 
it.

Hi Laurel,

Please take a look at the following documents sent by EMTA.  Only difference
is that we have not included the ""unscheduled holiday"" provisions as there
has not been a clear cut consensus among counterparties whether to use
Preceding or Following.

Please contact me if you have any problems.

I will try to sort through my e-mails if I find additional information on
the BRL templates.

Thank you

Subject: Re: Contacts

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EDIDE's accounts, EDIDE will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

Subject: Status of PIS/Cofins Laws as it effects Enron's trading operations

As you are aware, the application of the PIS/Cofins tax has a significant 
impact on the ability to profitably conduct  a trading and marketing business 
in Brazil.  This message summarizes the impact of recent activity relating to 
the current application of the PIS/Cofins tax and addresses the prospects for 
tax reform that will hopefully settle this issue.

Over a year ago, Medida Provisoria 1998 - 1 was issued that contained 
language that has been interpreted by taxpayers to exclude from their tax 
base amounts which had been paid to subcontractors, thus making the tax 
noncumulative.  The interpretation of Medida Provisoria 1998 - 1 as it 
related to  PIS/Cofins  taxes is not clear and many Brazilian taxpayers, 
including Enron entities, had filed for injunctions from the collection of 
PIS/Cofins on gross revenue, awaiting clearer guidance.

The recent release of Medida Provisoria 1998 - 18 simply deleted the language 
that taxpayers had been using the challenge the payment of the PIS/Cofins on 
gross revenue.  Taxpayers no longer have  constitutional challenge to the tax.

After talking with local counsel, I have a better understanding of the impact 
of this latest medida provisoria.  A medida provisoria is a provisional 
measure issued under the executive power of the president.  Under the 
Brazilian constitution, it has the effect of law but is effective for only 30 
days if not approved by the congress.   This particular medida provisoria has 
been reissued every 30 days in order to keep the measure effective.  The 
issuance of the latest medida provisoria is an attempt to end the discussion 
regarding the PIS/Cofins issue.  One view is that this approach will 
hopefully increase the pressure to resolve this issue.

There have been recent press releases indicating that tax reform in Brazil 
will not happen in 2000.   My sources indicate that this may not be the 
case.  There are discussions taking place that will move a small tax reform 
bill  forward in three areas  in which there seems to be consensus between 
the Treasury Department and the Executive Branch (President).  This tax 
reform is expected to move forward in August, 2000.    These items are as 
follows:

1.  End of Cumulative PIS/Cofins
2.  Unification of ICMS legislation 
3.  reducing tax burden on exports

How does all of this impact the development of a trading and marketing 
business in Brazil?

1.  We no longer have the option to pay PIS/Cofins on a net basis on current 
transactions based upon a favorable interpretation of Medida Provisoria 1998 
- 1.Since we would have had to book a reserve for the tax that we were not 
paying, this impacts the cash flow and not the earnings that could be booked 
from a transaction.
2.  We cannot use as a base case in forecasting our earnings from trading 
activity that we will pay PIS/Cofins tax only on the net margin.
3.  The PIS/Cofins issue is being discussed at the highest levels of 
government by some of the most politically influential people.  The key issue 
seems to be the timing of any change.  The recent breakdown in the 
discussions stemmed from the issue of whether the change would be delayed for 
2-3 years or phased in versus an immediate change in the application of the 
tax.  Any assumptions that Enron makes regarding the application of this tax 
must include a risk assessment that the changes, if enacted, may never become 
effective or may be delayed due to revenue constraints that cause the 
government to continue the historical application of the tax to gross revenue.

I have been told that Enron probably cannot add significant influence in the 
effort directed towards tax reform since the issue is being discussed at the 
highest levels of government by influential people.  However, I think Enron 
needs to focus on getting relief through specific exemptions, much like 
financial institutions have been able to get.   There is at least one bank 
that has been given approval to act as  power marketer that could be helpful 
in opening doors for this discussion.   Obtaining specific exemptions from 
the PIS/Cofins tax for the power and gas marketing businesses would allow us 
to develop the business and not have to worry about being caught in the midst 
of turmoil surrounding tax reform.

I will keep you posted on tax reform progress as it progresses  and will be 
glad to  assist in the development or arguments to support specific 
regulatory relief for Enron's trading businesses.

Regards

Lynn

Yes, I have received your message.  I had lunch with Monty, Keith and my dad 
at the Big G and it was wonderful.  Then I dragged Lawyers Daigle and 
Burlingame to the offices of Gordon, Arata, et al to say hello to Guy Wall.  
We only stayed for a few minutes and the old firm sure looked the same.  The 
weather in N.O. was perfect and I also had dinner at Emeril's and a catered 
meal by P. Prudhomme, both of which were excellent.  Things are rocking along 
here.  I am actually going to have that eye surgery next Friday (I'm 85% 
convinced to do it).  It only takes a short time and I can't drive to the 
clinic myself but I can drive the following day.  Maybe they'll come up with 
something to help my brain.

Back to N.O., I also had drinks with Paul Dubroc.  I guess you heard that 
Neel Roberts has been receiving treatments at M.D. Anderson.  (So is Julia 
Heintz's mother, by the way).  Robert Soniat (a lawyer in N.O.) recently died 
of liver cancer.  

I have been for long weekends to Phoenix and N.Y.  It snowed in Phoenix (it 
was supposed to be 80 degrees) and I caught the 24-hour bug in N.Y.

So, Carson, what's new with you???????????????????????????"

Chris, I've attached a simplified confirm based on our prior May, 1999 
version.
The only change in the new draft is to represent the fact that we are now 
using
only firm energy rather than a blend of firm and nonfirm. As a result volume
weighting should only apply on holidays and Sundays when on-peak and off-peak
values may need to be weighted in with 24-hour firm values.

On a related issue, how quickly could you have a corporate guarantee 
available?

Tanya:  I just spoke with Chris about this ARCO transaction which might trade 
TODAY.  We are ""cleaning up"" some of the language as it was based on the 
prior ARCO deal (when we were ECT).  Please note that Enron Corp. previously 
provided a guaranty.  I am not certain whether that guaranty is tied to the

Subject: Confirm for Power Swap




Chris, I've attached a simplified confirm based on our prior May, 1999 
version.
The only change in the new draft is to represent the fact that we are now 
using
only firm energy rather than a blend of firm and nonfirm. As a result volume
weighting should only apply on holidays and Sundays when on-peak and off-peak
values may need to be weighted in with 24-hour firm values.

On a related issue, how quickly could you have a corporate guarantee 
available?

Dave

Sara,

I think we must mention the following as the source of the index price for 
energy: ""Documento de Transacciones Economicas"" (DTE). This is an electronic 
document published by Cammesa, and is available to all participants of the 
Wholesale Electric Market in Argentina. It's a summary of all the economic 
transactions between the participants of the Wholesale Electric Market 
(Generators, Transmission Co, Distributors, Marketers and End Users).

This DTE is published around the 5th or 6th day of each month and reports all 
transactions for the previous month. It is accessed by calling into Cammesa's 
server and replicating the corresponding database.

The attached word file shows you different screens of this electronic 
document. The second zipped file is the DTE for June.

(See attached file: IndexView.doc)(See attached file: dte9906.zip)

Have a look at it and give me a call if you have any questions.

Regards, Julian

Jarrod:  attached is language which should be added to all paper and pulp 
omnibus confirms (and Bob has reviewed this language):

  
 Also, attached is the Temple-Inland confirm and I have changed only the 
""Credit or Other Special Provisions"" paragraph.  You will have to attach 
Exhibit ""A"" (which Susan sent you last week).



P.S.  Please verify with credit the timing for delivery of the guaranty.  I

 Chris,

   Six month 15MW transaction with Atlantic Richfield is fine.

Tanya:

I showed them a price and it looks like they will not be transacting today.  
The heat is off temporarily, but I would like to make sure we are OK with 
credit as they very well could be transacting soon.  Can we do this 
transaction?  Please note that the volume is 15 MW and not 50 as indicated in 
the confirm.

Thanks

Chris

Tanya:  I just spoke with Chris about this ARCO transaction which might trade 
TODAY.  We are ""cleaning up"" some of the language as it was based on the 
prior ARCO deal (when we were ECT).  Please note that Enron Corp. previously 
provided a guaranty.  I am not certain whether that guaranty is tied to the 
transaction specifically and I'll try to track down.  Will ENA provide a 
parent guaranty for the new transaction?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara

Subject: Confirm for Power Swap




Chris, I've attached a simplified confirm based on our prior May, 1999 
version.
The only change in the new draft is to represent the fact that we are now 
using
only firm energy rather than a blend of firm and nonfirm. As a result volume
weighting should only apply on holidays and Sundays when on-peak and off-peak
values may need to be weighted in with 24-hour firm values.

On a related issue, how quickly could you have a corporate guarantee 
available?

Dave

The use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past fe=

in the number of invoices and vendors.  With the higher volume, we have=20
reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle.

Although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual=20
employees, they often mail invoices directly to Accounts Payable.  At times=
=20
they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone.  In thes=
e=20
cases we return the invoice to the vendor.  If the employee is designated, =
we=20
try to track him/her down and forward the invoice.  The high level of=20
employee movement among jobs and locations at Enron has made this=20
increasingly challenging.  Either way, we end up doing something less=20
productive than paying invoices.

To maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessa=
ry=20
for research, we request that employees who have pagers, cell phones, and=
=20
other individually billed items such as licenses, subscriptions, etc., pay=
=20
for them by personal check or charge card (if applicable=01*payment instruc=
tions=20
are usually indicated on the invoice) and request reimbursement through=20
employee expense reports.=20

By submitting these charges on your expense report, you can help us reduce=
=20
the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices, the number of=
=20
checks generated by Treasury, the number of vendors in our database, and th=
e=20
turnaround time for payment of invoices. =20

Incidentally, Accounts Payable is currently installing a corporate-wide=20
web-based expense reporting system similar to what Enron International has=

used for the past year.  This will make it even easier to file your expense=

We=01,d like to make this effective immediately.  If you have any questions=

you finalize your piece.  The DATE of the earliest trade between ENA and HS 
Resources is important because we will use that date for the ISDA.  Please

Hello, I searched in Enpower and I do not see any financial trades that we 
have done with TransAlta Energy Marketing.  We may have done nymex trades 
with them.  These trades would be in TAGG.  It is possible that TransAlta is 
on the list that Sara and I have been using because of a nymex trade.  

Thanks,
Melissa

Janice/Sara,

I had a message from Joe Hunter regarding the attached  proposed letter.  He 
said that this has not been implemented yet.  This is a proposal and it was 
based on Southern's format that they sent us for review.  He said that they 
are only going to use this for 4-5 financial counterparties.

So the real question is....Does legal approve of this method?  

If approved, then we will target certain counterparties for Power  (probably 
some of the major players).  

It will eliminate the need to sign the confirmations.
It will not eliminate the need to check the commercial terms and legal terms 
of the confirms.
It will not eliminate the need to send a copy of the confirmation to the file.
It will not eliminate the need to send a copy of the ""list"" to the file 
(there will need to be a copy made for each deal to be placed in each file).

I do not see where we are gaining a great deal of time savings with this 
method.  In instances where we send our confirm when we are the Seller and 
the Counterparty sends their confirm when we are the Buyer...both of us would 
be preparing this schedule.  

Overall, I am not opposed to this method.  I do want to talk to commercial 
and make sure they are in agreement.  Just let me know the final word from 
legal.  Thanks!

Kim Theriot

Please see the attachment for a specific definition of ELIGIBLE SWAP 
PARTICIPANT and the TRADE OPTION EXEMPTION.

From a legal perspective and to avoid scrutiny and regulation by the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, ENA must always comply with the Trade 
Option Exemption when entering into options (as buyer or seller) with a third 
party.  Some of ENA's trading parties cannot satisfy this exemption from 
regulation because they are not a producer/merchant handling the underlying 
commodity (such as banks, hedge funds, etc) even though they may be entering 
into the transaction for business purposes.  If that situation occurs, ENA 
MUST ALWAYS BE THE OFFEREE OF THE OPTION (as buyer or seller) and ENA cannot 
solicit the party to enter into the transaction.

If ENA's trading partner fails to satisfy the Trade Option Exemption, our 
confirmation will EXPLICITLY state that ENA was offered the option to buy or 
sell by the counterparty.

Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara [ENA legal]

		 Subject: Revised Assignments from Jim Piccone


Attached are revised forms of Assignments for both the HSES to Enron (J. Aron 
trades) and HS Resources to HSES (Enron trades).  These are redlined versions.

The main changes to the HSES to Enron (J. Aron trades) assignment are 
completion of the Effective Date (June 28), the date of the J. Aron/Enron 
ISDA and the addition of counterpart and fax signature language.

The HS Resources to HSES assignment has been structurally revised to assign 
all HS Resources/Enron trades to HSES except those shown on Appendix A.  
Since the HS Resources/Enron trades continue to change every day until the 
HSES/Enron ISDA is in place, this new structure of the assignment will be 
much simpler and will pick up all HS Resources/Enron transactions through 
Friday, June 30.  Hopefully, by then the HSES/Enron ISDA will be in place.

Please let me know as soon as you believe these documents are ready for 
Enron's signature.  As soon as I have sign off by the other parties to the 
documents, I will advise you.  We can then have everyone print finals, get 
signatures and fax all counterparts to me.  I will act as a clearinghouse and 
get counterparts back out to everyone.

What we have negotiated with Southern was limited to financial trades done 
under the ISDA.  This was a form that they sent to us that we revised.  It 
was my understanding that they were going to contact Leslie separately about 
EPMI physical trades and Stacy about physical gas trades.

Sara,

Thank you for following up on our ability to transact a swap in Singapore.  I 
will have a conference call with them tonight to introduce the concept of a 
newsprint swap.  I do not expect that we will be prepared to close any 
transaction for at least one week.  I just want to make sure that we will 
have everything in place that will allow us to do business with them in the 
future.

Thanks for your quick response.

Good news.  

ABN Amro told us yesterday that they want to pursue this line and have it 
closed by the end of the week.  They asked us to send them a copy of the 
documentation where it stands up to now.  They gave us a copy of their 
mark-up of the Corp Guarantee which I gave to all of you.  ABN is motivated 
to get this done and will be amenable on pricing.  

Bank One talked to Jeff Shankman last night and has agreed to an effective 
rate of 0 for the initial margin.  They will charge us FF+30 but will 
reimburse us at FF+30 for any cash margins (see Schedule 1.)  Also Bank One 
will charge $2.55 a side for the commission ($5.10 total.)  Jeff told Bank 
One that ENE recently decided to pay all of its brokers the same fee 
(explains discrepancy between documentation and commission quotes from 
trading floor.)  As for the variation margin, the charge will be FF+30.  Bank 
One has  documents:
Customer Agreement - amendments will be made to Schedule 1 to reflect newly 
proposed commercial terms.
Enron Corp. Guaranty - Bank One needs to discuss Joel's request for Enron 
standard documentation
Credit line document - Jason/Sara need to make any necessary comments
Master Note (Promissory note) - NY law/jurisdiction will be acceptable.  Bank 
One needs to discuss Joel's' request for standard Enron documentation.  

Let's get together today so that we can organise ourselves to get our 
comments to the docs consolidated and close these as quickly and efficiently 
as possible.  

Thanks, Sarah

I took a brief look at the ABN guaranty--while not as offensive as many, 
there are several policy issues, including the fact that there is not a 
limitation on consequential damages, and that it does not have pay after 5 
days language that is, in a word essential. While I hate to start a battle of 
forms, I would recommend sending ABN the standard trading guaranty.

We have decided NOT to proceed with the swap agreement.  Enron and Shell will
each write a guaranty in favor of TBS for their pro rata share of the negative
difference between the gas price received and gas price paid resulting from 
the
differential in the gas price escalators.  Any positive difference in TBS's
favor will run through the TBS accounts to the TBS distribution account and,
subject to the blocking test in the Accts and Disbursement Agmt, will then be
distributed to E & S.
Dean & John: Can you propose a draft guaranty for internal review?  Once we're
happy with it we can send it to Shell for their consideration/sign-off.  
Thanks.

Regards,
     John

Subject:  Swap Agreement




I am sending this e-mail message to address several issues related to the
swap and to circulate a proposed confirmation for your consideration.

Before addressing the swap, however, I should note that it is not clear to
me that the project team has finally decided to proceed with a swap rather
than a guaranty.  If we are not, I would appreciate someone letting me know
so that we can stop this process.

Comments on the Draft Schedule:

     1.  Part 1(a) ""Specified Entity"":  A Specified Entity is an entity
other than the parties whose actions can cause an event of default or a
termination event.  The draft schedule does not contemplate a Specified
Entity.  I think we should consider whether EPE and/or SCG should be a
Specified Entity with respect to TBS.

     2.  Part 1(b) ""Threshold Amount"": proposes $1,000,000 for TBS, which
seems low given that Enron Corp. is backing it up.

     3.  Part 1(h) ""Additional Event of Default"":  If we use a swap
arrangement, there will be two: one for 72.5% between TBS and ECT, and one
for 27.5% between TBS and a Shell entity.  If that is the case, do we want
an additional event of default under which a sale by Shell of its interest
in TBS could result in termination?

     4.  Part 2  ""Representations"":  I think that we need someone in tax
to determine whether TBS can make the representations.

     5.  Part 4(d) & (e) ""Credit Support Provider"": Shell will be the
credit support provider under the other swap arrangement, not this one.

     6.  Part 4(g) ""Governing Law"", 4(h) ""Arbitration"": The schedule
proposes Texas law with AAA arbitration to be held in Texas.  It would seem
to me that we would want to use arbitration procedures that are similar to
those in the gas supply agreements, with ICC arbitration, held in Miami,
under New York, with joint arbitration if the same issue arises under one of
the gas supply arrangements (such as the proper calculation of price).

Comment on the Proposed Confirmation:

     I have reproduced the gas supply pricing provisions from the EPE Gas
Supply Agreement under the ""Fixed Amount Details"" but have not done so under
the ""Floating Amount Details"", which cross-references the provisions of the
SCG Gas Supply Agreement, because of the length of those provisions.

     Please let me know if you have any reactions to the above comments
or any comments on the attached confirmation.  I will contact Nasim to
discuss the process for pushing the swaps (or, alternatively, guaranties) to
completion.

Regards, Dean

Where do we stand in terms of corporate authority to do these margin deals? 
Are there standing resolutions or will you need to go for board approval--the

documentation where it stands up to now.  They gave us a copy of their 
mark-up of the Corp Guarantee which I gave to all of you.  ABN is motivated 
to get this done and will be amenable on pricing.  

Bank One talked to Jeff Shankman last night and has agreed to an effective 
rate of 0 for the initial margin.  They will charge us FF+30 but will 
reimburse us at FF+30 for any cash margins (see Schedule 1.)  Also Bank One 
will charge $2.55 a side for the commission ($5.10 total.)  Jeff told Bank 
One that ENE recently decided to pay all of its brokers the same fee 
(explains discrepancy between documentation and commission quotes from 
trading floor.)  As for the variation margin, the charge will be FF+30.  Bank 
One has  documents:
Customer Agreement - amendments will be made to Schedule 1 to reflect newly 
proposed commercial terms.
Enron Corp. Guaranty - Bank One needs to discuss Joel's request for Enron 
standard documentation
Credit line document - Jason/Sara need to make any necessary comments
Master Note (Promissory note) - NY law/jurisdiction will be acceptable.  Bank 
One needs to discuss Joel's' request for standard Enron documentation.  

Let's get together today so that we can organise ourselves to get our 
comments to the docs consolidated and close these as quickly and efficiently 
as possible.  

Thanks, Sarah

Dear Sara,

How nice to hear from you.  We did have a Maxwell Hendler exhibition and it
was incredible.  I thought I sent Mike the review.  If not, I should have.
Maxwell is currently  in an exhibition in Verona, Italy, at Studio La Citta,
that has been very successful.  I still have TANGEE at my home, AQUA POOL
remains available,  and there are some new pieces, as well.  We have had a
terrific season.   Hurry Back!   Best regards,   Patty

Sara, Susan:

The attached revision of the Appendix to the HS Resources to HS Energy 
Services assignment corrects the Total MMBtu column, which had a math error.  
The trade descriptions, which would control in any event, have not changed.

We would like to proceed with execution on Thursday.   Would you please 
accept the changes  in the red-lined documents I sent yesterday, print 
cleans, get signatures, and fax to me at 303-296-9709?  I will send the HS 
signiture pages in the morning, and will send the J. Aron pages as soon as I 
get them.

I will be in touch with you in the morning to discuss further.

Thanks. Jim

It has come to my attention that we made need another agreement similar to 
the one that we did with the ANNEX A form to cover the GTC's that Puget is 
bound by when it trades online with us.  I have enclosed the online GTC.  It 
is very similar to Annex A but I think that we need to deal with it 
separately.  Let me know what you think.

1. I am still waiting to hear whether ENA needs any special authority to 
enter into a debt transaction of this nature.

2. I  have discussed the guaranty with Bank One's Internal counsel (Bob 
Long), and enclose a revised draft below, to address a number of his 
concerns. Please let me know any thoughts that you have prior to my 
distributing this to him.

 

3. I have reviewed the note and accompanying documentation provided by Bank 
One, and note the following:
 i) The side letter authorises BOBIC to act as ENA's attorney in fact to 
initiate borrowings under the margin line. 
 ii) The Customer Agreement in Paragraph 6 provides for interest on a debit 
balance--it is not clear how this fits with the other documentation.
 iii) The remedies provision of the Customer Agreement (Paragraph 5) allows 
for liquidation in the event a bankruptcy petition is filed against ENA--it 
is customary in finance deals to have a 60 day window to have actions filed 
by third parties dismissed or stayed.
 iv) The note duplicates the interest calculation provision in the side 
letter, however, it omits fixed rate option set out in (c) of the side letter.
 v) The note refers to a ""deposit account"". Is there one? Or rather is it a 
different type of account?
 vi) The note allows for notice by telex. [I believe that the Telex system is 
for all intents, defunct]

Enclosed is the Counterparty form that we have come up with for Multi-Product 
Guarantys.  Depending upon the products that need to be covered, each 
Guaranty will need to be modified to make sure that it describes the proper 
entities and products.  I will send along the Enron form of this shortly but 
please pass this along to the appropriate people in the credit group.

Jeff, Stacy and Harry,
Are you going to change the Physical product form of Guaranty to look more 
like this?  Power has changed their form and it may help for us to all be 
consistent especially when we are asked to amend an existing Guaranty to 
include more products.  If you do decide to amend your form, please send the 
new form to credit.

Thanks for everyone's input.

Who in Corporate Legal would be the correct person to initial this document?  
Or, would it be the Corp. trader?  Jeff, you may be able to sign off your 
agreement with the terms--I'm not sure that they are looking for a legally

Laurel,

Attached is a term sheet from Merrill Lynch on ENE stock that we traded 
yesterday in swap on behalf of Corp.   ML is requesting that someone sign the 
term sheet.  Can you forward this to legal and find out who would be the 
right person to sign the term sheet.  I think it may be of an urgent matter 
b/c we are trading with them today.
Keep me posted.

Attached is a termsheet and execution summary for the ENE swap entered into
today.  If we dont get to 1mm shares by Friday we are happy to tranche the
swap based on the number of shares executed at that time.  Please give me a
call if you have any questions or comments.  We will give you a call in the
morning to discuss if you would like us to continue our hedging activity.
Thank you.

     Our Credit Department has approved Enron North America Corp. (""ENA"")
entering into ISDA Master Agreement with the following Tudor entities:

     The Ospraie Portfolio Ltd.   (which you have told us is a Cayman Island
company)
     Tudor BVI Global Portfolio Ltd.  (which you have told us is  a Cayman
Island company)
     Tudor Proprietary Trading, L.L.C.  (which you have told us is  a Delaware
limited liability company)

      It is our understanding that once we finalize the negotiation of the 
form
   of the ISDA Master Agreement for The Ospraie Portfolio Ltd., we will use
   substantially the same form to prepare ISDA Master Agreements for Tudor BVI
   Global Portfolio Ltd. and Tudor Proprietary Trading, L.L.C.    Therefore, 
we
   are authorizing you to retain Cayman Island Counsel (we believe you are 
going
   to use the Maples Calder law firm) to prepare one legal opinion covering 
the
   ISDA Master Agreements between ENA  and each of Tudor BVI Global Portfolio
   Ltd. and The Ospraie Portfolio Ltd.

All -
I spoke with John Greene about this issue this morning, and he said that he 
would handle it.  It is not customary to sign term sheets.  I put Peter Barna 
(Merrill Lynch) in direct contact with John with the understanding that they 
would work out the details (including the signature).  I asked them to 
forward the confirmation to us when it was ready.  So, in short, there 
shouldn't be anything that we need to do on this.

Hi Sara,

I met with accounting regarding these amounts. I will be forwarding a copy to 
you.

We have a total of .77 cents remaining in our account with Cargill.

Since we have several acounts in addition to Crude Oil, it is my 
recommendation that
we do not cancel the account as traders may want to utilize Cargill for other 
commodities.

Regards,
David

Cargill said that we do not have a line of credit nor do we have money 
sitting in an account with them.
The account is inactive at this time.

Let's review our next step when you have an opportunity.
Thanks
David

Hello David,

I didn't want to bother you - you're probably more than busy right now.

In my continuing effort to get your account going, specifically,
completing the margin line of credit, I thought the following might
help:

When Jeff Shankman first told me of Enron's requirement to have a line
of credit for margining, nat gas initial margin was $2750 per contract.
It is now $3850 and likely to rise again.  The 'cheap financing' that
our line represents to John Arnold may be even more appealing now (if he
has a second to convince Sara Shackleton to work on the documentation).

Otherwise, thanks for the intro to Bill White.  We've only spoken
briefly so far, but he did say he was trying to free up some time to get
something going.

I'll be in Houston in about two weeks, but I hope to talk to you before
then.

Regards,
Jim Naughton

Here is a message that I received from our counsel.  Again, I and they are 
just focusing on the Enron Online issues and Sara is handling the issues 
relating to doing transactions offline between Enron Mexico and the Mexican 
counterparties.  I will suggest to our counsel that we have a call mid next 
week involving you, me and them.  What is your availability on Wednesday?  
Alos, who from credit are you dealing with and are they aware that we 
probably will not be able to in a bankruptcy situation offset amounts owed 
with respect to the online and offline transactions?

 

Jeff:
Are there any tax issues that we need to be concerned about regarding the 
online piece of this?

I have been working with Mexican tax counsel regarding the online issues and 
received written advice from them yesterday, which I'll summarize and provide 
to all of you ASAP.  Best regards.

With the implementation of SAP, the employee expense report form has been 
modified to reflect the new coding system.  The procedures for its use are 
unchanged, but there are some cosmetic differences.  One item to note: the 
form no longer requires entry of your Social Security Number; instead use 
your new personnel number assigned through Human Resources (see 
http://hrweb.enron.com).  For electronically submitted expense reports, enter 
the same number on the receipt envelope.

The form is now available at the SAP website.  To access the form:

 From the Enron home page, go to the SAP intranet site http://sap.enron.com
 Choose one of the following paths:
 Click on Quick Reference Tools on the left menu
  Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms
  Click SAP Expense Report Form

  Click on Forms and Procedures Library on the left menu
  Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms
  Click SAP Expense Report Form
 Wait for it to load
 Click Enable Macros (or Yes, allow macros)

After you enter the data, save as Excel Workbook (.xls file extension) with a 
new filename.  Do not save as Excel Template (.xlt extension).

You may print the spreadsheet for submission to Accounts Payable, or attach 
it to Notes for electronic submission.  Instructions are available at the 
website, on the same drop down box as the form.

If you have any questions, contact the Center of Expertise (COE) at 713 
345-7427.

Thanks Carol, I understand you are only focusing on the Online transactions, 
and all I ask from you is the clearance to do Online transactions.
Regarding Credit, Rod Nelson has been supporting us and he is leaving all the 
pending things to Paul Radous.  Last week Rod and I spoke abut this, and his 
view is a little different. He believes there could be some exposure if the 
same counterparty transacts both on-line and off-line; however, there are 
ways to limit the transactions and very probably the likelihood of that 
happening is very little.  He was going to put together an opinion froom 
their side, and I suggest we have a conference call wednesday morning....
I am traveling wednesday but reachable through my assistant Barbara. 
011-452-8-152-2404.   PLease call any time is convenient for you so we can 
discuss this matter and also talk to your counsel.
Thanks and regards.

Hello David,

I didn't want to bother you - you're probably more than busy right now.

In my continuing effort to get your account going, specifically,
completing the margin line of credit, I thought the following might
help:

When Jeff Shankman first told me of Enron's requirement to have a line
of credit for margining, nat gas initial margin was $2750 per contract.
It is now $3850 and likely to rise again.  The 'cheap financing' that
our line represents to John Arnold may be even more appealing now (if he
has a second to convince Sara Shackleton to work on the documentation).

Otherwise, thanks for the intro to Bill White.  We've only spoken
briefly so far, but he did say he was trying to free up some time to get
something going.

I'll be in Houston in about two weeks, but I hope to talk to you before
then.

Regards,
Jim Naughton

acceptable. I would only include a provision stating that the services would 
be provided to the extent that no Mexican law or regulation is violated.

Pablo and Jose:
Thanks for the update.  Based on the marketing information that you received
from us yesterday, are there any restrictions on our folks in Mexico going
forward with their marketing efforts?  If so, please advise.  Prior to 
receiving
you written advice, would it be possible to schedule a call maybe on Wednesday
of next week with myself and Jaime so that we can at least outline any 
potential
online issues, both in connection with our marketing efforts and in connection
with the online documents that you are reviewing? I am available anytime after
2:30 (Houston time) on Wednesday and I am wide open on Thursday.

All -
I put together a first draft of a procedure memo for executing equity 
derivatives on Enron common stock.  Please review this, and give me any 
comments you might have.  I would appreciate it if I could have comments back 
from you by Friday morning so that we can have a working document as soon as 
possible.  Thanks in advance for your help.

Lisa Palmer and I had a conference call with the Xerox lawyer and commercial 
person.  The main issues are the following:

No CSA (claim to have over 40 ISDA Masters none of which contain CSA's! and 
not set up to handle collateral)
Rating downgrade is a Termination Event.  (Maybe they'll agree to our posting 
L/C's 
MUST have cross-acceleration (POLICY).
Guess what else?  NO NETTING (can't handle netting internally)

Otherwise, Xerox is cool."

Willie received a call from Mike Billings, the trader at Dow,
and he requested that deal #EY0963.1 from 6/15/99 be revised
from Dow Hydrocarbons to Dow Chemical.

He is currently signing and sending back the other trades that were
changed.  

Is it okay to change this deal also, and on a ""going forward"" basis, all
trades must be through Dow Hydrocarbons...

let me know...thanks...mgg

All:  It appears that this is the group which can best address the 
(derivatives) issues which may arise when Enron Corp. attempts to enter into 
equity swaps/options/forwards based upon Enron Corp. stock.  We have all 
undertaken to provide the group with the following items:

(1)  ""Procedures for Executing/Documenting/Unwinding Enron Corp. Equity 
Derivatives""
       Clint has already circulated a draft proposal.  Comments are invited.

(2)  The transacting party:  ENA (with an Enron Corp. guaranty) or Enron 
Corp.?
       Rex has no preference and credit's initial response was to consolidate 
trading in ENA.  I will revisit this issue with Bill Bradford.

(3)  Enron Corp. equity trading resolution
       Rex and Jim will handle the drafting and logistics.  This will be 
necessary if Enron Corp. is the trading party because the counterparty will 
want to review      (and equity trading requires authorization) AND also 
necessary if ENA is the trading party because equity trading requires 
authorization.

(4)  Standard form of Registration Rights Agreement
       Rex and Jim will handle the drafting.  This can be used as our ""form"" 
for future transactions.

(5)  Enron Corp. ""position paper"" addressing equity derivative parameters, 
preferable methods of settlement, registration rights, etc.
       I have no volunteers.  Maybe Bob Baird needs an assignment.

As you know, there are several outstanding confirms which require immediate 
attention before the foregoing items can be finalized.  Please let me know if 
we can establish a timetable for completion of this project.  Thanks for your 
help.  Sara"

Bill:  I have previously discussed this issue with Rod.  I would like to 
revisit once again.  These transactions include swaps/options/forwards on ENE 
stock.  There is a renewed effort coming from Treasury to use these tools 
more frequently than in the past.  I am in touch with Rex Rogers (Enron Corp. 
securities lawyer) as registration rights issues on ENE stock are definitely 
involved.  Our counterparties are telling us that they prefer to look to 
Enron Corp. since it is Enron Corp.'s stock that is involved.  At a minimun, 
even if ENA were the trading counterparty (with an Enron Corp. guaranty 
capped at an appropriate level), Enron Corp. would probably have to sign each 
confirmation as ISSUER OF THE STOCK (and ENA cannot make those agreements on 
behalf of Enron Corp.).

I would like to discuss ASAP as we are in the midst of negotiations with CSFB 
International, UBS AG, Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc. and Lehman 
Brothers Finance S.A."

Congratulations!! We are pleased to inform you that you are the winning 
bidder on one or more lots in our 2000/06/04 auction.

IMPORTANT:  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE MESSAGE!  It provides you with 
instructions on how to ensure that your wine is shipped according to your 
instructions, with the lowest risk of loss or breakage in shipment.  YOU MUST 
RETURN A SEPARATE CONFIRMATION FOR EACH AUCTION IN WHICH YOU HAVE WINNING 
BIDS.

Below you will find an invoice for the lots you won in this auction, along 
with the estimated charges for shipping, packaging and insurance.

Follow these steps to expedite your order:

1. PRINT OUT THIS EMAIL.

2. VERIFY THAT YOUR BILLING AND SHIPPING ADDRESSES ARE SHOWN CORRECTLY, or 
make any necessary changes to them.  Choose your shipping address carefully 
-- although we use our best efforts to ship your wine when weather conditions 
are favorable, winebid.com is not responsible for damage caused by exposure 
to heat or cold.  Please also note any special shipping instructions.

3. INDICATE YOUR PREFERRED METHOD OF PAYMENT.  Unless you tell us otherwise, 
we will charge the credit card number you have on file with us as of the 
close of the auction.  If you have changed your credit card since please let 
us know.  If you would prefer to send a check or use a wire transfer, please 
see the procedure for doing so below.

4. IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST PURCHASE of wine from winebid.com, please make a 
copy of your proof of age and mail it to winebid.com, P.O. Box 2550, Napa, CA 
94558 with your shipping authorization.

5. FAX THE PRINTED CONFIRMATION TO 877-921-3733, or mail it to winebid.com, 
P.O. Box 2550, Napa, CA 94558.  AS WE MUST PAY OUR SELLERS IN A TIMELY 
MANNER, IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE YOUR SIGNED CONFIRMATION WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THE 
AUCTION CLOSE YOUR CREDIT CARD ON FILE WILL BE CHARGED.  HOWEVER WE CAN NOT 
SHIP YOUR WINE UNTIL WE RECEIVE YOUR SIGNED CONFIRMATION AND PROOF OF AGE!

Once we've received your faxed confirmation, we will charge your credit card 
for the hammer price of the wine, the 12.5% premium, sales tax, if 
applicable, and shipping insurance.  We will charge the shipping and handling 
when the wine is actually shipped.  If you have purchased wine from both our 
West Coast and Midwest storage and service facilities, we will transfer the 
wine to the facility closest to your shipping address by 
temperature-controlled truck to consolidate your shipment.

Following are answers to some common questions regarding our service and our 
procedures after the auction has closed:

HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO SHIP MY WINE?  Because of the complexity in sorting 
individual bottles from hundreds of consignors for shipment to thousands of 
different customers, as well as the time it takes to transfer wine between 
our facilities, please allow two to three weeks after we receive your faxed 
confirmation before expecting shipment.  If you have an urgent need for the 
wine, please drop us an email at info@winebid.com and we'll attempt to 
accommodate your request.  Please also see the information on weather below.

WHAT ABOUT TEMPERATURE ISSUES?  Prior to shipping any wine, winebid.com's 
customer service staff checks the weather forecast at our shipping facility 
and at your delivery zip code.  If the forecast is too warm or too cold, we 
will hold the shipment until the weather is more favorable.  We only ship 
second day air shipments during the first half of the week, so your wine 
won't sit in the shipper's warehouse over the weekend.  For older vintages or 
very high value wines, we recommend that you arrange to pick up the wine at 
one of our facilities, or use a ground carrier with temperature-controlled 
trucks to minimize the risk of damage.  Older corks have a tendency to fail 
during air shipments.

HOW IS MY WINE SHIPPED?  We recommend the use of two-day service to ship your 
wines, to minimize the time the wine is exposed to temperature extremes on a 
truck or in a warehouse.  If you would like to use next day service, or 
standard ground service, please let us know and we'll provide a revised 
estimate of shipping charges.  All international shipments are sent by air.

IS THE WINE INSURED?  Yes.  Winebid.com has found that UPS, FedEx, and other 
shippers frequently do not honor claims for damaged wine shipments, so we 
have purchased and arranged for outside insurance coverage and provide it to 
all of our customers at a rate of 1% of the hammer price of the wine.  This 
insurance is mandatory, and is administrated by winebid.com.  If your 
shipment suffers loss, damage or breakage, please contact our customer 
service department to make a claim.  Our insurance does not cover claims of 
spoilage or damage from heat or cold during shipment.

HOW CAN I SAVE MONEY ON FREIGHT CHARGES?  We strongly recommend that fine and 
rare wines be shipped by air.  Given the weight of wine, this can be 
expensive.  If you would like us to use less expensive ground shipment, let 
us know.  Also, if your purchase from this auction is for less than a full 
case, consider allowing us to store your wine until it can be combined with 
purchases from future auctions to make a single, larger shipment.  Sending 
multiple shipments of one or two bottles at a time is far less efficient than 
shipping full case lots.

SHIPPING POLICY:  The primary means of distribution will be common carrier.  
All wines are sold in Illinois or California (depending on which service and 
storage facility is used) and ownership, possession and control of the wine 
passes to buyer in Illinois or California in accordance with the Uniform 
Commercial Code, and sales and use tax, provisions governing auctions.  We 
make no representation as to the rights of anyone to import wine into any 
state outside Illinois or California.  The buyer is solely responsible for 
shipment of their wines.  By participating in these auctions, you authorize 
us to act on your behalf to deliver your wine to you at a location in 
Illinois or California where the wine may be picked up by you, stored for 
pickup by you or shipped by you via common carrier to such other location as 
you may from time to time direct. Should you choose to authorize a common 
carrier to ship your wine from the storage and service facility, it will be 
at your own ris!
k.!
 For your information, wines may be sold and delivered only to persons who 
are at least 21 years old, and the various state and municipal shipping 
regulations governing alcohol around the country vary tremendously. At any 
given time, regulations previously authorizing shipment could be repealed, 
and vice versa. It is the responsibility of the owner of the wine to be 
familiar with the regulations of whatever jurisdiction he or she chooses to 
ship the wine into.  By placing bids in these auctions, you are representing 
that you are at least 21 years old, and the person to whom your wine will be 
delivered is also at least 21 years old.   The person receiving delivery will 
be required to show identification proving that he or she is at least 21 
years old.

1.) Choose a method of payment:
  a) Payment by Credit Card: __ Your card will automatically be charged the 
total amount above.
  b) Payment by Check: __ Payment in full must be received within 10 days. A 
$25 fee applies to all returned checks. Make check payable to Winebid.com 
Inc. and mail it to PO Box 2550 Napa, CA 94558.
  c) Payment by Wire: Please inquire for instructions.

Subject: Enron Corp. equity derivatives transactions on Enron Corp. stock

Bill:  I have previously discussed this issue with Rod.  I would like to 
revisit once again.  These transactions include swaps/options/forwards on ENE 
stock.  There is a renewed effort coming from Treasury to use these tools 
more frequently than in the past.  I am in touch with Rex Rogers (Enron Corp. 
securities lawyer) as registration rights issues on ENE stock are definitely 
involved.  Our counterparties are telling us that they prefer to look to 
Enron Corp. since it is Enron Corp.'s stock that is involved.  At a minimun, 
even if ENA were the trading counterparty (with an Enron Corp. guaranty 
capped at an appropriate level), Enron Corp. would probably have to sign each 
confirmation as ISSUER OF THE STOCK (and ENA cannot make those agreements on 
behalf of Enron Corp.).

I would like to discuss ASAP as we are in the midst of negotiations with CSFB 
International, UBS AG, Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc. and Lehman 
Brothers Finance S.A.

Laurel,

Attached is a term sheet from Merrill Lynch on ENE stock that we traded 
yesterday in swap on behalf of Corp.   ML is requesting that someone sign the 
term sheet.  Can you forward this to legal and find out who would be the 
right person to sign the term sheet.  I think it may be of an urgent matter 
b/c we are trading with them today.
Keep me posted.

Here is my first cut at a proposed form of amendment.  I have added a rep and 
an additional Event of Default to cover the 'Lien"" issue in light of the fact 
that Barrett's Credit Agreement restricts them from entering into any 
agreement that contains a negative pledge.  I winged the amendment to the 
Confirmations since I have not seen them yet.  Please call me with any 
comments.

 Tan and Susan - can one of you handle this?  I called Diane Anderson and 
told her that I'll be leaving Enron and won't be able to help her.  I told

		 Subject: Confirmation Letter

Susan,

I am working with Joe Hunter to prepare the individual letters to our 
counterparties
for the below detailed project.   In order to fill in the blanks in the first 
paragraph
of Carol's template, it is necessary for me to know the appropriate section 
in 
each counterparty's Agreement that references the existing confirmation 
procedures 
(the ""Confirmation Procedures"").

Would it be possible for you to provide me with copies of the Master 
Agreements
for each of the following counterparties, so I can fill in the blanks and get 
these letters
out the door:

Bank One (formerly FNB)
Bankers Trust Company
Barclays Bank PLC
The Chase Manhattan Bank
Citibank, N.A.
Credit Suisse Financial Products
Elf Trading S.A
J.Aron & Company
Paribas
Phibro Inc.
Royal Bank of Canada

I would be happy to come up and retrieve them as soon as you have them ready.
If you have any questions, please give me ( 3-0443) or Joe ( 3-3316) a call.

Thanks - we're looking forward to being able to implement this procedure.
-Diane

Joe Hunter has asked me to draft a form of confirmation reply letter that we 
could send to our counterparties in lieu of signing their confirmations.  
This form of letter with the appropriate chnages could also be used by those 
counterparties that we confirm.  Please let me know if you have any comments 
on this form or any concerns about implementing this process.  Thanks.

Joel has not negotiated the Corp. Guarantee with Bob Long.  Joel has made 
comments but did not want to send them to Bob until he heard back from Sara, 
Jason and myself.  Since we are replacing the Bank One agreements with our 
boiler plate, some of Joel's comments will go away but he wants to talk to 
Jason or Sara before continuing the process with Bob Long.  Would one of you 
please circle with him to make sure the Guarantee negotiation process in 
happening win tandem with the new boilerplate negotiations?  

Also, please copy him on the document distribution list  tomorrow.   Thanks, 
Sarah"

All:  I spoke with Bill Bradford to get the global credit perspective, and, 
he is entirely neutral.  However, he agreed that it made sense for Enron 
Corp. to transact on its own stock.  

I am prepared to draft new ISDA Master Agreements with our remaining 
potential targets in the name of ""Enron Corp."" without Credit Support 
Annexes.  Upon execution, the parties generally exchange evidence of 
authority (i.e., resolution or excerpt thereof).  

The outstanding confirms are in the name of Enron Corp.  These are ""Deemed 
ISDA's"" and no party has asked for evidence of authority (although the 
parties do represent that they have such authority).

Please let me hear from you if someone objects to the use of Enron Corp.   
Thanks.  Sara "

This is a wrap-up email to inform all of you about the dates, activities and 
where we are standing with regards to the expansion of EOL to the Mexican 
Market.   The general strategy is to target the 40 major key customers 
directly, through two  formal presentations. One on Thursday August 3rd in 
Monterrey, at the  Quinta Real Hotel; and the second one on Friday August 4th 
in Mexico City, at the Four Seasons Hotel.   The setting is pretty much a 
Continental breakfast, followed by welcoming remarks and the formal 
presentation of EOL.

We plan to send out the invitations with the brochures around July 15th.  Kal 
Shah is planning on delivering around 600 spanish-translated EOL Ball 
Brochures in the next days. The brochures will have a cover letter that will 
include the Guest Accounts for the customers that will be invited to the 
formal presentations. We will follow up with RSVP personal calls from the 
15th to the 3rd. The rest of the customers will receive the brochure by mail. 

Jeff Blumenthal is helping us on the Tax Issues regarding on-line 
transactions by Mexican Counterparties. Jeff is almost finishing on checking 
the Tax implications on the products most probably traded by the targeted 
customers, as well as all other products listed on EOL. 

Carol St Claire is helping us on all the legal issues, as well as reviewing 
the marketing material that would be sent out to customers. We should have a 
formal opinion in the next days. 

Eric Thode is putting together the press releases to be sent on the launching 
date, and is also helping us with a plan to invite and inform the media about 
the event as well as EOL service. Eric, please send a copy of the press 
releases to Carol, since there are some words we need to avoid on the legal 
side of things.

Paul Radous and Rod Nelson are helping us with the pre-approval of credit for 
all of these targeted customers to be able to transact in EOL. 

Leonardo Pacheco is helping us on several fronts, and specially coordination 
of this effort, as well as getting all the guest accounts for the customers, 
together with Frank Davies. Leonardo please send a bunch of  Getting Started 
manuals as soon as you can. 

Daniel Diamond will help us with the marketing material and strategy. Dan let 
me know who will be attending the presentations on your behalf, and type of 
aid we will need in the Hotels. 

Let me know who is planning to attend so we can help with reservations and 
travel arrangements, or call directly Barbara Martinez at 011-52-8-152-2404.

I really appreciate all of your support and great work.  I am looking forward 
to successfully concluding the ""Approval"" process in the next days so we can 
move forward with the logistics, and please let me know how else can I help.

Kind Regards,   Jaime Williams.

John,
Attached is a termsheet and execution summary for the ENE swap entered into
today.  If we dont get to 1mm shares by Friday we are happy to tranche the
swap based on the number of shares executed at that time.  Please give me a
call if you have any questions or comments.  We will give you a call in the
morning to discuss if you would like us to continue our hedging activity.
Thank you.

Let's eliminate future problems with Dow and their trader Mike Billings.

Credit has given the O.K. to trade in the name of The Dow Chemical Company.  
We will document trades on the ""omnibus"" UNLESS we are able to negotiate an
 ISDA with the counterparty.

Tell Mike Billings that we will not keep changing from ""Dow Hydrocarbons and 
Resources, Inc."" to the parent company.  We waste too much time and energy.

 Call if you have questions.  Sara"

Both the swap and termination confirms look fine to me.  The only question I 
would have for you in on the swap confirm.  On page 6, there is a transfer 
provision at the bottom of the page.  I don't know what the transfer 
provision in Section 7 of the Master Agreement is, but I just want to be sure 
that this does not allow them to freely transfer their obligations under the 
agreement to a non-affiliate.  I know that the trade has been terminated, but 
I just don't want any bad precedents being set.  This language may be just 
fine; I just wanted to be sure.  Otherwise, it looks good to me.

Barney.  We need to revise the agreement with an addendum to include Goldman 
Sachs to act as our prime Broker, in addition to Bear Stearns and Morgan

Attached is the latest deal team list with Jim's email.  

Please send out the docs (boilerplate Credit Agmt. and Trading Guarantee

their competition is.  To ABN please send to Kriss Grosshans and his

Sara and Jason,

Section 2.2 of the Credit Agreement attached below provides that ENA will 
make any payment of interest to ABN AMRO Bank N.V. net of applicable U.S. 
federal withholding tax (i.e., ABN AMRO bears the burden of the tax).  While 
ENA can pay the generally required withholding tax equal to 30 percent of the 
gross payment, it should obtain the appropriate U.S. federal withholding 
certificate from ABN AMRO so that the withholding tax will be reduced to 
zero.  (I have assumed that ABN AMRO N.V. is a Dutch entity.  If that is not 
the case, can you let me know in which country it is formed?)

The appropriate form to obtain is either:

 1.  IRS Form W-8BEN (which provides that ABN AMRO is a non-U.S. entity with 
no U.S. nexus and is entitled to the benefits set forth in the treaty entered 
into by the country under which ABN AMRO is formed and the United States), or

 2.  IRS Form W-8ECI (which provides that ABN has a U.S. branch and that 
interest earned by ABN AMRO is attributable to its U.S. branch).

It is in ENA's best interests to obtain a form since, if no form is obtained 
an ENA does not withhold the appropriate amount of tax, then the IRS will 
look to ENA for payment.  Furthermore, I suspect that ABN AMRO would be 
unpleasantly surprised if it receives only 70 percent of the payment that it 
intended on receiving.

Please call me at ext. 35777 with any questions.

Best regards,

Jeff

Effective immediately, reporting responsibility for Global Strategic Sourcing 
(GSS) will move from Enron Net Works to Enron Corp.  George Wasaff, Managing 
Director, will report directly to Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and 
Chief Accounting Officer for Enron.  GSS, formed February 1, 2000, will 
continue to focus on supply-chain management world-wide for Enron.   We 
believe this change in reporting will leverage and enhance GSS's global reach 
and effectiveness while allowing ENW to focus on its core mission of creating

A few thoughts:
1. Section 2.1 (y) the .30% should specify per annum
2. Section 2.1 contemplates that interest is payable monthly--this seems to 
conflict with the provisions of Section 3.1 which makes it payable on demand. 
Am I missing something?
3. Section 3.5 should we specify a time of day?

I have reviewed this via remote access, and am not able to print. I think 
more thought should go into the mechanics and timing  of what is going on 
here. I will be available next week. Can we have another meeting?

George,
I'm not sure if you're the right person to send the comments to, but Media
General has the following comments on the Newsprint Swap Agreement.

Schedule to Master Agreement

1.  Media General wants the cross-default to be reciprocal at $100 million
for both Media General and Enron.
2.   Further, Media General thinks that this should be a cross-acceleration,
not a cross-default.
3.   Page 3 of Schedule.  The ""date by which to be delivered"" for Party B
should track the same with Party A: i.e., if financials are available on
EDGAR then they would not be automatically provided by MG on a quarterly
basis.
4.  Page 4 of Schedule.  Under (a), add ""Attn.: Chief Financial Officer"".
We will send Marshall Morton's fax and telephone numbers.
5.  We will let you know who will serve as process agent.  We would like to
talk about governing law in Texas and the site of arbitration in Houston.
6.  Page 6 of Schedule.  In clause(b)(g), please note that MG intends to
assign this agreement and we want to make sure that does not affect this
representation.
7.Page 8 of Schedule.  MG wants the right to assign this agreement to a
party with a credit agreement equivalent to a certain level.  We can discuss
what that level should be.  We should discuss what Enron's credit rating is
in this connection.

Transaction Confirmation Document.

1. MG does not think this transaction should be characterized as a
""swaption"".  This was to be a deal for the purchase of newsprint at a fixed
price, not at Enron's option.
2. We want todiscuss the expiration date. We should also discuss the other
dates and terms which are blank.  On page 2, under ""Additional Provisions"",
the date for satisfying conditions is clearly wrong since it refers to July
5.  Once again, all of this ties in with not being an option, but a fixed
agreement.
3. We would like to have Enron render a monthly settlement statement with a
net amount being paidto/receivable from MG.  No netting is presently
provided for in the agreement.


ISDA Credit Support Annex

MG  would like to delete this entirely and would propose that Enron would
rely on the general cross-acceleration provisions.  Media General never
contemplated credit provisions more onerous than its credit agreements.

          I will have the Media General business people follow up with the
people at Enron, but could you please have some one get in touch with me on
this.

Thanks,
John

Since Scott Neal's phone call with the counterparty was July 23 I believe 
that should be the correct date.  The call made by Julian and Federico on 
July 20 was not effective to bind ECT.  Please confirm this with Sara and 
Scott and make sure everyone is on board with this.  I am sure Scott was just 
using the draft deal ticket Julian prepared and Julian used the date they 
called rather than the date that Scott did the deal.

Brent,

One last question on the Central Puerto S.A. doc.  We currently have the 
Trade Date as July 23, but the tickets we received say July 20th.  Is July 
20th correct?

The vast majority of this language is already in the guaranty in the form of 
waivers--I have no problem in saying the same thing 2 different ways, if it 
will expedite the deal. Any objections?

The revised Guaranty is acceptable except that I would like to see the
first sentence of Section 1 read as follows:

     Subject to the provisions hereof, Guarantor hereby irrevocably and
     unconditionally guarantees the timely payment when due of the
     obligations (including, without limitation, all renewals,
     extensions and modifications thereof, and all interest, fees and
     other monetary obligations incurred or accrued during the pendency
     of any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar
     proceeding, regardless of whether allowed or allowable in such
     proceeding) of Enron to Bank One under the Loan Documents (the ""
     Obligations"").

Please let me know where we are with respect to the Credit Agreement.
Are you preparing such an agreement?

I have received a couple of forms from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter re Enron 
Investments Plc. They have asked that we sign and return to them a form W-8, 
""Certificate of Foreign Status"", and also a form 1001, ""Ownership, Exemption, 
or Reduced Rate Certificate"".

These forms are in respect of a bank account number 038112215, which we have 
no record of here. Could you please let me know if you have any details of 
this account so that I can fill in the forms if appropriate. We only have 30 
days to complete and return the forms from the date the account opened, after 
which it is likely that any interest earned on the account will be subject to 
withholding tax.

thank you for your help.

The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures 
in excess of $5,000 has enabled ENA to better assess the business value of 
events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include 
customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this 
memo.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the 
threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to 
$2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and 
events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer 
events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events 
with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public 
Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman

2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract 
negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department 
will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they 
can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department 
will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program 
and ENA.

3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting 
documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a 
detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please 
submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR 
department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the 
form.

4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of 
the Chairman for final approval.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for 
various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance 
planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie 
Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Subject: EOL -- Mexican tax consequences  

This e-mail sets forth the Mexican tax consequences arising from Enron North 
America Corp. (or any other United States entity that is wholly-owned by 
Enron Corp. and does not have nexus in Mexico) (""ENA"") entering into any of 
the sixteen financial derivative transactions described in the ""Hedging 
Indexes definitions"" tab contained in the attachment below (""Transactions"") 
with Mexican counterparties through EnronOnline (""EOL"").  (The Transactions 
are those that Jaime Williams has indicated are most likely to be entered 
into with Mexican counterparties.  Although such counterparties may enter 
into any of the Transactions, they may also transact through EOL with respect 
to any other product offered.  I will follow up as soon as possible regarding 
the Mexican tax consequences applicable to those products not addressed in 
this e-mail.)

Based on advice received from Chevez, Ruiz, Zamarripa y Cia., S.C. (our 
Mexican tax counsel based in Mexico City), payments made by a Mexican 
counterparty to ENA pursuant to any of the Transactions will not be subject 
to Mexican income, withholding or value-added tax.  Consequently, the 
Transactions (described in the attachment below) are approved by the ENA Tax 
Department for trading through EnronOnline with Mexican counterparties.

Jaime and Agustin:  Please keep in mind that our previous discussions 
regarding ENA's activities  in Mexico (i.e., that its activities in Mexico 
should continue to be limited such that it is not subject to Mexican tax) 
also apply to ENA's EOL transactions with Mexican counterparties.  Thus, 
Enron employees' activities in Mexico on behalf of ENA (or any other 
non-Mexican Enron entity), whether through EOL transactions or otherwise, 
should be limited to general marketing of Enron products; no negotiations 
regarding any product should take place in Mexico on behalf of ENA, and no 
contract should be executed in Mexico on behalf of ENA.

Please contact me at 713.853.5777 with any questions.

Best regards,

Jeff

Jeff, I am sending you the specific information of the indexes and products 
that we believe our customers would be trading on EOL.....Please take a look 
at the file attached, and the page with Index Definitions, for the 
information you are looking for. The trades will be performed based on 
indexes taht already exist in OEL, so no new Mexican Indices will be 
included.   Please note however, that the mexican gas is priced in Mexico on 
the basis of the Tetco/Valero basket. So, most probably, that same basket 
will be included in the system to accomodate to our customer's needs. 
Please note that Carol St Clair will be helping us on the legal aspects of 
including Mexico into the EOL system.

Hi Sara, sorry to keep bugging you.  Did you decide if the payment date was 
going to be 10 days?  Elsie Lew needs to bill someone by 3:00 today.  The 
paperwork we have says five days but the counterparty is insisting on 10 
days.  The amount of money they owe us is 28 million.  Let me know if you 
have made a decision on this issue.

Everybody

Further to the sell-down of Sutton Bridge it looks like the originators are 
planning, as part of that deal to assign infinity deal number 25556, a 
currency swap we have with Sutton Bridge to EDF/London Electricity.  The 
hedge for this deal is a back to back deal with Natwest, infinity deal number 
25555.

My questions are:
When this swap was originally entered into there would have been a credit 
reserve taken for it, which will have to be released.  How much is this and 
what is the process?  I am assuming this release of credit will not effect my 
traders P&L.  Can you please confirm this.

What else do we need to look at to complete this assignment?  What are the 
legal implications?


The originator is looking to do this fairly quickly and so a quick response 
would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks
Trena

Sara,

here is online (web based) convertible trading site hat I could use - kindof 
like an online broker where they match up buyers and sellers.  I take it that 
before we enter to any agreement with them you need to approve it all.  

 I have not looked at this document yet, so please feel free to make any 
comments you may have.

Sara:  If the PacifiCorp ISDA we discussed last week is in or through the 
hopper, will you please forward a copy to me?  The guys on the floor would 
like to pull together a form of confirm that they can show to PacifiCorp when 
they meet with them later this week.  The date hasn't yet been set, but it 
could be in a few days.

I hope you had a good weekend.

Perhaps we can talk tomorrow.

Thanks.

 In order to better align our resources with the business units we support, 
we are designating the following individuals as operating company leads with 
primary responsibility for designing and implementing government and 
regulatory affairs support for the operating companies and to serve as 
primary contacts for the operating companies:

  EBS: Scott Bolton & Donald Lassere

  EES: Harry Kingerski

  ENA: Jim Steffes

 In addition to supporting the operating company organizations, these 
individuals will report to Rick Shapiro.  Jim Steffes will retain his 
responsibilities for regulatory risk assessment and will continue to report 
to Steve Kean in that capacity.

 There are already numerous working relationships and points of contact 
between government affairs and the operating companies.  The designation of 
Scott, Donald, Harry and Jim as leads does not change that.  Rather, we are 
looking to these individuals to coordinate these activities and serve as a 
""go to"" resource on issues which impact the respective operating companies."

Mary,

Set forth below are the provisions that should be included in a margin 
agreement whereby ENA will borrow funds from a non-U.S. entity (i.e., ABN 
AMRO) and make payments of principal and interest pursuant to the borrowing.  
As you'll note, the language provides that ENA will only be required to make 
(and be liable for) payments of interest that are net of any U.S. withholding 
tax and, thus, ABN AMRO will bear the burden of any U.S. withholding tax.


All payments under this Agreement shall be made without any deduction or 
withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such deduction or withholding 
is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any 
relevant governmental revenue authority, then in effect.  If a party is so 
required to deduct or withhold, then that party (""X"") shall (a) pay to the 
relevant authorities the full amount required to be withheld promptly upon 
the earlier of determining that such deduction or withholding is required or 
receiving notice that such amount has been assessed against Y, (b) pay and be 
liable to Y for only the net amount owed after reduction for any Tax, and (c) 
promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a copy thereof), or other 
documentation reasonably acceptable to Y, evidencing such payment to such 
authorities.

""Tax"" means any present or future tax, levy, impost, duty, charge, assessment 
or fee of any nature (including interest, penalties, and additions thereto) 
that is imposed by any government or other taxing authority in respect of any 
payment under this Agreement.

Please contact me at ext. 35777 with any questions.

Best regards,

Jeff

Bill

You are probably aware that Enron has gone unconditional on its offer to buy 
MG, a metal company here in London.
The objective is to integrate with them ASAP and as smoothly as possible.

I made a visit with MG today and talked to their FX trader who said that he 
trades with the following banks:
CIBC
Deutche Bank
Commerz Bank
Metall Bank

Can you please tell me what lines we have in place with these, if any at all.


Sara
Do we have isdas etc in place?


Most of the trades are spot or 3mth forward, but some trades are up to four 
years out.


Thanks

Hi Sara,

I just wanted to verify that I can use these Annexes for ALL  Tudor/Osprai 
deals.





Also,  is PG&E Core a division of Pacific Gas & Electric Company and can we 
use Pacific Gas & Electric's ISDA in place for PG&E Core?


Thanks,

I've spoken with Morgan Stanley this afternoon to get details on progress 
with the ISDA for credit trading.

In brief, they have our ISDA documents and are in the process of reviewing 
them.  They also informed me that Enron North America was in the process of

Hi Carol:

Enclosed is latest draft.  Please note that I changed DB's Threshold at A+
to bring it into line with Enron's rating.  I also added a sweep-in clause
to deal with the BT Transactions (Section 18).  Please let me know if those
provisions are acceptable.  Subject to internal DB approvals, I think the
other substantive points still open are (i) a Moody's rating for the MAC
clause, (ii) the demand section in the Guaranty, and (iii) determining the
L/C provisions and mechanics.  Please let me know who your replacement on
this matter will be and, if we don't speak before you leave, good luck and
congratulations.

Regards,

Steve

Ruling Against Texas Hospital Swap May Put Similar Deals in Jeopardy

  DALLAS -- A recent ruling that the El Paso County, Tex., Hospital District
illegally entered into an interest rate swap in late 1996 may imperil attempts
by other county health care providers to issue similar hedges, according to
officials familiar with ...

Sara and Paul,

I have received a request for a quote from Inforsa CI, and Chilean company.  
They appear to have an excellent balance sheet, but I don't know if we are 
set up to trade with Chilean companies.  Paul, the company's information is 
available on Bloomberg if you type in INFORSA CI and hit the equity key.  We 
are just starting discussions with them, but I wanted to make sure to give 
you both advance notice.  Please let me know if there is any additional 
information that you need from me.

It looks like it will be at least a month before Singapore Press Holdings 
will be ready to do business.  I'll keep you informed as our talks progress.

Thanks,

Jay

Eqt. Energy's Elmore Patterson have not reached closure on credit

a little clarification, e.g. I don't see the relevance of adding Part 6(g)
and (h) as we don't trade in pulp or paper. Please let me know if we need to
discuss. Thanks. Henry. (412-553-7711)

Henry:
Enclosed are clean and marked revised drafts of the Schedules.  As we
discussed,
I have bracketed those sections that are still open.  Please note that since
May, 2000 when the initial draft was sent to you we have updated our forms
and I
have included our new form language in Part 3, Sections (a) and (b), part 6,
Sections (g) and (h), Paragraph 13 (g) and the LC form.  Alos, I have made
the
chnages that you requested to the Enron Guaranty.  Are those chnages also
acceptable for the ERI Guaranty?

I look forward to hearing from you.  I will be leaving to go on maternity
leave
at the end of this week.  In my absence, please contact Susan Bailey at
713-853-4737 who will coordinate with another attorney in our group to get
this
finalized.

(1)  CIBC
 (a)  Enron Corp. has a 1/17/96 master and CIBC is designated as multibranch 
to act through offices in Tokyo, London and New York.  If this agreement is

 (b)  ENA has a 10/1/94 master and CIBC is designated as multibranch to act 
through offices in Toronto, Tokyo and London.  The agreement was amended on 
5/24/96 (to add a collateral annex), on 7/27/97 t(o add FX/currency option 
and FRABBA provisions) and on 1/13/00 (to amend thresholds).

 ENA is in the process of negotiating an ISDA master agreement.  We are 
speaking with Stephen Kessler (legal) in New York.

(3)  Commerzbank AG
 ENA is in the process of negotiating an ISDA master agreement.  We sent a

You are probably aware that Enron has gone unconditional on its offer to buy 
MG, a metal company here in London.
The objective is to integrate with them ASAP and as smoothly as possible.

I made a visit with MG today and talked to their FX trader who said that he 
trades with the following banks:
CIBC
Deutche Bank
Commerz Bank
Metall Bank

Can you please tell me what lines we have in place with these, if any at all.


Sara
Do we have isdas etc in place?


Most of the trades are spot or 3mth forward, but some trades are up to four 
years out.

Hi Sara, I have updated the file attached.  I ran a report of all financial 
power trades done in 2000 and included all counterparties we have traded with 
in 2000 on this list.  I bolded the counterparties that we are having confirm 
issues with.  All of the counterparty names appear on this list as they do in 
Enpower.



Thanks,

Sara and Paul,

I have received a request for a quote from Inforsa CI, and Chilean company.  
They appear to have an excellent balance sheet, but I don't know if we are 
set up to trade with Chilean companies.  Paul, the company's information is 
available on Bloomberg if you type in INFORSA CI and hit the equity key.  We 
are just starting discussions with them, but I wanted to make sure to give 
you both advance notice.  Please let me know if there is any additional 
information that you need from me.

It looks like it will be at least a month before Singapore Press Holdings 
will be ready to do business.  I'll keep you informed as our talks progress.

Thanks,

Jay

Sara, Ted,
CSFB has a new electronic access trading system for futures. 
Financial Trading, Enron North America, wants to establish a relationship to 
support this trading.  

To Trade Electronically, ENA will need a Standard Execution Agreement 
(Executing Broker) and a ""Prime Trade"" Agreement which supports the 
electronic trading.  
Financial Trading is still assessing whether we need a Give-up agreement with 
CSFB or will utilitze our current relationships with Carr and Prudential to 
hold the positions.  I have confirmed with Bob Klein that noone at Enron 
currently trades futures with CSFB.  
Trading will include Futures including, S&P, Nasdaq, Fixed Income (bonds, 
eurodollars) and Forex.

Sheila

Sara:

As promised, attached please find the revised Market Disruption and 
Correction to Published Prices provisions to be incorporated into all 
physical power transactions (including new master agreements and 
confirmations for transactions under existing masters).  As we have 
discussed, these provisions deviate from the terms of the financial power 
transactions in that market disruption has been revised to eliminate the 
concept of caps and changes in the commodity and the corrections provision 
has been modified to eliminate the 30-day limitation.  It is our intention 
that financial power transactions should be modified (e.g., future 
confirmations and new masters) to incorporate these changes for financial 
power transactions as well.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks,

Leslie

Sara,
Is there a Guarantee in place by Enron Corp. for ECT Investments, Inc. 
relating to our prime broker agreements with Goldman Sachs?  
We are talking to Goldman currently about increasing our leverage and a 
guarantee may be beneficial if one does not already exist.  We are unsure if 
one already exists.
Thanks,

Subject: De-brief of J. Kinneman's London week

Jeff, Bryan,
Laurel, Theresa and I met with Jeff yesterday as a follow-up to his week in 
London.  

The following discussions/items came out of our discussion:  This is meant to 
be a DISCUSSION list to move things forward as quickly as possible.

FOR ENRON CREDIT.COM ACTIVITY 
Enron Credit.com will be trading utilizing the legal entity of Enron North 
America for 3rd partiy transactions.
 We need a listing of authorized traders for both Enron Credit.com (uk legal 
entity) and ENA (us legal entity)
The listing gets signed off by Risk Controls and Legal. The authorized list 
is then distributed to brokers.   I will facilitate the process for the ENA 
side to get included.
 The inclusion of instruments is appropriate.

Confirmation Process for ENA:
 Laurel Adams will work with London to set up a checklist of the information, 
review and related documentation required for ENA confirmations.
Laurel will receive and file on behalf of ENA.  Otherwise all work and review 
will occur in London for these Enron Credit.com trades which utilitze
  ENA as the entity.
Timeliness of confirmations:  ENA policy is 24 hr turnaround and 3-4 days for 
more ad-hoc confirms.  

Settlements for Bonds transacted for Enron Credit.com:
 Houston will settle bond activity.  
 All Risk Managment reporting and Accounting will be the responsibility of 
Enron Credit.com.  

Accounting
 Enron Credit.com will provide to ENA, Financial Operations,  the necessary 
entries for General Ledger booking

Funding
 For the ENA account at the Prime Broker, we will obtain Funding from 
Corporate.  The charges for the funding, 6.5%, will be passed to the ENA 
 General Ledger account for Enron Credit.com's ENA activity.  I will talk to 
Financial Operations to facilitate.

Prime Broker Account
We can use an existing ENA account for ENA activity. 
We will request Sara to work with Paul Simons to get a Morgan Stanley prime 
broker account opened in the name of Enron Credit.com for trading done in 
Enron Credit.com's name. Funding will be provided by Enron Credit.com.

FOR  PROPRIETARY DEBT TRADING FROM HOUSTON (in ECT Investments or ENA legal 
entity)

Operations and Acounting
Houston Energy Operations to maintain operations for Debt and Convertible 
Books. Trading may open up another book for Enron Credit. com related 
activity executed in Houston.
 
Reporting 
 Daily P&L being provided to Enron Europe by 10:00 am (CST) for J. Sherriff 
reporting
 Daily P&L, final, sent to Enron Europe and Risk Controls and Reporting 
(Houston)  by 12:00 (CST)

Thanks. Sheila

Sara,
Is there a Guarantee in place by Enron Corp. for ECT Investments, Inc. 
relating to our prime broker agreements with Goldman Sachs?  
We are talking to Goldman currently about increasing our leverage and a 
guarantee may be beneficial if one does not already exist.  We are unsure if 
one already exists.
Thanks,

Sara,


As way of background, Carol has been working on an ISDA with PCES.  I had 
advised our PCES contact that I was unable to attend to this before my 
departure.  As you know,  PCES is a ""Top Ten"", therefore, you may want to 
pass this message onto to someone to handle.

FYI:  Our PCES contact is out of the office until August 2nd, but you may 
want to tackle anyway.

The PCES file can be found in the file drawers for ""green files"".  

Thanks.

Susan, 

We are definitely getting closer to bringing this ISDA agreement to a close. 
I reviewed with the Calgary office the latest draft you e-mailed; listed 
below are the remaining questions: Part 1 of the Schedule; subitem (k) with 
reference to romanette (ix) - the term ""Performance Assurance"" should be 
changed to ""Eligible Credit Assurance"" (same as in subitem (f) of Part 1). 

Part 4 of the Schedule; subitem (h) Governing Law - question was asked about 
Texas being the choice of law as opposed to New York. Our understanding is 
that the ISDA was structured under the guidance of New York law and request 
that Governing Law be changed to New York. 

Paragraph 13(c)(iv), Notification Time - request that the time be changed to 
1:00 p.m. 

Paragraph 13 - the remaining issues (listed below) will be discussed by Mr. 
Harry Wijsman in Calgary's Credit Department with Mr. Bill Bradford. These 
same issues were discussed during the ISDA negotiations with PanCanadian 
Petroleum and Enron's Canada office. The items are: 

Paragraph 13(b)(iv)(C) - Minimum Transfer Amount
Paragraph 13(g)(ii)(2) - Use of Posted Collateral
Paragraph 13(m)(i) - Material Adverse Change
Irrevocable Transfer Letter of Credit: transferability and automatic 
extension language.

Your assistance over this time period of negotiating has been appreciated 
very much. FYI: I will be leaving for vacation on Thursday, July 20 and back 
in the office on Wednesday, August 2. If you have any questions, please 
contact me at 713-331-5049. 

Best regards, 
Rick

We have exchanged calls.  Do you know if any credit function has been 
involved in this transaction?  Perhaps there was an underwriter involved?  It 
may take some time to educate myself on the transaction.

Jeff, I am sending you the specific information of the indexes and products 
that we believe our customers would be trading on EOL.....Please take a look 
at the file attached, and the page with Index Definitions, for the 
information you are looking for. The trades will be performed based on 
indexes taht already exist in OEL, so no new Mexican Indices will be 
included.   Please note however, that the mexican gas is priced in Mexico on 
the basis of the Tetco/Valero basket. So, most probably, that same basket 
will be included in the system to accomodate to our customer's needs. 
Please note that Carol St Clair will be helping us on the legal aspects of 
including Mexico into the EOL system.
Thanks and regards.

Aqui te mando el archivo de la lista de clientes EOL, en el mismo archivo ya 
esta la descripci?n de cada uno de los productos. Son tres los productos que 
no estan en EOL: el promedio Tetco y PG&E; el poliestireno y el PET. 

Por otro lado para el polietileno esta la descripci?n para el LLDPE.

Si se requiere alg?n cambio solo avisame.

Trading with certain type of metals is regulated. Let us confirm that.

One possibility would be to incorporate TradeCo first the way that we have
recommended, and then amend the corporate purpose once we have ascertained
which metals could be traded without being subject to governmental
concession.

Rogelio, the new corporate purpose looks very good to me...However, as you
know, Enron has recently acquired the largest metals trader in the world
(MG), and as of next september we will be able to trade metals on the
London exchange...I want the new corporate purpose to include ""metals"" in
its definitiion....

Peggy, let us know if this is O.K. with you so we can proceed....

Please see the attached credit terms to be included within a confirmation for 
this customer.  An existing Master Agreement was executed with ENA, but the 
customer has MAC'd.  In order to get a deal approved by credit, the customer 
has agreed to provide a $3.95MM LC upfront, to secure any potental credit 
risk associated with a possible termination event.

Jeff - per our conversation today, I have attached a basic equity forward
confirm (note that this is our generic form and will be modified to suit
the contract that we enter into) .  I have also attached a document
discussing a proprietary way that we have developed to enter into tax
deductible forwards.  I look forward to working with you further with
regard to this transaction

Lee,

Vitol's attorney has been in contact with Sara Shackleton of our Houston 
legal team regarding the updating of our old Master Agreement into an ISDA.  
However, our old agreement contains no MAC clauses.  Further, I note from 
your CAS analysis that the most recent financial statements you had available 
were year end 1998.  Did we request more current data from Vitol?  Did Vitol 
decline this request?  

We have a teleconference scheduled with their attorney at 10am Houston time 
tomorrow (Tuesday).  If you can shoot me a response to these questions before 
then, I would appreciate it.  If not, please get back to me at your earliest 
convenience.

Thanks,
Paul"

Jason,

Thank you for the revised draft and for the amendments you made.  As we
discussed in our last conversation, I needed to more fully review the issue
of letters of credit being posted as Eligible Credit Support.  I have done
so and had some additional comments as a result.  In addition, there were
some other items that I asked to be amended that weren't addressed.  I
thought it would be easier for me to just blackline your draft rather then
sending you a list of comments (see attached).  Perhaps we can use this
draft as a basis for a discussion of the remaining open items.

I will be leaving for vacation on Wednesday afternoon.  If you've had a
chance to prepare, we can talk before then.  If not, then we can pick this
up after I return on August 7th.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

Suanne

sorry i did not get a chance to revert back to you earlier.  was out in new

however, could you confirm with everyone that you have NO OTHER deals other

capability for this work at the moment.  Sara

Please review the attached sample swap confirmation.

He will be passing this sample swap confirmation out to many potential

Jason,

I received a response from my tax department and they seem to think that it
might be best to have a conversation with your tax people to better explain
how DLJIC is treated as a US partnership for tax purposes.  It is our belief
that the new regulations becoming effective on 1/1/01 will be helpful
because they will treat DLJIC as a US person.  Please let me know if you
think a conference call will work for you.  Perhaps we can schedule that
when I return from vacation.

Regards,
Suanne

We have received a notice dated 7/10/00 from Merrill Lynch International Bank 
that it intends to transfer their FX business to Merrill Lynch International 
Bank Ltd., a United Kingdom incorporated bank regulated by the SFA,  
effective as of the fourth quarter of 2000.  We do have an ISDA Master 
Agreement in place with Merrill Lynch International Bank.

I am sending a copy of the notice to Gary Hickerson & Tanya Rohauer (I am 
also sending Tanya the financials of the new entity).  We will await Credit's 
instructions as to how they would like to proceed after reviewing the 
documentation.

I've spoken with Morgan Stanley this afternoon to get details on progress 
with the ISDA for credit trading.

In brief, they have our ISDA documents and are in the process of reviewing 
them.  They also informed me that Enron North America was in the process of 
negotiating ISDA documents with the same MS entity.  They are going to 
provide consolidated comments to myself and Sara Shackleton in Houston during 
the course of tomorrow.

I'll liaise with Sara to ensure that this gets pushed along at top speed from 
the Enron end.

Thanks, Edmund

ISSUE

For a number of business reasons, a company may enter into contracts that are 
indexed to, and sometimes settled in, its own stock. Examples of these
contracts include written put options, written call options (and warrants), 
purchased put options, purchased call options, forward sale contracts, and 
forward
purchase contracts. These contracts may be settled using a variety of 
settlement methods, or the issuing company or counterparty may have a choice 
of
settlement methods. The settlement methods are:

     Physical settlement - the party designated in the contract as the buyer 
delivers the full stated amount of cash to the seller, and the seller 
delivers the full
     stated number of shares to the buyer.

     Net share settlement - the party with a loss delivers to the party with 
a gain shares with a current fair value equal to the gain.

     Net cash settlement - the party with a loss delivers to the party with a 
gain a cash payment equal to the gain, and no shares are exchanged.

The contracts described above may be either freestanding or embedded in 
another financial instrument. A freestanding contract is entered into 
separate and
apart from any of the company's other financial instruments or equity 
transactions, or it is entered into in conjunction with some other 
transaction and is legally
detachable and separately exercisable.

This Issue applies only to freestanding derivative financial instruments (for 
example, forward contracts, options, and warrants). This Issue does not apply 
to
security price guarantees or other financial instruments indexed to, or 
otherwise based on, the price of the issuer's stock that are issued in 
connection with a
purchase business combination [Note See STATUS section.], nor does it address 
the accounting for either the derivative component or the financial instrument
when the derivative component is embedded in and not detachable from the 
financial instrument. This Issue does not address the accounting for 
contracts that
are issued to compensation employees or to acquire goods or services from 
nonemployees.

The issue is how freestanding contracts that are indexed to, and potentially 
settled in, a company's own stock should be classified and measured.

EITF DISCUSSION

A. Framework for Accounting

The Task Force discussed the accounting for freestanding contracts that are 
indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own stock and reached 
several
consensuses, as described below. The consensuses in this Issue are to be 
applied to all freestanding derivative financial instruments that are indexed 
to, and
potentially settled in, a company's own stock; however, nonpublic companies 
may continue to apply the consensus in Issue No. 88-9, ""Put Warrants ,"" to the
instruments covered by that Issue. Hereinafter, the framework for accounting 
that is established in this Issue is referred to as the ""Model.""

(1) Initial balance sheet classification

The initial balance sheet classification generally is based on the concept 
that contracts that require net cash settlement are assets or liabilities and 
contracts that
require settlement in shares are equity instruments. If the contract provides 
the company with a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares, the 
Model
assumes settlement in shares; if the contract provides the counterparty with 
a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares, the Model assumes 
net cash
settlement. However, this Model is not applicable when settlement 
alternatives do not have the same economic value attached to them or when one 
of the
settlement alternatives is fixed or contains caps or floors. In those 
situations, the accounting for the instrument (or combination of instruments) 
should be based
on the economic substance of the transaction.1

          1 For example, if a freestanding contract, issued together with 
another instrument, requires that the issuer provide to the holder a fixed or
          guaranteed return such that the instruments are, insubstance, debt, 
the issuer should account for both instruments as liabilities, regardless of 
the
          settlement terms of the freestanding contract.

Accordingly, unless the economic substance indicates otherwise, contracts 
would be initially classified as equity, or as assets or liabilities, in the 
following
situations:

Equity instruments

     Contracts that require physical settlement or net share settlement

     Contracts that give the company a choice of net cash settlement or 
settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net share settlement).

Assets or liabilities

     Contracts that require net cash settlement

     Contracts that give the counterparty a choice of net cash settlement or 
settlement in shares (physical settlement or net share settlement).

(2) Initial measurement, and subsequent balance sheet classification and 
measurement

The Model requires that all instruments be initially measured at fair value 
and subsequently accounted for based on the initial classification and the 
assumed or
required settlement method in (1) above.2 Contracts that are initially 
classified as equity are accounted for in permanent equity. If physical 
settlement was
assumed or required and the company is obligated to deliver cash as part of 
the physical settlement,3 then public companies should refer to ASR 268, which
provides guidance by analogy for those transactions, and account for the 
transactions as provided below under ""Equity instruments - temporary equity.""

          2 For contracts that are classified as equity instruments that 
provide the company with a choice between either net share settlement or 
physical
          settlement that may require that the company deliver cash, net 
share settlement should be assumed. For contracts that are classified as 
equity
          instruments that provide the counterparty with a choice of either 
net share settlement or physical settlement that may require that the company
          deliver cash, physical settlement should be assumed.

          3 For example, if the company sells put options indexed to its own 
stock that enable the holder to sell shares back to the company at the strike
          price.

Equity instruments - permanent equity

     Contracts that require that the company deliver shares as part of a 
physical settlement or a net share settlement should be initially measured at 
fair value
     and reported in permanent equity. Subsequent changes in fair value 
should not be recognized.

     Contracts that give the company a choice of (a) net cash settlement or 
settlement in shares (including net share settlement, or physical settlement 
that
     requires that the company deliver shares) or (b) either net share 
settlement or physical settlement that requires that the company deliver cash 
should be
     initially measured at fair value and reported in permanent equity. 
Subsequent changes in fair value should not be recognized. If such contracts 
are
     ultimately settled in a manner that requires that the company deliver 
cash, the amount of cash paid or received should be reported as a reduction 
of, or
     an addition to, contributed capital.

Equity instruments - temporary equity4

          4 Classification and measurement in temporary equity is required 
for public companies. ASR 268 provides guidance by analogy for transactions
          classified as temporary equity.

     Contracts that (a) require that the company deliver cash as part of a 
physical settlement, (b) give the company a choice of either net cash 
settlement or
     physical settlement that requires that the company deliver cash, or (c) 
give the counterparty a choice of either net share settlement or physical 
settlement
     that requires that the company deliver cash should be initially measured 
at fair value and reported in permanent equity, and an amount equal to the 
cash
     redemption amount under the physical settlement should be transferred to 
temporary equity.

Assets or liabilities

     Contracts that are initially classified as assets or liabilities should 
be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
and disclosed
     in the financial statements. If contracts initially classified as assets 
or liabilities are ultimately settled in shares, any gains or losses on those 
contracts
     should continue to be included in earnings.

B. Hedging

The SEC Observer stated that the SEC staff has consistently held the position 
that hedge accounting is not permitted for transactions involving the 
contracts
within the scope of this Issue because those transactions have not met all 
the criteria of Statement 80. The SEC staff also believes that hedge 
accounting for
transactions involving those contracts is inconsistent with paragraph 28 of 
Opinion 9.

Because of the SEC staff's position, the Task Force decided to end its 
discussion of whether the contracts described above can qualify for hedge 
accounting.

C. Application of the Model to Specific Instruments

The following reflects several Task Force consensuses with respect to the 
application of the Model, described in Section A of this Issue, to certain 
freestanding
derivative financial instruments that are indexed to, and potentially settled 
in, a company's own stock.

(1) Written put options5 and forward purchase contracts

          5 Includes shareholder rights (SHARP rights) issued by the company 
to shareholders that give the shareholders the right to put a specified number
          of common shares to the company for cash.

Description

The company (the buyer) agrees to buy from the seller shares at a specified 
price at some future date. The contract may be settled by physical 
settlement, net
share settlement, or net cash settlement, or the issuing company or the 
counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods.6

          6 Application of the Model to purchased call options is discussed 
in C(3).

Consensus

The Model would be applied as follows:
                                                One Settlement Method

                                                                 Physical (a)
                                                                              
        Net Share

amount reported in temporary equity should be transferred and reported as an 
addition to
permanent equity.

capital.

(d) If the contracts are ultimately settled in shares, any gains or losses on

(3) Purchased call options

Description

The company (the buyer) purchases call options that provide it with the 
right, but not the obligation, to buy from the seller, shares of the 
company's stock at a
specified price. If the options are exercised, the contract may be settled by 
physical settlement, net share settlement, or net cash settlement, or the 
issuing
company or the counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods.

Consensus

The company should follow the table included in (2) above in accounting for 
the call options.

(4) Detachable stock purchase warrants

Description

An enterprise issues senior subordinated notes with a detachable warrant that 
gives the holder both the right to purchase 6,250 shares of the enterprise's 
stock
for $75 per share and the right (that is, a put) to require that the 
enterprise repurchase all or any portion of the warrant for at least $2,010 
per share at a date
several months after the maturity of the notes in about 7 years.

Consensus

The proceeds should be allocated between the debt liability and the warrant 
and the resulting discount should be amortized in accordance with Opinion 21.
The warrants should be considered, in substance, debt and accounted for as a 
liability because the settlement alternatives for the warrants do not have the
same economic value attached to them and they provide the holder with a 
guaranteed return in cash that is significantly in excess of the value of the 
share
settlement alternative on the issuance date.

(5) Put warrants

Description

Put warrants are instruments with characteristics of both warrants and put 
options. The holder of the instrument is entitled to exercise (a) the warrant 
feature to
acquire the common stock of the issuer at a specified price, (b) the put 
option feature to put the instrument back to the issuer for a cash payment, 
or in some
cases, (c) both the warrant feature to acquire the common stock and the put 
option feature to put that stock back to the issuer for a cash payment. Put
warrants are frequently issued concurrently with debt securities of the 
issuer, are detachable from the debt, and may be exercisable only under 
specified
conditions. The put feature of the instrument may expire under varying 
circumstances, for example, with the passage of time or if the issuer has a 
public stock
offering. Under Opinion 14, a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of 
debt with detachable warrants must be allocated to those warrants.

Consensus

Because the contract gives the counterparty the choice of cash settlement or 
settlement in shares, public companies should report the proceeds from the
issuance of put warrants as liabilities and subsequently measure the put 
warrants at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. 
Nonpublic
companies may continue to classify and measure the put warrants in accordance 
with the consensus in Issue 88-9.

D. Earnings per Share

The Task Force reached the following consensus on how written put options 
affect the earnings-per-share calculation:

If the written put options are ""in the money"" during the period being 
reported on, the potential dilutive effect on earnings per share should be 
computed using
the reverse treasury stock method. Under that method, the incremental number 
of shares is computed as (a) the number of shares that would need to be issued
for cash at the then current market price to obtain cash to satisfy the put 
obligation less (b) the number of shares received from satisfying the puts.

The Task Force discussed whether it should comprehensively address issues 
relating to earnings per share in this Issue. The Task Force agreed that the 
FASB
should address the issues relating to earnings per share as part of its 
project on earnings per share. [Note: See STATUS section.]

STATUS

In February 1997, the FASB issued Statement 128, which supersedes Opinion 15. 
Statement 128 is effective for financial statements for both interim and
annual periods ending after December 15, 1997, and earlier application is not 
permitted.

Statement 128 affirms the consensus reached by the Task Force on how written 
put options affect the earnings per share calculation. That is, in computing
diluted EPS, Statement 128 requires use of the reverse treasury stock method 
to account for the dilutive effect of written put options and similar 
contracts that
are ""in the money"" during the reporting period. Statement 128 states that 
purchased options should not be reflected in the computation of diluted EPS 
because
to do so would be antidilutive. At the July 23 and November 18-19, 1998 
meetings, an FASB staff representative made an announcement (Topic No. D-72,
""Effects of Contracts That May Be Settled in Stock or Cash on the Computation 
of Diluted Earnings per Share "") that for those contracts that provide the
company with a choice of settlement methods, the company shall assume that 
the contract will be settled in shares. That presumption may be overcome if 
past
experience or a stated policy provides a reasonable basis to believe that it 
is probable that the contract will be paid partially or wholly in cash. For 
contracts in
which the counterparty controls the means of settlement, past experience or a 
stated policy is not determinative. Accordingly, in those situations, the more
dilutive of cash or share settlement should be used.

At the July 23-24, 1997 meeting, the Task Force addressed the accounting for 
contingent consideration issued to effect a purchase business combination in
Issue No. 97-8. ""Accounting for Contingent Consideration Issued in a Purchase 
Business Combination ."" The Task force observed that Issue 96-13 should
be applied to freestanding contracts that are indexed to, and potentially 
settled in, a company's own stock if those instruments meet the criteria in 
Issue 97-8
for recording as part of the cost of the business acquired in a purchase 
business combination.

A related issue has been discussed in Issue No. 98-12, ""The Application of 
Issue No. 96-13 to Forward Equity Sales Transactions ."" That Issue deals with
the accounting and earnings per share treatment of situations in which a 
freestanding derivative instrument (a forward contract) that is indexed to, 
and
potentially settled in, a company's own stock is issued concurrent with the 
issuance of shares of the company's stock. This Issue is limited to 
situations in which
the party to whom the common stock was sold is also the counterparty to the 
forward contract.

Another related issue has been discussed in Issue No. 99-1, ""Accounting for 
Debt Convertible into the Stock of a Consolidated Subsidiary ."" That Issue
deals with the accounting in the consolidated financial statements for debt 
issued by a consolidated subsidiary or a parent company that is convertible 
into the
stock of a consolidated subsidiary. As part of the discussion of Issue 99-1, 
Task Force members agreed to consider further whether to clarify this Issue by
indicating that equity shares of any entity under the control of the 
consolidated entity are considered ""a company's own stock.""

A related issue was discussed at the May 19-20, 1999 meeting in Issue No. 
99-3, ""Application of Issue No. 96-13 to Derivative Instruments with Multiple
Settlement Alternatives ."" That Issue deals with how certain derivative 
contracts indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own stock that 
contain
multiple settlement alternatives should be accounted for.

The Task Force discussed another related issue in Issue No. 99-7, ""Accounting 
for an Accelerated Share Repurchase Program ."" That Issue addressed the
accounting for, and pooling-of-interests implications of, purchasing treasury 
stock and simultaneously entering into a forward contract indexed to the
company's own shares.

At the March 16, 2000 meeting, the Task Force discussed a related issue in 
Issue No. 00-6, ""Accounting for Freestanding Derivative Financial Instruments
Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, the Stock of a Consolidated 
Subsidiary ."" That Issue addresses how freestanding derivative instruments 
entered into
by a parent company that are indexed to, and potentially settled in, the 
stock of a consolidated subsidiary should be classified and measured in the
consolidated financial statements.

Another related issue was discussed at the March 16, 2000 meeting in Issue 
No. 00-7, ""Application of Issue No. 96-13 to Equity Derivative Instruments 
That
Contain Certain Provisions That Require Net Cash Settlement If Certain Events 
outside the Control of the Issuer Occur ."" That Issue deals with how certain
derivative contracts indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own 
stock that require a cash payment by the issuer upon the occurrence of future
events outside the control of the issuer should be accounted for.

No further EITF discussion is planned."

EITF Action on Derivatives on a Company's Own Shares

July 21, 2000

At its July 19, 2000 meeting, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)=20
tentatively resolved how certain settlement features affect accounting for=
=20
equity derivative contracts entered into by a company on its own stock.=20
Specifically, the EITF sketched out a model governing how such features=20
affect whether the contract should be treated as (a) an equity instrument a=
nd=20
reported in stockholders=01, equity or (b) an asset or liability at fair va=
lue=20
with changes in fair value reported currently in earnings.

EITF Issue No. 00-19, ""Determination of Whether Share Settlement is Within=
=20
the Control of the Issuer for Purposes of Applying Issue No. 96-13 ,"" was=
=20
taken up to address implementation of the EITF's March 16, 2000, consensus =
on=20
EITF Issue No. 00-7, ""Application of EITF Issue No. 96-13 to Equity=20
Derivative Transactions That Contain Certain Provisions That Require Cash=
=20
Settlement If Certain Events Occur ."" The final consensus in Issue 00-7=20
generally stated that equity derivative contracts that contained provisions=
=20
that implicitly or explicitly required net cash settlement outside of the=
=20
control of the company must be treated as assets and liabilities and carrie=
d=20
at fair value rather than equity instruments carried at original cost and=
=20
reported as part of permanent equity as provided for in EITF Issue No. 96-1=
3,=20
""Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentiall=
y=20
Settled in, a Company's Own Stock .""

The Task Force also tentatively provided an extended transition period for=
=20
existing contracts and contracts entered into before a final consensus is=
=20
reached. The goal is to reach a final consensus at the September 2000 EITF=
=20
meeting.

The Model=20

The model=01,s governing concept is that, for a contract to be accounted as=
=20
permanent equity, the contract's provisions should put the company=01,s=20
counterparty in no better position than the company=01,s common shareholder=
s.=20
Specifically, the EITF tentatively concluded that contracts in a company=01=
,s=20
own stock, such as written puts or forward purchase contracts, that come=20
under the scope of Issue 96-13 and have net share settlement provisions tha=
t=20
keep a contract from being classified as an asset or liability must have th=
e=20
following characteristics =01* otherwise the contract must be treated as an=
=20
asset or liability at fair value with changes in fair value reported=20
currently in earnings.

The contract must permit the company to settle net in shares, at its option=
,=20
in either registered or unregistered shares. (It was determined that the=20
ability to deliver registered shares was outside of the control of a compan=
y.)
The contract must contain an explicit cap on the number of shares to be=20
delivered in a net share settlement. This cap must exist even if the contra=
ct=20
terminates when the stock price reaches a stated price trigger. (The need f=
or=20
a cap was determined to be critical in determining whether a company had=20
sufficient authorized and unissued shares to settle the contract.)
At contract inception and on an ongoing basis, the company must have=20
sufficient authorized but unissued shares available to settle the contract=
=20
considering all other claims on authorized shares for stock options,=20
convertibles, and other transactions that may require the issuance of stock=
.=20
(This requirement was deemed critical as the ability to have a request for=
=20
additional authorized shares approved by the shareholders was deemed outsid=
e=20
of the control of the company. In this context, ""the company"" is defined as=
=20
the company's management rather than its management and shareholders.)
There is no requirement in the contract to post collateral at any point in=
=20
the contract or for any reason.
There are no required cash payments to the counterparty (true-ups) if the n=
et=20
shares initially delivered are insufficient to provide the counterparty wit=
h=20
full satisfaction of the amount due. However, true-ups may be included in t=
he=20
contract if the company only, not the counterparty, can choose whether to=
=20
satisfy the true-up in shares or cash and the true-up is subject to the=20
explicit cap discussed in item 2.
There is no economic penalty in the contract for net share settlement that=
=20
would economically compel the company to settle in net cash. (The right to=
=20
increase the number of shares delivered based on the fair value differentia=
l=20
between registered shares and unregistered shares was not deemed to be a=20
penalty.)
There are no provisions in the contract that would indicate the counterpart=
y=20
had creditor rights, or would otherwise contravene the objective of this=20
model that the counterparty=01,s rights would rank no higher than those of =
a=20
common shareholder. (Subject to future EITF discussions, it may be possible=
=20
to meet this criterion by having a legal letter addressing the issue or a=
=20
specific statement of this concept in the contract.)

Related Issues

There was also discussion of the provisions relating to termination and=20
settlement in the event of a merger or change in control. There was general=
=20
support for a position that, as long as the counterparty received the same=
=20
choice of compensation as other shareholders (for example, stock for stock,=
=20
stock and cash for stock, cash for stock), the fact that the counterparty=
=20
might receive cash in such circumstances would not preclude equity treatmen=
t=20
for the contract.

Similarly, in the event of nationalization or liquidation, a net cash=20
settlement of the same type afforded a common shareholder would not preclud=
e=20
equity treatment for the contract.

In addition, counterparty rights that did not exceed rights of common=20
shareholders should be acceptable, for example, rights to sue for damages i=
n=20
the event of misrepresentations or a breach of warrranties or if a company=
=20
simply refused to perform under the contract, as long as a common sharehold=
er=20
would also have those rights.

With respect to events that would cause a contract that was compliant with=
=20
the model at inception to later become noncompliant (for example, because a=
n=20
acquisition consumed enough authorized shares that otherwise were needed to=
=20
satisfy the contract), the EITF concluded that, at the time the contract is=
=20
no longer compliant, the fair value of the contract should be transferred=
=20
from equity to an asset or liability at fair value with prospective changes=
=20
in fair value reported currently in earnings. There would be no immediate=
=20
earnings effect at the time of this transfer.

Further, if, at a later date, sufficient shares were authorized to again=20
satisfy the contract, the carrying amount of the contract (that is, its fai=
r=20
value) would be transferred back to equity and the contract treated as equi=
ty=20
prospectively to the extent the contract continues to comply with the model=
.=20
(The company would not be permitted to reverse the gains and losses in fair=
=20
value recognized in earnings during the period the contract was treated as =
an=20
asset or liability.)

Transition

The EITF tentatively concluded that all contracts entered into after the da=
te=20
of a final consensus will have to comply with the model at contract incepti=
on=20
to achieve equity treatment. (The goal is to reach a final consensus at the=
=20
September 2000 EITF meeting.) For contracts entered into before the date of=
 a=20
final consensus, a company will have until June 30, 2001, to modify the=20
contract to comply with the final consensus.

For example, if a company entered into a contract before the date of the=20
final consensus, the company will have until June 30, 2001, to obtain any=
=20
shareholder authorization of shares needed to satisfy the criteria or to=20
modify their contract for the other criteria or any EITF changes to the=20
tentative model.

Since a variety of viewpoints are discussed at Emerging Issues Task Force=
=20
(EITF) meetings and it is often difficult to characterize the conclusions,=
=20
the following minutes may differ in some respects from the final minutes=20
available from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).

Jim -
Have we received the signed version from them?  Do we need to sign it as 
well?  Where does this deal stand?  I haven't seen/heard anything since we 
last spoke with CSFB.  Have you seen a confirmation for the amendment to a 
swap?  Please let me know.

Clint--the term sheet below is the 'final'.  It has received all approvals 
necessary at CSFBi.  They are going to send us the signed version on Monday 
(the delay simply because it will come from London), but it is all done and 
we can count on it as a final deal.

ISSUE

For a number of business reasons, a company may enter into contracts that are 
indexed to, and sometimes settled in, its own stock. Examples of these
contracts include written put options, written call options (and warrants), 
purchased put options, purchased call options, forward sale contracts, and 
forward
purchase contracts. These contracts may be settled using a variety of 
settlement methods, or the issuing company or counterparty may have a choice 
of
settlement methods. The settlement methods are:

     Physical settlement - the party designated in the contract as the buyer 
delivers the full stated amount of cash to the seller, and the seller 
delivers the full
     stated number of shares to the buyer.

     Net share settlement - the party with a loss delivers to the party with 
a gain shares with a current fair value equal to the gain.

     Net cash settlement - the party with a loss delivers to the party with a 
gain a cash payment equal to the gain, and no shares are exchanged.

The contracts described above may be either freestanding or embedded in 
another financial instrument. A freestanding contract is entered into 
separate and
apart from any of the company's other financial instruments or equity 
transactions, or it is entered into in conjunction with some other 
transaction and is legally
detachable and separately exercisable.

This Issue applies only to freestanding derivative financial instruments (for 
example, forward contracts, options, and warrants). This Issue does not apply 
to
security price guarantees or other financial instruments indexed to, or 
otherwise based on, the price of the issuer's stock that are issued in 
connection with a
purchase business combination [Note See STATUS section.], nor does it address 
the accounting for either the derivative component or the financial instrument
when the derivative component is embedded in and not detachable from the 
financial instrument. This Issue does not address the accounting for 
contracts that
are issued to compensation employees or to acquire goods or services from 
nonemployees.

The issue is how freestanding contracts that are indexed to, and potentially 
settled in, a company's own stock should be classified and measured.

EITF DISCUSSION

A. Framework for Accounting

The Task Force discussed the accounting for freestanding contracts that are 
indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own stock and reached 
several
consensuses, as described below. The consensuses in this Issue are to be 
applied to all freestanding derivative financial instruments that are indexed 
to, and
potentially settled in, a company's own stock; however, nonpublic companies 
may continue to apply the consensus in Issue No. 88-9, ""Put Warrants ,"" to the
instruments covered by that Issue. Hereinafter, the framework for accounting 
that is established in this Issue is referred to as the ""Model.""

(1) Initial balance sheet classification

The initial balance sheet classification generally is based on the concept 
that contracts that require net cash settlement are assets or liabilities and 
contracts that
require settlement in shares are equity instruments. If the contract provides 
the company with a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares, the 
Model
assumes settlement in shares; if the contract provides the counterparty with 
a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares, the Model assumes 
net cash
settlement. However, this Model is not applicable when settlement 
alternatives do not have the same economic value attached to them or when one 
of the
settlement alternatives is fixed or contains caps or floors. In those 
situations, the accounting for the instrument (or combination of instruments) 
should be based
on the economic substance of the transaction.1

          1 For example, if a freestanding contract, issued together with 
another instrument, requires that the issuer provide to the holder a fixed or
          guaranteed return such that the instruments are, insubstance, debt, 
the issuer should account for both instruments as liabilities, regardless of 
the
          settlement terms of the freestanding contract.

Accordingly, unless the economic substance indicates otherwise, contracts 
would be initially classified as equity, or as assets or liabilities, in the 
following
situations:

Equity instruments

     Contracts that require physical settlement or net share settlement

     Contracts that give the company a choice of net cash settlement or 
settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net share settlement).

Assets or liabilities

     Contracts that require net cash settlement

     Contracts that give the counterparty a choice of net cash settlement or 
settlement in shares (physical settlement or net share settlement).

(2) Initial measurement, and subsequent balance sheet classification and 
measurement

The Model requires that all instruments be initially measured at fair value 
and subsequently accounted for based on the initial classification and the 
assumed or
required settlement method in (1) above.2 Contracts that are initially 
classified as equity are accounted for in permanent equity. If physical 
settlement was
assumed or required and the company is obligated to deliver cash as part of 
the physical settlement,3 then public companies should refer to ASR 268, which
provides guidance by analogy for those transactions, and account for the 
transactions as provided below under ""Equity instruments - temporary equity.""

          2 For contracts that are classified as equity instruments that 
provide the company with a choice between either net share settlement or 
physical
          settlement that may require that the company deliver cash, net 
share settlement should be assumed. For contracts that are classified as 
equity
          instruments that provide the counterparty with a choice of either 
net share settlement or physical settlement that may require that the company
          deliver cash, physical settlement should be assumed.

          3 For example, if the company sells put options indexed to its own 
stock that enable the holder to sell shares back to the company at the strike
          price.

Equity instruments - permanent equity

     Contracts that require that the company deliver shares as part of a 
physical settlement or a net share settlement should be initially measured at 
fair value
     and reported in permanent equity. Subsequent changes in fair value 
should not be recognized.

     Contracts that give the company a choice of (a) net cash settlement or 
settlement in shares (including net share settlement, or physical settlement 
that
     requires that the company deliver shares) or (b) either net share 
settlement or physical settlement that requires that the company deliver cash 
should be
     initially measured at fair value and reported in permanent equity. 
Subsequent changes in fair value should not be recognized. If such contracts 
are
     ultimately settled in a manner that requires that the company deliver 
cash, the amount of cash paid or received should be reported as a reduction 
of, or
     an addition to, contributed capital.

Equity instruments - temporary equity4

          4 Classification and measurement in temporary equity is required 
for public companies. ASR 268 provides guidance by analogy for transactions
          classified as temporary equity.

     Contracts that (a) require that the company deliver cash as part of a 
physical settlement, (b) give the company a choice of either net cash 
settlement or
     physical settlement that requires that the company deliver cash, or (c) 
give the counterparty a choice of either net share settlement or physical 
settlement
     that requires that the company deliver cash should be initially measured 
at fair value and reported in permanent equity, and an amount equal to the 
cash
     redemption amount under the physical settlement should be transferred to 
temporary equity.

Assets or liabilities

     Contracts that are initially classified as assets or liabilities should 
be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
and disclosed
     in the financial statements. If contracts initially classified as assets 
or liabilities are ultimately settled in shares, any gains or losses on those 
contracts
     should continue to be included in earnings.

B. Hedging

The SEC Observer stated that the SEC staff has consistently held the position 
that hedge accounting is not permitted for transactions involving the 
contracts
within the scope of this Issue because those transactions have not met all 
the criteria of Statement 80. The SEC staff also believes that hedge 
accounting for
transactions involving those contracts is inconsistent with paragraph 28 of 
Opinion 9.

Because of the SEC staff's position, the Task Force decided to end its 
discussion of whether the contracts described above can qualify for hedge 
accounting.

C. Application of the Model to Specific Instruments

The following reflects several Task Force consensuses with respect to the 
application of the Model, described in Section A of this Issue, to certain 
freestanding
derivative financial instruments that are indexed to, and potentially settled 
in, a company's own stock.

(1) Written put options5 and forward purchase contracts

          5 Includes shareholder rights (SHARP rights) issued by the company 
to shareholders that give the shareholders the right to put a specified number
          of common shares to the company for cash.

Description

The company (the buyer) agrees to buy from the seller shares at a specified 
price at some future date. The contract may be settled by physical 
settlement, net
share settlement, or net cash settlement, or the issuing company or the 
counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods.6

          6 Application of the Model to purchased call options is discussed 
in C(3).

Consensus

The Model would be applied as follows:
                                                One Settlement Method

                                                                 Physical (a)
                                                                              
        Net Share
                                                                              
                            Net Cash

may be
settled by physical settlement, net share settlement, or net cash settlement, 
or the issuing company or counterparty may have a choice of settlement 
methods.

(3) Purchased call options

Description

The company (the buyer) purchases call options that provide it with the 
right, but not the obligation, to buy from the seller, shares of the 
company's stock at a
specified price. If the options are exercised, the contract may be settled by 
physical settlement, net share settlement, or net cash settlement, or the 
issuing
company or the counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods.

Consensus

The company should follow the table included in (2) above in accounting for 
the call options.

(4) Detachable stock purchase warrants

Description

An enterprise issues senior subordinated notes with a detachable warrant that 
gives the holder both the right to purchase 6,250 shares of the enterprise's 
stock
for $75 per share and the right (that is, a put) to require that the 
enterprise repurchase all or any portion of the warrant for at least $2,010 
per share at a date
several months after the maturity of the notes in about 7 years.

Consensus

The proceeds should be allocated between the debt liability and the warrant 
and the resulting discount should be amortized in accordance with Opinion 21.
The warrants should be considered, in substance, debt and accounted for as a 
liability because the settlement alternatives for the warrants do not have the
same economic value attached to them and they provide the holder with a 
guaranteed return in cash that is significantly in excess of the value of the 
share
settlement alternative on the issuance date.

(5) Put warrants

Description

Put warrants are instruments with characteristics of both warrants and put 
options. The holder of the instrument is entitled to exercise (a) the warrant 
feature to
acquire the common stock of the issuer at a specified price, (b) the put 
option feature to put the instrument back to the issuer for a cash payment, 
or in some
cases, (c) both the warrant feature to acquire the common stock and the put 
option feature to put that stock back to the issuer for a cash payment. Put
warrants are frequently issued concurrently with debt securities of the 
issuer, are detachable from the debt, and may be exercisable only under 
specified
conditions. The put feature of the instrument may expire under varying 
circumstances, for example, with the passage of time or if the issuer has a 
public stock
offering. Under Opinion 14, a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of 
debt with detachable warrants must be allocated to those warrants.

Consensus

Because the contract gives the counterparty the choice of cash settlement or 
settlement in shares, public companies should report the proceeds from the
issuance of put warrants as liabilities and subsequently measure the put 
warrants at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. 
Nonpublic
companies may continue to classify and measure the put warrants in accordance 
with the consensus in Issue 88-9.

D. Earnings per Share

The Task Force reached the following consensus on how written put options 
affect the earnings-per-share calculation:

If the written put options are ""in the money"" during the period being 
reported on, the potential dilutive effect on earnings per share should be 
computed using
the reverse treasury stock method. Under that method, the incremental number 
of shares is computed as (a) the number of shares that would need to be issued
for cash at the then current market price to obtain cash to satisfy the put 
obligation less (b) the number of shares received from satisfying the puts.

The Task Force discussed whether it should comprehensively address issues 
relating to earnings per share in this Issue. The Task Force agreed that the 
FASB
should address the issues relating to earnings per share as part of its 
project on earnings per share. [Note: See STATUS section.]

STATUS

In February 1997, the FASB issued Statement 128, which supersedes Opinion 15. 
Statement 128 is effective for financial statements for both interim and
annual periods ending after December 15, 1997, and earlier application is not 
permitted.

Statement 128 affirms the consensus reached by the Task Force on how written 
put options affect the earnings per share calculation. That is, in computing
diluted EPS, Statement 128 requires use of the reverse treasury stock method 
to account for the dilutive effect of written put options and similar 
contracts that
are ""in the money"" during the reporting period. Statement 128 states that 
purchased options should not be reflected in the computation of diluted EPS 
because
to do so would be antidilutive. At the July 23 and November 18-19, 1998 
meetings, an FASB staff representative made an announcement (Topic No. D-72,
""Effects of Contracts That May Be Settled in Stock or Cash on the Computation 
of Diluted Earnings per Share "") that for those contracts that provide the
company with a choice of settlement methods, the company shall assume that 
the contract will be settled in shares. That presumption may be overcome if 
past
experience or a stated policy provides a reasonable basis to believe that it 
is probable that the contract will be paid partially or wholly in cash. For 
contracts in
which the counterparty controls the means of settlement, past experience or a 
stated policy is not determinative. Accordingly, in those situations, the more
dilutive of cash or share settlement should be used.

At the July 23-24, 1997 meeting, the Task Force addressed the accounting for 
contingent consideration issued to effect a purchase business combination in
Issue No. 97-8. ""Accounting for Contingent Consideration Issued in a Purchase 
Business Combination ."" The Task force observed that Issue 96-13 should
be applied to freestanding contracts that are indexed to, and potentially 
settled in, a company's own stock if those instruments meet the criteria in 
Issue 97-8
for recording as part of the cost of the business acquired in a purchase 
business combination.

A related issue has been discussed in Issue No. 98-12, ""The Application of 
Issue No. 96-13 to Forward Equity Sales Transactions ."" That Issue deals with
the accounting and earnings per share treatment of situations in which a 
freestanding derivative instrument (a forward contract) that is indexed to, 
and
potentially settled in, a company's own stock is issued concurrent with the 
issuance of shares of the company's stock. This Issue is limited to 
situations in which
the party to whom the common stock was sold is also the counterparty to the 
forward contract.

Another related issue has been discussed in Issue No. 99-1, ""Accounting for 
Debt Convertible into the Stock of a Consolidated Subsidiary ."" That Issue
deals with the accounting in the consolidated financial statements for debt 
issued by a consolidated subsidiary or a parent company that is convertible 
into the
stock of a consolidated subsidiary. As part of the discussion of Issue 99-1, 
Task Force members agreed to consider further whether to clarify this Issue by
indicating that equity shares of any entity under the control of the 
consolidated entity are considered ""a company's own stock.""

A related issue was discussed at the May 19-20, 1999 meeting in Issue No. 
99-3, ""Application of Issue No. 96-13 to Derivative Instruments with Multiple
Settlement Alternatives ."" That Issue deals with how certain derivative 
contracts indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own stock that 
contain
multiple settlement alternatives should be accounted for.

The Task Force discussed another related issue in Issue No. 99-7, ""Accounting 
for an Accelerated Share Repurchase Program ."" That Issue addressed the
accounting for, and pooling-of-interests implications of, purchasing treasury 
stock and simultaneously entering into a forward contract indexed to the
company's own shares.

At the March 16, 2000 meeting, the Task Force discussed a related issue in 
Issue No. 00-6, ""Accounting for Freestanding Derivative Financial Instruments
Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, the Stock of a Consolidated 
Subsidiary ."" That Issue addresses how freestanding derivative instruments 
entered into
by a parent company that are indexed to, and potentially settled in, the 
stock of a consolidated subsidiary should be classified and measured in the
consolidated financial statements.

Another related issue was discussed at the March 16, 2000 meeting in Issue 
No. 00-7, ""Application of Issue No. 96-13 to Equity Derivative Instruments 
That
Contain Certain Provisions That Require Net Cash Settlement If Certain Events 
outside the Control of the Issuer Occur ."" That Issue deals with how certain
derivative contracts indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own 
stock that require a cash payment by the issuer upon the occurrence of future
events outside the control of the issuer should be accounted for.

No further EITF discussion is planned."

EITF Action on Derivatives on a Company's Own Shares

July 21, 2000

At its July 19, 2000 meeting, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)=20
tentatively resolved how certain settlement features affect accounting for=
=20
equity derivative contracts entered into by a company on its own stock.=20
Specifically, the EITF sketched out a model governing how such features=20
affect whether the contract should be treated as (a) an equity instrument a=
nd=20
reported in stockholders=01, equity or (b) an asset or liability at fair va=
lue=20
with changes in fair value reported currently in earnings.

EITF Issue No. 00-19, ""Determination of Whether Share Settlement is Within=
=20
the Control of the Issuer for Purposes of Applying Issue No. 96-13 ,"" was=
=20
taken up to address implementation of the EITF's March 16, 2000, consensus =
on=20
EITF Issue No. 00-7, ""Application of EITF Issue No. 96-13 to Equity=20
Derivative Transactions That Contain Certain Provisions That Require Cash=
=20
Settlement If Certain Events Occur ."" The final consensus in Issue 00-7=20
generally stated that equity derivative contracts that contained provisions=
=20
that implicitly or explicitly required net cash settlement outside of the=
=20
control of the company must be treated as assets and liabilities and carrie=
d=20
at fair value rather than equity instruments carried at original cost and=
=20
reported as part of permanent equity as provided for in EITF Issue No. 96-1=
3,=20
""Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentiall=
y=20
Settled in, a Company's Own Stock .""

The Task Force also tentatively provided an extended transition period for=
=20
existing contracts and contracts entered into before a final consensus is=
=20
reached. The goal is to reach a final consensus at the September 2000 EITF=
=20
meeting.

The Model=20

The model=01,s governing concept is that, for a contract to be accounted as=
=20
permanent equity, the contract's provisions should put the company=01,s=20
counterparty in no better position than the company=01,s common shareholder=
s.=20
Specifically, the EITF tentatively concluded that contracts in a company=01=
,s=20
own stock, such as written puts or forward purchase contracts, that come=20
under the scope of Issue 96-13 and have net share settlement provisions tha=
t=20
keep a contract from being classified as an asset or liability must have th=
e=20
following characteristics =01* otherwise the contract must be treated as an=
=20
asset or liability at fair value with changes in fair value reported=20
currently in earnings.

The contract must permit the company to settle net in shares, at its option=
,=20
in either registered or unregistered shares. (It was determined that the=20
ability to deliver registered shares was outside of the control of a compan=
y.)
The contract must contain an explicit cap on the number of shares to be=20
delivered in a net share settlement. This cap must exist even if the contra=
ct=20
terminates when the stock price reaches a stated price trigger. (The need f=
or=20
a cap was determined to be critical in determining whether a company had=20
sufficient authorized and unissued shares to settle the contract.)
At contract inception and on an ongoing basis, the company must have=20
sufficient authorized but unissued shares available to settle the contract=
=20
considering all other claims on authorized shares for stock options,=20
convertibles, and other transactions that may require the issuance of stock=
.=20
(This requirement was deemed critical as the ability to have a request for=
=20
additional authorized shares approved by the shareholders was deemed outsid=
e=20
of the control of the company. In this context, ""the company"" is defined as=
=20
the company's management rather than its management and shareholders.)
There is no requirement in the contract to post collateral at any point in=
=20
the contract or for any reason.
There are no required cash payments to the counterparty (true-ups) if the n=
et=20
shares initially delivered are insufficient to provide the counterparty wit=
h=20
full satisfaction of the amount due. However, true-ups may be included in t=
he=20
contract if the company only, not the counterparty, can choose whether to=
=20
satisfy the true-up in shares or cash and the true-up is subject to the=20
explicit cap discussed in item 2.
There is no economic penalty in the contract for net share settlement that=
=20
would economically compel the company to settle in net cash. (The right to=
=20
increase the number of shares delivered based on the fair value differentia=
l=20
between registered shares and unregistered shares was not deemed to be a=20
penalty.)
There are no provisions in the contract that would indicate the counterpart=
y=20
had creditor rights, or would otherwise contravene the objective of this=20
model that the counterparty=01,s rights would rank no higher than those of =
a=20
common shareholder. (Subject to future EITF discussions, it may be possible=
=20
to meet this criterion by having a legal letter addressing the issue or a=
=20
specific statement of this concept in the contract.)

Related Issues

There was also discussion of the provisions relating to termination and=20
settlement in the event of a merger or change in control. There was general=
=20
support for a position that, as long as the counterparty received the same=
=20
choice of compensation as other shareholders (for example, stock for stock,=
=20
stock and cash for stock, cash for stock), the fact that the counterparty=
=20
might receive cash in such circumstances would not preclude equity treatmen=
t=20
for the contract.

Similarly, in the event of nationalization or liquidation, a net cash=20
settlement of the same type afforded a common shareholder would not preclud=
e=20
equity treatment for the contract.

In addition, counterparty rights that did not exceed rights of common=20
shareholders should be acceptable, for example, rights to sue for damages i=
n=20
the event of misrepresentations or a breach of warrranties or if a company=
=20
simply refused to perform under the contract, as long as a common sharehold=
er=20
would also have those rights.

With respect to events that would cause a contract that was compliant with=
=20
the model at inception to later become noncompliant (for example, because a=
n=20
acquisition consumed enough authorized shares that otherwise were needed to=
=20
satisfy the contract), the EITF concluded that, at the time the contract is=
=20
no longer compliant, the fair value of the contract should be transferred=
=20
from equity to an asset or liability at fair value with prospective changes=
=20
in fair value reported currently in earnings. There would be no immediate=
=20
earnings effect at the time of this transfer.

Further, if, at a later date, sufficient shares were authorized to again=20
satisfy the contract, the carrying amount of the contract (that is, its fai=
r=20
value) would be transferred back to equity and the contract treated as equi=
ty=20
prospectively to the extent the contract continues to comply with the model=
.=20
(The company would not be permitted to reverse the gains and losses in fair=
=20
value recognized in earnings during the period the contract was treated as =
an=20
asset or liability.)

Transition

The EITF tentatively concluded that all contracts entered into after the da=
te=20
of a final consensus will have to comply with the model at contract incepti=
on=20
to achieve equity treatment. (The goal is to reach a final consensus at the=
=20
September 2000 EITF meeting.) For contracts entered into before the date of=
 a=20
final consensus, a company will have until June 30, 2001, to modify the=20
contract to comply with the final consensus.

For example, if a company entered into a contract before the date of the=20
final consensus, the company will have until June 30, 2001, to obtain any=
=20
shareholder authorization of shares needed to satisfy the criteria or to=20
modify their contract for the other criteria or any EITF changes to the=20
tentative model.

Since a variety of viewpoints are discussed at Emerging Issues Task Force=
=20
(EITF) meetings and it is often difficult to characterize the conclusions,=
=20
the following minutes may differ in some respects from the final minutes=20
available from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).

I have been going back and forth with Swiss Re on the representation and this 
is the language we have come up with.  Please replace the representation 
language in the confirm for Swiss Re weather deals with the following 
language.  I told Judy Lee that you would be resending the confirm with the 
new language.

""Representation.  ENA and Counterparty each represent that as of the Trade 
Date it is: (i) exposed in the conduct of its business, including in its 
capacity of making a market, to the risk of variations in temperature of the 
kind reflected in this Transaction and (ii) entering into this Transaction 
solely as it relates to such exposure.""

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,

Bob and Sara -

 As we discussed, I enclose the cover page from the lengthy CFTC
policy paper relating to regulation of Ag Options.  This paper was never
approved by the full Commission and does not represent CFTC policy.  I also
enclose:

 (i) An outline of the application for designation as a contract
market (a recent example is the application of BrokerTec Futures Exchange
LLC, published at 65 F.R. 36667 (June 9, 2000));

 (ii) Excerpts from a report by the General Accounting Office
discussing issues relating to the reauthorization of the CFTC (May 1999).
(This represents much of the seed work for S. 2679 and deals with certain of
the issues we discussed yesterday.); and

 (iii) Introductory notes to CFTC revisions to its Rules relating
to agricultural trade options (December 6, 1999).

The exemption we discussed was for an entity called SwapClear, referred to
in the GAO report.  During one of our conversations, Bob referred to
multilateral transaction execution facilities.  The Commission has proposed
regulations on this subject.  They are reported at 65 F.R. 38985 (June 22,
2000) (CCH Commodity Futures Law Reporter paragraph 28,153).

Regards.

Sara,
I spoke with Gary regarding the clearing of this CSFB activity.  I have also 
spoken with Kathleen Goss, CSFB, to clarify the use of these different 
agreements.  
The Executing Broker Agreement, includes the ""give-up"" to another clearing 
broker.  That is, we may choose to execute through CSFB but Clear through our 
existing agreements with Prudential and Carr.  
The Clearing Agreement, is our abiltiy is for  CSFB to clear the 
transaction.  Gary does want to put this in place.
The PrimeTrade License Agreement is specifically for the electronic Trading.

CSFB is forwarding the other two agreements, Executing and Clearing,  to me 
and I will forward them to legal.
Thanks Sheila

Sara, We need to send back to them with the agreements the fee schedule.  I 
will forward a copy to you.
Thanks, Sheila

Sara, Ted,
CSFB has a new electronic access trading system for futures. 
Financial Trading, Enron North America, wants to establish a relationship to 
support this trading.  

To Trade Electronically, ENA will need a Standard Execution Agreement 
(Executing Broker) and a ""Prime Trade"" Agreement which supports the 
electronic trading.  
Financial Trading is still assessing whether we need a Give-up agreement with 
CSFB or will utilitze our current relationships with Carr and Prudential to 
hold the positions.  I have confirmed with Bob Klein that noone at Enron 
currently trades futures with CSFB.  
Trading will include Futures including, S&P, Nasdaq, Fixed Income (bonds, 
eurodollars) and Forex.

Bob and Sara -

 As we discussed, I enclose the cover page from the lengthy CFTC
policy paper relating to regulation of Ag Options.  This paper was never
approved by the full Commission and does not represent CFTC policy.  I also
enclose:

 (i) An outline of the application for designation as a contract
market (a recent example is the application of BrokerTec Futures Exchange
LLC, published at 65 F.R. 36667 (June 9, 2000));

 (ii) Excerpts from a report by the General Accounting Office
discussing issues relating to the reauthorization of the CFTC (May 1999).
(This represents much of the seed work for S. 2679 and deals with certain of
the issues we discussed yesterday.); and

 (iii) Introductory notes to CFTC revisions to its Rules relating
to agricultural trade options (December 6, 1999).

The exemption we discussed was for an entity called SwapClear, referred to
in the GAO report.  During one of our conversations, Bob referred to
multilateral transaction execution facilities.  The Commission has proposed
regulations on this subject.  They are reported at 65 F.R. 38985 (June 22,
2000) (CCH Commodity Futures Law Reporter paragraph 28,153).

Regards.

- Larry

Here's my stab at the Product Long Description.



Sara - please review and offer your comments.

RAC - I need a Sigma Factor, please.

William - I have built a test Product in the Product Manager and it appears 
to have worked okay. I have asked David Forster to review the description as 
well as the attributes that I built in TEST. I will begin to build this in 
Production once I have his and Sara's sign-off. David will also be checking 
on the issue that I mentioned to you about the number of characters that can 
be put in the Volume and Price feilds in the Stack Manager. This is the one 
thing that could really hold up the process, so we may want to think about 
alternatives (such as trading in 10,000 increments - so that 5 means 50,000; 
50 means 500,000; etc) 

Jennifer Denney will be contacting Clara Carrington to talk to her about how 
Clara will see trades come over in the EOL Bridge Monitor.

Things are progessing relatively well so far, with the exception of the issue 
of the character limitation.

Kaye's birthday is right around the corner - Sunday,  August 6th.

I asked her if she would like to go to lunch on 7th and she said she would. 
She chose ""Two Rows"" in the Rice Village - yet another sports oriented place. 
I think we have her figured out now! 

So...... please let me know: 

1. Do you want to go to lunch with us on Monday the 7th? 

2. Do you want to go in on flowers? If so - how much do you want to 
contribute? 10? 20 ? etc...

3. Any other ideas?

Thanks!

trend and achieve our Enron-wide goal for 2000 of $2,310,000.

We are poised to play a significant role in this year's campaign.  I am=20
asking that the head of each business unit nominate one or more individuals=

promote and educate employees about the United Way and Enron's campaign.=20

Last year Enron's company-wide participation level was 78%. Several busines=

Once you've selected your department's campaigners, please forward their=20

Bill and Sara,
We have been talking with Goldman Sachs, one of ECT Investment's prime 
brokers,  about ways to reduce our margin requirement and gain greater 
leverage.  Goldman suggested that we may want to consider putting an Enron 
Guaranttee in place.  

We also have a prime broker agreement with Morgan Stanley.  Per the 
documentation that I have... I do not see a guarantte with Morgan Stanley.

1) Can you confirm that no guarantee exists with either Goldman or Morgan?
2) Any comments regarding a Goldman guarantee by Enron Corp for ECT 
Investments Inc.?

Thanks, Sheila"

Sara and I were told this morning, by our London office, that the MG 
acquisition has closed.  Based on what we have heard about MG's New York 
activities, that may mean that Enron is now the owner of some 
CFTC/NFA-licensees (such as FCM's, CTA's, pool operators, etc.).

I realize we may well not have acquired the domestic businesses to which I am 
referring, and if we have, someone may already be addressing this.  
Regardless -- do you think it would be a good idea for us to focus on this 
Monday, i.e., get with whoever is overseeing the MG acquisition from ENA 
Legal's perspective, and just make sure futures regulatory issues are being 
properly addressed?  let me know what you think -- Bob"

Bob:  I am having a stack of materials relating to Enron Corp. equity trading 
sent to your attention via Federal Express on Monday.   DO NOT READ ANYTHING 
YOU RECEIVE. 

Rex, Jim and I have been discussing the variety of Enron Corp. equity 
derivatives on ENE stock, the latest accounting issuances, ENE Board 
resolutions, confirmation templates and the like.  Rex should be contacting 
you shortly to schedule a conference call.

The package of materials MIGHT be useful when we discuss the foregoing issues 
(or, it might be totally useless!).  

Hope you have a great weekend.  Regards.  Sara"

Here's my stab at the Product Long Description.



Sara - please review and offer your comments.

RAC - I need a Sigma Factor, please.

William - I have built a test Product in the Product Manager and it appears 
to have worked okay. I have asked David Forster to review the description as 
well as the attributes that I built in TEST. I will begin to build this in 
Production once I have his and Sara's sign-off. David will also be checking 
on the issue that I mentioned to you about the number of characters that can 
be put in the Volume and Price feilds in the Stack Manager. This is the one 
thing that could really hold up the process, so we may want to think about 
alternatives (such as trading in 10,000 increments - so that 5 means 50,000; 
50 means 500,000; etc) 

Jennifer Denney will be contacting Clara Carrington to talk to her about how 
Clara will see trades come over in the EOL Bridge Monitor.

Things are progessing relatively well so far, with the exception of the issue 
of the character limitation.

Dale

Bill and Sara,
We have been talking with Goldman Sachs, one of ECT Investment's prime 
brokers,  about ways to reduce our margin requirement and gain greater 
leverage.  Goldman suggested that we may want to consider putting an Enron 
Guaranttee in place.  

We also have a prime broker agreement with Morgan Stanley.  Per the 
documentation that I have... I do not see a guarantte with Morgan Stanley.

1) Can you confirm that no guarantee exists with either Goldman or Morgan?
2) Any comments regarding a Goldman guarantee by Enron Corp for ECT 
Investments Inc.?

Thanks, Sheila

Sara,

Attached is a draft of the language that needs to be placed in all Michael 
Petroleum deals.  Janelle agreed with the counterparty that they will settle 
on the last day of the calendar month instead of our usual 5th Business Day.  
She is charging 6.5 % annual interest on payments they make to us for the 
days beyond the 5th Business Day.

I__________________________________________________________________I
(5th B.D.)       6.5% interest  
..............................................................................
....    (last B.D.)


Please let me know as soon as you can if this is ok. to put in the 
confirmations.  Call me if you need me to go up there.




THANK YOU SOOO MUCH!

Melba

Hi, Clem!  Please see below message from Sheila Glover.  I believe that in 
the past ENE has only issued a guaranty to Paribas, ED&F Mann and Bank One in 
connection with ENA's futures/special margin arrangements.  I'll be speaking 
with Paul Radous in credit.  Do you see any issues here?  Sara

Bill,

I will be happy to follow up on this.  But I think we at least need to 
consider the ramifications of entering into brokerage agreements with brokers 
who accept non-cash credit from their customers.  If they are willing to 
offer credit to Enron, they are bound to do so with others.  Enron's 
funds/accounts will be pooled with all other customers in the event  of a 
financial crisis at the broker.  To the extent the broker has granted credit 
to unworthy trading partners, Enron could have exposure if those partners 
default, thus causing this financial distress at the broker.

I don't wish to overblow this concern (i.e., focus excessively on low 
probability events), but I think we should at least discuss it a few minutes 
before we proceed.

appears Frank was on this initial email.  I don't know what progress, if any, 
has been made in getting the counterparty signed up online.  The person that 
contacted us is on the bottom of this email.  I will wait to see this 
counterparty come through on the Credit list.  P.S.  We do have a financial 
master in place with them in and there is nothing in it that should restrict

I noticed we have a master with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C.  I 
am under the impression that there is another master with Duke that is being 
negotiated because the business guys said that the negotiations on an ISDA 
master agreement is holding up another power trade that the Duke entity down 
here wants to do through its US subsidiary ECT is negotiating with.  Could 
you update me on what is being negotiated with any of the other Duke 
entities.  Also where is Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C. located 
and what types of trades does the master cover?  Thanks for your help."

I suggest the attached language be substituted for the current language in 
the schedules in respect of Engineering Report where  a PV/PDP mac is 
utilized.  Tana, maybe this could go as an optional insert under Docs to be

Mary:  Just a reminder.  Tana is not in charge of form changes; Susan Bailey 
handles that function.  Tana's primary role is ""special projects"" but she is 
helping Susan and Samantha with daily matters until Stephanie begins work and

I have incorporated the following adjustments:

In the web description, David Forster is adamate that we use 'Fin Curr Swap' 
in leiu of 'Curr Par Fwd'. In the event that we offer this product externally 
we need to be poised to demonstrate that we offering the same Product both 
internally and externally. We understand that this could be viewed as a 
series of Forwards, but it is, in fact, a swap, as we are paying Fixed 
Amounts vs Floating Amounts in a like currency.

In the web description 'CAD/USD' has become 'CAD/$-m' to designate USD per 
month.

I have included a blurb on how we derive at the Notional Quantity per 
Determination Period.

I have removed the 'CAD' from 'CAD Fixed Amounts' and 'CAD Floating Amounts; 
because we state what the Contractual Currency is, it's redundant, and 
removing it allows us to open up to other currencies.

I've indicated that the unit of volume is in 1,000,000 USD.

Comments, please; but I think we are there, and will commence building this 
in Production today.

Dale

Pat,

EDEN is a power LDC, owned mainly by AES. We have basically offered them a
financial product that works as described below:
Attached is a one page description of the structure.

(See attached file: Structure.ppt)

Terms and Conditions of the agreement:
Volume: 20MW x 7 days a week x 24 hours a day
Term: 3 years, 1999
Start Date: August 1st.
Index: Simple hourly average Monomic at Ezeiza
Structure: ""Collar"" (Enron sells and EDEN buys):
- Cap: @$20.15/MWh
- 1st year, floor: @$18.14/MWh
- 2nd year, floor: @18.05/MWh
- 3rd year, floor: @17.96/MWh
Zero-cost call option (Cap) for Enron:  @$22.16/Mwh.  (Enron buys and EDEN 
sells).

Example:
When Index is between $22.16 and $20.15, Enron pays to Eden. If Index is 
above $22.16, Enron keeps on paying $2.01 (Difference between $22.16 and 
$20.15).
When Index is between $20.15 and the floor (different every year), no 
payments are involved.
When Index is below the floor price, Eden pays to Enron whatever Index minus 
Floor is.

Pending issues:
Credit approval
Master Swap Agreement in place
Finalise negotiations. There is a high probability of this deal happening. 
Timing for closing is close to 10 days.

If you have any questions, let  me know.

Rolo

Pat,

That's a good question. Actually we are still defining prices with Eden to 
see what we are going to offer Siderca.

Following steps:
Eden and Enron to agree on structure and pricing;
Eden will present the structure to Siderca;
Siderca has to agree to the proposed structure and prices and will start 
negotiating documents.

I suggest that we hold on until we agree with Eden on point 1, and once that 
is decided, we can start working on it.

Regards,

Rolo

Where are you with this deal?  We will need to have underwriting become

Please let me know when you are ready to have a conference call with 
underwriting and myself to discuss this deal in detail.

Importance:  High
---------------------------------



Pat,

Fede and I met this morning with Eden. For the time being, we are going to 
work with them on another deal (which I will explain below) and we will 
suspend the Swap deal that we were currently working on..

Eden - Siderca - Enron Deal

Eden has a full-requirement PPA (140MW) with a TOP of around 50 MWs with 
Siderca that ends on May 31st, 2006. The contract price is approximately $30 
/Mwh (adjusted with a formula) clearly out of the money.   The contract also 
states that Siderca will have to pay $12MM penalty to Eden in the event 
Siderca wants to early terminate the contract. We have proposed to Eden the 
following structure:

Enron will pay Eden an upfront payment of $12MM so that Eden terminates the 
contract with Siderca, and then Enron can transact with Siderca. Enron will 
sign a MSA with Siderca selling (financially) for around 70 MW flat during 
the term of the agreement.
Enron will sign a MSA with a Generator (possibly CTSN - an AES Co. - or 
Central Puerto) to buy (financially) 70 MW flat during the term of the 
agreement.
Siderca will sign a physical power contract with a generator for 70 MW @ spot 
prices.
Term of the agreement: Nov '99 - March '06.

One important point is to determine what will the concept for the Upfront 
Payment that Enron will make to Eden. Fede and I
thought about two options:
Dummy Option or,
Direct Payment to the Main Shareholders of Eden on an off-shore basis

I am attaching a slide were the transaction is described. If you have any 
questions about the deal structure, do not hesitate to call either Fede or 
myself.

Rolo

I've spoken with Morgan Stanley this afternoon to get details on progress 
with the ISDA for credit trading.

In brief, they have our ISDA documents and are in the process of reviewing 
them.  They also informed me that Enron North America was in the process of 
negotiating ISDA documents with the same MS entity.  They are going to 
provide consolidated comments to myself and Sara Shackleton in Houston during 
the course of tomorrow.

I'll liaise with Sara to ensure that this gets pushed along at top speed from 
the Enron end.

Thanks, Edmund

The Product is as follows:

William Stuart on the FX desk will offer the Product to Enron canada Corp on 
an internal basis only. The GTC will be an 'internal only' GTC that we use 
that tells any external customer that may inadvertantly access the internal 
trade that the transaction is freserved for internal trading only; the only 
radio button will be a ""REJECT GTC"", which further prevents an external 
customer from transacting.

Stuart will post a Fixed Price price that represents the USD/CAD Exchange 
rate on Trade Date. The Fixed Amount will be a CAD amount equal to volume 
multiplied by Fixed Price. The Floating Amount will be a CAD Amount equal to 
the volume multiplied by the Index, where the Index is a Floating Price equal 
to the USD/CAD.

There are several arguments as to whether this should be classified as a 
Forward or a Financial transaction. Our effort was to arrive at something 
that would be easily understood by the market in the event that we begin to 
offer this product externally.

The full Product description is attached. Please go in and offer your 
approval.

Sara, Samantha,
I spoke with Guillaume this morning.  He suggested that we do the PrimeTrade 
Access Agreement first.  This allows us to get the CD for the PrimeTrade 
application  and to install it on a  PC here, roll it out to the traders, and 
have CSFB come in for trainng.
At the same time we can complete the clearing agreement.
We will not do the give up agreement.  If we decide we can do easily in the 
future.
Guillaume suggested that you call him if you have any questions.  He will be 
happy to facilitate.

Sheila

Tana,

Before Carol St. Clair left for maternity leave, she was working on the 
assignment of some financial and gas deals with Christopher Smith (who 
previously worked in our group).  Since Christopher is no longer here and 
with Carol being out, I'm scrambling to find out who in the financial team is 
working on this.

I've left Mark Taylor a message since Carol's voice mail forwards all 
questions to Mark.

Could you let me know if you have any info?

Thx,
Tracyh

come across in the physical arena of ag regulation, I have gone ahead and 
summarized some notes I have been putting together.  Obviously, some of this

Sara,

The following items are outstanding issues with respect to the 
above-referenced ISDA:

1. Arizona Public Service Company plans on executing the ISDA as Arizona 
Public Service Company, on behalf of its Bulk Power Marketing Resource 
Operations Division (""BPMROD"").  It is APSC's intent in the future to create 
a new entity for this division, such new entity to enter into all trading 
transactions.  As a result, it is ASPC's desire to  modify the definition of 
""Specified Transaction"" to only include transactions between Party A and 
BPMROD.

2. Procedures for Entering into Transactions - ASPC would like 5 days to 
dispute or accept confirmations.  Apparently, all of their agreements provide 
for 5 days, therefore any shorter time period could cause problems for them.  
I had previously offered 3 days.

3. Part 5 (f) Recording - ASPC wants to consent to recordings on ""trading 
lines only"".  They do not want to consent to officers (non-traders) being 
recorded if the communication does not occur on a trading line.

4. Part 5 (g)(B) - Setoff -  ASPC wants to delete ""or any of its Affiliates"" 
from this section.  ASPC thinks this issue is related to their issue in #1 
above.  I don't see why.  What do you think?  I assume that we are not 
willing to strike ""or any of its Affiliates"".

The only other issue is a credit issue which I am handling with Paul Radous.  
So, we're close.  Let me know what you think.

I noticed we have a master with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C.  I 
am under the impression that there is another master with Duke that is being 
negotiated because the business guys said that the negotiations on an ISDA 
master agreement is holding up another power trade that the Duke entity down 
here wants to do through its US subsidiary ECT is negotiating with.  Could 
you update me on what is being negotiated with any of the other Duke 
entities.  Also where is Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C. located 
and what types of trades does the master cover?  Thanks for your help.

Ya Hoo,

I think we may have this one done       ------finally.

Please review the e-mails below with respect to the Minimum Transfer Amount.  
If you recall, this person had been at a conference in which the speaker 
suggests the Min. Transfer Amount be at least twice that of the Collateral 
Rounding.  The Speakers point, which I can understand to an extent, has to do 
with discrepancies in valuing Mark-to-market between the two counterparty's.  
I can accept this, and will accept PanCanadian's proposal of a $100,000 
Minimum Transfer and $100,000 collateral rounding.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Also, I have attached and amended credit worksheet per my discussions with 
PanCanadian which incorporates our credit resolutions.

Thanks
Russell

Russell,

For your review. Based on this explanation I recommend a minimum
transfer amount of $100,000 and a rounding amount of at least $100,000.

Also, PanCanadian Energy Services Inc.'s CFO is willing to accept the
Minimum Net Worth indicator in the MAC clause but has requested the
threshold amount to be $100,000,000. In my opinion this is reasonable as
you are setting the credit limit threshold relatively low at $2,000,000.

If you are in agreement with the above, I believe this completes the
negotiation of the agreements and we can move toward preparing execution
copies.

Please let me know....regards, Harry

Subject: Re: Credit Support Annex

Hi Harry.  Thanks for your note.  It is my
understanding that when the ISDA Credit Support Annex
was first drafted, the drafters had a couple of
concerns about transfers so they addressed each concern
differently.  The minimum transfer amount is used to
avoid de mininimus transfers (remember that the
original participants were all banks and finance houses
doing large dollar deals together with daily marking to
market).

The drafters provided the option of rounding to avoid
conflicts as to what the transfer amount should be.
The original thought probably was to set rounding
limits quite high so that even if Party A and Party B
had different numbers, the rounding would be large
enough to avoid disputes.

You may recall that I used an example of one party
calculating that the delivery amount should be $1.6
million and the other calculating a delivery amount of
$1.8 million.  If rounding is up in integral units of
$500,000, the transfer would be for $2 million, thus
avoiding the conflict.

Some parties choose to use either minimum transfer
amount or rounding--but not both.  When parties use
both, they should examine whether the numbers they have
chosen for rounding don't interfere with minimum
transfer amount and vice versa. Many times, an
otherwise due transfer isn't made because the rounding
or minimum transfer numbers effectively change the
transfer amount.

Rounding needn't be less than half of the minimum
transfer amount.  Parties should understand, though,
that either can interfere with a transfer otherwise
due.  If you have further questions, please advise.

Susan,

Per my earlier e-mail, we have finalized the credit terms for this ISDA (see 
attached credit worksheet).  Also, please make note to change the definition 
for Net Worth that used in the drafts.  The draft versions defined Net Worth 
with Notes Receivable subtracted out.  This should be changed and the the Net 
Worth definition that is normally used in the ISDA should be replaced.  
Finally, please make PanCanadian Petroleum Limited a specified entity.

Once this draft is complete, can you please have Sara review.

Thank you,

Russell

Carol:  Hope all is well.  We are missing you every day.

(1)  On a ""swap"" related note, we have a Canadian party requesting the 
ability to post cash collateral to ENA.  Can you recall where we left off on 
the issue?  I seem to  remember conflicting advice (Peter's insistence upon 
the Stikeman memo and ENA simply not agreeing to accept cash) and uncertainty 
as to how ENA could perfect its interest and what law governs (in cash held 
in a U.S. account).

(2)  On a ""credit"" related note, I was forwarded the 7/24/00 Margin Exception 
Report (originally sent to your attention).  What were you doing to follow up 
on this report?  Yesterday, Mary gave me a copy of a ""collateral letter"" 
being sent by Molly Harris.  Did you speak with Mary about working on this 
project in your absence?

Edward Ondarza is moving to EBS.   Stephanie Panus starts on Monday.  That's 
all the news for now.
 
Talk to you soon.  Sara

P.S.  Can you send photos over the net?"

It seems like that is the best way to go.  With the board resolution, we'll 
just need to drag our feet a little on signing the ISDA. We should go ahead 
and negotiate the document and be ready to close right after we get the 
resolution in October.  Thanks for the update.

Clint:  after the meeting, Jim advised me that the ENE board resolution will 
be drafted for the Oct. meeting.  In the interim, he is convinced that only 
Enron Corp. should be a swap party to these equity swaps, forwards, etc.  I 
am going to speak with Rod Nelson (credit) and make some changes to our 
approach.  This should also make life easier negotiating with Lehman and Bear 
(from a credit perspecttive) but we'll reach an obvious stalemate when they 
ask for an Enron Corp. resolution (forthcoming after the relevant board 
meeting.  Sara

We have decided to postpone the All-Employee Meeting, which was scheduled at 
10 a.m. Wednesday, August 9, and concentrate our efforts on a successful kick 
off of our 2000 Houston United Way campaign.  This year's United Way gameshow 
event, ""Who Wants to Help Millions?"", will run, as previously announced, from 
11:15 a.m. to noon in the Hyatt Regency's Imperial Ballroom, followed by 
lunch in Antioch Park from noon to 1:30 p.m.  We encourage all employees in 
Houston to attend this fun event and cheer your business unit representatives 
on to victory and to helping others in the community.

We will communicate the new date of the All-Employee Meeting as soon as it 
has been determined. "

Everybody,

Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline 
call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to 
know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of 
Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they 
were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for 
Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the 
status of the master.

Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know 
if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct 
his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling 
this and pass the info on."

If neither ENA nor its counterparty is able to qualify as an offeree for 
purposes of the Trade Option Exemption (17 CFR Sec. 32.13, as amended) but 
each is an eligible swap participant (or better yet, each party has $10 
million in net worth as per Sec. 32.13) can the option still be exempt from 
CFTC regulation under the Swap Policy Statement or any CFTC interpretive 
letters?

I have concerns about not relying fully on the Trade Option Exemption but I 
also understood that the CFTC has informally said that the Swap Policy 
Statement provides a safe harbor for both swaps and options.

I am available to speak at your convenience.  Thanks.  Sara [713/853-5620] "

Sorry for the delay in catching up with my e-mails. Yes, MG London Inc is the

We have never gotten comfortable with the Canadian cash collateral issue.  
You may recall that Shari recently looked into this but her situation was 
limited to a particular counterparty.  I was never comfortable with the 
advice that I got from Blake, Cassells and would suggest that we follow up 
with stikeman which is who Shari worked with.  She may have some updated 
memos on this in the file she was working on (I think it was Duke).

Molly and I never talked about this.  Mark needs to pick someone who should 
be in charge.  Molly was never interested in meeting to talk globally about 
this but I think that a meeting with her and Bradford needs to occur.  Take 
care.  Got to go.  Hope to see you in about 2 weeks.

Carol:  Hope all is well.  We are missing you every day.

(1)  On a ""swap"" related note, we have a Canadian party requesting the 
ability to post cash collateral to ENA.  Can you recall where we left off on 
the issue?  I seem to  remember conflicting advice (Peter's insistence upon 
the Stikeman memo and ENA simply not agreeing to accept cash) and uncertainty 
as to how ENA could perfect its interest and what law governs (in cash held 
in a U.S. account).

(2)  On a ""credit"" related note, I was forwarded the 7/24/00 Margin Exception 
Report (originally sent to your attention).  What were you doing to follow up 
on this report?  Yesterday, Mary gave me a copy of a ""collateral letter"" 
being sent by Molly Harris.  Did you speak with Mary about working on this 
project in your absence?

Edward Ondarza is moving to EBS.   Stephanie Panus starts on Monday.  That's 
all the news for now.
 
Talk to you soon.  Sara

In addition to the exchange seats,  MG London is also licensed as an FCM and 
CTA with the CFTC --- the Enron acquisition requires a re-registration with 
respect to these licenses, and perhaps a great deal of unwanted 
disclosure/reporting burdens on Enron

Justin

Sorry for the delay in catching up with my e-mails. Yes, MG London Inc is the 
clearing member of NYMEX/COMEX and is FCM & CTA. The only other MG companies 
who have any exchange/regulatory registrations are in the UK and are 
Metallgesellschaft Ltd (LME & SFA, also LIFFE to come), MG Brokers Ltd (LME & 
SFA), MG Metal & Commodity Co Ltd (LME only).

Jon,

Grateful if you could complete the picture for me and for Mark Taylor.    Is 
MG London Inc. the entity that is the Clearing Member of NYMEX + a Futures 
Commission Merchant and Commodity Trading Advisor?   Do any other (MG) 
entities have similar registrations, and if so, what are these?

Thanks

Justin

Justin:

Do you know whether we have acquired any companies with CFTC registrations of 
any kind (e.g. Commodity Trading Advisor or Futures Commission Merchant)?  I 
was wondering who was responsible for compliance matters if we have.

I hope you're well and all my best to Fran.

Mark

Sara, Samantha,
I spoke with Guillaume this morning.  He suggested that we do the PrimeTrade 
Access Agreement first.  This allows us to get the CD for the PrimeTrade 
application  and to install it on a  PC here, roll it out to the traders, and 
have CSFB come in for trainng.
At the same time we can complete the clearing agreement.
We will not do the give up agreement.  If we decide we can do easily in the 
future.
Guillaume suggested that you call him if you have any questions.  He will be 
happy to facilitate.

Sara,

here is online (web based) convertible trading site hat I could use - kindof 
like an online broker where they match up buyers and sellers.  I take it that 
before we enter to any agreement with them you need to approve it all.  

 I have not looked at this document yet, so please feel free to make any 
comments you may have.

I have attached the query result.  I ran a query for all deals where the 
index is a Linear Low Density.  
According to Lee, we would be interested in deals that are active effective 
4/00 forward.  The ones in yellow apply. 
Sara- I will forward you the signed confimations of all of the yellow ones.

We have tentatively planned for two partners from the Chicago law firm of 
Sidley & Austin to come visit us in our offices on Friday, Aug. 11 and to 
give a presentation.  I say ""tentatively"" because I have not yet been able to 
confirm Mark Haedicke's availability on that date -- I will try to do that as 
soon as possible.

I would expect the presentation to take 1 to 2 hours -- I'm sure it could 
take longer if we wanted it to, i.e., if there turned out to be some matters 
that we wanted to discuss in further detail with them.  I think a morning 
meeting would suit most people's availability better than an afternoon one; 
please share your thoughts on this with me.

Enclosed is a rough outline of an agenda I have suggested to them for their 
presentation.  If there are other matters you would like to hear them 
discuss, I encourage you to let me know; I will pass all suggestions along to 
them.

As most of you probably know, attorneys have a duty of strict confidentiality 
to their clients, and this duty attaches from the moment a consultation 
begins (regardless of whether a formal ""engagement"" has commenced).  
Violation of this duty is grounds for disciplinary action by the governing 
bar association.   On the other hand, I realize that we do not have an 
established relationship with this firm or these lawyers.  All of that being 
said, I will leave it to each of you as to your comfort level in asking 
particular questions or sharing particular information.

agreements / legal issues related to the Buy Side Direct site or its parent

I noticed we have a master with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C.  I 
am under the impression that there is another master with Duke that is being 
negotiated because the business guys said that the negotiations on an ISDA 
master agreement is holding up another power trade that the Duke entity down 
here wants to do through its US subsidiary ECT is negotiating with.  Could 
you update me on what is being negotiated with any of the other Duke 
entities.  Also where is Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C. located 
and what types of trades does the master cover?  Thanks for your help.

Samantha,

I left the Bank One closing binder with you regarding the amendment to the 
brokerage agreement and the margin line of credit.  Please be sure to update 
the database regarding these agreements.  If you need my help, just ask.  
Also, I am following up with John Arnold regarding the executing broker 
agreements, which I sent to him for initial signature.  Thanks.  Mary

The attached confirm is a swap.  There is no need for a rep in the confirm.  
If a weather deal is structured as an option, Gordon Heaney (backed by Diane 
Anderson) who confirms weather transactions, adds the weather-specific Trade 
Option rep into the confirmation.  The desk uses a template for options.  Let 
me know if you have any other questions.  Sara

Pat,

That's a good question. Actually we are still defining prices with Eden to 
see what we are going to offer Siderca.

Following steps:
Eden and Enron to agree on structure and pricing;
Eden will present the structure to Siderca;
Siderca has to agree to the proposed structure and prices and will start 
negotiating documents.

I suggest that we hold on until we agree with Eden on point 1, and once that 
is decided, we can start working on it.

Regards,

Rolo

Where are you with this deal?  We will need to have underwriting become

Please let me know when you are ready to have a conference call with

---------------------------------



Pat,

Fede and I met this morning with Eden. For the time being, we are going to 
work with them on another deal (which I will explain below) and we will 
suspend the Swap deal that we were currently working on..

Eden - Siderca - Enron Deal

Eden has a full-requirement PPA (140MW) with a TOP of around 50 MWs with 
Siderca that ends on May 31st, 2006. The contract price is approximately $30 
/Mwh (adjusted with a formula) clearly out of the money.   The contract also 
states that Siderca will have to pay $12MM penalty to Eden in the event 
Siderca wants to early terminate the contract. We have proposed to Eden the 
following structure:

Enron will pay Eden an upfront payment of $12MM so that Eden terminates the 
contract with Siderca, and then Enron can transact with Siderca. Enron will 
sign a MSA with Siderca selling (financially) for around 70 MW flat during 
the term of the agreement.
Enron will sign a MSA with a Generator (possibly CTSN - an AES Co. - or 
Central Puerto) to buy (financially) 70 MW flat during the term of the 
agreement.
Siderca will sign a physical power contract with a generator for 70 MW @ spot 
prices.
Term of the agreement: Nov '99 - March '06.

One important point is to determine what will the concept for the Upfront 
Payment that Enron will make to Eden. Fede and I
thought about two options:
Dummy Option or,
Direct Payment to the Main Shareholders of Eden on an off-shore basis

I am attaching a slide were the transaction is described. If you have any 
questions about the deal structure, do not hesitate to call either Fede or 
myself.

Rolo

Can I obtain by electronic email the ISDA Credit Support Annex 1994 (New
York Law) and the ISDA Master Agreement 1992 Multicurrency--cross border?
This will allow us to avoid an original type of the agreements.  For
training new attorneys we want search capability with respect to usage of
definitions and the like.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.  If
charges to our account are necessary, please advise and I will get
authorization.

It seems to me that in our omnibus forms, there is no rounding rule 
applicable to the return of collateral.  However, credit worksheets often ask 
for the rounding rule to apply to both delivery and return (similar to 
master).  Could you look at the forms at your convenience and let me know if 
I am missing something?  If not, I will ask Mark if he thinks we should 
revise.  Thanks.  Mary"

Are you the Sara Shackleton who worked for Gordon, Arata?  I'm Jo Wiley and I 
worked for Preston Oil.  I just took your call for Nora Dobin and when I saw 
your name flash across the screen, I just had to ask.

settlement are in here.  I'd also like to talk to ya'll about the fees and 
expenses section.  Jim, where are we on putting together registration 
language that is acceptable to us?  Talk to ya'll later.

The London office is forwarding recent legal advice from our lawyers in South 
Africa regarding FX clearances.  It seems that prior to transacting with a 
South African party, we need copies of the party's ""certification"" from the 
National Bank allowing the party to make payments out of the country (thereby 
converting local currency to USD).  Such approvals are severely restricted.  
I will forward the memos to Susan Bailey for inclusion in our ""database"" of

Apparently this is another leg of the forward/swap etc transaction with 
Credit Suisse that we wound up agreeing to registration rights language in 
the resulting swap because they had those rights in the original deal.  It 
was done with emphasis to CS and their counsel that it was a one time 
situation, and should not be viewed as precedent for future swaps.  That 
registration rights language is attached as ""CSFBi"" below.   We would 
probably like to go with more restrictive language in our ""standard"" deals, 
and that proposed registration rights language is also attached below.  The 
primary difference in the two versions is that in the ""standard"" the 
counter-party does not have the full decision to require those rights--in 
order to trigger registration rights there must be a positition taken by the 
SEC or its staff that registration is necessary, or a market practice of such 
registrations has developed before the hedge is unwound.  Since this 
transaction still may have the stamp of the ""one time situation"", you might 
want to simply go with the CSFBi language-- if you feel otherwise, it would 
probably be best to go with the ""standard"" language (with the CSFBi language 
as an acceptable fall-back for this deal).    Was that confusing enough?  
Please let me know if you need anything further or otherwise want to 
discuss.  Thanks.

I spoke to Andrea and she said that the commercial guys were taking care of 
this issue.  This came up because during my trip a week and a half ago I 
suggested they let Houston know about the deal so that no one was surprised 
when the deal was executed.  They are trying to close the deal by the end of 
the month.  I am not sure if they can pull everything together in time. 
Additionally Diomedes told them that he does not want Electro buying the 
power but wants a free customer of Electro buying the power which just 
complicates things even further.  Do you have a time frame for when you can 
come to Brazil yet?  Let me know when you do and Andrea Bertone will check on 
the availability of Jose Emilio Pinto and Luis Mauer to spend some time with
us.  Talk to you later.

Hey guys, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I just checked with Ted 
Murphy and there is no authorization in place for trading transactions in 
Brazil.  This is pretty serious, and I suggest that someone call Ted (x33324) 
prior to execution to explain the deal and work through issues.

I know that Don had written a trading authorization memo, but since Ted has 
not seen it, I assume that in the frenzy of business, it was not submitted. 
The submission of an authorization memo to Ted for Rick Buy's and Jeff 
Skilling's execution is standard practice and required prior to entering a 
new market.   This is an interim step prior to going to the Enron Board for 
formal approval of trading limits.

I understand that Don is in Houston on vacation and I'm trying to track him 
down.

FYI-

Brazil is starting up it looks like although they still have some regulatory 
issues that need to be resolved before we will see alot of transactions.  I 
am going to ask the attorney in Sao Paulo, Andrea Bertoni, to summarize the 
regulatory issues just so we can understand this market better.

The transaction below is what they are looking at for the time being. 
Although I do not see large credit issues with this specific transaction, I 
am going to forward a memo that Julio and I wrote that outlines the credit 
procedures that need to be followed.

SMUD is working on a weather transaction with Enron which may get completed 
shortly - since this is a financial deal we need to get a ISDA in place 
asap.  I believe this is a blacklined copy of the ISDA.  Feel free to call me 
or Gary Taylor at 713-853-1511 to get more info on the weather deal. 


Stewart 

PS I hope this leads to us getting the power schedule as well!

Marino Monardi asked me to send a copy of our ISDA Master Agreement and
Schedule for your review. He would like to have these agreements in place to
facilitate the precipitation hedge he is discussing  with Enron. We have not
included a Credit Support Annex. Since we are a municipality, pledging
assets as collateral involves complications that could possibly impact the
schedule Marino has established for finalizing the precipitation hedge
agreement. As an alternative, I believe he is open to making periodic
payments during the year in lieu of providing collateral as financial
positions change.

I am working with Jeff Kabel in the Buenos Aires Office, pitching our risk 
management capabilities. We are focusing on the Power market and the Liquids 
market in BA. 
In this regard we have contacted Perez Companc, active both in Oil trading 
and Power Generation, and as a result we have a possibility of structuring 
some options on power with them.
I will like to ask you which is our situation as regards ISDA documentation 
with Perez. Do we have one signed with them ? What needs to be done to have 
it ?

I have received from them a copy of the credit support and schedule and will

We are considering several online trading platforms for trading investment 
grade, high yield and convertible corporate bonds.  

The sites we are considering are as follows:

Market Axess & LIMITrader - I will send you documents for these sites today.

Buy Side Direct, for which documents are being reviewed by your group.

Trading Edge / Bond Link - The review of documents for this site was 
originally handled by George Weber, who has since forwarded these agreements 
to Carmen Ayala.

Thanks for your assistance in reviewing these documents.  Please let me know 
if I can provide additional information during your review.

This is a reminder for those who have not had a chance to respond to the 
attached survey.
It would be appreciated if you take a few minutes to complete the survey.

The Internet provides instant access to global information, products and 
services.  
Technological advancements, such as faster computer processors and Internet 
connections, make access easier and more efficient.  

In keeping with Enron's vision to be the best company to work for in the 
U.S., 
the Company is considering offering a program that will empower eligible 
employees -- and their families -- by providing access to this new technology 
from their homes. 

The attached survey will give the program administrators the information 
needed 
to assess Enron employee participation.  Your feedback is critical and we 
would 
appreciate you taking a few moments to give us your opinion.  Click the link

Okay.  I will inform the ENA commercial team that they will need to allocate 
the total available line with ECTRIC.  I believe separate masters with 
separate credit thresholds will be required.  Though I would appreciate input 
from legal if we can somehow net Vitol S.A. (Swiss) with its US unit, Vitol 
S.A. Inc. under one master and thus set only one, global limit without the 
need to allocate.

I have always believed that Vitol SA and Vitol SA Inc are one and the same 
company anyway. IE the later is simply a US branch.

Okay.  I will inform the ENA commercial team that they will need to allocate 
the total available line with ECTRIC.  I believe separate masters with 
separate credit thresholds will be required.  Though I would appreciate input 
from legal if we can somehow net Vitol S.A. (Swiss) with its US unit, Vitol 
S.A. Inc. under one master and thus set only one, global limit without the 
need to allocate.

Yes, we have received figures for end 12/99 plus unaudited figs for 31/5/00. 
I believe Neil is doing the analysis and will input them into CAS - credit

Agreed.  However, if we have to negotiate separate ISDAs, we will have to 
incorporate different threshold amounts.  My question is, Is there any way we 
can draft these documents such that only one, overall threshold could be set 
under which all Vitol exposure can be aggregated?

This is something that we have discussed a little in London and what I 
believe is required is an umbrella netting and cross default agreement sign 
by all parties. However, this is difficult to draft and is questionable to 
its enforceability, especially with Swiss entities. I guess this is Legal's 
call.

With respect to agricultural trade options, the CFTC has specifically said 
that the swaps exemtion and the swaps policy statement are not available.  I 
will call you.

>>> <Sara.Shackleton@enron.com> 08/04 11:52 AM >>>

Ken:  In connection with our new product (and  absence of any physical 
activity
in that product), I have the following question:

If neither ENA nor its counterparty is able to qualify as an offeree for
purposes of the Trade Option Exemption (17 CFR Sec. 32.13, as amended) but 
each
is an eligible swap participant (or better yet, each party has $10 million in
net worth as per Sec. 32.13) can the option still be exempt from CFTC 
regulation
under the Swap Policy Statement or any CFTC interpretive letters?

I have concerns about not relying fully on the Trade Option Exemption but I 
also
understood that the CFTC has informally said that the Swap Policy Statement
provides a safe harbor for both swaps and options.

I am available to speak at your convenience.  Thanks.  Sara [713/853-5620]

Sara, Samantha

I talked to Chuck Kaufman and he had the following concerns from a credit 
standpoint:

1) Cross Default-  He wanted to lower Enron's cross default to $50MM to equal 
the amount for Cinergy.  I informed him, this amount has been set by our 
banks and the Enron Treasurer feels the $100MM is justified.  He has agreed 
to keep the amounts as they are.

2) Guaranty's and Guaranty/Collateral Thresholds-  
    a) Enron outgoing Guaranty-  Enron currently gives a $10MM guaranty to 
cover two Cinergy entities, Cinergy Marketing and Cinergy Capital. In my 
credit          worksheet I asked that Enron give them an additional $10MM 
guaranty to cover this ISDA specifically with the intention of amending the 
existing guaranty  to remove Cinergy Marketing.  After speaking to Chuck I 
have agreed to tie the existing guaranty to this contract and not use the 
additional guaranty at all.  
 Please tie the existing guaranty to the ISDA, I will forward a copy of that 
guaranty to you, so it can be used as and exhibit.

   b) Enron incoming Guaranty-  Enron currently receives a $10MM guaranty 
from Cinergy Corp which guaranty's Cinergy Marketing and Cinergy Capital for 
both  physical and financial products.  I allocated $2MM of this guaranty to 
the ISDA with a $2MM collateral threshold.  Chuck wanted to see their 
threshold  increased to $10MM.  I told them I would agree to this if we 
received an increase in their guaranty to allow for cushion for other 
business outside of this  ISDA.  He is going to put this requested increase 
to $12MM into their corporate office.  This being said, please increase the 
collateral threshold  for Cinergy Marketing to $10MM.

Can you please incorporate these changes into the ISDA, and once I hear that 
Chuck has confirmed the increase in the Guaranty amount to Enron I will 
notify you to send execution copy's to him, assuming all the legal issues 
have been resolved.

Regards,
Russell

Jon,

I had a glance over the written paper from Sullivan & Cromwell as to FX 
Transactions, and it seems to me that there would be fewer US regulatory 
issues (should there be any), if we were to use MG Brokers Inc, the FCM 
entity.  Are there any other reasons why we would not want to use this entity?

[Mark/Alan/Marcus - I have separately sent you by email the Sullivan & 
Cromwell paper]

Thanks.

Subject: FX Transactions

We received the attached from Sullivan & Cromwell re the FX business and the 
possibilities of using a US companyn which company to use for contract 
purposes. At a meeting here at MG today, the consensus/preference was not to 
use a UK company as we have no full ISD (chapter 10) firm nor the wish to 
change MG's status.

Per the advice from S&C, we like the idea of using a US corporation with a UK 
""arranger"" to cover any UK regulatory issues that arise. Dependent on where 
the business will end up (I understand to be discussed by Gary Hickerson/Mike 
Hutchinson 18th August), the following appears to be the among the logical 
solutions:

1. Contractual entity - either Enron North America, MG London Inc or Newco 
Inc.
2. Arranger - either EEFT Ltd, Metallgesellschaft Ltd or MG Brokers Ltd 
(depending on the effect on their chapter 3 status for the last two).

The current customer base consists of entities in the US, Canada, France, UK 
and Switzerland.

Please advise on any group/tax issues that can affect the final decision. If 
you need any further information, please let me know.

Many thanks.

To my knowledge, here is a list of individuals involved w/ the MG acquisition

(1) Justin Boyd 
(2) Lance Schuler
(3) Jon Barrett -- MG Ltd (London)  -- Justin had forwarded my e-mail inquiry 
to this person; phone # for MG London is (44-171-448-2244)
(4) Al Pennisi -- VP, MG London (New York) -- Jon's e-mail to Justin 
suggested further inquires re the NY office be directed to this person 
(212-715-2343)
(5) Linklater's -- Lance mentioned that this was outside counsel on the 
acquisition; I do not know whether any U.S. counsel was involved at all

If we need quick answers/action re preventing FCM/CTA disclosure requirements 
from burdening too far up the Enron corporate ladder, I suggest we put in a 
quick call to Ken Raisler "

Get ready...decimalization is coming soon!

Dear SARAH:

To bring the U.S. securities markets in line with foreign markets and
make the pricing easier to understand, the Securities Industry
Association and the Securities and Exchange Commission have agreed to
convert the existing U.S. stock and exchange-traded options markets
from fraction to decimal-based pricing. The SEC has recently mandated
that this project be initiated no later than September 5, 2000.

As of this date, it hasn't been decided whether stocks will be traded
in nickel or penny increments. The NYSE will begin testing the decimal
system in September with a group of 50 stocks traded to the penny,
while all others will continue to be quoted in fractions. To ensure
that the transition progresses smoothly, with no disruption to the
functioning of the market, other stocks and options will convert
gradually to decimal pricing over a period of six months.

What this means to you as an E*TRADE customer:

Decimalization means you'll soon see the prices for stocks and options
quoted the same way they are at the grocery store or the gas station:
$20.50 (not $20-1/2) and $35.25 (not $35-1/4). By April 1, 2001, every
price you see on your trade confirmations, statements, on the E*TRADE
Web site, in the newspapers, and on the stock tickers on television
will be expressed in decimals.

E*TRADE is prepared to do everything possible to make this transition
from fractions to decimals a smooth one. Beginning in August, we will
post more information about the conversion to decimal pricing on our
Web site. Please check regularly for updates.

As always, thank you for investing with E*TRADE. We look forward to
serving you for many years to come.

Sincerely,

Suzi White
E*TRADE Vice President, Service Quality

Gary, Trena,

The key points are:

1. Any FX business conducted from London must in most cases be done by or 
through a specifically authorised SFA-regulated entity.  None of the MG 
London entities is authorised to conduct this type of business.  The choices 
therefore are:

- Set up a new SFA-regulated entity specifically authorised to carry on this 
type of business (up to 6  months to implement)

- Change the current authorisation of the regulated MG London entities to 
permit this type of business (this would involve a material change to its 
current  authorisation )

- Consider using Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited (""EEFT""), which is 
SFA-regulated.  However, the approval of SFA would be required to   extend 
the scope of its current SFA authorisation to include this type of 
business.   Note also that EEFT Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited   
currently acts as agent only and not as principal - this is primarily for 
regulatory capital reasons for unregulated entity.  Any proposed extension 
of   EEFT's current authorisation must also be carefully considered in the 
light of the potential increased risk of consolidated supervision from a 
regulatory  capital perspective.

2. Enron carries on all of its current investment business with commercial 
enterprises, and not private individuals.  And there are good reasons for 
this.  From a legal and regulatory perspective, this exposes Enron to fewer 
potential risks and to a significantly lower degree of regulatory 
compliance.  If Enron were to carry on this business with private 
individuals, this would materially increase the level of regulatory 
compliance; it also may give the individual additional rights of recourse 
against Enron for breach of its regulatory duties, and could also expose 
Enron to a greater risk of potential claims as to existence of a special or 
fiduciary relationship between itself and the private individual.  There 
would therefore need to be an overwhelming commercial rationale to support 
the decision to take on private individuals as customers.

With respect to agricultural trade options, the CFTC has specifically said
that the swaps exemtion and the swaps policy statement are not available.
I will call you.

>>> <Sara.Shackleton@enron.com> 08/04 11:52 AM >>>

Ken:  In connection with our new product (and  absence of any physical
activity
in that product), I have the following question:

If neither ENA nor its counterparty is able to qualify as an offeree for
purposes of the Trade Option Exemption (17 CFR Sec. 32.13, as amended) but
each
is an eligible swap participant (or better yet, each party has $10 million
in
net worth as per Sec. 32.13) can the option still be exempt from CFTC
regulation
under the Swap Policy Statement or any CFTC interpretive letters?

I have concerns about not relying fully on the Trade Option Exemption but I
also
understood that the CFTC has informally said that the Swap Policy Statement
provides a safe harbor for both swaps and options.

I am available to speak at your convenience.  Thanks.  Sara [713/853-5620]

Subject: Foreign Exchange from a US entity

David

Further to our recent telephone conversation, we would be grateful if you 
would give us a brief written summary on the regulatory and/or legal issues 
governing a US corporation transacting foreign exchange with US and non-US 
customers. My basic understanding of our telephone conversation was that, as 
a non-bank, neither the Fed, the SEC nor the CFTC have any jurisdiction. 
However the Commodities Exchange Act prohibits us from contracting with 
certain types of counterparties.

The potential business we are looking at currently covers outright foreign 
exchange with counterparties such as banks, securities houses, funds, 
corporates and, possibly, high net worth individuals. The business also 
covers the provision of EFP facilities for these customers whereby they 
ultimately receive a currency futures position on the IMM division of the CME 
or on FINEX. This latter area is one where, from the Exchanges' points of 
view, we would effectively be acting as an executing broker.

I hope this brief description is enough for you to be able to respond but if 
you have any questions or would like further clarification, you can contact 
me by e-mail or by telephone on +44 20 7265 5421.

Thank you for your help in this.

Kind regards.

Jon Barrett

Subject: Re: Foreign Exchange from a US entity  

David

The US entity we're considering at the moment is an FCM, regulated by the 
CFTC and which is a member of NYMEX/COMEX. It currently clears the NY 
exchanges metals business for the group. It will probably be utilised to 
clear the NY exchange energy business following the Enron tie up. It may 
assist in clearing CSCE business but is unlikely at this stage to be looking 
to be a CSCE exchange member. 

It currently has capital of $2 million and subordinated debt of $20 million. 
Profits are generally paid out in the form of a dividend so although it may 
have a small amount of retained profit it won't be material. Currently it has 
about $10 million of regulatory capital requirements.

Depending on your advice, we may consider an un-regulated company with, at 
the moment, not very much capital. This latter point could be rectified, 
either with subordinated debt or capital injection. The EFP customer 
facilities (approximately 50% of the business) may prohibit this.

I hope this is enough info.

Best regards.

Jon

For example, is it currently regulated in any respect?  Is it, or will it be,

basic understanding of our telephone conversation was that, as a non-bank,
neither the Fed, the SEC nor the CFTC have any jurisdiction. However the
Commodities Exchange Act prohibits us from contracting with certain types of
counterparties.

The potential business we are looking at currently covers outright foreign
exchange with counterparties such as banks, securities houses, funds, 
corporates
and, possibly, high net worth individuals. The business also covers the
provision of EFP facilities for these customers whereby they ultimately 
receive
a currency futures position on the IMM division of the CME or on FINEX. This
latter area is one where, from the Exchanges' points of view, we would
effectively be acting as an executing broker.

I hope this brief description is enough for you to be able to respond but if 
you
have any questions or would like further clarification, you can contact me by
e-mail or by telephone on +44 20 7265 5421.

Thank you for your help in this.

Kind regards.

Subject: FX Transactions

We received the attached from Sullivan & Cromwell re the FX business and the 
possibilities of using a US companyn which company to use for contract 
purposes. At a meeting here at MG today, the consensus/preference was not to 
use a UK company as we have no full ISD (chapter 10) firm nor the wish to 
change MG's status.

Per the advice from S&C, we like the idea of using a US corporation with a UK 
""arranger"" to cover any UK regulatory issues that arise. Dependent on where 
the business will end up (I understand to be discussed by Gary Hickerson/Mike 
Hutchinson 18th August), the following appears to be the among the logical 
solutions:

1. Contractual entity - either Enron North America, MG London Inc or Newco 
Inc.
2. Arranger - either EEFT Ltd, Metallgesellschaft Ltd or MG Brokers Ltd 
(depending on the effect on their chapter 3 status for the last two).

The current customer base consists of entities in the US, Canada, France, UK 
and Switzerland.

Please advise on any group/tax issues that can affect the final decision. If 
you need any further information, please let me know.

Many thanks.

Subject: Re: FX Transactions  

Justin

Our understanding is that FX traded from the US is effectively unregulated. 
If we use MG London Inc, there would be the possibility that the CFTC would 
have some type of oversight on the unregulated business. Only the posting of 
the IMM EFPs needs to be done through the FCM.

There are other practical issues here in that that MG London Inc currently 
lacks the infrastructure needed to do the outright FX business as it has no 
bank FX lines and no bank accounts for all the currencies. There are other 
issues where the main settlements/back office expertise is here in London. 
These are obviously not insurmountable but we need to do a lot of work to get 
either MG London Inc or, for example, MG Newco Inc ready for the business. Is 
there an angle for using Enron North America, for example, as I understand 
they already have existing FX lines and settlements or would that be a 
non-starter? There are currently some UK and EU customers on Wolff's books 
who would need to be routed via an SFA regulated arranger. Will we be able to 
use EEFT for this?

Jon,

I had a glance over the written paper from Sullivan & Cromwell as to FX 
Transactions, and it seems to me that there would be fewer US regulatory 
issues (should there be any), if we were to use MG Brokers Inc, the FCM 
entity.  Are there any other reasons why we would not want to use this entity?

[Mark/Alan/Marcus - I have separately sent you by email the Sullivan & 
Cromwell paper]

Subject: Re: Foreign Exchange from a US entity  

David

The US entity we're considering at the moment is an FCM, regulated by the 
CFTC and which is a member of NYMEX/COMEX. It currently clears the NY 
exchanges metals business for the group. It will probably be utilised to 
clear the NY exchange energy business following the Enron tie up. It may 
assist in clearing CSCE business but is unlikely at this stage to be looking 
to be a CSCE exchange member. 

It currently has capital of $2 million and subordinated debt of $20 million. 
Profits are generally paid out in the form of a dividend so although it may 
have a small amount of retained profit it won't be material. Currently it has 
about $10 million of regulatory capital requirements.

Depending on your advice, we may consider an un-regulated company with, at 
the moment, not very much capital. This latter point could be rectified, 
either with subordinated debt or capital injection. The EFP customer 
facilities (approximately 50% of the business) may prohibit this.

I hope this is enough info.

Best regards.

Jon

Sara,

Can we trade with counter-parties in Chile??  We have a strong credit in 
Chile that wants to purchase an 18 month financial swap for newsprint.  See 
note below for more in.  Let me know what we need to do...

Thanks.

There might be a problem with the site only being in Spanish, but I know that 
credit here got S+P data on them.

Sending the Report tonight.

The following power point presentation graphically sets forth the steps

differs from that sent to several of you last week in that there are now 
dotted lines in red around those pieces of MG that are affected at each stage

where they wind up at each such stage - hopefully a more friendly on the eyes

Campbell is a hedge fund we have been pursuing for over a year now, but there 
have been two stumbling blocks to our trading with them. The first was that 
their funds were not setup to allow trading OTC instruments, only futures 
were allowed. Recently, they found away around that problem by reorganizing 
one of their domestic funds to authorize OTC instruments. One hurdle has been 
removed.

The second issue is Enron's credit rating. We need to help them get around a 
requirement for a minimum single A credit rating on counterparty risk. To do 
this, I would like to show them the credit arrangement we have with Tudor, 
i.e. a zero threshold and with mutual margining but including our ability to 
post letters of credit. Before we get to the ISDA negotiation phase, Campbell 
wants to see a sample of what the l/c would look like and the type of banks 
we would be using along with their credit ratings. Can you have a sample 
prepared for me without going the full step of preparing an ISDA draft?

I'm in Houston Friday morning and will drop by tomorrow morning to say hello. 
Perhaps we can discuss it then.

With best regards,

advised were final.  Samantha prepared final docs.  I looked them over just 
generally and signed off.  I am however asking Samantha to just check with 
you regarding the docs before we send to credit since they are Cayman/FX and

We are considering several online trading platforms for trading investment 
grade, high yield and convertible corporate bonds.  

The sites we are considering are as follows:

Market Axess & LIMITrader - I will send you documents for these sites today.

Buy Side Direct, for which documents are being reviewed by your group.

Trading Edge / Bond Link - The review of documents for this site was 
originally handled by George Weber, who has since forwarded these agreements 
to Carmen Ayala.

Thanks for your assistance in reviewing these documents.  Please let me know 
if I can provide additional information during your review.

The legal contact for Buy Side Direct is Michael Minnich at 415-369-5016.

Lisa O'Connor, our business contact, suggested that comments / issues be 
forwarded to her as Michael is out of the office today.  Lisa's #s are 
415-369-5020 (phone) and 415-369-5021 (fax).  Could you please copy me on any 
communication ?  

The clearing firm will be Weiss Peck & Greer, an affiliate / sub of 
Rabobank.  Lisa confirmed that the clearing firm will be the counterparty for 
all trades, allowing trading on an anonymous basis.  Lisa was not sure if the 
current agreement acknowledges the clearing firm's obligations in the event 
of a failed trade.  

I will review the document and call / email you with my comments shortly.

Thanks.

The following are my comments regarding the Buy Side Direct agreement:

4.6 Clarify justification for cancelling trades.  For example, user input 
error is not acceptable justification.    

4.7 Specify required lead time for Buy Side Direct to communicate changes in 
the agreement to subscribers ?

4.10 I do not have an objection to this clause.

8. Per section 5, subscriber is obligated to settle trades based on 
information subscriber inputs to system.  However, section 8 references no 
obligation on the part of Buy Side Direct to settle a trade in the event the 
other counterparty does not.  Given that the system will be anonymous, with 
Buy Side Direct acting as the counterparty for all trades, this obligation 
should be referenced.  (However, the agreements for all of the internet 
trading sites we are considering also appear to be silent on this issue.)   

 Buy Side Direct should be responsible for the accuracy of order and trade 
terms.

12. Should the agreement specify how and / or to whom Buy Side Direct will 
communicate material changes ?

17. Jurisdiction:  My understanding is that Enron's 1st choice is Texas but 
that we would accept New York.

Sheila, Madhur and I are scheduled to speak Monday morning regarding 
involving Risk Control and Credit in the evaluation process.

Thanks.

The IT Contract group has been involved in reviewing documents for Trading 
Edge's Bond Link online bond trading site.  George Weber, who has since moved 
into another area, discussed various issues with Trading Edge early this 
year.  Laine Borgman, a contract administrator in the IT Contracts group, has 
become involved in the Trading Edge review during the past week.  Attached 
below are Trading Edge agreements and their responses to issues raised by IT 
Contracts.  

The primary issues Laine and I discussed yesterday are as follows:

Jurisdiction:   
Our preference is Texas, but we would accept New York.  Trading Edge's 
response is unclear, although I believe they will readily agree to New York.

Indemnification (similar to issues with Buy Side Direct):  
Agreement assigns no liability to 3rd parties which the agreement describes 
as ""providers of software"".  As Trading Edge is the nominal counterparty for 
all trades, this may be acceptable if the agreement held Trading Edge liable 
for settling trades.  However, I do not see where section 11 addresses 
Trading Edge's liability for trades.   
We would also like assurances / liability regarding the accuracy of order and 
trade information.  

Limits of Liability:
Review language in both the Access and TIPs agreements (per Trading Edge, 
they will not agree to modify the TIPs Agreement, which is dictated by a 3rd 
party).

Assignment:  
Trading Edge's agreement does not allow Enron to assign the agreement to 
other parties.  Initially, only EnronCredit.com personnel in Houston and 
possibly London would use Trading Edge's site, so this would not be an issue 
initially.  Although we would prefer that the ability to assign be included, 
this issue could be addressed later as needed.
 
Electronic Mail (#18):
We do not want to accept email communication in the event of a lawsuit.  From 
the tone of their previous response, I believe they will agree to include 
lawsuits in the definition of extraordinary matters, for which email will not 
be employed.  

Sara, how would you suggest we proceed with the Trading Edge review ?  I will 
speak with Sheila Glover regarding the involvement of Credit and Risk Control 
in our request to utilize Trading Edge's trading platform.

Thanks.

Attached are revised drafts of the proposed Schedule and Addendum, marked to
show changes from the most recent draft you reviewed.  I believe that we
have implemented most of the changes you suggested.

Although I have discussed most of the changes with Kim Noble, she may have
additional or different thoughts.

We are still in the process of reviewing the form of Enron guaranty, and
will come back to you with comments shortly.

We look forward to hearing from you at your early convenience.

Mike and Sara,

There is generally ""no give"" on the Enron language regarding affiliates 
language which I have provided below.  

""The following entities shall also be deemed to be included in the term 
Subscriber and shall have the right to use the Service:  Subscriber's 
wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliated companies and those affiliated 
companies in which Subscriber or one of its subsidiaries or affiliated 
companies own an equity interest and which is under the direct or indirect 
control of Subscriber or one of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies.  
Furthermore, Subscriber shall also be allowed to have any agent or third 
party service company or facility manager of Subscriber's IT functions to 
assist it to the degree necesssary so that the Subscriber can fully access 
and utilize the Service.""

I will be happy to discuss any procedures we utilize and/or provisions in the 
document.   It is also my understanding that Mike is expecting more contracts 
of this nature so standardized and acceptable language will be to our 
advantage.  Sara, our legal counsel is Mark Holsworth and he is ""charged with 
reviewing all the IP documents"".  

Let me hear from you soon.

Subject: FX Transactions

We received the attached from Sullivan & Cromwell re the FX business and the 
possibilities of using a US companyn which company to use for contract 
purposes. At a meeting here at MG today, the consensus/preference was not to 
use a UK company as we have no full ISD (chapter 10) firm nor the wish to 
change MG's status.

Per the advice from S&C, we like the idea of using a US corporation with a UK 
""arranger"" to cover any UK regulatory issues that arise. Dependent on where 
the business will end up (I understand to be discussed by Gary Hickerson/Mike 
Hutchinson 18th August), the following appears to be the among the logical 
solutions:

1. Contractual entity - either Enron North America, MG London Inc or Newco 
Inc.
2. Arranger - either EEFT Ltd, Metallgesellschaft Ltd or MG Brokers Ltd 
(depending on the effect on their chapter 3 status for the last two).

The current customer base consists of entities in the US, Canada, France, UK 
and Switzerland.

Please advise on any group/tax issues that can affect the final decision. If 
you need any further information, please let me know.

Many thanks.

Hello, Justin and Jon, this is Bob Bruce with the Enron North America legal 
department in Houston.  Sara and I were wondering about a few things; perhaps 
David Gilberg or someone else is already addressing these issues --

(1) Given MG London's status as a licensed FCM and CTA, did Enron's 
acquisition of MG require any CFTC filing?  If so, Sara and I would like to 
get a copy of the filing.

(2) Sara and I were also curious as to whether, or to what extent, CFTC 
licensing/registration/disclosure requirements may apply ""upward"" to any 
Enron entities or their officers.

Please let us know if you can shed any light on these areas, or if there is 
someone else we should be checking with on these matters.  Thanks -- Bob"

Everyday heroes are all around us at Enron, living our core values of 
Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence in everything they do.  Some 
of these heroes make a big splash while others just quietly make a difference 
in the workplace around them.  Either way, these special individuals deserve 
to be recognized with a nomination for the 2000 Chairman's Award.

As there is more than just one employee living the values at Enron, this 
award program will honor 10 employees as members of the Chairman's 
Roundtable.  From that group, the one individual most embodying our values 
will be presented with the Chairman's Award at the Management Conference in 
San Antonio in November.

The beauty of this award program is that it is completely employee-driven 
from beginning to end.  From your nominations, an international employee 
committee will select the Chairman's Roundtable and eventually, the 
Chairman's Award winner.  Your role of nominating our everyday heroes is 
extremely vital to the program's success.  If someone has made a positive 
impression on you, please take the time to complete a nomination form and 
send it to Charla Reese by October 1, 2000.  You may click here for a 
printable form:  http://home.enron.com/announce/chairman_nom/form3.doc

For more information on the Chairman's Award, including details on last 
year's Roundtable members and previous winners, Repit Suliyono and Bobbye 
Brown, please click here: http://home.enron.com/announce/chairman_nom

Again, this is a very special award at Enron and we sincerely thank you for 
your participation.

Ken, Jeff and Joe"

As far as MG's business is concerned from NYC and the US, the legal support

I would very much appreciate your support re: other legal issues, CFTC, etc

I am not aware of the nuances of copper trading!  However, I left a message 
earlier this morning to find out from the MG lawyer.  I haven't heard back.  
The deal ticket should provide for the premium payment date and, if not, I 
would use our standard language.  Sara

On copper option trades, do you know when the premium is usually due?  Does 
the standard 2 days rule still applies to this commodity?

amendment pertaining to FX transactions and move forward with the threshold

Sara,

I hope you have now received instructions from your commercial swaps team to 
put together an ISDA  currency swap and confirm which ECT Corp will be 
providing to either Enron Europe Power 3 Limited or a subsidiary of that 
company. The subsidiary will be receiving dollars under a bond issue and 
paying pounds out (a spot transaction I believe) but will then receive pounds 
income which it will need to convert to dollars to pay interest on the bonds.

The precedent document is the Sutton Bridge currency swap.

Can you please confirm you have been instructed and let us know your timing 
for issuing a document.  The sooner we can see this next week the better.

The bond trustee will as usual require the swap to be backed with legal 
opinions from Enron in-house counsel (Mark Haedicke) re due execution and 
from V&E (Terry Yates) re enforceability. My understanding is that the swap 
will not be guaranteed by Corp (correct Julian?).

Linklaters are representing Enron - Julian Davies and Fran Xavier (tel: 171 
456 2000). Could you please send them your fax, telephone and email details. 
Linklaters have kindly agreed to prepare a first draft of the Mark Haedicke 
opinion and to send it out to you Sara.

Thank  you. I look forward to hearing from you.


     Mark

Our understanding is that FX traded from the US is effectively unregulated. 
If we use MG London Inc, there would be the possibility that the CFTC would 
have some type of oversight on the unregulated business. Only the posting of 
the IMM EFPs needs to be done through the FCM.

There are other practical issues here in that that MG London Inc currently 
lacks the infrastructure needed to do the outright FX business as it has no 
bank FX lines and no bank accounts for all the currencies. There are other 
issues where the main settlements/back office expertise is here in London. 
These are obviously not insurmountable but we need to do a lot of work to get 
either MG London Inc or, for example, MG Newco Inc ready for the business. Is 
there an angle for using Enron North America, for example, as I understand 
they already have existing FX lines and settlements or would that be a 
non-starter? There are currently some UK and EU customers on Wolff's books 
who would need to be routed via an SFA regulated arranger. Will we be able to 
use EEFT for this?

Jon,

I had a glance over the written paper from Sullivan & Cromwell as to FX 
Transactions, and it seems to me that there would be fewer US regulatory 
issues (should there be any), if we were to use MG Brokers Inc, the FCM 
entity.  Are there any other reasons why we would not want to use this entity?

[Mark/Alan/Marcus - I have separately sent you by email the Sullivan & 
Cromwell paper]

Thanks.

Subject: FX Transactions

We received the attached from Sullivan & Cromwell re the FX business and the 
possibilities of using a US companyn which company to use for contract 
purposes. At a meeting here at MG today, the consensus/preference was not to 
use a UK company as we have no full ISD (chapter 10) firm nor the wish to 
change MG's status.

Per the advice from S&C, we like the idea of using a US corporation with a UK 
""arranger"" to cover any UK regulatory issues that arise. Dependent on where 
the business will end up (I understand to be discussed by Gary Hickerson/Mike 
Hutchinson 18th August), the following appears to be the among the logical 
solutions:

1. Contractual entity - either Enron North America, MG London Inc or Newco 
Inc.
2. Arranger - either EEFT Ltd, Metallgesellschaft Ltd or MG Brokers Ltd 
(depending on the effect on their chapter 3 status for the last two).

The current customer base consists of entities in the US, Canada, France, UK 
and Switzerland.

Please advise on any group/tax issues that can affect the final decision. If 
you need any further information, please let me know.

Many thanks.

Subject: Re: Foreign Exchange from a US entity  

David

The US entity we're considering at the moment is an FCM, regulated by the 
CFTC and which is a member of NYMEX/COMEX. It currently clears the NY 
exchanges metals business for the group. It will probably be utilised to 
clear the NY exchange energy business following the Enron tie up. It may 
assist in clearing CSCE business but is unlikely at this stage to be looking 
to be a CSCE exchange member. 

It currently has capital of $2 million and subordinated debt of $20 million. 
Profits are generally paid out in the form of a dividend so although it may 
have a small amount of retained profit it won't be material. Currently it has 
about $10 million of regulatory capital requirements.

Depending on your advice, we may consider an un-regulated company with, at 
the moment, not very much capital. This latter point could be rectified, 
either with subordinated debt or capital injection. The EFP customer 
facilities (approximately 50% of the business) may prohibit this.

I hope this is enough info.

Best regards.

Jon

Thanks.  I will prepare a memo.  One question on your e-mail -- can you give 
me a bit more information about the US entity that will be the FX dealer?  
For example, is it currently regulated in any respect?  Is it, or will it be, 
engaged in any other businesses?  How large is it in terms of assets or net 
worth?  Thanks.  I'll get back to you soon.

Further to our recent telephone conversation, we would be grateful if you 
would
give us a brief written summary on the regulatory and/or legal issues 
governing
a US corporation transacting foreign exchange with US and non-US customers. My
basic understanding of our telephone conversation was that, as a non-bank,
neither the Fed, the SEC nor the CFTC have any jurisdiction. However the
Commodities Exchange Act prohibits us from contracting with certain types of
counterparties.

The potential business we are looking at currently covers outright foreign
exchange with counterparties such as banks, securities houses, funds, 
corporates
and, possibly, high net worth individuals. The business also covers the
provision of EFP facilities for these customers whereby they ultimately 
receive
a currency futures position on the IMM division of the CME or on FINEX. This
latter area is one where, from the Exchanges' points of view, we would
effectively be acting as an executing broker.

I hope this brief description is enough for you to be able to respond but if 
you
have any questions or would like further clarification, you can contact me by
e-mail or by telephone on +44 20 7265 5421.

Thank you for your help in this.

All:  I am trying to determine what issues are currently being addressed with 
respect to MG London, Inc. from a U.S. regulatory perspective and WHO is 
addressing them.  My concern arises from questions I am being asked by Gary 
Hickerson's group regarding FX trading AND (agricultural) trading where the 
existence of an Enron FCM or CTA could become significant.  I will try to 
have a short call arranged so that we can all understand the planned course 
of action, etc.  I realize that other individuals may be involved and we can 
include them as necessary.  Thanks.  Sara"

I thought either or both of you would be best placed to assist Bob Bruce with 
this request.

 Would you be kind enough to see what documents we have which may throw some 
light on MG's licensed status.
As to whether any licensing/registration/disclosure requirements may apply 
""upward"" to any Enron entity, Edmund do you know whether the MG parent 
company was so obligated?

Hello, Justin and Jon, this is Bob Bruce with the Enron North America legal 
department in Houston.  Sara and I were wondering about a few things; perhaps 
David Gilberg or someone else is already addressing these issues --

(1) Given MG London's status as a licensed FCM and CTA, did Enron's 
acquisition of MG require any CFTC filing?  If so, Sara and I would like to 
get a copy of the filing.

(2) Sara and I were also curious as to whether, or to what extent, CFTC 
licensing/registration/disclosure requirements may apply ""upward"" to any 
Enron entities or their officers.

Please let us know if you can shed any light on these areas, or if there is 
someone else we should be checking with on these matters.  Thanks -- Bob

Attached are revised drafts of the proposed Schedule and Addendum, marked to
show changes from the most recent draft you reviewed.  I believe that we
have implemented most of the changes you suggested.

Although I have discussed most of the changes with Kim Noble, she may have
additional or different thoughts.

We are still in the process of reviewing the form of Enron guaranty, and
will come back to you with comments shortly.

We look forward to hearing from you at your early convenience.

Best regards.

Does this mean we have an ISDA and it is just being revised, so I can 
theoretically do a deal with them.

I also sent an email to Jason Peters ( don't know if he's still around) 
regarding the ABN Amro futures agreement. Do you know anything about this one?

Charles,

I would be grateful if you could respond to me as referred to below, namely:

Provide a copy of the CFTC filing.

Confirm whether any CFTC licensing/registration/disclosure requirements 
applied ""upward"" to any Enron entities or their officers - I assume not.

Thanks.

I have just recently become involved on the metals side of things for the US

question.

If there is anything I can do to help you let me know. I will be in NYC later 
this week to meet the metals traders.

All:  I am trying to determine what issues are currently being addressed with

addressing them.  My concern arises from questions I am being asked by Gary 
Hickerson's group regarding FX trading AND (agricultural) trading where the 
existence of an Enron FCM or CTA could become significant.  I will try to 
have a short call arranged so that we can all understand the planned course 
of action, etc.  I realize that other individuals may be involved and we can 
include them as necessary.  Thanks.  Sara

I am requesting that online trading agreements be executed with the following 
bond trading platforms which we are evaluating:

         Site   Initial Corporate Bond Categories *       Type  Site Status

Buy Side Direct   Convertibles (+ Equity Hedge)  ** Cross Matching  Aug 15th 
Launch

Trading Edge / Bond Link High Yield, Convertibles   Cross Matching  Live

LIMITrader   High Yield, Convertibles   Cross Matching  Live

Market Axess   Investment Grade   Multi-Dealer ***  August Launch
        
*   Additional corporate bond categories may be added in the future.  For 
example, Market Axess expects to add high yield and convertible bonds within 
3  to 6 months.   

** John Greene is aware that convertible bond transactions through Buy Side 
Direct will involve offsetting equity hedges.

*** We have execution agreements in place with all current Market Axess 
dealers.

Potential benefits offered by online sites include trading flows and improved 
execution efficiency.  In addition, these sites provide opportunities for 
generating demand for EnronCredit.com credit derivatives, given that users of 
these sites are buyers or sellers of corporate credit risk.  The ability to 
trade will greatly enhance our evaluation of these sites.  

As noted above, 3 of the 4 sites are cross-matching, where trading is 
completely anonymous and the site's sponsor or clearing firm are the nominal 
counterparty for all trades.   One of the 4 sites will be a multi-dealer 
system where counterparties transact directly with a particular dealer. 

Trades for all sites would be cleared through prime brokers with whom we have 
existing agreements.

As you suggested, we should ensure that agreements with online trading 
platforms allow for trading by ENA, ECT Investments and EnronCredit.com.   My 
understanding is that Sheila's group would coordinate the opening of any 
additional accounts required to facilitate trading by each entity.

I suggest that Madhur Dayal be designated initially at the person to receive 
notification of material changes to agreements.  We should retain the ability 
to change this contact person.

Thanks.

Mike

Sara-

I propose the following steps to get through the final hurdle and be able to 
wrap up this Sisyphusian exercise.

I would like to have sample Equity Forward contracts amended for our 
registration language and any other items that you feel should be changed 
generated for ML, CSFB, BS (you can leave out the trade details). You can 
take their sample confirmations and change them.
I will then take the confirmations to Ryan Siurek and have him check the 
settlement language to make sure that they meet the new accounting guidelines.
We can incorporate Ryan's changes and then send the samples to the 
appropriate Investment Bank for their comments.
If everything checks out, we can then fill in the commercial terms for all 
the forwards completed to date.

I thinkthat this would simplify the whole process as we focus on 3 
confimation templates and not the many different trades with the various 
banks.

Call me to discuss any change to my plan.

Thanks

J

Have you followed up on our solution of sending cash in respect of our
credit requirements? (We are actually thinking that you could withhold a
couple of monthly payments to IPP (currently $680,000/month) in respect of
JDI's requirement. We would provide a letter approving this.)

Mark:  I scheduled a meeting with you at 4:30 pm today to discuss the MG 
acquisition, in particular, MG London, Inc. (a U.S REGULATED NYMEX clearing 
member, FCM, CTA).  NO ONE is looking into this from a US regulatory/legal 
perspective and I think it should be the swap group.  Enron's ""regulated"" 
product areas are metals (since MG clears its own trades on the NYMEX/COMEX 
and has FCM/CTA status) and potentially agriculture if we (some Enron entity) 
choose to become a regulated ""ATOM"" (ag trade option merchant).  From a legal 
perspective, I think we should have a ""whitepaper"" drafted by Sullivan & 
Cromwell, and, it should include an analysis of the MG London, Inc. existing 
situation.  This would tie into the ag regulation.  Also, have you thought 
about ENA and MG as NYMEX members and whether we keep both designations, 
whether we move all/part of ENA's existing clearing business to MG (and 
perhaps eliminate the need for margin/brokering arrangements such as Paribas, 
etc.) and any other related issues?  For efficiency purposes, Donna Lowry has 
asked to join us.  Donna and I had a conference call this morning with 
Justin, Paul, Jon Barrett, Sheila Glover and Trena McFarland to figure out 
who's on first (with MG).

Also, I am attaching an update of my workload.  I have reached the breaking 
point and I need more help (even with Jason's help on brokerage agreements 
the new electronic trading platform agreements are reaching multiple 
proportions with a new request for agreements for ENA, ECT Investments and 
EnronCredit.com London).  Gareth and Craig Clark want to meet today about the 
prepay (Delta/Citibank) and I REALLY need help on the Global Finance side.

See you later.  Sara

I am requesting that online trading agreements be executed with the following 
bond trading platforms which we are evaluating:

         Site   Initial Corporate Bond Categories *       Type  Site Status

Buy Side Direct   Convertibles (+ Equity Hedge)  ** Cross Matching  Aug 15th 
Launch

Trading Edge / Bond Link High Yield, Convertibles   Cross Matching  Live

LIMITrader   High Yield, Convertibles   Cross Matching  Live

Market Axess   Investment Grade   Multi-Dealer ***  August Launch
        
*   Additional corporate bond categories may be added in the future.  For 
example, Market Axess expects to add high yield and convertible bonds within 
3  to 6 months.   

** John Greene is aware that convertible bond transactions through Buy Side 
Direct will involve offsetting equity hedges.

*** We have execution agreements in place with all current Market Axess 
dealers.

Potential benefits offered by online sites include trading flows and improved 
execution efficiency.  In addition, these sites provide opportunities for 
generating demand for EnronCredit.com credit derivatives, given that users of 
these sites are buyers or sellers of corporate credit risk.  The ability to 
trade will greatly enhance our evaluation of these sites.  

As noted above, 3 of the 4 sites are cross-matching, where trading is 
completely anonymous and the site's sponsor or clearing firm are the nominal 
counterparty for all trades.   One of the 4 sites will be a multi-dealer 
system where counterparties transact directly with a particular dealer. 

Trades for all sites would be cleared through prime brokers with whom we have 
existing agreements.

As you suggested, we should ensure that agreements with online trading 
platforms allow for trading by ENA, ECT Investments and EnronCredit.com.   My 
understanding is that Sheila's group would coordinate the opening of any 
additional accounts required to facilitate trading by each entity.

I suggest that Madhur Dayal be designated initially at the person to receive 
notification of material changes to agreements.  We should retain the ability 
to change this contact person.

Thanks.

The interest component was eliminated from the terms of this Transaction (as 
was the switch from a price return swap to a total return swap and the name 
change).  It seems that Ben and Scott S. had a subsequent conversation (after 
ours) and the agreed changes were communicated to me.  SS

All:  Attached are the following docs:
 (1)  Talon I LLC/Harrier I LLC equity swap confirm
 (2)  Harrier I LLC/EBS Investments, L.L.C. equity swap confirm
 (3)  revised ISDA Master Agreement Schedule for Harrier I LLC and EBS 
Investments, L.L.C.

Please review and provide me with your comments.  I do not have all necessary 
address and account information.
The swaps are subject to the  ISDA 1996 Equity Derivatives Definitions.  
Section 7.4 (of those Definitions) contains the payment obligations and 
provides that the Equity Amount Payer pays a positive Equity Amount and ""the 
other party"" pays the absolute value of a negative Equity Amount.  Also, I 
believe that Accounting Issue 00-19 is inapplicable to this Total Return Swap 
or else we may have issues with the ""Extraordinary Events"" elections.

A ""generic"" address may be more appropriate.  Which agreement did we recently 
sign with reference to the ""Documentation Desk""?  Sara

Mike and Sara,

There is generally ""no give"" on the Enron language regarding affiliates 
language which I have provided below.  

""The following entities shall also be deemed to be included in the term 
Subscriber and shall have the right to use the Service:  Subscriber's 
wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliated companies and those affiliated 
companies in which Subscriber or one of its subsidiaries or affiliated 
companies own an equity interest and which is under the direct or indirect 
control of Subscriber or one of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies.  
Furthermore, Subscriber shall also be allowed to have any agent or third 
party service company or facility manager of Subscriber's IT functions to 
assist it to the degree necesssary so that the Subscriber can fully access 
and utilize the Service.""

I will be happy to discuss any procedures we utilize and/or provisions in the 
document.   It is also my understanding that Mike is expecting more contracts 
of this nature so standardized and acceptable language will be to our 
advantage.  Sara, our legal counsel is Mark Holsworth and he is ""charged with 
reviewing all the IP documents"".  

Let me hear from you soon.

Mike,

Checking on the status of getting Stephanie Panus, a new paralegal in our 
Group, full edit access to the referenced database.

Also, we need to get some additional people full edit access:  Matt Dawson, 
who just started in London Legal, and David Minns, a lawyer in our Australia 
office.  Can you let me and each of these people know when they have access.

Thanks!"

Shane:  Here's the scoop

(1)  ENA has an existing ISDA Master Agreement with Citibank N.A.. dated as 
of November 17, 1992.  The Master is not restricted to any particular type of 
transaction but it clearly anticipates commodity and rate swaps.  ENA is the 
Calculation Agent.  Also, only commodity transactions are netted.

(2)  Citibank proposed an amendment to this Master in February, 2000.  The 
amendment was primarily to amend the collateral annex to INCREASE the 
collateral threshold to USD 30 million for BBB (and above) rated entities.  
It also states Citibank to be ""multibranch"" with NY and London offices acting 
under the Master.  Apparently, the proposed FX language to be added to the 
Master was dropped (I think in the interest of time).  Mollie Harris in 
credit is trying to have Citibank sign the amendment.

(3)  ABN Amro is in my office ready for signature.  I will have it executed 
and email you when done.  Samantha Boyd (Ext.39188) will help me with the 
followup.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Sara,

Does this mean we have an ISDA and it is just being revised, so I can 
theoretically do a deal with them.

I also sent an email to Jason Peters ( don't know if he's still around) 
regarding the ABN Amro futures agreement. Do you know anything about this one?

Regards,

Shane

??????? Please find attached, for your review, Amendments to each of the 
currently outstanding Delta Notes, together with forms of Consent to such 
Amendments. These Amendments are needed in order to ensure that the Delta III 
transaction does not violate the negative covenants of the oustanding Delta 
Notes. Note that I have also attached a blacklined document with respect to 
each Amendment (the current version blacklined against a composite document) 
in order to highlight the alterations made to the definitions in each of the 
Delta Notes.

??????? Please note that these documents remain subject to further internal 
review.? The Remainder of the Delta III documents will follow.

??????? Please direct questions or comments regarding the attached documents 
to Mike Dunn at (212) 530-5435.? Best Regards.

After having conducted our first of several business reviews, Enron Global 
Markets - Office of the Chairman would like to outline the following 
organizational changes effective immediately.

The Global Risk Markets group under Jere Overdyke illustrates enormous

different commercial functions and to capture market share and value, the 
group is being realigned.  Jere will continue to manage Global Risk Markets 
and build on our insurance capabilities.  Mark Tawney is responsible for our 
weather business and will now report to the EGM Office of the Chairman.  

Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President of 
Operations and Chief Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of 
the Chairman, and to Sally Beck, Vice President of Global Risk Management 
Operations.  In his role as Chief Accounting Officer, Brent will also report 
to Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for 
Enron Corp.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila Glover, 
business controller for Financial Products; Todd Hall, business controller 
for weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for global products and 
coal.  In addition, Tom Myers will join Brent's management team as Director 
of Accounting.  Brent and his team are responsible for all accounting, risk 
reporting and trading operations for all the businesses within EGM.

Sara,

Further to our telephone conversation last week, I would be grateful if you 
could
let me have your comments on the revised draft ISDA documentation sent 
through to
you.

We are very keen to finalise the ISDA and CSA as soon as possible next week. I
look forward to hearing from you.

Regards
Megan Duffill

All:  I have once again revised the confirm for the EBS Raptor deal.  There 
will be only one swap transaction:  Harrier I LLC/Talon I LLC.   
Please note the following changes:

(1)  the Initial Equity Notional Amount has been corrected
(2)  I have expanded the definition of Cash Dividends
(3)  I have ADDED a provison for ""Payment Obligations"" to avoid confusion for 
those of you unfamiliar with the 1996 Equity Definitions.  Since I have 
removed the interest payment feature, the only payments changing hands will 
be upside/dividends and downside.  The ""Equity Amount Payer"" pays the upside 
(difference between Initial Price (on the relevant Valuation Date) and Final 
Price) and dividends; the other party pays the downside.
(4)  I have retained the concept of multiple optional termination dates.
(5) Kevin:  I NEED the Harrier account/notice information.

This confirm should serve as a template for additional Raptor equity share 
swaps so please review and comment.  Thanks.  Sara

Thanks for your response John, I think it provides the clarification that we 
need to move forward.
I have one further question for you relating to current ISDA/exchange 
agreements that we have in place in Enron Japan.

Below are all exisiting ISDA and brokerage agreements that Financial trading 
currently has in place. Does Enron Japan have any ISDA/broker agreements in 
place that we can use for the purpose of executing financial trades?  
(perhaps with some of the names on the attached list?)If so, do you know what 
sort of credit has been extended and/or whether there is netting versus other 
commodity books or dedicated activity credit?

If we do not have any agreements in place which would allow us to conduct 
trades, do you know who I should contact regarding necessary documentation?

Sincerely,
Darren

Darren-

Currently, we have three ISDA Master Agreements under process.  Our potential 
counterparties are Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co., The Industrial Bank 
of Japan and Sanwa Bank Ltd.  We have produced these documents based on the

Thanks for your response John, I think it provides the clarification that we 
need to move forward.
I have one further question for you relating to current ISDA/exchange 
agreements that we have in place in Enron Japan.

Below are all exisiting ISDA and brokerage agreements that Financial trading 
currently has in place. Does Enron Japan have any ISDA/broker agreements in 
place that we can use for the purpose of executing financial trades?  
(perhaps with some of the names on the attached list?)If so, do you know what 
sort of credit has been extended and/or whether there is netting versus other 
commodity books or dedicated activity credit?

If we do not have any agreements in place which would allow us to conduct 
trades, do you know who I should contact regarding necessary documentation?

Sincerely,
Darren

Ted, Bill and Sara,
ECT Investments Inc. is wanting to establish execution only agreements for 
on-line trading for the Convertble and credit books.  These services are new 
and the trading desk wants to be able to utilize.  
We will establish only one relationship with ECT Investments Inc. at this 
time and all clearance will be done through our prime brokers.  [Books are

I'm working with Sara on legal issues related to Buy Side Direct.  Is my 
understanding correct that approval from Risk Control and Credit is required 
to initiate trading, and that you are requesting their approval for Buy Side 
Direct as well as the other sites listed below ? 

Please let me know if I should be involved in this process.  Any feedback 
regarding expected timing of this approval would also be appreciated.

Thanks.

Dayal/HOU/ECT@ECT 

Subject: Online Trading Platforms

I am requesting that online trading agreements be executed with the following 
bond trading platforms which we are evaluating:

         Site   Initial Corporate Bond Categories *       Type  Site Status

Buy Side Direct   Convertibles (+ Equity Hedge)  ** Cross Matching  Aug 15th 
Launch

Trading Edge / Bond Link High Yield, Convertibles   Cross Matching  Live

LIMITrader   High Yield, Convertibles   Cross Matching  Live

Market Axess   Investment Grade   Multi-Dealer ***  August Launch
        
*   Additional corporate bond categories may be added in the future.  For 
example, Market Axess expects to add high yield and convertible bonds within 
3  to 6 months.   

** John Greene is aware that convertible bond transactions through Buy Side 
Direct will involve offsetting equity hedges.

*** We have execution agreements in place with all current Market Axess 
dealers.

Potential benefits offered by online sites include trading flows and improved 
execution efficiency.  In addition, these sites provide opportunities for 
generating demand for EnronCredit.com credit derivatives, given that users of 
these sites are buyers or sellers of corporate credit risk.  The ability to 
trade will greatly enhance our evaluation of these sites.  

As noted above, 3 of the 4 sites are cross-matching, where trading is 
completely anonymous and the site's sponsor or clearing firm are the nominal 
counterparty for all trades.   One of the 4 sites will be a multi-dealer 
system where counterparties transact directly with a particular dealer. 

Trades for all sites would be cleared through prime brokers with whom we have 
existing agreements.

As you suggested, we should ensure that agreements with online trading 
platforms allow for trading by ENA, ECT Investments and EnronCredit.com.   My 
understanding is that Sheila's group would coordinate the opening of any 
additional accounts required to facilitate trading by each entity.

I suggest that Madhur Dayal be designated initially at the person to receive 
notification of material changes to agreements.  We should retain the ability 
to change this contact person.

Thanks.

Mike

Currently, we have three ISDA Master Agreements under process.  Our potential 
counterparties are Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co., The Industrial Bank 
of Japan and Sanwa Bank Ltd.  We have produced these documents based on the 
credit worksheets prepared in Houston and in conjunction with Baker &

I am not aware of any brokerage arrangements to which Enron Japan Corp. is a

Hi Jeff,

Per our conversation this afternoon, I have attached the draft forward
purchase termsheet and forward transaction confirmation template for your
review.  Please give us a call to discuss terminating the Total Return Swap
as of Friday, 08/04/2000, and entering into a forward purchase contract at
your earliest convenience.

If you have any questions or need additional information, please let us
know.  We are looking forward to speaking with you soon!

Is it possible to get electronic file for the Enron North America and Peoples

Molly,

Could you send me an electronic version of the ISDA that was signed between
ENA and PEC. I understand from our attorney that we did not work with an
electronic version, only a hard copy. In order to create an ISDA template
for MEH, I need the electronic version.

Thanks

Please give Sara the bank account details for Harrier I. She needs this for 
the swap confirmation.

Sara, 

I sent you the pages from the Schedule that has Harrier's notice information.

Further to Mary's memo of 8/18/00, I would like to add the following comments:

(1)  I initially drafted the share swap confirm as a PRICE RETURN swap.  
Scott then requested a TOTAL RETURN swap (ie, dividends included).  I met 
with accounting this morning and (Ryan believes that) the swap is price 
return only:  the asset holder is only swapping price exposure and the 
business unit should recognize the immediate dividend benefit to its asset.

PLEASE VERIFY WHETHER THE SHARE SWAPS ARE PRICE RETURN OR TOTAL RETURN

(2)  With respect to the right of ""multiple optional partial swap 
terminations"", please verify that:
 (a)  the business unit has the right to request that Harrier partially 
terminate the swap prior to the scheduled termination, any number of times, 
without restriction as to frequency, minimum or maximum number of shares, or 
any other limitation, irrespective of whether the asset owner actually sells 
the underlying shares.  How is this right of termination (and the multiple 
requests) to be documented?
 (b)  the ""Initial Price"" of the shares on the Effective Date of the swap 
WILL ALWAYS BE USED to calculate the gain or loss (vs. using the share price 
on the date of each partial termination)"

(2)  Have you thought about electronic notice provisions?  Shouldn't 
default/termination notices be in writing to the appropriate counsel/Corp. 
secretary?  And, can we agree to ""electronic notices"" at all?  There is no 
electronic address for a Documentation Desk or Assistant General Counsel.  I 
am seeing this type of provision in electronic trading agreements.

Darren-

Currently, we have three ISDA Master Agreements under process.  Our potential 
counterparties are Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co., The Industrial Bank 
of Japan and Sanwa Bank Ltd.  We have produced these documents based on the 
credit worksheets prepared in Houston and in conjunction with Baker & 
McKenzie, Tokyo.  Mark Taylor is reviewing the drafts prior to presenting 
them to the potential counterparties.

I am not aware of any brokerage arrangements to which Enron Japan Corp. is a 
party.  I note that I have copied Jonathan Whitehead on this correspondence, 
as he may be able to provide insight regarding plans for entering into such 
arrangements.

Best regards,

John

Thanks for your response John, I think it provides the clarification that we 
need to move forward.
I have one further question for you relating to current ISDA/exchange 
agreements that we have in place in Enron Japan.

Below are all exisiting ISDA and brokerage agreements that Financial trading 
currently has in place. Does Enron Japan have any ISDA/broker agreements in 
place that we can use for the purpose of executing financial trades?  
(perhaps with some of the names on the attached list?)If so, do you know what 
sort of credit has been extended and/or whether there is netting versus other 
commodity books or dedicated activity credit?

If we do not have any agreements in place which would allow us to conduct 
trades, do you know who I should contact regarding necessary documentation?

Sincerely,
Darren

company.  ALL of these agreements are negotiated by legal and must be 
executed by the business unit (VP or higher) and Ted Murphy.  Sheila Glover 
always sends a request and explanation for new account to legal, compliance 
and Ted Murphy.  Legal keeps a comprehensive listing by Enron company in an

Is it possible to get electronic file for the Enron North America and Peoples

Midwest Energy Hub, to utilize our format for the template for MEH.

Molly,

Could you send me an electronic version of the ISDA that was signed between
ENA and PEC. I understand from our attorney that we did not work with an
electronic version, only a hard copy. In order to create an ISDA template
for MEH, I need the electronic version.

Thanks

Is it possible to get electronic file for the Enron North America and Peoples 
Energy Corporation ISDA?  Is it in Word?  I am trying to get our new JV, 
Midwest Energy Hub, to utilize our format for the template for MEH.

Thanks
Molly

Molly,

Could you send me an electronic version of the ISDA that was signed between
ENA and PEC. I understand from our attorney that we did not work with an
electronic version, only a hard copy. In order to create an ISDA template
for MEH, I need the electronic version.

Thanks

differs from that sent to several of you last week in that there are now 
dotted lines in red around those pieces of MG that are affected at each stage 
of the reorganization and solid red lines around the same pieces reflecting 
where they wind up at each such stage - hopefully a more friendly on the eyes

Hey, Carson!  Sorry to hear about you and Melissa but I know that life can 
always get better (if you let it).  
I've finally finished my two-year project of replacing most of my landscaping 
with ""native plants.""  Of course, I'm rarely home to enjoy them but 
everything looks great on the weekends.

I'm dying under a load of work here but I know better than to complain too 
much.

Stephanie,  double check.  It appears the CES master and transactions were 
assigned to ENA and the transactions assigned over to the ENA BOM Master 
Agreement that we already had we BOM.  For some reason the parties then 
agreed not to terminate the old CES master, but leave it in place inactive.  
Normally we would terminate the CES master when we have one in place.  
Stephanie, is there anything in the file indicating why it was not so 
terminated?  Did BOM want to keep it in place until the prior trans were 
expired for a belt and suspender?  Please advise.  Mary"

Sara,
 Mike Fowler forwarded me a copy of the prime broker clearing services 
agreement sent to him by BuySide Direct, to facilitate the trading they would 
like to do.  We would like to comment on item #23.  Input on #23 should be 
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the two prime brokers currently utilized 
most by ECT Investments Inc.  Sheila Glover asked me to review and forward 
comments to you.  The document looks like the standard prime broker clearing 
services agreement that we have established in the past with other 
executing/clearing brokers.  If you need anything else, my number is 
713-853-1439.

Thanks,

I'm working with Sara on legal issues related to Buy Side Direct.  Is my 
understanding correct that approval from Risk Control and Credit is required 
to initiate trading, and that you are requesting their approval for Buy Side 
Direct as well as the other sites listed below ? 

Please let me know if I should be involved in this process.  Any feedback

Dayal/HOU/ECT@ECT 

Subject: Online Trading Platforms

I am requesting that online trading agreements be executed with the following 
bond trading platforms which we are evaluating:

         Site   Initial Corporate Bond Categories *       Type  Site Status

Buy Side Direct   Convertibles (+ Equity Hedge)  ** Cross Matching  Aug 15th 
Launch

Trading Edge / Bond Link High Yield, Convertibles   Cross Matching  Live

LIMITrader   High Yield, Convertibles   Cross Matching  Live

Market Axess   Investment Grade   Multi-Dealer ***  August Launch
        
*   Additional corporate bond categories may be added in the future.  For 
example, Market Axess expects to add high yield and convertible bonds within 
3  to 6 months.   

** John Greene is aware that convertible bond transactions through Buy Side 
Direct will involve offsetting equity hedges.

*** We have execution agreements in place with all current Market Axess 
dealers.

Potential benefits offered by online sites include trading flows and improved 
execution efficiency.  In addition, these sites provide opportunities for 
generating demand for EnronCredit.com credit derivatives, given that users of 
these sites are buyers or sellers of corporate credit risk.  The ability to 
trade will greatly enhance our evaluation of these sites.  

As noted above, 3 of the 4 sites are cross-matching, where trading is 
completely anonymous and the site's sponsor or clearing firm are the nominal 
counterparty for all trades.   One of the 4 sites will be a multi-dealer 
system where counterparties transact directly with a particular dealer. 

Trades for all sites would be cleared through prime brokers with whom we have 
existing agreements.

As you suggested, we should ensure that agreements with online trading 
platforms allow for trading by ENA, ECT Investments and EnronCredit.com.   My 
understanding is that Sheila's group would coordinate the opening of any 
additional accounts required to facilitate trading by each entity.

I suggest that Madhur Dayal be designated initially at the person to receive 
notification of material changes to agreements.  We should retain the ability 
to change this contact person.

Thanks.

Mike

I don't see anything in the file that indicates why the Master with CES was 
not terminated, only that it will be inactive.

Stephanie,  double check.  It appears the CES master and transactions were 
assigned to ENA and the transactions assigned over to the ENA BOM Master 
Agreement that we already had we BOM.  For some reason the parties then 
agreed not to terminate the old CES master, but leave it in place inactive.  
Normally we would terminate the CES master when we have one in place.  
Stephanie, is there anything in the file indicating why it was not so 
terminated?  Did BOM want to keep it in place until the prior trans were 
expired for a belt and suspender?  Please advise.  Mary

All:  During the fourth quarter, 2000, MLB intends to transfer all FX 
business to MLIB Ltd.  ENA and Enron Corp. have been asked to agree to this 
transfer with the result that any executed master agreement with MLB will be 
transferred to MLIB Ltd as principal.  ENA has an ISDA Master Agreement dated 
effective 7/1/95; I cannot locate a master between Enron Corp. and MLB.

Will someone in credit approve this transfer?  Please let Stephanie Panus 
(X53249), our newest paralegal, know.  Thanks.  Sara"

On an ISDA I am reviewing, credit has asked that all indebtedness of the 
Canadian counterparty to its affiliates be subordinated to us (in this case 
ECC).  Does anyone have access to a Canadian form of subordination 
agreement?  I imagine that a fairly bare-bones form would suffice.  Thanks --

Please review this email from David Dupre on confirm desk.  He has been 
inquiring of me re credit lines the last few weeks.  The margin cash issues 
seem to be getting a bit of attention lately.  However, these are new 
brokerage agreements or amendments or amplifications of established accounts 
to trade other commodities.  I have the paperwork Refco sent.  Maybe we 
should sent down and visit re all of the brokerage matters.  Should I handle 
these, or stick with the ones related to margin lines.  Should we send this 
kind of stuff to Jason?  Please advise.  Mary

Hi,

1. Refco

Refco's paperwork will be submitted to you today to review. It is my 
understanding
that the following rates have been negotiated (on a round-turn basis):

$2.50 Brokerage
$0.55 Exchange
$1.20 Clearing
$4.25

Our contact there is Steffen van Keppel at 713-266-0050

2. Cargill

Our traders want to renew crude oil trading with Cargill at a lower rate. 
Which legal documents do we need to sign to ensure that this lower
commission rate is established and honored?

3. GNI-Next advisors

We are talking to Stephen Purdy upon the request of Spencer Vosko. We have 
been advised that the rate will be $5.25 on a roundturn basis.
This broker will be forwarded their paperwork to the trader, and, I'll ensure 
that you receive it.

Please keep me updated on any other new brokers which we may be negotiating 
with for new agreements and/or existing brokerage agreements
which may be establishing a line of credit.

Many thanks,

David

Why don't we talk about this.  I have initiated Samantha as the trading 
agreement guru.  That's why she needs to be in the loop on all of these 
agreements (amendments included).  Let's distinguish margin lines from 
trading agreements (although the margin line concept obviously includes a 
futures or other arrangement)  I maintain a list (""in the pipeline"") which I 
circulate to the Hickerson desk since that desk opens the greatest number of 
trading agreements.  Sara

Please review this email from David Dupre on confirm desk.  He has been 
inquiring of me re credit lines the last few weeks.  The margin cash issues 
seem to be getting a bit of attention lately.  However, these are new 
brokerage agreements or amendments or amplifications of established accounts 
to trade other commodities.  I have the paperwork Refco sent.  Maybe we 
should sent down and visit re all of the brokerage matters.  Should I handle 
these, or stick with the ones related to margin lines.  Should we send this 
kind of stuff to Jason?  Please advise.  Mary

Hi,

1. Refco

Refco's paperwork will be submitted to you today to review. It is my 
understanding
that the following rates have been negotiated (on a round-turn basis):

$2.50 Brokerage
$0.55 Exchange
$1.20 Clearing
$4.25

Our contact there is Steffen van Keppel at 713-266-0050

2. Cargill

Our traders want to renew crude oil trading with Cargill at a lower rate. 
Which legal documents do we need to sign to ensure that this lower
commission rate is established and honored?

3. GNI-Next advisors

We are talking to Stephen Purdy upon the request of Spencer Vosko. We have 
been advised that the rate will be $5.25 on a roundturn basis.
This broker will be forwarded their paperwork to the trader, and, I'll ensure 
that you receive it.

Please keep me updated on any other new brokers which we may be negotiating 
with for new agreements and/or existing brokerage agreements
which may be establishing a line of credit.

Many thanks,

David

Jennifer below are MAP's legal department's comments on the Enron OTC 
agreement from July 14..

  1. On the address at the top of page 1 the address for MAP should be 
correctly identified.  I don't believe ""Document Department"" is correct. 
CHANGE TO ATTENTION DALE BARWIG

  2. Under the provision titled ""Floating Amount Details"", ""Floating Price"" 
at line 3, change the word ""entitled"" to ""titled"".

  3. Under Governing Law change ""Texas"" to ""New York"".

 On the last page, information should be inserted for notices for MAP and 
another provision for communications.  Under ""Communications"" insert ""Prior 
to the close of business on the next business day following the trade date, 
ENA will prepare and forward this contract electronically (faxed or attached 
to an email in a mutually acceptable format) to MAP's trader with a copy to 
the supervisor of Feedstock Acquisition and Derivative Accounting as listed 
below under Contractual Invoices"".

 Then for ""Contractual Invoices"":

Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC (MAP)
Name: Fred L. Bennett
Title: Supervisor, Feedstock Acquisition and Derivative Accounting
Address: Room 444-M, 539 South Main Street, Findlay, Ohio 45840
Tel No: (419) 421-4200
Fax No: (419) 421-5040
Email: FLBennett@MAPLLC.com""

  4. Under Annex A General Terms and Conditions under the provision titled 
""Market Disruption Event"", line 3, change ""ENA"" to ""both parties"".
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here starts my comments on the contract language.

5.  As we talked about I am confused that which crack sale has occurred.  The 
fixed price referencing the attachment should indicate USGC 74 Grade (Pipe) 
Heating Oil.  I am unclear where in the document we mention Low Sulfur.

Floating Price: The average of USGC platts oilgram midpoint for USGC Pipeline 
No. 2 74 Grade OIl, multiplied by 42, less the First Nearby NYMEX WTI Crude 
Oil futrures settlement prices

Where is the settlement paragraph?  Something like:

If the Fixed Amount exceeds the Floating Amount for such calculation period, 
the fixed price payor shall pay the floating price payor an amount equal to 
such excess.  If the floating amount exceeds the fixed amount for such 
calculation period, the floating price payor shall pay the fixed price payor 
an amount equal to such excess.

Thanks for you help.

introduced me to some of your co-workers. Everyone says you are the

All:  Please review for content.  This deal has been recast as a ""Price 
Return Swap"" and I hope it is self-explanatory (i.e., you won't have to drag 
out the 1996 Equity Definitions).  I will forward a draft letter shortly.

We need signed copies for each account, if you do not wish to disclosure. 
Sheung 
? . 

Brief Background on the form: 
The Securities & Exchange Commission has adopted? Rule 14b-1(c), effective 
January 1, 1986, which will enable companies, upon request, to ascertain the 
identity of shareholders whose securities are being held for them by 
broker/dealers. 
The purpose of this rule is to improve the communication between a company 
and 
its shareholders. The Rule does provide the customer the right to maintain 
the confidentiality of the account.? The rule requires that UNLESS YOU OBJECT 
IN WRITTING, Morgan Stanley will be required to disclose your name, address, 
and security position(s) to the company. 

Thanks, 
Francis

Mark, Kristina, and Carol,

In the past few months (before Carol went on maturity leave) I have been 
communicating with Carol on possible positions available at Enron.  Due to 
the Moratorium that was in place here at Azurix, unfortunately, I could not 
speak to anyone at Enron in reference to possible employment opportunities.  
The Azurix Board has lifted the moratorium as of August 7, 2000 and due to 
the present situation here at Azurix, I would greatly appreciate the 
opportunity to speak to each of you of any positions that are open in your 
area or of possible leads to other groups that can use a candidate who is 
detail oriented and possess strong analytical,  communication and 
interpersonal skills and proficient when it comes to ethical and professional 
responsibilities within the corporate arena.  

Thank you for reviewing my resume and I hope to be speaking to each of you in 
the future.  Many thanks, Barb

All:  Before Rod became a Brit, we were working with Enron Corp. treasury to 
put in place some masters in the name of ENA for the following parties:

Bear, Stearns Internaitonal Limited
Credit Agricole Indosuez
CSFB International
Lehman Brother Finance S.A.
Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.
Deutsche Bank

These masters will be used to for equity deals on ENE stock.  The Treasury 
group has concluded together with Rex Rogers and V&E, that Enron Corp. is the 
appropriate swap counterparty for these masters and NOT ENA.

Who in credit will be available to assist me in this process?  Thanks.  Sara"

Sara,
We already have done something for ING Barings or it is in the works in 
Legal.  We have had a long standing relationship with Furman Sels as an 
executing Broker.  ING Barings bought them and sent us documentation to 
change the agreement to the name of ING Barings.

Mike,
If you think you guys need a relationship, check with Theresa to see if we 
already have one.  Again, equities should go through John Greene unless 
packaged hedge. 

Please call if questions.

Sheila"

Kristina:  As you may have heard, some Raptor issues have been raised to a 
new level.  I have waited to further revise the confirm pending the V&E 
response; Also V&E suggested edits on the confirm format for all Raptor 
deals.  As you will see from Scott's memo, the unilateral right of 
termination is a potential issue.  Sara

We have not received anything yet.  Carol Gravener is my new Duke contact for 
this ISDA and I left a message today with her to see exactly when she sent it 
out.  She is out of her office until Wednesday so, I may not receive a 
response before then.

When I spoke to her on July 28th, she said that they were sending the 
comments to us so, I assume that we should be seeing them this week,

Regards,

Pat

Sara,

We need to draft an ISDA for Empire Paper Group, LLC.  We would like to 
insert language that will allow Enron to get a second lien on the assets 
after the primary lender instead of using the CSA.  Cross default thresholds 
are $1MM and $100MM, respectively for Empire and Enron.

Please send the draft to credit first and we will check the new language.  
The underwriters are Jay Epstein and Chris Croon.

If you have any questions please feel free to call.

Hey, Jen:  I'm not going to email you to death like some people but I hear 
through the grapevine that you're having a blast and making tons of friends.  
I told your mom that she and I should rent a convertible, don our sunglasses 
and drive to Natchitoches to go shopping at the Walmart and take you to 
lunch.  She didn't think you would like the idea too much.  Hope you really 
are having a wonderful year, making lots of friends and stretching your brain 
power.  Love, Sas

P.S.  How did you make out in your investment class?"

Jennifer below are MAP's legal department's comments on the Enron OTC 
agreement from July 14..

  1. On the address at the top of page 1 the address for MAP should be 
correctly identified.  I don't believe ""Document Department"" is correct. 
CHANGE TO ATTENTION DALE BARWIG

  2. Under the provision titled ""Floating Amount Details"", ""Floating Price"" 
at line 3, change the word ""entitled"" to ""titled"".

  3. Under Governing Law change ""Texas"" to ""New York"".

 On the last page, information should be inserted for notices for MAP and 
another provision for communications.  Under ""Communications"" insert ""Prior 
to the close of business on the next business day following the trade date, 
ENA will prepare and forward this contract electronically (faxed or attached 
to an email in a mutually acceptable format) to MAP's trader with a copy to 
the supervisor of Feedstock Acquisition and Derivative Accounting as listed 
below under Contractual Invoices"".

 Then for ""Contractual Invoices"":

Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC (MAP)
Name: Fred L. Bennett
Title: Supervisor, Feedstock Acquisition and Derivative Accounting
Address: Room 444-M, 539 South Main Street, Findlay, Ohio 45840
Tel No: (419) 421-4200
Fax No: (419) 421-5040
Email: FLBennett@MAPLLC.com""

  4. Under Annex A General Terms and Conditions under the provision titled 
""Market Disruption Event"", line 3, change ""ENA"" to ""both parties"".
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here starts my comments on the contract language.

5.  As we talked about I am confused that which crack sale has occurred.  The 
fixed price referencing the attachment should indicate USGC 74 Grade (Pipe) 
Heating Oil.  I am unclear where in the document we mention Low Sulfur.

Floating Price: The average of USGC platts oilgram midpoint for USGC Pipeline 
No. 2 74 Grade OIl, multiplied by 42, less the First Nearby NYMEX WTI Crude 
Oil futrures settlement prices

Where is the settlement paragraph?  Something like:

If the Fixed Amount exceeds the Floating Amount for such calculation period, 
the fixed price payor shall pay the floating price payor an amount equal to 
such excess.  If the floating amount exceeds the fixed amount for such 
calculation period, the floating price payor shall pay the fixed price payor 
an amount equal to such excess.

Thanks for you help.

I just wanted to keep you in the loop with regards to the status of getting 
the Brokerage Agreement in place with Chase H &Q.

Gary Hickerson will not be in the office until Wednesday of this week.  
However, he has revised the list of authorized traders that I forwarded to 
his attention  and has asked for Shelia Glover to review his changes.   
During a conference call this morning with Kelly Templeton, Shelia and 
myself, Shelia  had some concerns with Gary changes and wants to speak with 
Gary again before the list is approved.  

Although Shelia is also out of the office, she will follow-up with Gary so 
that I can get the agreement with Chase H&Q in place.

Please prepare updated drafts today if at all possible.

Earlier drafts were prepared on June 10, 1999 that were similar to each of

John:  I just wanted to stay in the loop for Japan as to Gary Hickerson's 
FX/rate/equity counterparties.  My understanding from Gary is that  EGM 
(through ENA) will continue to hedge the business originating in Japan, 
subject to tax and any regulatory input.  I don't know if this has 
necessitated an agency arrangement  between Japan and Houston (or another 
office, similar to London or Australia).  Also, for netting reasons, Japan 
would not duplicate existing counterparty  ISDA's with ENA, and to the extent 
Japan is transacting with a bank having an agreement with ENA, we could amend 
the agreement for multibranch purposes if necessary (e.g., Bank of Montreal 
if the bank is transacting from multiple locations that need to be added to 
ENA's agreement).

Please advise if you have already had these discussions with Mark Taylor.  I 
look forward to hearing from you.  Sara  "

Alan, and Sara,
We had spoken about a month ago that the Credit and Convertible Books may be 
moved into Enron North America from ECT Investments Inc..
Please advise what we need to do to do this.  At the prime Brokers we can 
move these separate books to the ENA grouping of books.  What do we need to 
do from a Corporate structure side since ECT Investments, Inc. is a wholly 
owned sub of ENA at this time?

Enron Credit.com is currently using the ENA entity for deals with US 
courterparties. 

Thanks, Sheila"

Sara/Mary,

Koch Energy Trading, Inc. has contacted me several times over the past couple 
of weeks in order to request that we change our Confirmation procedures.  
Currently, per the Master Agreement, we send our form of Confirmation and 
they sign and return those to us.  With the volume being well over 50 deals 
per day with Koch, they are now seeing this as cost prohibitive on their end, 
as they are doing all of the work related to Confirmations (Comparing details 
to their system and return faxing).  Now, Koch would like to go to both 
Counterparties sending confirms, comparing each other's paper to the system 
and notifying only in the case of discrepancies.  I suggested to Koch that we 
might try using a system similar to Sempra's in which we send our Confirms 
and they return a one-page fax which lists our deal numbers and their 
agreement or disagreement with those deals.  Still, they considered this to 
be very manual on their end and leaves them responsible for notifying of any 
discrepancies.  I'm sure the legal departments will be getting involved soon, 
so I wanted to get your thoughts on changing our current process before it 
comes to that.

Thanks,
Joe"

Alan, and Sara,
We had spoken about a month ago that the Credit and Convertible Books may be 
moved into Enron North America from ECT Investments Inc..
Please advise what we need to do to do this.  At the prime Brokers we can 
move these separate books to the ENA grouping of books.  What do we need to 
do from a Corporate structure side since ECT Investments, Inc. is a wholly 
owned sub of ENA at this time?

Enron Credit.com is currently using the ENA entity for deals with US 
courterparties. 

Thanks, Sheila

In January this year, EHMC was established as an internal collaborative 
effort of Enron International-Renewable Energy, Enron Engineering & 
Construction Company, and Portland General Operations.  The business 
objective was to establish Enron as a leading supplier of hydroelectric 
modernization/upgrade services to dam owners, developing and executing 
construction projects, and taking payment in new power, or other commodities.

With the recent corporate-wide reorganization, EHMC will now function as a 
collaborative effort between EE&CC and PGO.   Its business objective will 
continue to be the support of all Enron Business Regions in the development 
and execution of these specialized, high-value projects around the world.

Rick Whitaker (X68660), who will report in through EECC,  will continue to 
lead this effort .

Houston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in 
the name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are 
backed to EnronCredit.com Limited.  

In particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ 
International Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have 
no master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit 
derivatives?

Sara-

An agency agreement has been contemplated between Tokyo and Houston.  I 
believe it would be best to have Susan Musch advise on this issue, as she is 
handling the tax aspects relating to these activities and was also involved 
in the arrangements between Sydney and Houston.  I have copied Susan on this 
correspondence.

As to the netting issue, please confirm my understanding, that the issues 
are; (i) that we do not want different Enron entities (i.e. Enron Japan Corp. 
and ENA) entering into ISDAs with the same Japanese counterparties; and (ii) 
that if Enron Japan Corp. is transacting with a bank, with which ENA has an 
ISDA in place, we would amend such existing ISDA to cover the multibranch 
situation. 

I have not yet had detailed discussions with Mark regarding the issues you 
have raised.

Best regards,

John

		 Subject: Enron Japan agreements (ISDA/futures/brokerage)

John:  I just wanted to stay in the loop for Japan as to Gary Hickerson's 
FX/rate/equity counterparties.  My understanding from Gary is that  EGM 
(through ENA) will continue to hedge the business originating in Japan, 
subject to tax and any regulatory input.  I don't know if this has 
necessitated an agency arrangement  between Japan and Houston (or another 
office, similar to London or Australia).  Also, for netting reasons, Japan 
would not duplicate existing counterparty  ISDA's with ENA, and to the extent 
Japan is transacting with a bank having an agreement with ENA, we could amend 
the agreement for multibranch purposes if necessary (e.g., Bank of Montreal 
if the bank is transacting from multiple locations that need to be added to 
ENA's agreement).

Please advise if you have already had these discussions with Mark Taylor.  I 
look forward to hearing from you.  Sara

Sara,

Please contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  
Rod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be 
available in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but 
I am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other 
things Credit support for his business.  

It does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without 
Treasury's approval.

Irene:  Due to the lateness of  discussions at Enron Capital & Trade 
Resources Corp., I did not send any documents to you this evening.  However, 
I do have two different sets of drafts to send to you in the morning.  I have 
an ISDA without an annex (collateral built into the Schedule) and an ISDA 
with an annex.  We have had discussions regarding the use of Letters of 
Credit and Surety Bonds as acceptable forms of collateral and I may need some 
additional time to resolve the issues.  

I will contact you early tomorrow to deliver docs and establish a timeline 
(if possible).  Thanks.  Sara"

Sara,

Please contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  
Rod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be 
available in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but 
I am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other 
things Credit support for his business.  

It does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without 
Treasury's approval.

Subject: Credit Derivatives

I am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in 
Houston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in 
the name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are 
backed to EnronCredit.com Limited.  

In particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ 
International Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have 
no master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit 
derivatives?

FYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.

I think we're about ready for the Legal perspective and I would like to have

Gary is going to provide me with a list of OTC products for priority 
trading.  He has been in discussions with tax and structuring in Houston for 
the S. Cone.  The group has considered (i) trading onshore, (ii) trading as a 
sub of Elektro (and can this be a sub of an offshore entity?) and (iii) 
trading offshore.  They have studied the CC5 account requirements and have 
had conversations wtih JP Morgan and BofA.  There appears to be little 
communication with anyone in Brazil and Joe Kishkill is going to Sao Paulo 
next week.  I'll be more specific in a day or so.  I'm still having problems 
tying into the database (this is ridiculous!).  Did you receive my voice

Sara,
If it is a fairly straight forward task to move the Credit and Convertible 
books into Enron North America, we should negotiate the new agreements in the 
name of Enron North America.
If is is going to take more time then we should go ahead in the name of ECT 
Investments and change it to ENA as soon as the books are moved.
Please advise.
Thanks, Sheila"

All:  Just a status update on the growing number of brokerage agreement 
requests, and, I will circulate an updated list shortly.

On 8/8/00, Mike requested agreements for Market Axess, LIMITrader Securities, 
Inc. and Trading Edge on behalf of EnronCredit.com Limited.  We have sent 
comments to the first two.  
Sheila requested a Morgan Stanley agreement for EnronCredit.com Limited (low 
priority).
ENA sent comments to Ing Barings (fka Furman Selz) some time ago and has not 
heard back.  We were going to dupe for ECT Investments, Inc.
Denis is the responsible lawyer for EnronCredit.com Limited..
If in fact these electronic agreements should be in the name of ECT 
Investments, Inc., then we'll negotiate from Houston (or divide and conquer!)
Sheila, your email of 8/18 seemed to refer to BuySideDirect's agreement with 
ECT Investments, Inc. (and not the agreements requested by Mike).  Also, you 
should note that BuySideDirect requires use of its designated broker, Weiss, 
Peck & Greer (I believe to take the other side of the trade or broker the 
deal with a third party)...We have received a copy of that agreement as well.

My goal here is to make certain that we are all on the same page and can 
continue to approach these agreements in an organized manner.  Please let me 
know your comments or questions.  

Thanks.  Sara"

Sara

Initially, trading on the online trading sites noted below will be conducted 
in the name of ECT Investments or ENA.  As Sheila notes in her email from 
earlier today:

If it is a fairly straight forward task to move the Credit and Convertible 
books into Enron North America, we should negotiate the new agreements in the 
name of Enron North America.

If is is going to take more time then we should go ahead in the name of ECT 
Investments and change it to ENA as soon as the books are moved.

Please advise.

 We may consider establishing an agreement for EnronCredit.com at a later 
date, but not initially.  

Thanks.

Mike

Stephen Klein has requested a draft confirmation for a proposed transaction 
with Bay State Paper Company.  I have attached the worksheet containing the 
credit provisions.  This is a bit different from our standard terms, so call 
me if you have questions.  Stephen is hoping to show this to the customer by 
the close of business today.  If your schedules do not permit for that quick 
of a turnaround, please give him a call to let him know a more appropriate 
timeline (X5-7233).

Thanks,
Tanya

OK, this is hot off the press.  
Tanya:  our Performance Impairment language limited the collateral call to 
1.1 times outstanding exposure.  The collateral was defined only as Letters 
of Credit and the issuing bank was at least A- S&P rated.  As to the 
Threshold, well, you can read the response.
Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Sara,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  Internally we have been
discussing the main hurdle issues which you and I discussed in our last
telephone conversation.

The results are as follows:
Harvard will not agree to change its Additional Termination Event in favor
of your Performance Impairment clause.  We find this to be too uncertain and
are more comfortable with the certainty of the ratings as set out in our
Additional Termination Event clause.
Harvard believes that it can get comfortable with the idea of Letters of
Credit, however, they must come from a middle single A or better
counterparty and we would like to know who you intend to provide such LOCs
from at the time of contract negotiation.  Harvard will not provide letters
of credit as collateral but rather US Treasuries.
Harvard cannot accept or give cash as collateral.
Harvard is willing to raise the threshold for a BBB+ from $0 to $500,000,
but cannot agree to the increase of $10,000,000 which you have requested.
Harvard cannot agree to Minimum Transfer Amounts of $1 and requires the
threshold and minimum transfer amount table as set out in our CSA to remain
in tact.
Harvard will accept a guarantee from Enron Corp., however, it must be
Harvard's standard with no changes.

Please advise where this leaves us.  I will await your response prior to
addressing issues raised in your facsimile dated 7/20/99.

Regards,
Jo-Ann Bigwood
Harvard Management Company, Inc.

Sara,
If it is a fairly straight forward task to move the Credit and Convertible 
books into Enron North America, we should negotiate the new agreements in the 
name of Enron North America.
If is is going to take more time then we should go ahead in the name of ECT 
Investments and change it to ENA as soon as the books are moved.
Please advise.
Thanks, Sheila

Sara and Sam,
Comment regarding the attached..
1) Morgan stanley for Enron Investments plc done.
2) The only Enron Credit.com should be for the Morgan Stanley account. the 
others should be in ENA (or ECT Investments if we can't get done )
3) I resent the CSFB Clearing agreement.

Sara will update the attached file to reflect our intention that the four 
online bond trading agreements (Buy Side Direct, Trading Edge / Bond Link, 
Market Axess and LIMITrader) be executed for ENA / ECT Investments, not 
initially for EnronCredit.   

In light of your email outlining plans to move the Credit and Convertible 
books from ECT Investments to ENA, Sara and I discussed executing agreements 
for both ENA and ECT Investments.  

Sara is beginning her review of Trading Edge agreements.  She has already 
provided her comments to attorneys for the other three trading platforms.  

Thanks.

The Prime Trade agreement with CSFB is a VERY high priority.  Higher than the 
UBS Warburg.  Gary has called Ellen twice about this, and he is going to be

Could you tell me who we provided comments to at Market Axess and LIMITrader 
?    My business contacts were not aware that we had provided feedback.

Thanks.

Sara,

Stuart just executed an FX deal with MG.   He is hedging some cashflows for a 
metals trade that they have done.  As the MG entitity which Enron purchased 
is MG Plc, I am assuming that we should book this trade as MG plc.  Would you 
think otherwise?  Does Legal have any official documentation on the MG 
purchase that we could send to Global CP so that they can set up MG plc in 
their database.  Currently, there are lot's of MG's in global, but  they all 
have different names (MG Metal & Commodity Co. Ltd, MG Refining & Marketing, 
etc. )  "

Edmund,

My understanding is that your understanding is correct.  I shall speak with 
Sara on this issue and then inform all interested parties to avoid further 
confusion from certain quarters in 
London........................................................

Kind regards

Mark,

This needs to be cleared up.  

My understanding is that ECTRIC through EEFT does the trade.  The deal is 
backed to back with ECT and booked in the ECT book.  The deal number for the 
original trade should also therefore be from the Houston book.  I've already 
told this to Lee - correct me if my understanding of the position is 
incorrect.

Best, Ed.

Given the apparent confusion about how European trades ought to be booked and 
monitored, can we arrange a conference call/ video conference in the near 
future to iron out any anomalies and ensure that all parties are satisfied 
with the arrangements.

I thought that all Pulp & Paper deals were booked in Houston?

 It would seem that this deal has been booked incorrectly from ECTRIC, when 
it should have been booked from Houston (ECT?)

I have looked at Inapa from a credit perspective.

I am assuming that this deal was approved by someone in London Credit, i.e. 
Lee Munden,etc. My understanding of this deal is that it is bewtween a London 
legal entity and the counterparty. ECT's involvement is an intercompany back 
to back position. This deal should be confirmed out of the London office, and 
exposure monitored there. 

Thanks,
Tanya

As you know, Peoples has been eagerly awaiting templates (ISDA, Guarantees, 
L/Cs) from Enron for the MEH JV. At this point, their credit officer is 
leading the charge with People's legal department and moving forward to 
create something!  I have shared that we do not want to utilize the existing 
People's agreement as a standard.

Do you have templates we could give them now and explain they are under 
revision?  They have wanted to begin reviewing and are now anxious.   Don't 
we want Enron to lead the way for these templates?  Please advise.

Thank you

The only comments I would add to the feedback you provided to the attorneys 
for the various online trading agreements are as follows: 

Trading Edge:

My comments were summarized in my August 11th email to you.

LIMITrader:

Agreement should specify the obligation of LIMITrader and / or their clearing 
firm (Bear Stearns Clearing Corporation) to execute trades, in the event the 
other side of the trade does not.  

Buy Side Direct:

Michael Minnich agreed, during a call with Jason and me, to add language 
addressing the obligation of Buy Side Direct (until the trade is affirmed) 
and Weiss, Peck and Greer (from affirmation until settlement) to execute 
trades, in the event the other side of the trade does not.  

Michael also agreed to clarify their policies regarding trades which Buy Side 
Direct modifies or cancels under their clearly erroneous policy.

Market Axess:

No additional comments.  

Thanks.

Barclays. Heads up, I am sending the comments from Barclays over to you, and 
have copied Rob Taylor at A&K. Ranabir Dutt is the business person."

Kay:  I left you a voice mail yesterday at Sheila's suggestion regarding 
Midwest.  Greg and I discussed the use of ENA's format of ISDA documentation 
by Midwest and I have a couple of questions about how our docs will be used, 
whether Midwest will be competing with us and who will be negotiating hedge 
agreements on behalf of Midwest (i.e., will ENA swap lawyers be involved?).  
Please call me so that I can comply with Greg's request..
Thanks.  Sara

Greg:  I will have the boilerplate sent to you separately.

Feels funny emailing someone so close.  I'm addicted to email, however,

I saw Gregg in the elevator lobby as the door was closing.  I'm going to see 
if I can corner him while he is in town to see what is going on.  I'm not 
up-to-speed on this one.

If any of the Raptor investments for which you are responsible is comprised, 
in whole or in part, of warrants, please provide a copy of the warrants (and 
any related documentation which governs the exercise of the warrants) to 
either Sara Shackleton or Mary Cook.  For the public companies this should be 
done ASAP (i.e. no later than the end of business today) and for the privates 
this should be done by the end of the week.  Also, please arrange to meet 
with either Mary or Sara to provide a brief explanation as to how the 
derivatives work (they need to understand the nature of the derivatives in 
order to properly structure the Raptor hedge).  Once again, I apologize for 
the short notice but hope that each of you recognizes that the internal 
pressure to push investments into Raptor has increased exponentially.  Thanks 
in advance.

Sara,

Per my last e-mail on the Papeis Inapa deal, herewith for your complete 
information a copy of the final form of Deemed ISDA Confirmation very 
helpfully drwan up by Edmund Cooper in London to document the trade between 
EEFT (for ECTRIC) and Papeis Inapa.

May be when you get a few minutes, we can have a chat just to confirm the 
Enron entities involved in paper deals in Europe as there appear to be 
certain people in London who are a little confused on this issue.

Kind regards

Mark

Darren:

I hope your trip went smoothly.  I spoke with Sara Shackleton, and she 
mentioned that she completed the Prime Trade agreement and sent it out to 
Kathleen Goss and Kathleen Dybala.  She is now working on the Futures/options 
agreement and will be finished soon.  Do you know whether that should be sent 
to the same contacts or do you have different contact names for that piece?  
Please let me know so we can send these out as soon as possible.  I hope 
everything is well in Tokyo.

I thought I'd communicate to the group some recent developments.

1. Gordon and Ryan advise that the swaps for assets in JEDI 1 and 2 will 
cover our proportionate economic interest in the asset within JEDI. Gordon 
believes the spreadsheet of proposed swaps reflects this. The swap will be 
between Harrier and Talon and there will be no back-to-back swap with JEDI. 
There should be no required disclosures to CalPERS resulting from these 
hedges. 

2. Gordon and Ryan advise that for assets currently on our balance sheet that 
are hedged with Raptor and then sold to Condor,  there will be no reduction 
in the hedge or any back-to-back hedge when it moves into Condor. The swap 
will be between Harrier and Talon.

3. Mark Taylor and Bob Baird have concluded that the swaps can be terminable 
by Harrier if the underlying security is sold.

I.  I thought it would be helpful to put the following in writing for 
everyone based upon our conversations with Ron Astin.

In making ownership determinations the following applies:

1.  Where warrants are also owned:

warrants (exercisable within 60 days by ""Enron"") + stock owned   
________________________________________________________________

warrants (exercisable within 60 days by ""Enron"") + stock issued and 
outstanding

2.  Where preferred shares are owned:

If preferred class is public, it must be included.
If preferred class is private, but convertible to common public, it must be 
included.
If preferred class is private (and not convertible to common public), and we 
do not own 10% of any other class that is public, then it does not need to be 
included.

3.  Where the shares are owned via a joint arrangement of any type, please be 
sure that the share numbers that are being reviewed and to be provided to 
legal include the gross shares held in the joint arrangement, and the ""Enron"" 
net shares (our % interest applied to the gross).  We need both numbers to 
coordinate our analysis.  Only the net share number will be swapped.

Is Mark Taylor aware of Gary's plans?  I know from my conversations with Mark 
about support for trading in South America that very few people in Enron, 
other than Don and a few commercial guys in Brazil, believe that there will 
be any action to speak of on the trading side in South America.  If Gary does 
anything other than trade from ECT on exchange or through swaps that he will 
have to take into consideration who will provide legal and administrative 
support and from where.

Andrea has not confirmed any meetings with me yet.  But I would not wait too 
long to make the reservations.

Importance:  High
---------------------------------
Gary is going to provide me with a list of OTC products for priority 
trading.  He has been in discussions with tax and structuring in Houston for 
the S. Cone.  The group has considered (i) trading onshore, (ii) trading as a 
sub of Elektro (and can this be a sub of an offshore entity?) and (iii) 
trading offshore.  They have studied the CC5 account requirements and have 
had conversations wtih JP Morgan and BofA.  There appears to be little 
communication with anyone in Brazil and Joe Kishkill is going to Sao Paulo 
next week.  I'll be more specific in a day or so.  I'm still having problems 
tying into the database (this is ridiculous!).  Did you receive my voice

Subject: Raptor Hedges

I thought I'd communicate to the group some recent developments.

1. Gordon and Ryan advise that the swaps for assets in JEDI 1 and 2 will 
cover our proportionate economic interest in the asset within JEDI. Gordon 
believes the spreadsheet of proposed swaps reflects this. The swap will be 
between Harrier and Talon and there will be no back-to-back swap with JEDI. 
There should be no required disclosures to CalPERS resulting from these 
hedges. 

2. Gordon and Ryan advise that for assets currently on our balance sheet that 
are hedged with Raptor and then sold to Condor,  there will be no reduction 
in the hedge or any back-to-back hedge when it moves into Condor. The swap 
will be between Harrier and Talon.

3. Mark Taylor and Bob Baird have concluded that the swaps can be terminable

Stuart advises that his request equally applies to the option to purchase 
Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. capital stock held by Sundance Assets, 
L.P. ( not the dreaded spark spread option which you worked on in the same 
transaction, which spark spread option was repurchased and terminated some 
months ago ). Let me know when you would like to discuss the matter. The 1997 
Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the option was originally granted 
was signed today ( we are still waiting on an attachment to that agreement to 
be delivered by the other side before we release the document to them), and 
we did modify the option and some transfer restrictions in that Agreement 
that will apply to the Raptor analysis. A registration statement registering 
the CCSI common stock that would be acquired upon exercise of the option was 
filed yesterday with the SEC. Let me know when you would like to meet to 
discuss this matter.

Does the request apply as well to options to purchase? There is an option in 
the Catalytica transaction - recently renegotiated ( we are signing the deal 
up today) to purchase 500,000 plus CCSI shares on a cashless basis. The share 
number is subject to adjustment in a stock split to occur upon the spin off 
of CCSI prior to the merger of its parent sometime before year end. The 
option expires in February 2001.

If any of the Raptor investments for which you are responsible is comprised, 
in whole or in part, of warrants, please provide a copy of the warrants (and 
any related documentation which governs the exercise of the warrants) to 
either Sara Shackleton or Mary Cook.  For the public companies this should be 
done ASAP (i.e. no later than the end of business today) and for the privates 
this should be done by the end of the week.  Also, please arrange to meet 
with either Mary or Sara to provide a brief explanation as to how the 
derivatives work (they need to understand the nature of the derivatives in 
order to properly structure the Raptor hedge).  Once again, I apologize for 
the short notice but hope that each of you recognizes that the internal 
pressure to push investments into Raptor has increased exponentially.  Thanks 
in advance.

Received a call from Perez lawyer, Javier Casal, saying that they have been 
occupying most of their time in another priority Project and this is why they 
are delayed with their answer on the MSA proposal. He said that they have 
scheduled an internal meeting for next Monday, Aug. 9 to tackle this MSA with 
Enron Corp. and they will contact us asap with their comments.

I told Perez that it was not worth while to delay it further than one more 
month. Casal answered that he took resposability for taking care of this 
matter.

keep you posted.

I'll be out of the office this afternoon and tomorrow. Tuesday and Wednesday 
of next week I'll be working in another Enron office, and will be traveling 
back to Houston on Thursday. I'll be checking my voicemails regularly and 
Joyce can reach me in an emergency.

Joel will be covering for me on Raptor matters in my absence, although I 
haven't attempted to get him up to date on the hedging issues we've been 
discussing over the last week or so given the fact that I believe we've 
essentially finished working through how we do these and given the relative 
complexity of the issues here."

Sara,

Per my last e-mail on the Papeis Inapa deal, herewith for your complete 
information a copy of the final form of Deemed ISDA Confirmation very 
helpfully drwan up by Edmund Cooper in London to document the trade between 
EEFT (for ECTRIC) and Papeis Inapa.

May be when you get a few minutes, we can have a chat just to confirm the 
Enron entities involved in paper deals in Europe as there appear to be 
certain people in London who are a little confused on this issue.

Kind regards

Mark

Tom,

Here's the final version, subject to:

2. Need to insert the Houston deal number.

Let me know if you have any queries.

Regards, Edmund.

Sara,

1.  Re number of shares - Assume there is one or more Notice Dates for x 
number of shares and a final Termination Date for [1.093,426 - x] shares.  As 
written, would the calculation on the Termination Date be based on (a) 
1,093,426 shares or (b) [1,093,426 - x] shares?  It should be (b), but it 
looks to me like the confirm says (a)?

Am I mis-reading this?

2.  Picky point - but if the final date is both a Notice Date and a 
Termination Date, is the calculation only done once?

Regards

JAG

Market Axess:

The online trading platform launched during August, focusing initially on 
investment grade bonds.  Based on restrictions their dealers imposed on 
potential users, we have agreed to defer our involvement with the site until 
high yield trading is introduced during the 4th quarter.   Would you prefer 
that we resolve issues with Market Axess' legal agreements now, or that we 
wait until we are closer to the date we begin using the system ?

Buy Side Direct:

I will be out of the office tomorrow.  Should we meet Tuesday or Wednesday to 
discuss the feedback you, Jason and I received today from their attorney ?  
I'm open Tuesday between 9:30 and 3:00 or Wednesday before 4:00.

 Thanks.

I've asked my secretary to give you a copy of the omnibus agreement dated as 
of August 29,2000, delivered to Catalytica today, among ENA, Sundance 
Assets,L.P. ( holder of the Catalytica Combustions Systems, Inc. Class B 
Preferred Stock and option to purchase ), Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. 
and Catalytica, Inc., together with a copy of the 1998 Preferred Stock 
Purchase Agreement pursuant to which Enron Ventures, predecessor to Sundance, 
acquired the stock and option. The attached is an S-1 registration statement 
filed yesterday by Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. with the SEC related 
to the distribution of CCSI shares held by its parent, Catalytica Inc, to its 
stockholders in connection with the merger of the parent with DSM, N. V. A 
merger proxy statement summarizing the DSM transaction will follow. The S-1 
and merger proxy statement may be overkill for your purposes, but they will 
help make sense of the omnibus agreement if you have questions about that 
agreement. Note that modifications to the share transfer restriction and 
assignment provisions in the 1998 Agreement to accommodate Raptor and the 
grant of the right to exercise the option on a cashless basis are included in 
the omnibus agreement. The S-1 and proxy statement should be of interest in 
analyzing the disclosure obligations under the securities laws with respect 
to the Raptor transaction.

Received a call from Perez lawyer, Javier Casal, saying that they have been 
occupying most of their time in another priority Project and this is why they 
are delayed with their answer on the MSA proposal. He said that they have 
scheduled an internal meeting for next Monday, Aug. 9 to tackle this MSA with 
Enron Corp. and they will contact us asap with their comments.

I told Perez that it was not worth while to delay it further than one more 
month. Casal answered that he took resposability for taking care of this 
matter.

keep you posted.

Sara,
Under the influence of a heightened sensitivity to the issue of Muni 
authorization, we need to know whether or not our ISDA with Merced has any 
restrictions on length of transactions which we should be aware of.  Stewart 
wants to do an 18 month swap soon.  Mark T. looked it up on the data base for 
me and apparently the Board of Merced passed a resolution approving the ISDA 
and ""certain transactions"" thereunder.  We need to know what kinds of 
transcations they can and cannot do.  Thanks very much.---cgy"

 Hi  Sara,

I have just recieved the attached fax and phone call from Matt Flett at 
Morgan Stanley in London. I believe that he has taken over the above 
transaction from Megan Duffill. He has contacted me in the abcence of Edmund 
Cooper who is currently on sick leave and asked for a response on the points 
raised in the fax.
Is this one of yours or have we now become involved in some way? When you 
have a moment please could you let me know  either way. 

Many Thanks

Matt Dawson

Sara,

I'm sure that as soon as the technical kinks are worked out, John will want 
to begin trading European stocks right away.  Could you please have a look at 
the Instinet agreement, and see what changes might be necessary to facilitate 
this?  Please let me know what you think.  THanks.

Julie,

This is the Instinet install.  Who do you think is the best person to 
coordinate the install?  Please forward this to them and ask them to contact 
me on ext. 3-5534 in London.

Laurel,

Please be aware that we are wanting to add european equity trading to the 
existing Instinet contract.  Although it may change at a later date, we would 
like for this activity to be done in the name of ECT Investments so I am not 
sure how much the contract will change.  As I have mentioned, there is a 
chance that we may have to have such trading done out of another entity but 
we can worry about changing any contracts when that happens.  I want to get 
the technological kinks worked out during the ""down time"" so that as soon as 
we have figured out how this activity is going to be structured we can begin 
trading immediately.  I will direct the Instinet contract contact to you as 
soon as I find out who that is.

Thanks and regards,
John

Hi John,

Thanks for taking the time to chat with me regarding your new London office.
You are very smart to start setting up the equipment ahead of time.  My
colleague in London is Mark Freeman.  He will be calling you to discuss the
details of your account.  If you need to reach Mark in London call 44 207 680
3191.

As we discussed on the phone, we will need to pass your account through credit
committee at Instinet London.  It sounds like Enron Houston is the same entity
as Enron London.  Hopefully this will make the legality issues simple.  In
addition, you mentioned that the phone lines to Reuters have been installed.  
We
can usually hook the Instinet terminal right up to the Reuters phone line.
Please let me know once you have the name of the technician handling the 
account
so we can contact him/her.

I ran you through some of the functionality Instinet provides on the
international side.  We should probably talk about this in more detail soon.  
I
will be in London the week of 9/11-9/15 so perhaps I could bring your new
coverage person over to meet if you think that makes sense.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, comments or concerns please 
contact
me on 212 310-7268.  As I mentioned, I am still on jury duty but hope to be 
off
by next Tuesday.  I always check messages from the road.  Good luck with the
apartment search.  You can not go wrong in Chelsea it's fantastic.  Have a 
great
weekend!!!

Jenn

1.  I was not sure whose doc the referenced notice was, but I think the 
address should be Talon c/o LJM2@ Co-Investment, L.P.  rather than just to 
Talon.

2.  Vargas met with me last night.  I am printing out and copying proposal 
sheets and valuations and stock ownership (the latter of which they are 
making corrections to and resending this morning.  My asst. is coordinating a 
meeting with Stuart, Sara and myself this morning to coordinate further 
review actions and swap preparation. 

3.  Based upon the latest voice from Sefton re note adjustment, I checked 
with A. Currey and she advised that nothing need be said in the swap re same 
as the structure docs will automatically cause payment via adjustment.

to have the deal tickets modified (with a handwritten note, something to the

Sara,

According ot Financial Settlements, the City of Dublin transaction that I 
told you could have some legal risk because it is a municipality, was 
actually the trigger to a physical transaction.  I asked if they could book 
this in the system as a Physical Swap so we show no financial exposure.

The ISDA Master  does not circumscribe the trade term or trade parameters. 
The issue which we discussed is authority.  The Merced resolution of March 
16, 1999 specifically authorizes the general manager ""...to develop and 
provide appropriate information, and certifications for completing Master 
Trading (ISDA) Agreements with energy vendors and execute Master Trading 
(ISDA) Agreements and appropriate vendor Schedules to the ISDA Agreement for 
the purpose of acquiring energy and stabilizing energy costs.  Such 
executions are subject to Counsel review of the agreement and schedules as to 
form.""  There is no specific mention of authority to enter into transactions 
(by Merced's traders).
Intuitively one could draw the conclusion that the ISDA Master contemplates 
transactions, Merced authorized the ISDA Master and therefore Merced 
authorized transactions under the ISDA Master.  Since Merced is a 
governmental entity, the safer view is that we should not assume that Merced 
authorized transactions.  Merced probably intended to authorize transactions, 
and if so, should not have an issue with specifically providing a clarifying 
resolution.

Russell:  Thanks for the info.  I do need to send a REMINDER to the credit 
group about the authority issues raised by municipals (governmentals, cities, 
etc.) entering into financial trades.  Where can I obtain the most recent 
list of credit people (you know how those credit people are) who deal with 
financial trading?  Thanks.  Sara

P.S.  the early production payment docs typically conveyed an undivided 90 % 
interest in the producer's net revenue interest in particular properties.  
The other 10 % was considered ""excess"" for purposes of you know what.

Sara,

According ot Financial Settlements, the City of Dublin transaction that I 
told you could have some legal risk because it is a municipality, was 
actually the trigger to a physical transaction.  I asked if they could book 
this in the system as a Physical Swap so we show no financial exposure.

Laurel:  Will John be trading in the names of BOTH ENA and ECT Investments, 
Inc. or only one of them?  Is John located in London temporarily?  Will 
Houston book the trades pursuant to the agency agreement? (I'm not certain 
which companies are covered by the agreement).  Let's discuss.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

I'm sure that as soon as the technical kinks are worked out, John will want 
to begin trading European stocks right away.  Could you please have a look at 
the Instinet agreement, and see what changes might be necessary to facilitate 
this?  Please let me know what you think.  THanks.

Julie,

This is the Instinet install.  Who do you think is the best person to 
coordinate the install?  Please forward this to them and ask them to contact 
me on ext. 3-5534 in London.

Laurel,

Please be aware that we are wanting to add european equity trading to the 
existing Instinet contract.  Although it may change at a later date, we would 
like for this activity to be done in the name of ECT Investments so I am not 
sure how much the contract will change.  As I have mentioned, there is a 
chance that we may have to have such trading done out of another entity but 
we can worry about changing any contracts when that happens.  I want to get 
the technological kinks worked out during the ""down time"" so that as soon as 
we have figured out how this activity is going to be structured we can begin 
trading immediately.  I will direct the Instinet contract contact to you as 
soon as I find out who that is.

Thanks and regards,
John

Hi John,

Thanks for taking the time to chat with me regarding your new London office.
You are very smart to start setting up the equipment ahead of time.  My
colleague in London is Mark Freeman.  He will be calling you to discuss the
details of your account.  If you need to reach Mark in London call 44 207 680
3191.

As we discussed on the phone, we will need to pass your account through credit
committee at Instinet London.  It sounds like Enron Houston is the same entity
as Enron London.  Hopefully this will make the legality issues simple.  In
addition, you mentioned that the phone lines to Reuters have been installed.  
We
can usually hook the Instinet terminal right up to the Reuters phone line.
Please let me know once you have the name of the technician handling the 
account
so we can contact him/her.

I ran you through some of the functionality Instinet provides on the
international side.  We should probably talk about this in more detail soon.  
I
will be in London the week of 9/11-9/15 so perhaps I could bring your new
coverage person over to meet if you think that makes sense.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, comments or concerns please 
contact
me on 212 310-7268.  As I mentioned, I am still on jury duty but hope to be 
off
by next Tuesday.  I always check messages from the road.  Good luck with the
apartment search.  You can not go wrong in Chelsea it's fantastic.  Have a 
great
weekend!!!

Jenn

To be perfectly honest, I'm not sure.  Per John's message, he wants to trade 
as ECT Investments.  IF he were doing any heding activity for the Merchant 
assests portfolio, that trading would be as ENA, although, those trades may 
be done by David Vitrella and/or Selena.   Do you know if John will be able 
to trade as ECT Investments, or if a separate entity will have to be set up?"

Thanks for the response - You both have the approprate person at Merced to 
contact to get clarification with respect to authorization.  They are aware 
that you may call.  At this point they are fully hedged in the near term so 
future deals will be back years (precisely the term we may be concerned with).

The ISDA Master  does not circumscribe the trade term or trade parameters. 
The issue which we discussed is authority.  The Merced resolution of March 
16, 1999 specifically authorizes the general manager ""...to develop and 
provide appropriate information, and certifications for completing Master 
Trading (ISDA) Agreements with energy vendors and execute Master Trading 
(ISDA) Agreements and appropriate vendor Schedules to the ISDA Agreement for 
the purpose of acquiring energy and stabilizing energy costs.  Such

form.""  There is no specific mention of authority to enter into transactions 
(by Merced's traders).
Intuitively one could draw the conclusion that the ISDA Master contemplates 
transactions, Merced authorized the ISDA Master and therefore Merced 
authorized transactions under the ISDA Master.  Since Merced is a 
governmental entity, the safer view is that we should not assume that Merced 
authorized transactions.  Merced probably intended to authorize transactions, 
and if so, should not have an issue with specifically providing a clarifying 
resolution.

Stewart,
Yesterday at our meeting with Tim, I thought it was fairly clear that efforts 
were to be made before deals were done to check out authorization.  This 
morning you tell us you have done a 3 year deal with Merced and ask us to 
check out the authorization question after the fact.   This is exactly the 
opposite of what I thought we were all trying to do.  We don't really need to 
call Merced.  We have the relevant legal paper.  You need to get  the 
attorney from the finance group, Sara,  to tell you whether or not Merced is 
authorized to do the deal you have already done.

I am working with the guys at Turlock to check out their authorizations.

Hi Sara!

Please give us a call as your trip grows closer. Schedule permitting (we just 
had a baby girl nine days ago, and crush activity may still be petty
crazy!), we'd love to get together. Also, please let us know if we can help 
you with any recommendations while you're here.

All the best,

All publics are in draft awaiting the resolution of this issue, except Active 
Power.  There is a memo to be released today discussing the entire Active 
Power scenario which should help us figure out how to draft same per Mike 
Galvan.  Further, I have asked Galvan to double check the Carrizo warrant 
numbers that were provided because I am not sure they make sense based upon

As a result of restrictions that Market Axess has imposed on users of its 
multi-dealer online bond trading site, we will not begin using the site until 
trading of high yield bonds is implemented late this year.  

Legal:  I suggest that we defer legal discussions until this date 
approaches.  

Credit Approval:   This will not be an anonymous site, where our credit 
exposure is to the site or clearing broker.  Our exposure for Market Axess 
transactions will be to one of their participating dealers.  My understanding 
is that we have trading agreements with each of Market Axess' current dealers 
(JP Morgan, Chase, Bear Stearns, ABN Amro, Deutsche, UBS Warburg).  Please 
let me know if there are credit issues related to trading with these dealers 
through Market Axess.  Before we begin trading, we will determine if there 
are any new Market Axess dealers for whom credit approval is required.

Please let me know if you like to discuss.

Thanks.

Mike

Hello Sara,

I talked to Chuck Kaufmann in Cinergy's credit dept. concerning the ongoing 
issues.  Basically, he has agreed to the cross-default levels of 50/100 
million.  He is going to look further into the guaranty issue and get back to 
me on this. I will keep you updated.

issues.  Basically, he has agreed to the cross-default levels of 50/100 
million.  He is going to look further into the guaranty issue and get back to 
me on this. I will keep you updated.



Thanks
Russell

hi sara -- i hope your weekend was great!  i had a pretty nice and quiet 
one.  kinda difficult to get used to working now.

i remember that in the EITF meetings, you mentioned that ENA has a broad 
approval to enter into all derivative transactions.  do you mind faxing a 
copy to me (713 853 9252)?  i am working on the follow-on condor offering.  
we expect that part of that second offering will be in euros and we will 
likely have enron enter into a currency swap with the indenture trustee.  
counsel for the investment banks are asking about who has authority to sign 
what documents.

i appreciate your help!! "

Sara,

Did you ever hear from Sarah Wesner regarding setting up some lines of credit 
for Darren's futures trading in Japan?  This trading will be done as Enron 
Japan, not ENA, so we cannot use the existing agreements.  Please let me know 
what I may need to do so we can make sure everything is set up for Darren.

		 Subject: Trading Edge / Bond Link Agreement

The IT Contract group has been involved in reviewing documents for Trading 
Edge's Bond Link online bond trading site.  George Weber, who has since moved 
into another area, discussed various issues with Trading Edge early this 
year.  Laine Borgman, a contract administrator in the IT Contracts group, has 
become involved in the Trading Edge review during the past week.  Attached 
below are Trading Edge agreements and their responses to issues raised by IT 
Contracts.  

The primary issues Laine and I discussed yesterday are as follows:

Jurisdiction:   
Our preference is Texas, but we would accept New York.  Trading Edge's 
response is unclear, although I believe they will readily agree to New York.

Indemnification (similar to issues with Buy Side Direct):  
Agreement assigns no liability to 3rd parties which the agreement describes 
as ""providers of software"".  As Trading Edge is the nominal counterparty for 
all trades, this may be acceptable if the agreement held Trading Edge liable 
for settling trades.  However, I do not see where section 11 addresses 
Trading Edge's liability for trades.   
We would also like assurances / liability regarding the accuracy of order and 
trade information.  

Limits of Liability:
Review language in both the Access and TIPs agreements (per Trading Edge, 
they will not agree to modify the TIPs Agreement, which is dictated by a 3rd 
party).

Assignment:  
Trading Edge's agreement does not allow Enron to assign the agreement to 
other parties.  Initially, only EnronCredit.com personnel in Houston and 
possibly London would use Trading Edge's site, so this would not be an issue 
initially.  Although we would prefer that the ability to assign be included, 
this issue could be addressed later as needed.
 
Electronic Mail (#18):
We do not want to accept email communication in the event of a lawsuit.  From 
the tone of their previous response, I believe they will agree to include 
lawsuits in the definition of extraordinary matters, for which email will not 
be employed.  

Sara, how would you suggest we proceed with the Trading Edge review ?  I will 
speak with Sheila Glover regarding the involvement of Credit and Risk Control 
in our request to utilize Trading Edge's trading platform.

Thanks.

Sara,

I talked to Chuck Kaufmann and Randy Beevis at Cinergy Marketing.  We have 
come to a resolution on the guaranty issues, and I want your thoughts on 
this.  

1) With respect to their guaranty to Enron, we are going to keep the dollar 
amount at $10MM, and decrease their collateral threshold in the ISDA to 
$8MM.  This way they have $2MM in cushion for Cinergy Capital and their 
physical gas business.  In addition, their current guaranty includes Enron 
Canada Corp, although they would like this removed as a guaranteed entity.

2) With respect to the guaranty Enron provides to Cinergy, the dollar amount 
should be increased $15MM, leaving the collateral threshold at $10MM.  Also, 
several of the Enron entities on the guaranty should be removed.  These are:  
Enron Canada, HPL Resources and Louisiana Gas Marketing.  Houston Pipe Line 
Company should be added as an additional guaranteed counterparty. 

So in summary, we are lowering the collateral threshold for Cinergy to $8MM, 
ENA's will stay at $10MM, and the above amendments need to be made to the 
guaranty's.

I will bring copy's of these guaranty's up to you and we can discuss when you 
have had a chance to digest all this.

Thanks

Russell

but please foward as appropriate.  If you read in the Lotus Notes database,

Mary,

Per your e-mail, I would like to delete (ii) in the defininition of 
""reasonably withheld"" as there is only one party that has a possibility to 
have a material unhedged position (ie. Enron).  

Thanks,

Ryan

The (i) Termination Date and (ii) each date specified as such in a written 
notice from either party to the other party with respect to a designated 
Number of Shares specified in the notice (the ""Notice""), to which the party 
receiving such notice consents, which consent shall not be unreasonably 
withheld.  For purposes of this Confirmation, the parties agree that consent 
shall be deemed reasonably withheld (i) if the party receiving the Notice has 
a reasonable business purpose for maintaining the Transaction (excluding any 
business purpose relating specifically to the existing or anticipated value 
of the Transaction or any other Transaction subject to the Agreement) or (ii) 
if consenting to the Notice would result in a material unhedged exposure or 
liability for the party receiving the Notice.  For the avoidance of doubt, a 
Notice shall be sent from either party to the other party on the Termination 
Date.

Mary,

Per your e-mail, I would like to delete (ii) in the defininition of 
""reasonably withheld"" as there is only one party that has a possibility to 
have a material unhedged position (ie. Enron).  

Thanks,

Ryan

The (i) Termination Date and (ii) each date specified as such in a written 
notice from either party to the other party with respect to a designated 
Number of Shares specified in the notice (the ""Notice""), to which the party 
receiving such notice consents, which consent shall not be unreasonably 
withheld.  For purposes of this Confirmation, the parties agree that consent 
shall be deemed reasonably withheld (i) if the party receiving the Notice has 
a reasonable business purpose for maintaining the Transaction (excluding any 
business purpose relating specifically to the existing or anticipated value 
of the Transaction or any other Transaction subject to the Agreement) or (ii) 
if consenting to the Notice would result in a material unhedged exposure or 
liability for the party receiving the Notice.  For the avoidance of doubt, a 
Notice shall be sent from either party to the other party on the Termination 
Date.

As to ENA swaps, upon discussion with Andrea and Ryan there will be no 
language included in the provision in respect of trying to define when 
something is or is not deemed reasonably withheld.  See below.  Sara is 
discussing the Avici swap with EBS.  I am going to prepare the ENA confirms 
on this basis. 
 
The (i) Termination Date and (ii) each date specified as such in a written 
notice from either party to the other party with respect to a designated 
Number of Shares specified in the notice (the ""Notice""), to which the party 
receiving such notice consents, which consent shall not be unreasonably 
withheld.  For the avoidance of doubt, a Notice shall be sent from either 
party to the other party on the Termination Date.

Attached are the transaction documents for Project Tahiti.  Each of the 
documents is marked to show revisions against the version circulated last 
Wednesday, August 30.  As we discussed on the phone, we have incorporated the 
business agreement reached between CIBC and Enron, as follows:

The Tahiti Series Trust Agreement has been revised to require the consent of 
all certificateholders (which includes Fiji Z LLC, which can only consent 
with the consent of its Class B Member - CIBC) prior to (i) the creation of 
any series after December 31, 2000 (see definition of Series Supplement) and 
(ii) making any amendments to the purpose provision (which specifically 
limits the purposes of the Trust to holding Trust Property - defined as the 
warrants) or the definition of Series Supplement.

The Subscription Agreement has been revised to provide that CIBC's commitment 
to fund on December 31, 2000 will be terminated if the Bali Trust receives 
any funds except in connection with the issuance of debt of the Bali Trust 
(which would require the consent of CIBC as the beneficial owner) or funds 
received from CIBC.

Please be aware that because of the revisions described above, it was not 
necessary to incorporate  all of Tim Elwood's comments received September 3, 
2000.

The documents in WordPerfect format are identified as follows:

(1)  Will the ISDA be negotiated prior to execution of your trade?

the trader?  Who will be responsible for payments under the swap (i.e., will

Yes

(2)  Are the trade terms correct?  You did not send me a deal ticket.  Who is 
the trader?  Who will be responsible for payments under the swap (i.e., will 
it be you)?

The project company Lost Creek will be responsible for payments under the 
swap.

(3)  What happened to comments on the Schedule?

We spoke to Barclays about your comments and other comments from BR (who is 
the admin partner for Lost Creek).  A revised version of the comments is due 
from Barclays.  I will send them to you once I get them.

(4)  Who is reviewing the Schedule from a credit perspective?

No one from Enron credit is reviewing it.  It does not seem that such a 
review is necessary -- give me a call and we can discuss.  We have negotiated 
a cross acceleration to the project debt (rather than a cross default).

Could you please refax my comments to your Schedule?  I have misplaced my 
version.  Thanks.  Sara

Yes

I wanted to thank each of you for your contributions to date on Project 
Raptor.  By the end of the day, we will have successfully completed 
incorporation of the public hedge candidates into the Raptor Structure.  I 
appreciate the hard work that it took to get it done and apologize for being 
a pain.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that the private hedge 
candidates must be completed ASAP.  If you have any checklist response forms 
that have not been completed for the private candidates, please complete and 
return them to me immediately.  Many thanks.

All:  During the fourth quarter, 2000, MLB intends to transfer all FX

transfer with the result that any executed master agreement with MLB will be 
transferred to MLIB Ltd as principal.  ENA has an ISDA Master Agreement dated

Attached are the transaction documents for Project Tahiti.  Each of the 
documents is marked to show revisions against the version circulated last 
Wednesday, August 30.  As we discussed on the phone, we have incorporated the 
business agreement reached between CIBC and Enron, as follows:

The Tahiti Series Trust Agreement has been revised to require the consent of 
all certificateholders (which includes Fiji Z LLC, which can only consent 
with the consent of its Class B Member - CIBC) prior to (i) the creation of 
any series after December 31, 2000 (see definition of Series Supplement) and 
(ii) making any amendments to the purpose provision (which specifically 
limits the purposes of the Trust to holding Trust Property - defined as the 
warrants) or the definition of Series Supplement.

The Subscription Agreement has been revised to provide that CIBC's commitment 
to fund on December 31, 2000 will be terminated if the Bali Trust receives 
any funds except in connection with the issuance of debt of the Bali Trust 
(which would require the consent of CIBC as the beneficial owner) or funds 
received from CIBC.

Please be aware that because of the revisions described above, it was not 
necessary to incorporate  all of Tim Elwood's comments received September 3, 
2000.

The documents in WordPerfect format are identified as follows:

Closing Checklist (255001)
Trust Agreement of Tahiti (254424)
Beneficial Interest Certificate (254806)

Attached are the transaction documents for Project Tahiti.  Each of the 
documents is marked to show revisions against the version circulated last 
Wednesday, August 30.  As we discussed on the phone, we have incorporated the 
business agreement reached between CIBC and Enron, as follows:

The Tahiti Series Trust Agreement has been revised to require the consent of 
all certificateholders (which includes Fiji Z LLC, which can only consent 
with the consent of its Class B Member - CIBC) prior to (i) the creation of 
any series after December 31, 2000 (see definition of Series Supplement) and 
(ii) making any amendments to the purpose provision (which specifically 
limits the purposes of the Trust to holding Trust Property - defined as the 
warrants) or the definition of Series Supplement.

The Subscription Agreement has been revised to provide that CIBC's commitment 
to fund on December 31, 2000 will be terminated if the Bali Trust receives 
any funds except in connection with the issuance of debt of the Bali Trust 
(which would require the consent of CIBC as the beneficial owner) or funds 
received from CIBC.

Please be aware that because of the revisions described above, it was not 
necessary to incorporate  all of Tim Elwood's comments received September 3, 
2000.

The documents in Word format are identified as follows:

Good afternoon John.

Attached is a suggested draft letter.  As it is from a US company to another 
US
company, you may want to Americanise the salutations/layout etc !!

(See attached file: Enron- London terminal.doc)

As soon as I receive the signed version back form you, we can move ahead with
the installation process.

Kind regards.
Mark

Just to update you:

1.  I think that our travel plans are fairly well set and I know that Kaye 
has spoken with you on several items.
2.  Mark wanted to be sure that in Sao Paulo, meetings were being scheduled 
with outside counsel (which I believe Andrea is handling), with Randy Young 
(can you attend to that please?) and ESA necessary commercials (Andrea 
handling?).
3.  Mark wanted to make certain that we got on Don Black's calendar while in 
B.A.  Could you look into that as well?

For my own edification, who are Luiz Maurer and Orlando Gonzalez?

Please let me know if there is anything elso you need form me. 

I'll bring you up to date on Hickerson shortly.

Thanks,  Sara"

I spoke with John and he said that we just want to have an additional

Which I assume is ECT Investments.

It should be the same as whatever it says in the orignal contract.  In other 
words, if I am authorized to trade on Instinet on behalf of both ENA and ECT 
Investments then we need to have this contract say the same thing.  In 
reality, it is just a formality to get the software on my desktop.

MG Ltd. is entering into FX transactions through ENA.  The companies have 
also entered into financial copper trades (first trade 6/16/00).  I think RMT 
and MG Ltd. should enter into an ISDA Master but I don't know the long term 
plan for MG Ltd.   Please confirm.  Sara

P.S.  Have we assigned a single paralegal to handle RMT Masters?"

From time to time, we trade with counterparties that are food companies (e.g. 
Quaker Oats) or agribusinesses (e.g. Cargill) or other companies somehow 
related to the agriculture business.   Please assign all confirms, ISDAs and 
other contracts for any such companies to me for review/drafting/negotiation.

There may be situations where someone other than me is a more appropriate 
choice, and we will handle this on a case-by-case basis.  But as a general 
rule, Mark and I have agreed that it would be a good idea for me to handle 
food/agriculture counterparties from here on out.

Also on a general vein, if any of you become aware of any kind of transaction 
Enron is doing with a food/agriculture company, please bring it to my 
attention.

Thanks -- Bob

I just wanted to see if you had an opportunity to review the revised Enron

finalized.  Please call me at 713-220-4124 if there are any outstanding

Subject: Re: Tech contact for ITG Europe Platform installation

Cyrus/Julie,

Can you please coordinate with Jamie White at ITG on this install.  I don't 
really care how I get it.  I would presume that someone in our IT group 
worked with ITG to determine the best delivery method on the original 
install.  If so, please use the same architecture.  If not, please consider 
the options and if we think there exists a better method than the one being 
in Houston, let's upgrade the one in Houston concurrently with the London 
install so the two sites are in synch.

This install will initially be for European equity trading only but we may 
want to incorporate US equities at a later date as well.  Any activity on 
this setup will be governed by the same agreements currently in place as it 
will be done on behalf of both ECT Investments and Enron North America until 
further notice.

Thanks and regards,
John

Is this for European or US equities or both ?
Do you want to trade using Internet access or would you prefer a fixed link

If you could let me know

Cyrus/Julie,

Can you please coordinate with Jamie White at ITG on this install.  I don't 
really care how I get it.  I would presume that someone in our IT group 
worked with ITG to determine the best delivery method on the original 
install.  If so, please use the same architecture.  If not, please consider 
the options and if we think there exists a better method than the one being 
in Houston, let's upgrade the one in Houston concurrently with the London 
install so the two sites are in synch.

This install will initially be for European equity trading only but we may 
want to incorporate US equities at a later date as well.  Any activity on 
this setup will be governed by the same agreements currently in place as it 
will be done on behalf of both ECT Investments and Enron North America until 
further notice.

Thanks and regards,
John

Is this for European or US equities or both ?
Do you want to trade using Internet access or would you prefer a fixed link 
leased line ?
If you could let me know
Thanks

		 Subject: Trading Edge / Bond Link Agreement

The IT Contract group has been involved in reviewing documents for Trading 
Edge's Bond Link online bond trading site.  George Weber, who has since moved 
into another area, discussed various issues with Trading Edge early this 
year.  Laine Borgman, a contract administrator in the IT Contracts group, has 
become involved in the Trading Edge review during the past week.  Attached 
below are Trading Edge agreements and their responses to issues raised by IT 
Contracts.  

The primary issues Laine and I discussed yesterday are as follows:

Jurisdiction:   
Our preference is Texas, but we would accept New York.  Trading Edge's 
response is unclear, although I believe they will readily agree to New York.

Indemnification (similar to issues with Buy Side Direct):  
Agreement assigns no liability to 3rd parties which the agreement describes 
as ""providers of software"".  As Trading Edge is the nominal counterparty for 
all trades, this may be acceptable if the agreement held Trading Edge liable 
for settling trades.  However, I do not see where section 11 addresses 
Trading Edge's liability for trades.   
We would also like assurances / liability regarding the accuracy of order and 
trade information.  

Limits of Liability:
Review language in both the Access and TIPs agreements (per Trading Edge, 
they will not agree to modify the TIPs Agreement, which is dictated by a 3rd 
party).

Assignment:  
Trading Edge's agreement does not allow Enron to assign the agreement to 
other parties.  Initially, only EnronCredit.com personnel in Houston and 
possibly London would use Trading Edge's site, so this would not be an issue 
initially.  Although we would prefer that the ability to assign be included, 
this issue could be addressed later as needed.
 
Electronic Mail (#18):
We do not want to accept email communication in the event of a lawsuit.  From 
the tone of their previous response, I believe they will agree to include 
lawsuits in the definition of extraordinary matters, for which email will not 
be employed.  

Sara, how would you suggest we proceed with the Trading Edge review ?  I will 
speak with Sheila Glover regarding the involvement of Credit and Risk Control 
in our request to utilize Trading Edge's trading platform.

Thanks.

Mike

Sara,

Due to Marathon Ashland's recent request, for future confirms can we change=
=20
the current Rounding paragraph in their Confirms to:

For the purposes of the calculations of the Floating Price(s), (i) prices=
=20
quoted in Gallons shall be converted to Barrels by multiplying such price b=
y=20
42 and (ii) Floating Prices(s) relating to commodities quoted in (i) gallon=
s=20
shall be rounded to five places, (ii) MMBtu=01,s shall be rounded to four=
=20
places, (iii) barrels shall be rounded to three places and (iv) gigajoules=
=20
shall be rounded to four places. If the number after the final number is fi=
ve=20
(5) or greater then the final number shall be increased by one (1), and if=
=20
the number after the final number is less than five (5) then the final numb=
er=20
shall remain unchanged.


Everything same, except adding the Gallons to Barrels conversion.

Thanks,
Joe

		 Subject: Re: Enron Japan Trading and Enron Global Markets LLC Trading

 Darren-

 Pursuant to your questions relating to interest rate and foreign exchange 
trading in Japan, please review the advice below:

 Interest Rates and Foreign Exchange Transactions.  

 Transactions with respect to interest rates and foreign exchange (other than 
financial futures transactions) are generally not subject to specific 
regulation in Japan.  Banks, securities companies are permitted to enter into 
transactions of this type as part of their ancillary business, but are not 
granted an exclusive mandate to conduct these transactions.  

 Accordingly, it would be possible for Enron Japan Corp. to conduct interest 
rate and foreign exchange transactions with ordinary Japanese corporations as 
well as financial institutions.  

 However, in the event that Enron Japan does conduct interest rate or foreign 
exchange transactions with a  corporation that is not a financial 
institution, the risk that the transaction may be considered to be gambling 
increases.  The fact that one of the parties to a derivative transaction is 
authorized by statute to enter into the transaction will constitute a defense 
to an allegation that the transaction constitutes gambling.  If neither party 
to the transaction has the benefit of a specific authorization, it will be 
necessary to rebut an allegation of gambling by arguing that the parties had 
a legitimate business reason for entering into the transaction.  Baker & 
McKenzie has stated that this risk is relatively low and are not aware of any 
cases where such activity has been problematic.

 In addition, where the transaction constitutes an OTC financial futures 
transaction (for example, a swap where the price is based on an interest rate 
index quoted on a financial futures exchange in Japan), the transaction will 
be regulated under the Financial Futures Trading Law (see below).

 Financial Futures Transactions.  

 In summary, under the Financial Futures Trading Law, if Enron Japan wishes 
to conduct financial futures brokerage business it must hold a license.  If 
Enron Japan does not hold such a license, the counterparties with whom it may 
conduct financial futures transactions will be limited to banks, securities 
companies and members of a Financial Futures Exchange who are licensed as 
financial futures brokers.  Financial futures transactions include the 
following:

  (a) futures contracts in relation to currencies, etc. and listed options 
with respect to currencies, etc.; and

  (b) OTC financial futures transactions.

 With regard to the question as to whether the trades that you engage in have 
to be booked under Enron Japan Corp., or whether you can execute for Enron 
Global Markets LLC, this is really a tax question for Susan Musch, who I have 
copied on this e-mail.  My general understanding is that, so as not to 
develop a permanent establishment for tax purposes, which could create tax 
liabilities for an offshore entity conducting such activities, the trades 
should be booked with Enron Japan Corp. This is subject to Susan's advice, 
which will provide you further details and perhaps more sophisticated methods 
to approach this issue.

 Looking forward to seeing you back in Japan.

 Best regards,

 John

Hello John, 

As you know, I am looking at returning to Tokyo on temporary assignment  
effective September 1 to support our efforts in Enron Japan as well as to 
leverage the locational advantage for Financial trading (part of Enron Global 
Markets LLC) From what I understood of our earlier conversations, there is 
not a legal issue with entering into foreign exchange or fixed income trades 
with another counterparty located in Tokyo, whether it be another US bank or 
a Japanese bank.  Can you please generally confirm this?  Do the trades that 
I engage in have to be booked under Enron Japan/ or can I execute for Enron 
Global Markets LLC? 

Sheila,
If the trades that I do in Japan have to be booked under Enron Japan, how 
does the accounting work to effectively transfer P&l back to Gary's RC? (ie 
how are we accounting for proprietary trading p&l in London office?) and are 
there any nuances that I need to be aware of in the booking/implementation of 
these trades

Jan,
 what information are you going to need from Sheila's group in order to be 
comfortable with the transaction and accounting process? {either on 
proprietary and/or on order flow originating either in Japan or abroad- ie an 
Australian interest rate hedge that I conduct out of Japan


Sincerely,
Darren

Susan,
I would appreciate your assistance in determining how the book needs to be 
organized.  In what legal entity it needs to be.  The P&L for management 
purposes will roll up to Financial Trading in Global Markets.
Thanks. Sheila

 Darren-

 Pursuant to your questions relating to interest rate and foreign exchange 
trading in Japan, please review the advice below:

 Interest Rates and Foreign Exchange Transactions.  

 Transactions with respect to interest rates and foreign exchange (other than 
financial futures transactions) are generally not subject to specific 
regulation in Japan.  Banks, securities companies are permitted to enter into 
transactions of this type as part of their ancillary business, but are not 
granted an exclusive mandate to conduct these transactions.  

 Accordingly, it would be possible for Enron Japan Corp. to conduct interest 
rate and foreign exchange transactions with ordinary Japanese corporations as 
well as financial institutions.  

 However, in the event that Enron Japan does conduct interest rate or foreign 
exchange transactions with a  corporation that is not a financial 
institution, the risk that the transaction may be considered to be gambling 
increases.  The fact that one of the parties to a derivative transaction is 
authorized by statute to enter into the transaction will constitute a defense 
to an allegation that the transaction constitutes gambling.  If neither party 
to the transaction has the benefit of a specific authorization, it will be 
necessary to rebut an allegation of gambling by arguing that the parties had 
a legitimate business reason for entering into the transaction.  Baker & 
McKenzie has stated that this risk is relatively low and are not aware of any 
cases where such activity has been problematic.

 In addition, where the transaction constitutes an OTC financial futures 
transaction (for example, a swap where the price is based on an interest rate 
index quoted on a financial futures exchange in Japan), the transaction will 
be regulated under the Financial Futures Trading Law (see below).

 Financial Futures Transactions.  

 In summary, under the Financial Futures Trading Law, if Enron Japan wishes 
to conduct financial futures brokerage business it must hold a license.  If 
Enron Japan does not hold such a license, the counterparties with whom it may 
conduct financial futures transactions will be limited to banks, securities 
companies and members of a Financial Futures Exchange who are licensed as 
financial futures brokers.  Financial futures transactions include the 
following:

  (a) futures contracts in relation to currencies, etc. and listed options 
with respect to currencies, etc.; and

  (b) OTC financial futures transactions.

 With regard to the question as to whether the trades that you engage in have 
to be booked under Enron Japan Corp., or whether you can execute for Enron 
Global Markets LLC, this is really a tax question for Susan Musch, who I have 
copied on this e-mail.  My general understanding is that, so as not to 
develop a permanent establishment for tax purposes, which could create tax 
liabilities for an offshore entity conducting such activities, the trades 
should be booked with Enron Japan Corp. This is subject to Susan's advice, 
which will provide you further details and perhaps more sophisticated methods 
to approach this issue.

 Looking forward to seeing you back in Japan.

 Best regards,

 John

Hello John, 

As you know, I am looking at returning to Tokyo on temporary assignment  
effective September 1 to support our efforts in Enron Japan as well as to 
leverage the locational advantage for Financial trading (part of Enron Global 
Markets LLC) From what I understood of our earlier conversations, there is 
not a legal issue with entering into foreign exchange or fixed income trades 
with another counterparty located in Tokyo, whether it be another US bank or 
a Japanese bank.  Can you please generally confirm this?  Do the trades that 
I engage in have to be booked under Enron Japan/ or can I execute for Enron 
Global Markets LLC? 

Sheila,
If the trades that I do in Japan have to be booked under Enron Japan, how 
does the accounting work to effectively transfer P&l back to Gary's RC? (ie 
how are we accounting for proprietary trading p&l in London office?) and are 
there any nuances that I need to be aware of in the booking/implementation of 
these trades

Jan,
 what information are you going to need from Sheila's group in order to be 
comfortable with the transaction and accounting process? {either on 
proprietary and/or on order flow originating either in Japan or abroad- ie an 
Australian interest rate hedge that I conduct out of Japan


Sincerely,
Darren

I am trying to finalize this master during Carol St. Clair's absence.  I have 
a few questions prior to our comments.  They are:

(1)  Have you already commented on the new form of Letter of Credit 
Provisions which Carol sent to you?  This is referred to as Exhibit A to 
Paragraph 13 of Annex A.  I did not see your response.

(2)  Have you reviewed the latest Letter of Credit format?  I did not see 
your response.

(3)  What is the genesis of Part 5, Section 18 of your redline.  I know that 
DB acquired Bankers Trust, but did Carol ever review this provision?  Have 
both parties agreed as to existing transactions?

Please let me hear from you.  Thanks.  Sara"

Dear ShareBulder:

I am pleased to announce the selection of the GE Money Market Fund (the ""GE
Fund"") as an improved way to manage your ShareBuilder account cash
balances.  Beginning October 2, 2000, all customer deposits and cash balances 
will
be automatically ""swept"" into the GE Fund and maintained there.  When you
purchase stock through ShareBuilder, money will be automatically transferred
back from the GE Fund to cover your transactions.  This will all be done
automatically.  You do not have to do anything to arrange transfers and you 
will
be able to access your ShareBuilder cash balances as quickly as you can
today.

The GE Money Market Fund is administered by GE Asset Management, Inc., a
registered investment adviser and wholly-owned subsidiary of General Electric
Company.  GE is one of the largest fund management businesses in the U.S. -
their investment advisory business oversees more than $100 billion.  This
replaces our current structure, which pays daily interest on your cash
balances.  You should generally realize a higher return through the GE Fund - 
money
fund dividend yields tend to exceed the discounted T-Bill interest rates we
now pay.  GE Fund dividends will be calculated daily and posted monthly to
your online ShareBuilder account statement.

This ShareBuilder upgrade will be part of every account and will be added
to the ""Terms and Conditions"" in the account agreement.  Beginning October
2nd, all current and future customer accounts will automatically incorporate
the GE Fund for cash balances.  We will provide a link to the GE Fund's
prospectus directly from ShareBuilder.com.

Again, you don't have to do anything to effect this change.  However, if
you have any concerns or questions, please contact us via email at
mailto:customercare@netstock.com or toll-free at 888-NET-STOK between the 
hours of 6 AM
and 6 PM Pacific Time, Monday through Friday.

I am very excited about this enhancement to ShareBuilder, and I hope you
enjoy the change!

Sincerely,

Jeff Seely
President and CEO
Netstock Investment Corporation"

Thanks for being on top of this.  As I mentioned in my voice mail to you on 
Friday, no trader should conclude a transaction on behalf of ENA while 
located in a foreign country.  On several discrete occasions we have 
sanctioned exceptions to this rule but each such case had unique facts that 
permitted us to conclude that those transactions were OK.  Further, any 
physical presence by ENA is a foreign country is generally a bad idea because 
it supports a foreign tax authority's argument that ENA is doing business in 
their country.  Thus, because of that general concern, no Instinet terminal 
should be put in place on behalf of ENA in a foreign country (especially 
since for what purpose would such a thing be used - trading?) but, rather, an 
appropriate foreign affiliate of Enron should contract for such service (in 
this respect, you should speak with Janine Juggins in our London tax group - 
Janine is our resident trading tax expert in London and will be very familiar 
with the things described in this E-mail).  I will be out of the country this 
week (returning the week of the 18th) and can be reached at the Vancouver 
Hotel in Vancouver, British Columbia.  Best regards.  Steve.

As just described in my earlier E-mail on this matter, this raises several 
concerns and is not a good idea.  It would be preferable to have one of our 
foreign affiliates contract for the service.  Separately, it appears that a 
form of trading for ENA is contemplated in London which, as we have 
discussed, raises serious tax nexus concerns for us.  Consequently, I have 
cc'd Janine Juggins on this E-mail so that she is aware of matters and can 
explore to see what is actually contemplated.  Janine, I suspect that we need 
to clarify on whose behalf people work while in London (EEL?).  I will be in 
Canada this week and will try to speak with you while away but, 
alternatively, you can speak with Janine directly and/or contact me at the 
Hotel Vancouver in Vancouver, British Columbia.  Steve.

Cyrus/Julie,

Can you please coordinate with Jamie White at ITG on this install.  I don't 
really care how I get it.  I would presume that someone in our IT group 
worked with ITG to determine the best delivery method on the original 
install.  If so, please use the same architecture.  If not, please consider 
the options and if we think there exists a better method than the one being 
in Houston, let's upgrade the one in Houston concurrently with the London 
install so the two sites are in synch.

This install will initially be for European equity trading only but we may 
want to incorporate US equities at a later date as well.  Any activity on 
this setup will be governed by the same agreements currently in place as it 
will be done on behalf of both ECT Investments and Enron North America until 
further notice.

Thanks and regards,

Hopefully, none of these transactions have been ""booked"" for ENA by a trader 
located in a foreign country.  That said, the general rule is that 
intra-company transactions are generally booked directly to RMT rather than 
to ENA and then back to RMT.  I have cc'd Rhett Jackson on my reply so that 
he can confirm this since Rhett has become the ""keeper"" of the RMT technology 
for our group.  Sorry for the delay in responding.  Steve.

Subject: RMT Masters - booking trades

The following Enron companies have recently booked financial trades with 
ENA.  I think these should be booked directly with RMT.  Please advise.

Enron Netherlands Holding BV

Enron Development Funding Ltd.

EnronCredit.com Limited


Thanks for your help.  Sara

Sara, 
we are currently working with John to establish a corporate structure for 
equities trading out of London. I am due to meet with him today or tomorrow 
so will follow up on these particular trades.

Subject: Re: Instinet Corporation  

Thanks for being on top of this.  As I mentioned in my voice mail to you on 
Friday, no trader should conclude a transaction on behalf of ENA while 
located in a foreign country.  On several discrete occasions we have 
sanctioned exceptions to this rule but each such case had unique facts that 
permitted us to conclude that those transactions were OK.  Further, any 
physical presence by ENA is a foreign country is generally a bad idea because 
it supports a foreign tax authority's argument that ENA is doing business in 
their country.  Thus, because of that general concern, no Instinet terminal 
should be put in place on behalf of ENA in a foreign country (especially 
since for what purpose would such a thing be used - trading?) but, rather, an 
appropriate foreign affiliate of Enron should contract for such service (in 
this respect, you should speak with Janine Juggins in our London tax group - 
Janine is our resident trading tax expert in London and will be very familiar 
with the things described in this E-mail).  I will be out of the country this 
week (returning the week of the 18th) and can be reached at the Vancouver 
Hotel in Vancouver, British Columbia.  Best regards.  Steve.

Sara,

Please do not have anyone do any work on this aside from the install 
agreement.  I am waiting on a ruling from London's tax group and no trading 
will be done whatsoever until that point.  There is indeed a question as to 
what entity our London activity will be done out of but this is already being 
considered by the correct individuals herre in London.  I am waiting 
anxiously for the ruling on it as it is the only thing holding up my being 
able to start trading.  

The reason I am setting up a desktop in London under existing documents is 
that I want to begin trading as soon as I get the go ahead from tax and 
legal.  In other words, I do not want to get to the point where everyone has 
signed off on the structure only to be held up by technology constraints.  I 
fully expect that additional documentation/agreements will be required once 
we know exactly which entity we will be operating out of and have told 
Instinet (as well as ITG and eventually Autex) this. 

Please let me repeat: no activity will be executed on these systems until we 
get a final ruling from London's tax, legal and regulatory personnel.  Please 
do not have anyone do any additional work aside from signing the agreement 
for the install.

Thanks and regards,
John

See attached.  I advised Brian that we would await FINAL sheets prior to 
preparation of swaps so as to not redo them all as we had to do on the 
publics.  I will review the sheets today and provide comments on them as to 
swap preparation and request source data as we may need to figure out what 
some of these items are and how to write the swaps (for example, ""income 
participation certificates"").  For those that fit neatly into our template, I 
will get paralegal support on first drafts.  For the other items I will 
discuss with Sara how we will split them between us.  Stuart, will you 
distribute them to the appropriate persons for legal review comments and then 
provide the comments back to Brian Schwertner for FINAL sheet preparation.

Sara, will you handle Catalytica?  Based upon prior emails I think you worked 
on this with Bart Clark.

Hi Sara--

There are open issues regarding the L/C faciltity, so Carol and I decided not 
to comment on specific clauses until those issues were resolved.  I believe 
Carol was ok with Section 18, but it was added shortly before she left for 
maternity leave.  Because we are still trading with you under the existing BT 
ISDA, the clause is simply meant to sweep-in any exisiting BT-Enron trades 
under the new DB-Enron facility.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.  My understanding is 
that we are now scheduled to talk on Wed. at 11am NY time. I look forward to 
talking with you then.

Regards,

Steve

Steven:

I am trying to finalize this master during Carol St. Clair's absence.  I have 
a
few questions prior to our comments.  They are:

(1)  Have you already commented on the new form of Letter of Credit Provisions
which Carol sent to you?  This is referred to as Exhibit A to Paragraph 13 of
Annex A.  I did not see your response.

(2)  Have you reviewed the latest Letter of Credit format?  I did not see your
response.

(3)  What is the genesis of Part 5, Section 18 of your redline.  I know that 
DB
acquired Bankers Trust, but did Carol ever review this provision?  Have both
parties agreed as to existing transactions?

Please let me hear from you.  Thanks.  Sara

Notice No. 00-313
September 7, 2000


TO:
ALL NYMEX/COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
ALL MEMBER FIRMS
ALL CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM: NEAL WOLKOFF

RE:
POSITION ADJUSTMENT DEADLINES FOR THE OCTOBER 2000 METAL AND ENERGY CONTRACTS 
[NYMEX RULE 9.04(P) AND COMEX RULE 4.37(A)]


As a reminder, position adjustments for both NYMEX and COMEX Division metals 
contracts are prohibited beginning on the tenth business day prior to the 
first business day of the delivery month, and throughout the delivery month.  
Therefore, all position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for the 
October 2000 metals contracts must be completed prior to September 18, 2000.

Additionally, position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for NYMEX 
energy contracts are not permitted during the last three trading days of the 
respective contracts.  Rules 9.04(P) and 4.37(A) are below.

If you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact Nick Galati 
at (212) 299-2920 or Nick Falcone at (212) 299-2919.


NYMEX RULE 9.04 - CLEARING PROCEDURE

(P) Concurrent Futures Positions

(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may not 
be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other bookkeeping 
procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor transactions in 
accordance with Exchange Rules.  Provided, however, that a clearing member 
will be exempt from this requirement if: (I) one side of the concurrent 
position is established the business day prior to the date that the offset 
memoranda are filed with the Clearing House; (II) a clearing member filing 
such offset memoranda can satisfy the Exchange at its request that the delay 
in effecting the offset is attributed to an error in the filing of its 
clearing sheets; and (III) by 10:30 a.m. on the same date that a clearing 
member files such offset memoranda, the clearing member also files with the 
clearing house an updated and accurate Long Open Interest Report.

(2) For the purposes of this Rule 9.04(P), the current delivery month for 
energy futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the third 
business day, prior to termination of the respective futures contract, 
including the termination date.  The current delivery month in platinum and 
palladium commences on the tenth (10th) business day prior to the first 
business day of the delivery month.

COMEX RULE 4.37A - CONCURRENT FUTURES POSITIONS

(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may not 
be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other bookkeeping 
procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor transactions in 
accordance with Exchange Rules.  Provided, however, that a clearing member 
will be exempt from this requirement if one side of the concurrent position 
is established the business day prior to the date that the open positions are 
filed with the Clearing House.

(2) For the purposes of this Rule 4.37A, the current delivery month for 
metals futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the tenth (10th) 
business day, prior to the first business day of the delivery month.
The current delivery month for Eurotop futures commences on the open of 
trading on the tenth (10th) business day prior to the termination of the 
respective futures contract, including the termination date.

Sara, long time no see.  I won't be over for this autumn's ECT conference but 
hope to be around next year.  

Please do me a favour and look through the doc attached below, which is 
governed by New York law (in particular the reps under Section 2(d) and the 
governing law language/jurisdiction language).  The contract gives rise to 
some issues (e.g. deficient default language), which I thought I could 
address myself.  The matter is somewhat urgent.  Tks.

Martin

Please be advised that Ken Raisler from Sullivan and Cromwell will be 
conducting  Sales Practices/Anti-Manipulation Training sessions this week for 
the commercial staff.   The program covers  the legal implications of various 
activities of our commercial team -- particularly as they interact with 
customers in marketing.  The program also covers laws prohibiting market 
manipulation that might affect our trading and marketing activities.

The two hour training sessions will be  held at the Doubletree, in the 
Dezavala Room on the second floor at the listed times.   Please feel free to 
attend and observe (since legal staff are more likely to know the answers, 
you are asked not to participate in the break-out small group sessions).

  Session 1 Thursday, Sept. 14  2:00 p.m.
 Session 2 Thursday, Sept. 14  4:00 p.m.
 Session 3 Friday, Sept. 15  9:00 a.m.

Steve is absolutely correct -- all intercompany swap transactions between ENA 
and Enron Corp. affiliates should be confirmed directly by RMT.

Subject: Re: RMT Masters - booking trades  

Hopefully, none of these transactions have been ""booked"" for ENA by a trader 
located in a foreign country.  That said, the general rule is that 
intra-company transactions are generally booked directly to RMT rather than 
to ENA and then back to RMT.  I have cc'd Rhett Jackson on my reply so that 
he can confirm this since Rhett has become the ""keeper"" of the RMT technology 
for our group.  Sorry for the delay in responding.  Steve.

Sharon:  Thanks for your fax and markup of the Schedule dated Sept. 6.  There 
is a major issue which we need to discuss and that is the counterparty 
identity itself.  It appears that you have identified a DIFFERENT party to 
the agreement, namely, a limited liability company named ""SITA"", which is not 
the entity which we originally proposed,.  This does not appear to be the 
credit which we evaluated.  

Also, we insist upon a Credit Support Annex.  As you know, the agreement 
contemplates multiple transactions and the posting of collateral is a major 
issue, particularly for long-dated pulp deals.  

Can you call me tomorrow?  We need to address the major issues upfront.  You 
can reach me at 713-853-5620.  Thank you.  Sara"

Sara, long time no see.  I won't be over for this autumn's ECT conference but 
hope to be around next year.  

Please do me a favour and look through the doc attached below, which is 
governed by New York law (in particular the reps under Section 2(d) and the 
governing law language/jurisdiction language).  The contract gives rise to 
some issues (e.g. deficient default language), which I thought I could 
address myself.  The matter is somewhat urgent.  Tks.
