We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of ""NetcoOnline""

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, ""NetcoOnline"" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


NetcoOnline Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

Kara Boudreau (30570) - Gas

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00"

Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,
UBSWenergy.com

Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan"

TO:  All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan


Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the ""Personal Data"" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

	Firm						Relationship

	Bankruptcy court (i.e. motions, etc.)		
	Creditors' Committee
	U.S. Trustee
	Ernst & Young					Accountants for the Creditor's Committee
	Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin		Financial advisors for the Creditors' Committee
Blackstone					Financial advisors for Enron
Batchelder and Partners				Financial advisors for Enron
Weil, Gotshal and Manges			Bankruptcy attorneys for Enron
Milbank Tweed					Attorneys for the Creditors' Committee
Andrews and Kurth				Attorneys for Enron Corp



The following are the members of the Bankruptcy Management Committee:

Ray Bowen - Chairman
Bob Butts
Jim Fallon
Dave Glassford
Dave Gorte
Mark Muller
Julia Murray
Lou Stoler

Initially, this committee will meet on a daily basis to organize all the bankruptcy related activities as well as to prioritize requests going to the Creditors' Committee and the court.  It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors.  Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee."

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

Hi! Glad to hear you are all doing fine. Mom is good. I am still on the northwest side of town. I bought a house last summer, which I am now trying to sell. It is a three bedroom and since James and I got married it is too small. I don't know if I mentioned it, or if Ingrid did, but he has three boys. So, we have found a 5 bedroom house in the same neighborhood, Prestonwood Forest, that we will probably buy, we just have to sell ours. Mom also bought a house in the same neighborhood last summer. She moved my Granny here from Port Arthur to live with her. She is 95. I think Mom is going to go crazy dealing with her. Mother doesn't have much patience. Let me know when you can go to lunch. I would really like to see you.
See you soon, 
Laurie

SNG LNG has made the necessary filing to place its FERC Gas Tariff into effect on the proposed in-service date of the Elba Island facilities, 12/1/01.   The filing (which is 311 pages) includes revised initial rates for terminaling service.  Most of the tariff was approved in the certificate proceeding.  Substantive changes are explained in Exhibit Z1, which is in Set 7 below.

These are links to the tariff pages.  The links will open in an imaging program.  Use Ctrl-Page Up and Ctrl-Page Down to move between pages.  If you want to print anything, use the printer icon on the tool bar above the page and select ""fit to page"" under the Imaging Options drop down menu.

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2

 Organization Announcement (Correction) 

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had 
indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not 
correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided 
below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. 
EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  
will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year 
experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas 
industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive 
international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, 
please welcome Ken in his new role.

TO: Existing Firm Transportation Shippers

RE: Offers For Permanent Relinquishment of Firm Capacity in
Conjunction with the Leidy East Expansion Project



Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line (""Transco"") solicits offers
for the permanent relinquishment of firm transportation
capacity on the Transco system. Shippers holding capacity
with receipts at Leidy, PA and deliveries to Princeton
Junction or mainline points in Zone 6 may offer that
capacity for relinquishment, subject to the
conditions outlined below.


Transco intends to combine such relinquished capacity
with newly constructed capacity in order to render service
in Transco's Leidy East Expansion Project (""Leidy East"").
In accordance with the Commission's order of April 26, 2001
denying Transco's request for clarification of the MarketLink
Order, the Leidy East project will provide service to
shippers that had executed contracts that were filed with
the Commission on April 13, 2001, as part of Phase 3 of the
MarketLink project.  The capacity of the Leidy East project
will be 130,000 Dts/d.  In order to meet the proposed in-
service date of November 1, 2002, Transco plans to file
a certificate application with the Commission for Leidy
East by the end of June.



Offers for capacity relinquishment may be made by
shippers with existing transportation services as defined
above and provided under Part 284(G) of the FERC's
regulations.

Valid offers must meet the following criteria:

1. The capacity offered must result in a reduction of the
facilities otherwise required to serve the subscribing
shippers in Leidy East;

2. Inclusion of relinquished capacity in the project must
result in a lower cost of service for the project than if
additional facilities were constructed;

3. The remaining contract term for the relinquished
capacity must not exceed the primary contract term of
service for Leidy East;

4. Offers for permanent relinquishment will not be
accepted from shippers who have contracted for service
under Leidy East;

5. Offers must identify the specific contract(s) and delivery
point(s) in each contract at which delivery point entitlements
(DPEs)will be reduced as a result of the relinquishment of firm
capacity to those points; and

6. Offers must be unconditional, binding and irrevocable.

Such offers must be received by Transco no later than 5:00
PM CST on Monday, May 21, 2001. After receipt of offers to
relinquish capacity, Transco will make any modifications
necessary to the design of the facilities to be constructed
to render service in Leidy East.

Parties that submit offers to relinquish capacity will be
notified as to whether the offer complied with the
specifications set forth herein and whether the capacity
will be accepted and utilized to render service in Leidy East.
If more capacity is offered than is needed in Leidy East,
preference will be given to those offers which reduce the
cost of Leidy East to the greatest degree. In the event of
a tie, preference will next be given to those offers which
have the shortest remaining term for the capacity
relinquished.

Shippers with relinquished capacity that is included in
Leidy East will retain all rights and responsibilities set forth
in their Service Agreement(s), Rate Schedule FT and the General
Terms and Conditions of Transco's FERC Gas Tariff until
Leidy East firm transportation service commences through the
relinquished capacity.  The Leidy East firm transportation
service is expected to commence on November 1, 2002.
The relinquishing shipper's service agreement(s) will be
terminated or reduced effective on the actual in service date.
Transco's acceptance of relinquished capacity is and will be
subject to the following:

1. Execution and delivery by the shipper to Transco of an
agreement to permanently relinquish such firm transportation
capacity (such agreement to be provided by Transco);

2. Execution and delivery of an amendment to the shipper's firm
transportation contract reflecting any modifications resulting
from the relinquishment of a portion of the service related to
such capacity, if applicable;


3. Receipt of a FERC certificate authorizing the proposed
Leidy East facilities and service (including approval of this
capacity relinquishment) in a form acceptable to Transco in its
sole opinion.


In the event that Leidy East does not go forward for any reason,
including, without limitation, the FERC authorizations being
granted in a form unacceptable to Transco, the capacity
relinquishment shall not be effectuated and all related
agreements shall be null and void.

Parties desiring more information regarding this announcement
should contact Nancy Hargrove at 713-215-2926.

Judy,
My customer is getting serious about the Transco Zn 4 delivered deal.  Can

settlement?
Thanks,
Sean"

May 11, 2001

Texas Eastern Transmission (TE) will have planned maintenance work
beginning at 9AM, Tuesday, May 15 and ending at 9AM Thursday, May 17 on
the discharge of Blessing Compressor Station (BLE) and on the McAllen
line downstream of the Pemex Interconnection (PMX).  TE requests that
prior to and during this period, to the maximum extent possible,
shippers ensure that scheduled receipts into the system do not exceed
scheduled deliveries out of the system in STX, ETX or the 24"" system.

This maintenance will block all gas moving East through Blessing
Compressor Station, and due to the resulting limited capability to move
gas out of STX/ETX, there will be a systematic scheduling required for
all receipts between Blessing Station and Fagus Compressor Station (FGS)
on the 24"" system beginning at 9AM on gas day Tuesday, May 15. Based on
currently scheduled volumes, the cuts could have a significant impact on
scheduled receipts in the area specified.  TE strongly recommends TABS
parties rank their markets prior to 11 AM Monday.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.

Notice to:  All Producers, Receipt Point Operators, Interconnecting
Pipelines and Shippers on the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line
Corporation System

Subject:  North Terrebonne Processing Plant - Notice of Force Majeure

Transco received the following notice today from the operators of the
Terrebonne plant.

 ""In accordance with Article XVII of the above referenced
agreement please be advised that the North Terrebonne Gas Processing
Plant and Tebone Fractionation Plants shut down yesterday, May 10,
2001.  The shut down was due to a propane leak on the suction side of
one of the refrigeration compressors at North Terrebonne.  An incident
investigation team is preparing to investigate the exact cause of the
leak.  Present estimates of the duration of the shut down are uncertain
but may be as long as three to five days.""

As a result of this outage, delivery points on Transco will see a
temporary increase in the heating content (Btu) of the quantities
received from the Transco system.  Transco expects the situation to be
alleviated shortly per the above notice and will provide an update as
it is received from the plant operators.

If you have any questions, please contact your Transportation
Scheduling Representative.

Sean-

Transco's 4/1/01 filed rates for the path you're intersted in are as follows:

IT   Z3-Z4 Max Rate= $.2742 dth/d 
  GPS=   $.0097dth/d
  GRI=  $.0070dth/d
  ACA=  $.0022 dth/d




FT Z3-Z4 Demand
  Max Rate= $.2698dth/d
  GRI=  $.0030dth/d

FT Z3-Z4 Commodity
  Max Rate= $.0152dth/d
  GPS=  $.0097dth/d
  GRI=  $.0070dth/d
  ACA=  $.0022dth/d

As we discussed, the settlement process in this case has not even yet begun 
so it will be some time before we know what the final rates will be.  It's 
likely that the 40% requested increase will be cut in half...but until we see 
the Commission staff's top sheets (their assessment of Transco's case), I 
won't have a firm basis for making a prediction.  As a result, I'd suggest 
that you write into the agreement that the rate to be paid will be the ""then 
applicable rate"" or some similar language that gives you the ability to true 
up or down as needed.

If you'd like me to put together some language for your contract with respect 
to regulatory adjustment to the price, or need any additional information, 
please let me know.  II'll forward you the tariff sheets these rates are 
based on this morning.

Thanks,
Suzanne"

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your user 
id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

""Of course, Transco is free to file a new application requesting certificat=

In filings before FERC acted, the state of New York said Transco should be=

Hello All-

Attached above are the cover letter and proposed tariff sheets filed by Texas 
Eastern yesterday for a June 1 effective date.  The rate changes reflect 
under recoveries in their ASA account which tracks their cash-out mechanism 
and increased cost of system fuel.  The underrecovery in the ASA account has 
increased from $22,000 to over $22,000,000 over the period September 1--March 
31.  Texas Eastern claims that this is largely a result of the gaming of 
their currently monthly cash-out (which will likely be changed to weekly in 
their 637 proceeding).  As a result, Texas Eastern is seeking a waiver of the 
annual filing period in order to begin collecting the underrecovery through a 
surcharge that would amount to as much as $.0354 from ELA-M3.  Texas Eastern 
proposes to begin recovery in June so as to extend the recovery period from 
12 months (Dec-Nov) to 18 months (Jun-Nov), which will lower the level of the 
surcharge.

We'll review the filing to see if there are any grounds for protest / 
comment.  These types of dollars are usually ""rubber-stamped"" by FERC for 
pass-through but the filing to change the recovery time period may give us 
some grounds to protest the recovery.

 The full filing can be found at :  
http://infopost.link.duke-energy.com/infopost/default.asp?pipe=TE

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional 
information.

Thanks,
Suzanne"

Subject: MARCH 2001 Payment to SEC - Revision


Mary - Please review the attached revisions to HI 199. The changes are 
1. Transport Rate for baseload gas is 3 cents plus fuel 
2. The prices for Excess gas are based on transport to Sta 65, then sta 65  
prices.

Sent:	Thursday, November 01, 2001 11:15 AM
To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	Daily Update


Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you."

Hope things are going well for you.  I'm still here.  I don't know for how long...sounds like we may know something by tomorrow????  Don't know for sure.
Hope to talk to you soon!

From: 	Enron Office Of The Chairman

Subject:	Organizational Announcement


As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO."" This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal."

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins."

Subject:	PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com."

Do we do any business on Chandeleur?  They have filed to expand their system 
by about 40,000 Mcf/d and to interconnect with Destin Pipeline at the 
Pascagoula Chevron refinery.  Apparently there was an open season.

Please let me know within the next couple of days whether we should intervene 
or not.  I have never had any inquiries or expressions of interest in 
Chandeleur, so I will assume not unless I hear from you otherwise.

Subject: Any Petal Gas Storage Issues?

As reported previously in the trade press, Petal Gas Storage has decided to 
build its own pipeline to connect its storage facility in Forrest Co., MS to 
interconnections with Southern Natural, Destin, and Transco in Clarke and 
Jasper Cos., MS.  We have received FERC's notice of the application (Docket 
No. CP01-69), and will be filing an intervention before the February 20 
deadline.  Southern Company Services has contracted for the full 700,000 
Mcf/day of capacity for a term of 20 years.  The project calls for about 59 
miles of 36-inch pipeline and a 9,000 HP compressor station at a cost of 
about $94,343,700.

As part of its application, Petal also submitted pro forma tariff provisions 
and rates for firm and interruptible transportation services and asked for 
authority to charge negotiated rates.  Petal also requested approval of 
certain deviations from the pro forma transportation agreement for the 
contract with Southern, apparently to allow Southern to act as agent for its 
affiliated operating electric utilities to apportion capacity among them.

Please advise if you have any issues with Petal that should be made a part of 
our intervention.  The certificate application is 635 pages, not including 
another 778 pages for the environmental reports, so I'm not going to request 
a copy unless someone indicates a desire to review it.

Conference


David Reitz of National Fuel indicated that the pipeline is back to its 
position before the last technical conference with regard to keeping the TBF 
fee a part of the imbalance resolution process as opposed to making it a 
separate service.  As a fall back position, National Fuel will seek guidance 
from FERC as to whether it should be made into a new service.  To make PA OCA 
happy, David Reitz indicated that any future proposal will incorporate the 
50-50 sharing that is in the current proposal.

National Fuel plans to make a revised pro forma tariff filing in mid-January 
and inform FERC that this filing resulted from the collaborative effort of 
parties to the proceeding.  The filing will have reservation of rights 
language that preserves National Fuel's right to file something completely 
different when it files to place the revised tariff sheets into effect.  
Prior to making the filing, National Fuel will circulate the explanatory 
transmittal letter and pro forma tariff sheets, and will flag any changes 
made to the pro forma tariff sheets.  This pre-filing circulation should 
occur some time during the first two weeks in January.

Nothing was said about the intra-day recall provisions.


>>> <Rebecca.W.Cantrell@enron.com> 12/18/00 03:39PM >>>

Yes, please.  I have another meeting, so I probably won't be able to dial
in.  What are the directions, just in case?

Let me know if they try to make any changes in the intraday recall
provisions.

Thanks.

Hi Judy,

I spoke with Chris Germany yesterday and he said that you were going to take 
care of fixing the Oglethorpe deal.  An unhappy Doug Jones from Oglethorpe 
called me yesterday.  He is wanting to get the corrected invoice ASAP so he 
can have the wire to us before year end.  If he doesn't get the invoice 
today, he will not pay us until after the first of the year.  

Please let me know when to expect the changes to come across so I can forcast 
the cash receipt in our system for treasury and also let Doug know when the 
invoice will be faxed over to him.


Thanks to everyone involved for all of your help.  Merry Christmas!

Could you please send the service agreement into Koch for the Ormet 
transaction.  This memo that I wrote to Scott details the rates that we have 
negotiated with Koch.  Koch has to post our deal for five days, so could you 
please try to send it out today if at all possible.  I am also sending you 
the draft letter agreement that Koch sent to us which we will also need to 
execute.  We will also need to put an IT agreement in place with Koch.  They 
have offered the same discounted rates on an IT basis for any volumes above 
the 15,000/d of FT.

Also, could you please arrange to put in place an IT agreement on Cypress for 
delivery to Ormet Aluminum's Burnside,LA

Thanks for your help.

Subject: Ormet

Scott:

Ormet's Burnside,LA Aluminum refinery is dually connected to Koch and Cypress.
The transport rates that  Koch has quoted for FT to Ormet are as follows:

From Bridgeline/Paradis or LRC/ Paradis .03 demand charge

from Venice     .05 demand charge

from the Mobile Bay pooling point on Koch .045 demand charge
(if we buy upstream of the pooling point then we would also pay a .0246 
gathering fee on Mobile Bay)

In addition we will be charged .0022 ACA from any of these receipt points.

The fuel rate is 1.6%.  This will be passed on to Ormet.

Koch has agreed that any volumes in excess of the 15/d of FT will be at the 
same discounted rate, but will flow on an IT basis.  If this IT is cut, we 
still must use best efforts to transport from other receipt points on Koch or 
on Cypress.  Ormet pays all additional transport costs.
Additionally, we have a price re-opener if Koch changes from monthly 
balancing at any point during the contract term.
I am working with Koch to get secondary delivery points on Koch in the event 
that the desk wants to take the gas elsewhere (i.e. if Ormet doesn't need the 
gas or if you choose to deliver off of Cypress).  If you have any preferences 
for alternate delivery points, please let me know.

As I mentioned, we  have already quoted NYMEX + .055 as the all-in delivered 
price to Ormet.

Ormet would like to come to agreement on this transaction today (his wife is 
due any day so he will be out of the office starting tomorrow).  They are one 
hour ahead of us so your comments are greatly appreciated.

Thank you for all of your help on this deal.

Craig

We have learned the following from a talkative DTI rep:

DTI intends to  modify its existing 637 proposals.  Apparently, in light of 
customer opposition, DTI intends to withdraw its proposal to shorten the 
imbalance make-up period from 20 days to 72 hours and will instead develop a 
new rate schedule for electric generators, who it claims are the entities 
that drove DTI's need to shorten the make-up period in the first instance.

Here is the message I received from my technical folks. (below in red).
As you can see a lot of work is involved.  Let me know how much you would
plan to nominate at this point, etc.    And can they committ to a certain,
volume, etc.   Also,  have they talked to HPL about taking gas at this
point.


After visiting the site (M&R 71886/76886), I found the following work that
would need to be done before custody transfer measurement could be
performed :
 (The site has two 12"" meter runs with valve switching (bidirectional flow)
and run switching - and has not flow gas in over 10 years)

1. All valves will need to be inspected & overhauled
     A. Run switching valve - major overhaul (needs to be sent off for this
work)
     B. Control valves - inspected & overhauled (needs to be sent off for
this work)
     C. Small regulators overhauled
2. Both meter tubes pulled and inspected
     A. Sr. fitting needs to be overhauled
     B. Tubes will need to be honed (needs to be sent off to have fitting
overhauled and tubes honed)
3. All transmitter need to be replaced
     A. Differential - 2
     B. Temperature - 2 (1 additional from original setup)
     C. Pressure - 4
     D. Direct mount manifolds - 2
     E. UPS system
4. RTU boards need to be furnished
     A. Mother board
     B. STI REM
     C. Main terminal board
     D. Serial IO LEM
     E. Analog Output board
5. New batteries ( 4 @ $ 160)
6. Two sets of orifice plates (In .50"" increments through Beta range)

It would take at least 1.5 months to re-work the station controls and
associated valves, meter runs, and EGM.  If you need more information
please let me know.

It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the=

first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen.  We recogniz=
e=20
that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron=01,s business goals, and w=

=20
through Enron stock options.=20

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=
he=20
All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided valu=

to participants through 2000.  Employees who have participated in this=20
program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of=
=20
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the=20
program.  =20

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package=

and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron=01,s continued=
=20
success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and=
=20
Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid=
ed=20
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for=
=20
calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  =
It is=20
expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted,=
=20
effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib=
le=20
on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to=
=20
final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to=20
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and=20
international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base=20
salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on=20
December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some=20
international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.
? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated gran=
t=20
of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O=

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =

Note: In addition to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, grant=

Do you know anyone who would like or need detailed maps from the Final 
Environmental Impact Statement for Gulfstream?  I typically don't keep 
environmental information for projects because it takes up so much room and 
nobody ever asks for it.  However, this does have facility location maps of 
the project and various alternatives.  The full system is broken down into 
121 topographic maps, so it's very detailed.  This may not be the final 
routing, but it will be pretty close.

First come, first served.  I only have one volume.

Further to our conversations, I would like to meet with you guys to discuss Q1. Specifically, I would like Stephanie and Kim to provide for me a list of your Q1 activities, achievments, actions items and then summarize your plans for Q2 and rest of year. 

Let's do this as a group first, and then if anyone wants to talk directly about specific commercial issues then we can do so on a one off basis. 

I have asked Jessica  to book 2 hours( video conference room )  for next tues. May 8. 

Pls advise if there are any questions.

Rumor has it that Paramount had signed up for the short term emergency firm on Kern.... not that it matters but I was wondering if that was true. 

If so, he may want to hedge this pipe and you guys could spin some orig off of it.

Further to our conversation, pls release $ 1,004,000 US funds to the Canadian Orig Desk Head, Eric Ledain. 

These funds will come out of the prudency account that has been set up to distribute these payment obligations.

Gerald, I would like to raise a confirm between ENA and ECC that stipulates why we are paying them these amounts. 

Total payment was in consideration of ECC syndication of PCHC and Misako of which the granted amount on Misako was $ 200,000 .


If there are any questions, give me a call.

Mark, In my discussions with Lavorato, he has asked us to provide a summary/outline of the business operations of each of the co's that we have syndicated this capacity with. 

Set up your summary that includes, Co. Name, Principal, primary business, dealings history ( if any ), number of employees, contact name of deal maker. 

Cannon, Patina, FMI Weld, Huber,Misaka

Don't spend too much time with this, but a little history on each co. is what John wants for his review. 

Thanks, BT "

Glad to hear about the vegas grouping.  Rumor has it that you and i are bunking together... John thought you might want to share a king bed but until we get to know each other better, we should get two queens.  Can you look after getting us a room.  I have not stayed at the belagio, should be nice.  I will call you sometime tues.  See you on friday around 6:00 pm.

This packages will always be a work in progress ....make sure that the message that you are intending to deliver is delivered so have a wrap up slide(s) that brings the whole thing home and leaves your customers with a summarized version of your presentation.

Kim, I would like to use this format in our discussions with Long Beach and Palo Alto... In light of my schedule I would ask that you ensure that the material is in the format you would like.  

Also, our discussions with Long Beach are going to be around outsourcing and their performance against Socal's index... We have done some analysis of this data but not enough to bring in recommendations.

As part of our discussions, we need a section on Risk Management Services, historical pricing Socal vs Long Beach. Recommendations on some risk management products and then next steps slides. 

Our objective with both co's is to get involved in their management and outsourcing of some of their load.  I would like to pursue a proposal whereby we setup with Long beach a 3 or 5 year structure that provides both long term and short term incentives on their price vs Socal. 

I will call you on Tues. a.m.

The Enron stock that I sold was in US funds.  I then coverted it to Canadian $'s and that is what is on my T4.  The equities that I owned did include Communications System International, and I think that is it.... However, I am travelling and unable to confirm this for you until Apr. 24. or so.

Tanya, here are the draft confirms that we have negotiated with Sierra. I am also going to add some specific language regarding delivery point and pro-rata cuts.. and you guys need to work with gerald and put in netting / set off language that you feel protects our interests. 

As an aside, I talked to the commercial person at Sierra and advised them that we will be amending this draft again to incorporate Netting provisions and she advised me that that would not be a problem. 

Thanks.  BT

Bill, the language that we have used for discounting had a 200 basis point amount attached to it. It should not be included based on our last conversation.. If this is going to be attached as a schedule  then it still needs to go through some changes. 

The calculation, summary page is almost complete.

Gerald, rather than say mid month.... define the language to say... start date shall be Aug 1.  in the event that the start date is delayed past Aug 1 and prior to Sept 1, then the start date shall be Sept 1.

This can be rolled for another month.

Marg, you had co-ordinated for me the L1-A visa I acquired to move from Canada to Houston. 

I need a lawyer to assist in the preparation and filing of a Visa for my spouse. She has been advised to pursue a visa called ""TN"" which would allow her to work as a registered nurse. Apparently under the US - Canada free trade agreement, she can acquire this visa which is supposed to be low cost and easy to get.   

Can you advise as to the best route to get this underway.

You can direct Kern that we are prepared to underpin that exposure such that Enron wears that risk.... as
 1. there should be no risk anyways, and 
2.  if there were to be any, it should be ENA's anyways.

My arguments remain the same regarding gas coverage. I believe that gas coverage responsibilities belong to west gas.  This coverage should be transitioned over to a marketing rep in west gas, and I would like that to be you.

Subject:	L-P Natural Gas

Mark and Eric,

John Malowney here in the Portland office is trying to assist Louisiana-Pacific in financially hedging their overall gas exposure.  The attached e-mail and spreadsheet outline the basics.  Essentially, he would like to group their plants into 5 or 6 general pricing regions for parsimony.  At this point, we are looking for assistance roughly grouping these plants together.  Obvioulsy, If L-P is interested in this type of hedge, we will be contacting you for further assistance in obtaining quotes.  L-P has made it clear that they wish to deal with only one point-man at Enron and John has that role.  He is currently out of the office, so you should get back to me with any questions or needed clarifications.

Thanks for your assistance.  Please contact me by phone (503.464.8122) or e-mail.

Todd A. Perry

Todd, if you're not the man that's fine but I'm hoping you are.... 

Attached is L-P's total natural gas volumes.  The plan is to financially hedge them at the various hubs in the $4.50 to $5.00/MMBTU range over a one year period.  They feel a longer time period would warrant a lower price/MMBTU.  I've listed the various states and or provinces but I have no idea as to the corresponding hubs.  I have already provided L-P with an ISDA which they are in the process of reviewing.   L-P would like to meet here in Portland to discuss our proposed plan on Tuesday April 24th.  Let me know when you want to discuss a game plan.  JOHN

Judy, attached is a summary report I received from Enron. Please disregard the information I had submitted in the organizer.... as it is incomplete.  I gave up on that system because I was unable to put in decimal points... 

This is the complete list of ENRON Corp stock that I sold in 2000 and has all the relevent information on it.

I have read the agreement, believe we need to hold the recall rights as per El Paso's direction, however let's discuss. 

Call me when you are ready to meet. 

Note:  Bill, I would like to discuss with you the possibility of reducing the "" Capacity"" in consideration of PGE selling us outright the citygate gas...

Bill, you would have to structure your paper with PG& E such that their MTM amount computes to an amount of capacity assigned to us to handle this position.  With EL Paso having receipt point flexability, but subject to change we must be very careful in our bid assumptions on this pipe that we would be assuming as a result of this.  As i had said yesterday, San Juan receipt point status is a lot cheaper than Permian... and changes the economics considerably.

Jim, good to hear from you.  Glad to hear that everything is going OK.  My transition down to Houston has all in all gone pretty good.  We settled in pretty quick at home and Kim is being quite a trooper regarding her home life although I know she misses outside interaction. She may be able to work soon so this should help keep her busy. 

Work has been exiting, the West US markets have provided good opportunities to me and I am slowly making my way to meet the customers.  I could easily spend every day on the road. 

I have loved the winter.. hilight has to be no snow to shovell... but I will pay the price for the summer because you can't do anything when it is a 100 degrees.  

Better run,.... drop me a line sometime... and if you are ever getting your way down this way, call first, we will get together.

Further to our meeting in Denver.... and as agreed, we are going to create a consolidated fundamentals package that will be maintained, controled and distributed by our group.  This package will form part of all of your outgoing conversations with customers and will be set up in such a way that it can be customized for each customer group, buyers or sellers. 

In short form, the information package will include:

*	Supply:		Complete historicals and forecasts for WCSB 
*	Demand:	historical demand broken down by tradeclass, region, 
*	Transportation:	historical loads, basis transport values, expansions etc
*	Generation:	gas fired new gen information that will affect future supply demand
* 	Storage:	AGA's historical - by region
* 	Hydro:		Historical flows / snow pack reports... items that will affect Hydro this year .. perhaps next
*	Misc:		Summary of misc and related items that will have an effect on West gas and power.. things that drive our business.'
*	Conclusions:	Summarize all of these variables.. update and make a determination on whether are not we are bullish - bearish-neutral.

I will track down an old copy of the files that we used ot use so as to not reinvent the wheel if and where at all possible.

WHO: Phillip will take the lead on putting this information package together. Dave Fuller will assist in some of the output. 

TIMELINE: 	This should be completed in draft form by the end of the week...


We should be after a guality package that we are prepared to take to our customers on a qrtly basis as part of our customer coverage rotation.

Call if any questions. Previous packages that you think are helpful shoudl be sent into phil's attention.

Mark, further to our conversation... Mercado transacted with Enron North
America under the terms and conditions of a financial transaction and these
transactions have been or will be settled financially, however these
transactions could have been set up as physical.  The structure of the
transaction changes as a result of a few variables, including the price,day
of cash settlement, and curtailment issues on San Jan deliveries which
would then automatically convert the fixed price portion to 100% load
factor and settlement would be on 100% of the volume regardless as to what
physically flowed.

Please call me if there are any questions regarding this note.

Brad, further to our conversation of yesterday morning, please find attached 
Enron's payout table and alternative payout table regarding the permanent 
assignment of PGT capacity. 

The onus will be on Enron to deliver long dated capacity to Calpine and we 
will begin working on this immediately.

Below is a summary of some of the key next steps. Please review and we can 
discuss on Monday the numbers and final steps as required. 

ENA and Calpine will formalise  % discount, volume grid, lump sum $ amount or 
annuity amount. 
As discussed our cost of funds implied will be LIBOR + 200 basis points. ( to 
be confirmed ).
ENA will raise a precedent agreement with option language in favor of Calpine 
which allows you to request that the period 2 volume  be no less than the 
period 1 volume and up to the total delivered volume of 67,500 based on the 
agreed to % discount as referenced in point #1. 
ENA will forward the draft precedent agreement which will include the 
necessary conditions precedent required and with the general commercial terms 
as agreed per items above (ETA - Tues/Wed). 
ENA will provide a bid to Calpine on Monday afternoon with a number on the 
Spark Spread proposal.
Contact name @ Trans Canada and ANG is Kay Coad Ph: 403-267-2480.  
  
I trust the information as provided above is consistent with our previous 
discussions.  Please contact me once you have had a chance to review. 

Regards,

BT

Mark, Stephanie further to our conversations please find a summary list which 
I will need some help on.  As part of our business plan for 2001 Phillip and 
myself will make a presentation to Delainey et al regarding the West 
Initiatives.  This is going to happen by Dec. 8.  

As you guys know our group in total is going to be made up of a few key areas.

Producer Services 
Transportation
Origination/ Middle Marketing
Trading


Can you put together in draft form a business plan for next year that 
outlines some key items. Once we have a first pass at this, we can 
incorporate into the overall package and decide how this fits in with our new 
group. 
 
The key subject items should include:  

SM/MW/BT 1> Market Overview - supply demand fundamentals in your area. 
SM/MW/BT 2> Strategies and opportunities for 2001 ( What new initiatives will 
we implement ?)
SM/MW/BT 3> New products and structures for your area
SM/MW/BT 4> Issues in 2000 ( what didn't work ?)
BT  5> Organization Issues / people /transition etc. 


If you could start thinking about these in greater detail, we can then go 
through and incorporate into the west orig. objectives. 

Call me to discuss, but we should start to discuss detail early next week.  

BT 

Thanks,  BT "

For your information. please find attached the spreadsheet that I sent to 
Calpine for their consideration. 

Action: 

Peter is going to review the assignment doc's and with Steve raise the proper 
legal document that protects ECC/ENA's interests.  At this time, Peter and I 
are of the opinion that a new agreement may be all we need but we will 
discuss on Monday.

Julie/ Stephanie/Eric....we need to discuss the numbers again. The real 
producer unwind costs may be really ugly, which basically means that our 
numbers may be too low to Calpine.. even with the counter offer, the front 
end economics are pulling a lot of value out of the deal. 


Assuming numbers can be agreed too by everyone, we are positioning ourselves 
for a package out to the producers for early next week. 

Stephanie.. one of our customers has asked for California fundamentals... 
overview... do we have anything available.  

Talk to everyone on Monday.

I have also received the bridge loan documents and have signed these forms 
and sent them back to as of right now via inter office mail..... you should 
have by tommorrow ( Weds).  Can you please sign as required.

Chris, further to our conversation of yesterday I believe that we should 
impliment the plan that we had discussed.  Effective immediatly, we should 
instruct all parties involved that West Gas marketing issues will be handled 
by the Houston based team.  Coverage, Accountability, origination, 
structuring will now become the sold responsibility of Kim and myself. The 
only thing that we ask of your people is an expeditious transition with the 
customer.  In a lot of cases, this has already happened. On the circumstances 
where it has not we should be able to transition very quickly.  

Kim will be your mid marketing conduit to pricing and information.... If a

4.  Do you have all the final economics on costs, mortage amount, Taxes, Int. 
Rate, Monthly payments.
5. You sent me a package which lists all of the closing costs.. Am I too 
assume you are paying those directly and getting reimbursed by ENA or do I

Fran.... Kerri Rigsby from Associates will be contacting you regarding the 
Bridge Loan.  She needs a letter on file verifying that I will have these 
funds. 

We still need to decide where we are going to put this money. For right now, 
we should plan on me signing the promisary note by fax, and then have a 
cheque sent up to me in Canada so that I can consolidate with the rest of the 
funds required for closing. 

Thanks. BT "

Subject: Enron - PGT Payout Table

Brad, further to our conversation of yesterday morning, please find attached 
Enron's payout table and alternative payout table regarding the permanent 
assignment of PGT capacity. 

The onus will be on Enron to deliver long dated capacity to Calpine and we 
will begin working on this immediately.

Below is a summary of some of the key next steps. Please review and we can 
discuss on Monday the numbers and final steps as required. 

ENA and Calpine will formalise  % discount, volume grid, lump sum $ amount or 
annuity amount. 
As discussed our cost of funds implied will be LIBOR + 200 basis points. ( to 
be confirmed ).
ENA will raise a precedent agreement with option language in favor of Calpine 
which allows you to request that the period 2 volume  be no less than the 
period 1 volume and up to the total delivered volume of 67,500 based on the 
agreed to % discount as referenced in point #1. 
ENA will forward the draft precedent agreement which will include the 
necessary conditions precedent required and with the general commercial terms 
as agreed per items above (ETA - Tues/Wed). 
ENA will provide a bid to Calpine on Monday afternoon with a number on the 
Spark Spread proposal.
Contact name @ Trans Canada and ANG is Kay Coad Ph: 403-267-2480.  
  
I trust the information as provided above is consistent with our previous 
discussions.  Please contact me once you have had a chance to review. 

Regards,

BT

A bit dramatic, but a good story nonetheless.
--------------------------



Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=
ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=
st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=
arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=
e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=
 way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=
ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=
ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=
rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=
hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=
orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=
blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=
g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=
size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=
tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=
ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=
pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=
s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=
inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=
ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=
levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's =
Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!""
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=
m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=
. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=
cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=
lion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles th=
roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,""=
 notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=
rket intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=
d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=
y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =
formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =
selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=
mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=
 to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=
nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=
ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=
ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =
power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =
new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=
ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=
he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=
rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=
eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great mar=
riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=
ntality of the financial markets.""
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=
d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=
 was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=
an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =
culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=
he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=
o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=
 the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=
 company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =
$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=
rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=
 his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=
ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=
, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=
nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=
nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=
tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=
t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about b=
usiness-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone=
-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=
e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =
once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=
ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=
 off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=
lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=
ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=
ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=
t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=
ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=
rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=
hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone cou=
ld actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=
istmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all th=
e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20
From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=
 photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=
f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=
ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=
er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I =
never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=
gest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=
en-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=
nything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =
on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure=
 that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally=
. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=
s pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that wou=
ld not have been good for me.""=20
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=
some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=
duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=
 underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=
eporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are =
bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=
its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=
 upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understa=
nding this.""
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=
neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=
lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=
o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=
ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=
ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=
 hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=
se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=
at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =
in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=
 the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=
uch humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=
es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=
as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=
ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=
olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=
ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=
y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=
 from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=
s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=
o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=
toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=
ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=
dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=
NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=
e of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=
mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =
pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=
n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=
 in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =
Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being call=
ed ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=
ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=
avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=
nning a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a=
 better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at tha=
t time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change.""
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=
 debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =
exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =
new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=
tarted.=20
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=
d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=
ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=
llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I l=
iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told Busines=
sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =
wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =
was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=
hat he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and=
 he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=
odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=
k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=
s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=
up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =
a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=
, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=
 all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=
ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=
one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=
here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=
 called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=
e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =
a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =
risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=
estment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" The=
n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=
utives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says=
, ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=
ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=
en said, ""Let's go.""
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=
 cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=
ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=
se divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would=
 be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =
even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=
, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =
character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=
 joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in=
."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=
on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=
r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=
. After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back.""
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=
d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=
ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =
gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=
ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=
est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =
to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=
etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=
ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=
rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=
th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =
have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=
ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=
ess. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a s=
kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=
t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=
f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=
 industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=
older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =
money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to=
 create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The peo=
ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=
rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.""
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=
martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=
cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =
wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=
gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=
oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""a=
ggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=
ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20
You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston h=
eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=
n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=
 day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=
bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense =
of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =
candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=
he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =
Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=
ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =
than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=
ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=
g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=
nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=
turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=
lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=
pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=
 with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=
e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=
on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=
ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=
erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=
m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=
en at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with=
 the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about th=
e psychology and what it took to keep these people going.""
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=
, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=
e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=
nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=
es-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=
 make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=
til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=
ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =
with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=
. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=
ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=
f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=
ectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=
d say,"" one loyalist says.=20
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=
erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=
uzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=
ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=
 Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=
ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=
n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=
ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=
rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=
e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=
rts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=
ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =
the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=
gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=
n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=
2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=
 in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New =
York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=
ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=
sforming another.
""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,""=
 sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilitie=
s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed For=
tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=
e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=
, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=
cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=
el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=
 client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=
e against the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c=
ommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=
came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=
nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=
d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=
on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=
y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi=
ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=
t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=
 deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=
 in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strat=
egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=
dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insis=
ted.
There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =
the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=
ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=
omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=
o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=
ents as customers and began calling them ""counterparties.""
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=
aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=
 overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=
e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=
l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=
derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=
ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=
, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=
d at all.=20
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-marke=
t accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=
ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=
 idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge=
t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=
nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=
ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=
 went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=
ht be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" inves=
tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=
et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=
t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =
going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" =
says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=
any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=
 for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=
ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=
ting literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away=
 for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says.
As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =
took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=
ron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change st=
arted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =
of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=
he commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=
rhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an in=
telligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=
e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=
rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=
o disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=
. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=
killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=
ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=
hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu=
ickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi=
sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=
iate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=
 store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=
n's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att=
itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=
e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=
on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=
 he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=
ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =
""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=
ight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de=
als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=
ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=
n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became a=
n Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says=
 one former Enron executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=
ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=
 E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=
e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =
but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=
s way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=
ou bleed to death.""
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy =
company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J=
ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=
ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=
lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=
ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=
on's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=
ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=
ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the tim=
e for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=
 ""It was the technology era.""
To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=
cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye=
ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=
ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=
e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=
ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =
$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=
f Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=
e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =
two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=
rate America.
But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=
a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=
ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=
ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=
hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=
er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals=
, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.
Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=
ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin=
g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=
tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=
g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=
 deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=
ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=
s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=
 visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=
ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=
k her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =
Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=
lity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri=
vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate=
st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=
er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20
But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =
business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=
ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=
 it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=
d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =
out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=
 diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start=
 afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=
 Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old =
culture than running a business.""=20
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=
 announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is wh=
en the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely=
 well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-=
power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=
le. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=
he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=
ay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=
e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=
od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =
anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=
 the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=
ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=
ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=
eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=
 was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=
aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=
 January.
Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =
India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =
constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa=
tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th=
at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =
and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a=
 very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=
rate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=
te House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big=
gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=
are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (Californi=
a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=
 be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al=
l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=
ke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down =
with its lights on."")
But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had =
been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=
 believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=
 it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=
 buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=
on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=
id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=
e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=
rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=
 Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t=
he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D=
uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=
lenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported =
hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=
s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=
ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr=
omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""Th=
ere wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=
ow. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.""
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=
d in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforw=
ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing =
in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=
ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=
ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=
nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=
in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl=
e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=
e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=
nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Stre=
et is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,=
"" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=
rry more weight.""
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=
xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =
the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=
retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=
eir ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says.=
 ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=
ere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'""=20
Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=
 now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=
p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as=
 one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=
h someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=
on that's better suited for good times than bad.""
As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=
ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=
 and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=
es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=
m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named =
a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=
, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =
everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovat=
e much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performanc=
e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=
gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=
rale problem.""
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=
 of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=
 their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi=

Barry,

I will have September actuals ready on Wednesday.  Let me know if you want to meet then to discuss.

Also, Louise has reviewed the headcount plan submitted for 2002 and asked that we reduce the West Origination count by one.  The attached file shows what was initially submitted.  If you will let me know what position to eliminate, I will make the necessary adjustments.

 

Thanks,
Laynie

Mark,

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

CALIFORNIA ENERGY MARKETS

[1] Power Authority Faces Legislative Backlash 
After a three-month honeymoon, the new California Power Authority 
is being shredded in the winds of politics this week with the Legislature 
looking into its deals, the California Energy Commission annoyed with its 
monopolizing ventures and the Department of Water Resources rebuffing 
its plan to sell its power through state contracts. Other than skepticism 
from legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan, the Power Authority 
escaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and 
fuel cells at [18]. 
[18] Assembly to Investigate Power Authority 
(from [1]) 
Is the California Power Authority a dangerously 
out-of-control state agency, or is it the best hope for get-ting 
back some state control over electricity supplies? 
The Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the 
Power Authority's role thus far in carrying out the letter 
and spirit of SBx2-6 in a hearing set for November 1. 
The move is spearheaded by the offices of Assem-blymember 
Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), the chair 
of the joint committee, and Assembly speaker Bob 
Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys). Both members were princi-pal 
authors of the Power Authority's enabling legisla-tion, 
SBx2-6. Legislative staff are questioning the 
Energy Foundation's unpaid role in devel-oping 
the Power Authority's requests for bids, particularly 
the RFB for microtur-bines. Only one com-pany, 
Capstone, can meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy 
Foundation, and staff are looking into potential overlaps 
between Capstone and the Energy Foundation. 
Political maneuvers are swirling around the Con-sumer 
Power and Conservation Financing Authority. 
Not only elected officials are concerned; the staff and 
heads of other agencies the Power Authority must 
work with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose 
Power Authority overtures. Tom Hannigan, di-rector 
of the Department of Water Resources rebuffed 
Power Authority board chair David Freeman's pro-posal 
to have it buy peaker output. California Energy 
Commission members said they are at policy odds 
with the Power Authority's siting plans. 
In an October 4 letter to Freeman, Hannigan said 
that the Power Authority's power-wind and fossil 
peakers-is likely too expensive, overblown and not 
able to respond quickly enough to balancing power 
needs. ""The letters of intent already approved by the 
Power Authority could far exceed [DWR's] ability to ab-sorb 
that power given the outlook for net-short need."" 
Freeman assumes that the market for Power Authority 
power will be via contract, not the spot market. ""Selling 
on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky,"" said 
Power Authority spokesperson Amber Pasricha. 
The Power Authority is the only agency cur-rently 
in the position of actually being able to acquire 
new energy as the state's $12.5 billion bond issue to 
underwrite continued DWR power purchases is in 
limbo and the California Independent System Operator 
is still not creditworthy. Still, the Power Authority 
cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic 
house in order, and an Assembly investigation might 
jeopardize that [J.A. Savage].

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com"

reservoir storage?

Will new technology improve storage economics?

What new storage projects are in the works?

Subject:	PGT Pipeline L/C Request

Bill, FYI, I have received a formal request from PGT asking Enron to provide security on their pipeline.  The request is for approx $ 11MM. They are referencing a provision in their tariff  that says that if a co. goes below BBB by S&P, then they have the right to ask for security.

I have discussed this request with them and they assure me we are not being singled out. I told them we will review the letter with credit and management and get back to them prior to the deadline imposed on their request( Nov. 20).

A copy of this request will be on your desk first thing this a.m.

regards, BT

Pursuant to the PGT tariff, if our credit rating falls below BBB, they can ask for a corporate affiliate's guaranty or other security acceptable to their lenders. They are not required to continue transportation service for a shipper who, after a request, fails to establish creditworthiness.  

Hope this is responsive to your question."

Are you sending out Xmas cards.  We usually do, and we usually send a small $25 gift to our best customers (ones we make money off) and those who do operational favors for us.

There is an Enron card but it does not say Enron or we can order some.  Probably $.75 plus postage and 150 cards.  Gifts probably go to 20 customers for a cost of $500 - $600.

What do you think?

Steffes and I were just chatting and an idea came up, that we try to offer our El Paso capacity to PG&E in their bankruptcy suit (in which a settlement is being negotiated) and perhaps we can, in turn, reduce our claim against PG&E in that case.  Maybe this is already being done, but if not, it is a thought.  Lisa Mellencamp and Michael Tribolet are doing the bankruptcy case. "

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under ""SEC Filings.""

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=

FYI

We are planning on joining Crestone for a combined Denver Christmas party.  The cost for our share will be approximately $1,000.  I know it is not cheap, but I think it is an important signal and morale booster which is critical at this time.  We have a long way to go in this deal."

Way too close to home!

Male Maturity

When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.

When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I
needed a
passionate girl with a zest for life.

In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything
was an emergency;
she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.

When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was
totally
predictable and
never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I
needed a girl with some
excitement.

When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her.
She
rushed from one
thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things
and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and
very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.

When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted
firmly on the
ground and married her.

She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

There are too many people going downstairs to get their lunch and your cost center is being charged daily whether people eat or not.  I have had a couple of you approach me that you still would like for your groups to be included in daily lunches.  Please email me by tommorrow and let me know if you would like to continue.

I received this email from Karen Taylor at Duke Field Services.  I have been working with her on gathering deals whereby ENA could purchase 3rd party gas on the Jonah Gas Gathering system.  As you can see, a numerber of our larger trading counterparties are not willing to trade with us, but are unwiling to tell us directly.  I hope this is a short term problem, as most of the larger counterparties account for the majority of our transactions.  I've included the second part of the email to show you both that I am willing to extend myself in whatever manner to bring value to the once mighty Enron.

PS  I haven't been able to close any deals with Karen, but I feel that I am very close!

04:33 20Nov2001 RSF-Platt's: Enron sees cash drain, warns on survival

New York (Platts)--20Nov2001/533 am EST/1033 GMT Enron filed Q3 financials late Monday, revealing a huge cash drain, despite last week's $1.5-bil asset-backed infusion from merger partner Dynegy. Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $1.2-bil, even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier, $550-mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $3-bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $1.9-bil of commercial paper. Enron blamed operating costs, trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners. Enron said it expects $800-mil soon from asset sales and got another $440-mil bank line Monday. But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment-grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due. That could have a ""material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern,"" it warned.

19:23 19Nov2001 RSF-Enron sounds debt alarm, reduces reported earnings

    By C. Bryson Hull
    HOUSTON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Humbled energy giant Enron Corp. <ENE.N> on Monday warned that it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt by next week and reduced its already-abysmal third-quarter earnings.
    The Houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on Monday with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
    Among the new information included is the disclosure that Enron is up against a short deadline to meet a $690 million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week.   That marked the start of a nine-day period that expires on Nov. 26, during which Enron must lay down collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships.
    If not, the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership, which includes a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash.
    The company is working to make alternative payment arrangements, since it can ill-afford to pay the debt now. Enron has already already maxed out its $3 billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat.
    Enron also reduced previously reported 2001 third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share. The move reflects adjustments made after the quarter's end, Enron said.
    On Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $638 million or 84 cents per share for the third quarter of 2001. On Nov 8, Enron said it had restated earnings for 1997-2000 and that net income for the four-year period was more than a half a billion lower than originally reported.
    It also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay $3.9 billion to other partnerships, the bulk of it to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust.
    Such an outcome would keep Enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and ""would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern,"" the company wrote.
    Enron had released those figures earlier, but had yet to state in such stark terms the dire risk the debts pose to its viability.
    CREDIT COULD BE A KILLER
    Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for Enron to ""Baa3"" and ""BBB-minus,"" just one notch above ""junk"" status. Each warned it may cut its respective ratings again. Moody's also cut Enron's short-term debt rating, which affects  commercial paper, to ""Not Prime,"" a junk rating.
    In nearly all of its partnership deals, Enron guaranteed the financing it received with a promise to issue Enron shares to its partners if its credit fell below investment grade and its stock price was under certain levels. At the close of trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were at $9.06 - well below the trigger prices.
    All of the partnerships, which Enron used to finance projects in a way that kept them off the balance sheet, have become the once-proud company's bane. The SEC is investigating potential conflict-of-interest issues involving two such partnerships on which ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow served as general partner.
    Enron had to extract itself from those partnerships, which led to a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity.
    The revelation of the equity reduction started one of the more stunning and rapid corporate collapses in recent memory, leaving Enron to be bought on Nov. 9 by smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. <DYN.N> for the fire-sale price of $9 billion in stock.
    In an unusual note, Enron said that its financial statements in the filing were not audited by an independent accountant, per SEC regulations, because of ""the need of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditors, to complete their review procedures.""
    Arthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit's completion.

Let's not forget the fact that Citizens has cut Enron more during the life of the deal.  The only company walking away from a deal will be Enron.  We will set up a meeting to discuss fixing the problem.

Thanks,

As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?

Thanks,

Kim

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.  "

Sean,

I will have a written response to you by tomarrow - the desk is ""assuring me"" that they have made some changes and we should expect better performance.  Let me know what else you need and I will get this response to you tomarrow.

Thanks for the note back.... yeah, I am still kicking.... and I am sure
you know this that it will take a little more than a bankruptcy to shake
this guy... when I grab on , I grab on tight.... 

Sorry for putting you through the inconvenience of having to read our
documents.. I think we have all had to dust off the paper... but I
sincerely hope most of it is behind us. 

I knew Karen was at Progas, glad to hear that she is enjoying work... 

I have not been to Calgary since May, and am not sure when I will be
back up... and if it will be on a permanent of temporary basis.... all
in all Houston is treating us pretty good.  Work really has been great
and I have such a good marketing region... california, arizona,
Denver.... vegas... are some of the highlights... so when I need to, I
go blow a few braincells out in one of these fine regions..

Kim is working a little ( 2 shifts in 1 year).... she may have to pick
up the pace on that effort... ( she is fighting me on that one)... House
is good, weather right now is great... 80 degrees ( all the time)...
there is something to be said about living in shorts and sandals... 

Better run, take care, talk soonest.

rumours of your demise are greatly exageerated !

I'm surviving - just finished an NEB Hearing yesterday on our bypass

had
this little meltdown of our strategic alliance partner which caused a
few
sleepless nights and much reading of the contracts...but we survived.

We will hold off transferring any physical positions desk to desk until the end of bidweek.  After NX1, we will transfer positions at a daily EOL Index mid price.  Please monitor my book and others to make certain DEC deals are not being transferred prior to NX1 at an IF monthly or GD daily mid price.

Thanks,

Mike"

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Since there will be no Mark Report today (due to the fact I need to catch a plane), The AGA number today was an injection of 15 BCF, with a revision from last week of +10 BCF to bring the total storage to 3.132 TCF or 484 BCF above last year and 313 BCF above the 5 yr average.

Have a great Thanksgiving! See ya Monday!

The existing position with these guys is that we have been buying gas month to month.  1,500/d from England Energy, and 15,000/d from Dominion E&P.  I'll keep you posted on additional conversations.

As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  

I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, ""it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new.""

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow."

As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  

I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, ""it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new."" 


Paul

PS  I have signed the document and have Fed Ex'ed it back to Houston."

Let's not forget the fact that Citizens has cut Enron more during the life of the deal.  The only company walking away from a deal will be Enron.  We will set up a meeting to discuss fixing the problem.

Thanks,
Mike

As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.  "

As a follow up to the written warning on August 14, 2001 to Heidi Dubose regarding her poor job performance I would like to submit the following commentary:

Heidi's phone coverage is still very inadequate.  I have had two discussions with her in the last 2 weeks regarding this.  She consistently does not take messages properly.  Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding.  When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time.  She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled.

The kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty.  She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them.  If she does it is after they have been in there for days.

We continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs.


In summary, Heidi's performance has improved some since August 14 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis.  She has not elevated her performance to the level which is required to manage the office.

We need to protect the flows to Citizens on TW.  I know you guys have been working on this, but Citizens continues to receive cuts.  Please secure the supply off of TW.  Let Sempra know that IB Link gas will not do.

Brian,

I have one fellow on my team that is scheduled to interview for the Origination Training Track on Wednesday.  His name is Harry Bucalo and he is an Associate.  He has worked for me for the last six months and helped me build the voice trading business.  

He has excellent customer skills and really puts his heart and soul into the job.  I'd like to see him accepted into the program.  He is an excellent candidate.  

Please let me know what further I can do to support his case.

Regards,

Mark  "

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.

Barry, the re-org announcement is being drafted to indicate that the West and Texas are not affected.  In that announcement is it you and Mike or you and Phillip or you, Mike and Phillip that are leading the West ?

Spoke to Ray Welch.
They were supposed to meet with their lawyer yesterday - the lawyer never showed up.
They'll try to get their comments together in the next few days.
He mentioned that they were meeting internally on your transport swap structure Barry."

Dear Friends,

After having had the chance to meet you all, I wanted to take an opportunity to collectively thank you and reiterate one last time how much a rotation into your esteemed group means to me. I assure you that, whatever shortcomings you may feel I have, can be overcome by my proven ability to work hard, dedication and dogged ambition.  

As I expressed to a number of you, I am certainly open to undertaking any assigned readings and/or classes you may like to recommend in anticipation of a December rotation.  I would like to do my utmost to hit the ground running and prove my worth.

Thanks so much again.  I look forward to staying in touch and hopefully having the chance to see you all again very soon.

Best Wishes,
Vikram"

We expect a ruling in the 336 docket to allocate receipt point capacity on =
El Paso, and that could be done before the end of the year.  BUT, we expect=
 that will be subject of rehearing applications and possibly even court app=
eal.  And that allocation is likely to be revised if and when the full requ=
irements/capacity problems get addressed in the other dockets in which they=
 are pending.  So, the possibility of revisions to receipt point allocation=
s exist even after an order is issued, and is final and non-appealable in 3=
36.  The language in the draft agreement states that Huber acknowledges tha=
t EP's capacity allocation procedures are under review by FERC and that the=
 capacity under contract will be bound by any modifications resulting from =
any FERC proceeding related to such capacity allocation procedures.  I thin=
k this is broad enough to cover all potential FERC actions, as it says ""any=
"" FERC proceeding.  Since we want to keep it open for future revisions, I w=
ould not advise inserting the usual  ""final, non-appealable order"" since yo=
u want to be able to track any changes that come along, however they may be=
 themselves changed by a later order. =20

I was going to add a footnote to this note but thought I didn't need to as I know for a fact ( by individual ) that we do not have any issues in West Gas Orig.  This note was for your information only to reflect the increased level of expectations that Mike holds his trading organization to and I support this completely.

Your work hours are not in question... nor are those of Denver, and Houston based origination. However I will reiterate that we need to get back to basics and stay focused and I will promote that message given every opportunity.

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

We are still interested, just reviewing our plans. We do have some studies
to finish before we could make an offer.  When we first talked, you did
mention that you are willing to make a payment of the difference between the
tariff and what we agree would be the market for the transportation. I am
assuming that this is still the case.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John"

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work."

A heads up for you gas folks that Enron will be on ComEd's side against Dynegy on this power issue at 
FERC, since EES designates Firm LD contracts as sources on ComEd's network transmission system (Dynegy wants ComEd to only allow ""capacity"" contracts to be used).  We plan to file the Enron response on Friday.

Subject:	Dynegy v. ComEd update

Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later today.  ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources and that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement.

Enron will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually trying to create an ""icap/capacity"" requirement where there is none (Dynegy's pleading states ""ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled.)  We will also include statements that the continuation of the network v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems.

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows ""marketer firm"" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation ""owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load,"" and 2) a Network Customer ""must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract"" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on ""over-the-counter"" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

Interesting reading, boys, following up on our conversations last night.

Dynegy vs. Enron:
A ""Tale of Two Companies"" =20
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20


Facts: Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) beat expectations in the third quarter, repo=
rting that its earnings rose to $286 million, or 85 cents per diluted share=
, from $177 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, for the same period in =
2000. This represented a 22-percent increase from 3Q 2000 and boosted the c=
ompany's 2001 earnings estimate. Dynegy has a market capitalization of $14.=
5 billion. Its stock is currently trading at about $43 down from a 52-week =
high of $59, although it is important to note that for year-end 2000 the co=
mpany's stock was one of the top performers among Standard & Poor's 500 com=
panies with a total shareholder return of 218 percent. Dynegy employs 5,778=
 people. =20
Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) reported $638 million in losses for the third quart=
er, after taking $1.01 billion in charges associated with several of its no=
n-core businesses. The company's 3Q recurring net income (before the write-=
offs) increased 35 percent to $393 million, or 43 cents a diluted share, an=
d revenue in the quarter rose to $47.6 billion from $30 billion in 3Q 2000.=
 Enron has a market capitalization of $14.8 billion. Its stock is currently=
 trading at about $16.0, which represents a six-year low for the company an=
d is considerably lower than the peak of $82 hit in August 2000. Enron empl=
oys 20,600 people. =20
Analysis: Dynegy closed out a banner year in 2000 and appears to still be o=
n a roll in terms of its financial performance. In contrast, Enron faced an=
 unprecedented year of turmoil, and is presently languishing in a low ebb, =
characterized by a strategic crossroads and heightened scrutiny of the comp=
any's financial reporting. While the two companies operate in the same mark=
et space of power trading and are fierce competitors, Dynegy-ironically the=
 younger and smaller of the two companies-is an industry success story whil=
e Enron's status remains rather uncertain. The questions to be addressed in=
 this article are: What is Dynegy doing ""right""? What is Enron doing ""wrong=
""? What lessons can other power and natural-gas marketers learn from this ""=
tale of two companies""?=20
Although they are often referred to as ""cross-town rivals,"" Dynegy and Enro=
n are worlds apart in terms of their competitive positions. Their divergent=
 approaches to the global marketplace illustrate what could be the single-m=
ost important element related to their disparate positions at the end of 20=
01. Put more simply, the two companies have vastly different strategies, an=
d-hindsight being 20/20-a strong argument can be made that Dynegy's strateg=
y is the winner at this juncture. Throughout this article, I will focus on =
two key areas in which Dynegy and Enron differ dramatically. Those two key =
areas are the ownership of physical generation assets and the extent to whi=
ch the companies have expanded (and invested) into non-core sectors.=20
Both companies started out as natural-gas companies and converged into the =
power market in the 1990s. However, that is essentially where their similar=
ities end, and over the last few years Enron and Dynegy have followed decid=
edly different paths. In an attempt to make the complex rather rudimentary,=
 let me summarize the two paths this way: Enron does not believe it needs t=
o own physical assets to be a success in the power and natural-gas trading =
sector; Dynegy, on the other hand, not only believes in the ownership of ph=
ysical assets, but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the compa=
ny as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry. =20
Let's look at the companies separately. We'll discuss Enron first since it =
is the older of the two. Enron readily admits that its strategy is difficul=
t to define, but a close approximation is that Enron literally creates comm=
odity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers. The=
 participation and success in commodity markets, according to Enron, does n=
ot necessitate ownership of physical assets. In fact, the company has routi=
nely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wh=
olesale business. Rather, Enron has concentrated on developing a new philos=
ophy of risk management excellence, in which it will merely buy and sell th=
e commodities it needs to participate in trading venues. =20
As an example, Enron bought Portland General (which owns 2,000 MW of genera=
tion and 41,600 kilometers of electric T?lines) in 1996 as a way to launch =
its penetration of the West Coast power markets. When competition fizzled i=
n that region, Enron put Portland General back on the sales block (a sale o=
f Portland General to Northwest Natural is pending at this writing). Likewi=
se in Europe, where it is one of the most prominent trading companies, Enro=
n has disposed of generation assets such as Sutton Bridge in England and, u=
nlike other U.S. competitors, has refrained from buying additional generati=
ng units in opening countries such as Germany and Italy. According to its m=
ost recent 10K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, En=
ron owns or controls 2,015 MW of generating capacity (including joint owner=
ships), which is drastically lower than the average among other companies o=
perating in the power trading sector. =20
Dynegy's approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different fr=
om Enron's. In the words of CEO Chuck Watson, ""Dynegy's long-term strategy =
is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets, which supports=
 earnings sustainability."" Ever since going public in 1995, Dynegy has been=
 on an acquisition binge, with each purchase significantly increasing its g=
eneration capability. Dynegy presently owns or controls about 27,000 MW of =
generating capacity in the United States, 26 gas-processing plants and 14,0=
00 miles of pipelines, which are located in geographically competitive area=
s. The company's goal is to own or control 70,000 MW, or 10 percent of the =
U.S. market, within the next five years. Sometimes, Dynegy has acquired ass=
ets through partnerships with other companies such as NRG Energy, but just =
as often it has purchased assets independently. Most notably, when Dynegy a=
cquired Illinova in early 2000, the purchase doubled Dynegy's generating ca=
pacity. Dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in Europe, wher=
e it is presently planning to purchase natural-gas storage facilities in En=
gland. Dynegy executives have argued that natural-gas storage is the best w=
ay to back up a natural-gas trading operation. There's no question that the=
 approach is working. Out of the $286 million that Dynegy reported in the t=
hird quarter, $263 million of it came from the company's main wholesale bus=
iness. =20
The issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference be=
tween Enron and Dynegy, and its significance should not be overlooked. It i=
s not difficult to make a case that supports Dynegy's approach. Owning phys=
ical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the cour=
se of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and=
 anticipate small changes in price. In other words, by controlling the actu=
al output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells, a=
 trader such as Dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be=
 in a particular region, how much power can be produced to meet that load a=
nd when shortages might occur. In addition, in markets that are short on in=
frastructure, it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market=
 unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region. By t=
he same token, those companies that do control physical assets often have g=
reater communication with grid operators, and possible insight to spreads (=
the difference between various energy prices). In fact, Dynegy's CEO Watson=
 fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around t=
he volatility of price, and being capable of resolving balances when shorta=
ges exist. This may be more difficult for a company such as Enron to accomp=
lish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in=
 power bids. Dynegy's strategy of acquiring both natural-gas pipelines and =
power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities.=20
On the other side of this argument, a case could be made that Enron's appro=
ach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility. Certainly,=
 by investing less in power generation facilities, Enron has less capital o=
n the line when compared to a company like Dynegy. Under a scenario when ma=
rket prices suddenly drop, a company such as Enron that does not have heavy=
 capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an as=
set-laden company because Enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixe=
d payments of a generation facility. Asset-heavy companies also may find th=
at their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilit=
ies in times of extreme price volatility. As the industry becomes increasin=
gly focused on bottom-line results, this could be seen as a potential conce=
rn for investors. Further, some would argue that Enron's approach of establ=
ishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell r=
equirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility. What E=
nron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being=
 tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own po=
rtfolio.=20
Consequently, the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the ""g=
reat debate"" among power traders. However, although Dynegy's overall perfor=
mance in the third quarter was better than Enron's, that does not necessari=
ly provide a clear endorsement of Dynegy's strategy toward acquiring new ge=
neration facilities. Keep in mind that Enron's 3Q losses resulted primarily=
 from non-recurring charges related to its non-core businesses (broadband a=
nd water in particular). Without these charges, Enron's core wholesale trad=
ing business continues to perform well. This is a point that CEO Ken Lay ha=
s been quick to reiterate to investors. ""Our 26-percent increase in recurri=
ng earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core who=
lesale and retail energy businesses and our natural-gas pipelines,"" Lay sai=
d. ""The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enron's leadi=
ng market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook.""=
=20
Moreover, perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets, the key issu=
e that played a role in the current disparity between Dynegy and Enron earn=
ings in the third quarter is the companies' approach to developing new line=
s of business.  Telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point. Enron=
, which prides itself as usually gaining a first-strike advantage, plunged =
into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies. Under the lea=
dership of then-CEO Jeffrey Skilling, Enron sunk large sums of capital into=
 purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would qui=
ckly become lucrative. Now Lay admits that the company ""could have gotten i=
nto the broadband business with less capital"" and that Enron ""spent too muc=
h too soon"" in this sector. Nevertheless, Enron recorded an $80-million non=
-recurring write-down for restructuring its broadband unit in the third qua=
rter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by red=
ucing future costs in this sector to $40 million a quarter. =20
Dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom=
 sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared t=
o Enron. Dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom s=
ector, but in the third quarter took a $15-million loss in its broadband bu=
siness compared to the $80-million loss that Enron reported. However, Dyneg=
y clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities (electricity=
 and natural gas) and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical wa=
y that merely supplements its core business.=20
It is also important to note that Enron gained the first-strike advantage w=
hen it developed EnronOnline, an electronic trading exchange. In fact, Enro=
n was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space, well ahead =
of its competitors. Dynegy later followed this trend with creating Dynegydi=
rect. The two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards, =
but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case Enron was s=
uccessful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its =
competitors. The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline ha=
s recorded transactions that exceed $590 in notional value. Since its incep=
tion in November 2000, Dynegydirect has recorded $33 billion in notional tr=
ansactions. =20
At this juncture, Dynegy and Enron are very different with regard to their =
approaches toward financial reporting. Enron, which has often been accused =
of not providing a balance sheet to investors, is currently struggling from=
 a serious image problem as the Securities and Exchange Commission pursues =
an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by Enron's CFO. To my rec=
ollection, no one has ever accused Dynegy of not providing a balance sheet,=
 and thus the company's status with investors is arguably more solid. As I =
don't expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any=
 time soon, my projection is that (at least in the near term), we will cont=
inue to see a wide disparity in Wall Street performance between Dynegy and =
Enron. That is not to say that anyone should count Enron out of the game. A=
s noted, the company's core business of wholesale business remains strong, =
but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other non-core businesses. Th=
at doesn't mean Enron is down permanently, but it will have to find a way t=
o strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and thos=
e businesses that former CEO Jeffrey Skilling believed were advantageous.=
=20
In many ways, the comparison between Dynegy and Enron is rather like the to=
rtoise and the hare parable. I am sure you can guess which company is the t=
ortoise and which is the hare in this analogy. The race between the two is =
far from over, although Dynegy is taking the lead at this point, based on i=
ts more methodical approach. What will be fascinating to observe is how bot=
h companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly mo=
dify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies. =20

Subject: Natural Gas Origination


Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John"

Chris,

My email probably was a bit out of line, sent out of frustration - my apologies.  It was not wise of me to give a trader a heads up on my intent to buy in the first place, going forward I will not do that.  I have no expectation of having Stephan manage anyone's price risk.  I am hoping to develop Cascade into a long-term Enron customer, I make no origination on the deals I have done with them, I have encouraged them to enter into longer term DI deals and I have hooked them up with EOL - all intended to benefit of the cash desk in Calgary.  Next time the market falls $0.12 immediately following a trade I make on behalf of a customer I'll keep my mouth (email) shut.

There is no offence intended by either of these emails and I intend to continue to try and develop more spot and term business for your desk.

Dave

Dave,

I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning. I don't really feel that it is Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer. If you would like we could look at doing an  MSA with Cascade where by we could sell them gas at Sumas DI.

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Concerned Energy Cos Make Few Changes In Enron Dealings
By MARK GOLDEN, KRISTEN MCNAMARA, JON KAMP and JOHN EDMISTON
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
NEW YORK -- Energy trading companies have concerns about the credit quality of troubled Enron Corp. (ENE), but they have made almost no changes in policies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas, the companies said Thursday.
The concerns have arisen because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country's power and gas markets, has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure.
Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this week.
""We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron,"" said John Sousa, chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc. (DYN). ""It's business as usual.""
Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company, too, has made no changes and has no concerns about Enron's credit. Another Top 10 power and gas trading company, Aquila (ILA), has also left Enron credit unchanged.
Other companies expressed concern, though they've taken little if any action.
""Like everyone else in the marketplace, we're proceeding with caution,"" said Lora Kinner, director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing, the North American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A.
Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn't expect to make any drastic changes.
Like many utilities, the Public Service Co. of New Mexico (PNM) is ""monitoring the situation."" So is Aquila, said Mark Gurley, general manager of trading at the company.
""We haven't altered our credit policy at all,"" Gurley said. But if Enron's credit rating slips, ""our tolerances for risk with them would go down,"" he said.
A trading manager for another energy company said that all energy and financial companies that have dealings with Enron are assessing their exposure. But that manager's company has made no changes and doesn't expect Enron to have cash liquidity problems.
One large firm has been limiting the credit it extends to Enron for the past month. A gas trader with another firm has been encouraged to do more business on other energy trading platforms like the InterContinental Exchange. Enron, however, is far too big to cut off entirely, traders said.
Energy trading companies depend on Enron as the major market maker for their commodities. Enron built the over-the-counter wholesale gas marketplace, and more recently its two-year-old electronic trading platform, EnronOnline, has become a major marketplace for gas and power, accounting for 25% of those markets, according to one recent estimate.
   Enron is the counterparty to every trade on the system.  
EnronOnline grew so quickly because of the company's policy
that traders must offer aggressive two-way spreads - both
bids and offers - on the commodities they trade. Any
reduction in EnronOnline volumes could translate to an
immediate liquidity problem for North American power
markets.
""If there is a problem with Enron, there's going to be domino effect through the industry,"" Tractebel's Kinner said.
Uncertainties about Enron's financial situation have aggravated the volatility of gas futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a trader said.
Gas and power traders said that Enron traders are moving to liquidate some positions and, because the company's problems are well known, it is getting squeezed in the market, which would discount the return on positive positions.
Enron traders have few outstanding favors to call on with counterparties, because Enron traders have been so aggressive over the years, the trading manager said.
Analysts have raised questions about Enron's difficulties on a number of conference calls held by other energy companies to discuss their quarterly earnings reports. One of those companies, Sempra Energy (SRE), said it was monitoring the situation but saw little risk so far.
""At this point, there's no reason for concern,"" Sempra spokesman Doug Kline said. ""We continue to trade with them, and they're covering their margins.""

Chris,

My email probably was a bit out of line, sent out of frustration - my apologies.  It was not wise of me to give a trader a heads up on my intent to buy in the first place, going forward I will not do that.  I have no expectation of having Stephan manage anyone's price risk.  I am hoping to develop Cascade into a long-term Enron customer, I make no origination on the deals I have done with them, I have encouraged them to enter into longer term DI deals and I have hooked them up with EOL - all intended to benefit of the cash desk in Calgary.  Next time the market falls $0.12 immediately following a trade I make on behalf of a customer I'll keep my mouth (email) shut.

There is no offence intended by either of these emails and I intend to continue to try and develop more spot and term business for your desk.

Dave

Dave,

I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning. I don't really feel that it is Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer. If you would like we could look at doing an  MSA with Cascade where by we could sell them gas at Sumas DI.

I made a few changes.  Please use this version.  Janie, if you are satisfied as it is, please run it by Mike, Barry and Stephanie.  I didn't realize it was due tomorrow until this afternoon (I was operating under the assumption that it was due 10/25 - don't know why!).  I'm not sure we can file it electronically, so it may have to be e-mailed to the D.C. office.  If so, we would need the final copy by 2:00.

Thanks.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

NOAA ANNOUNCES NEW ""ENVIRONOMICS"" PROGRAM THAT 
LINKS WEATHER, CLIMATE TO ECONOMY
Data Show Effect of Climate Conditions on Corn and Soybean Yield
and Residential Energy Needs
October 24, 2001 - NOAA <http://www.noaa.gov/> today unveiled two new indices that evaluate the effect of climate conditions on corn and soybean yield and on residential energy needs. The development of the indices is part of NOAA's ""Environomics"" program <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/environomics/environomics.html>, an effort to better understand the impact of weather and climate on socioeconomic sectors of the nation. The indices were developed by NOAA's National Climatic Data Center <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ncdc.html> in Asheville, N.C., which maintains the world's largest weather database. (Click NOAA image for larger view of standardized temperature index for Sept. 2001.)
Anecdotal statements about the weather are often used to explain variations in economic activity, and these statements are often based on perceptions about the weather that may or may not be valid. Through NOAA's Environomics program, relationships between the nation's climate and vital economic sectors of the nation are clearly defined using climate indices, which enhance the understanding of how year-to-year variations and trends in weather and climate affect associated sectors.
Thomas Karl <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/about/welcomefromdirector.html>, director of NOAA's National Climatic Data Center, said, ""Climate indices developed through the Environomics program provide quantitative information regarding climate's influence while providing historical perspective on how weather and climate conditions affecting our economy and society today compare with conditions of the past.""
The period of high energy demand and prices of the late 1970s coincided with extremely cold winters that contributed to higher residential energy usage. The Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index (REDTI), which provides information related to climate sensitive residential energy demand, reflects this increased demand through historically high index values and can be used in part to explain the cause of the historically high energy demand of that time. By providing continuing updates to the index, a clearer understanding of future fluctuations in energy demand will be possible.
The REDTI tracks both unusually hot and unusually cold conditions. It varies from year to year due to variability and trends in temperature, and it responds most strongly to temperature conditions in heavily populated regions. REDTI values range from 0 to 100. Values greater than 90 indicate a much above average temperature-related energy demand and values less than 10 reflect much below average conditions.
The REDTI for the 2001 April-September season was 34, indicative of slightly below average residential energy demand for cooling and heating. Based on the 107 year record, the population-weighted REDTI value of 34 ranks as the 19th lowest value.
The nation's warm season (April-September) 2001 ranked as the fourth warmest such period since 1895, the first year of complete climate records. The preliminary national average temperature was 67.4 F (19.7 C), which was 1.6 F (0.9 C) above the long-term mean. Although the area-weighted national temperature gave the season a rank of fourth warmest on record, the persistence of average to cooler than average temperatures in some of the most heavily populated regions of the U.S. contributed to a REDTI that was below average. Energy usage statistics for 2001 will be available from the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration in 2002.
While the REDTI provides information on the impacts of temperature on energy demand, the Moisture Stress Index (MSI), was developed to quantify the effect of soil moisture conditions on crop yield. It provides historical perspective on conditions such as moisture stress, that are closely associated with corn and soybean yields and is a source of information for explaining the cause of lower national yields.
The MSI ranges from zero to 100 and specifically measures the proportion of the nation's corn or soybeans affected by severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness. Values near zero indicate that few productive corn or soybean growing areas were affected by severe drought or catastrophic wetness. This index reflects conditions during July and August and is weighted by the mean (1991-2000) annual crop productivity within 344 climate divisions in the contiguous U.S. Although a number of factors affect the success of a single crop growing season, drought or excessive wetness during critical phases of crop growth have a significant impact on the nation's corn and soybean yield.
Although warmer than average temperatures coincided with drought in some parts of the country during the warm season months of 2001, conditions in the heart of the major corn and soybean crop growing regions were generally normal to wetter than normal. The corn MSI for the 2001 crop growing season was eight, and the soybeans MSI was seven. This means that severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness affected only 8 percent and 7 percent of the nation's corn and soybeans, respectively. Both index values were below average and reflect favorable soil moisture throughout a large part of the crop growing regions during July and August (the reproductive season).
The MSI for corn exceeded 40 during the drought-plagued growing seasons of 1983 and 1988 and 30 during the catastrophically wet summer of 1993, years in which corn yields were less than 75 percent of the 2000 yield. The 2001 growing season (May-September) followed several years in which national corn and soybean yields were generally high, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The low values of this year's corn and soybean MSI indicate that conditions associated with this index were again favorable for good corn and soybean yields. National crop yields for 2001 will be available from the United States Department of Agriculture following the harvest season.
NOAA is dedicated to enhancing economic security and national safety through the prediction and research of weather and climate-related events and providing environmental stewardship of our nation's coastal and marine resources."

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PAs have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

Breaking News : posted Oct 25, 11:12 AM
Breathitt 'Uneasy' About Approach to Pipe Certification 
Although FERC and California regulators have made a lot of headway in past months in their effort to relieve the imbalance between in-state and interstate pipeline capacity, Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Wednesday that she still is somewhat unsettled by FERC's tendency to routinely approve interstate pipe projects without giving full weight to the impact on existing shippers. 
""I remain uneasy about the...policies the Commission has advanced in favor of certification of interstate capacity despite the [inadequacy] of takeaway capacity and particularly the confidence with which the Commission has rejected the legitimate concerns of shippers on [Kern River's] system,"" she said during the regular FERC meeting. 
Breathitt's remarks were part of a concurring opinion on two orders in which FERC denied rehearing of its certificate approval for Kern River Gas Transmission's 2002 Expansion Project and California Action Project [CP01-31, CP01-106-001]. Firm customers of Kern River sought reconsideration of the certificate orders on the grounds that the expansions would result in pro-rata capacity reductions for existing shippers at Wheeler Ridge and would diminish their firm delivery rights. 
Despite her concerns, Breathitt noted that she was ""pleased that over the past six months the Commission has come to acknowledge that our actions in certificating the Kern River expansions could exacerbate the problems of delivering natural gas to end-users in Southern California."" 
Even more importantly, ""the Commission has recognized the potential degradation of shippers' firm rights resulting from the certification of additional interstate capacity is an appropriate factor in the public benefits analysis that we use to determine whether a project is in the public convenience and necessity,"" she said. 
Moreover, ""I am relieved that certain events are occurring in California that will mitigate congestion at Wheeler Ridge. More takeaway capacity is on the horizon, and the California PUC is considering certain regulatory relief that will facilitate the transportation of natural gas from Wheeler Ridge to Southern California markets."" 
Nevertheless, Breathitt urged her FERC colleagues ""not [to] lose sight of the panoply of issues we must consider in issuing natural gas pipeline certificates."" 
This doesn't mean, however, that she is against all new pipelines and expansion projects, Breathitt said. ""I most certainly share the sense of urgency to ensure adequate and reliable energy supplies. However, there is more to the Commission's mandate under the Natural Gas Act than simply getting more pipe in the ground."" 
Breathitt noted that the Commission plans to revisit the issue of the adequacy of California takeaway capacity when it takes up Kern River's pending application for its proposed 2003 Expansion Project [CP01-422]. Firm customers on the pipeline have already protested the application. They claim that Kern River has sold nearly 500,000 Dth/d of additional primary firm delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge in the three expansion projects, and that they are experiencing scheduling cuts as a result. 
When the Kern River 2003 expansion comes before the Commission, ""I will continue to advocate a thoughtful and coordinated approach to fostering badly needed interstate and intrastate expansion in California.""

Subject:	FERC Draft Orders on Kern River and PG&E Projects

FERC today issued Draft Orders denying rehearing in the following:

Kern River, CP01-31 (2002 Expansion Project)
Rejected arguments of the Firm Customers that the project should not have been approved or, alternatively, the rights of the expansion shippers at Wheeler Ridge should be subordinate to those of the existing shippers.

PG&E Gas Transmission, NW, CP01-141 (2001 Expansion)
Rejected Newport Northwest LLC's assertion that requiring the expansion shippers to pay a fuel cost surcharge to recover any incremental fuel costs due to the additional compression approved for this project is contrary to FERC precedent and the policy statement on expansion facilities.

These orders should be issued within the next few days, and we will circulate copies.  Let Melinda know if you want to see the draft copies before then (they are not available electronically)."

Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us.  Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:

	ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).
	Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time).
	Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining).

All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes.  Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future.  This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us.  Ray

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200."

Alan,

My sincerest apologies, please keep me posted on what happens.  I'd like to buy you lunch sometime soon and talk about how we can avoid these situations in the future.  I think if we get master documents in place and convey to you a better understanding of our corporate structure, you'll find Enron easy to deal with, flexible, responsive, and competitive.  I'll call you soon in hopes we can get together.

She mentioned to me that she is working on the Transpecos Project, with the people in Transwestern, and in Northern since the Transpecos project ties both pipelines together.  Names: Jeffrey Fawcet, and Randy Rice.  
Best regards.

Greetings Jaime:

Wanted to follow up on our meeting. We are still planning to get together as discussed and are working on our packet of information. This will  include a general overview of supply demand fundamentals and pipeline expansions.

Could you please provide information on the following:

1) CFE - what is their charter and how do they relate to PEMEX
2) RFP process for CFE projects - how does it work, who are the usual participants
3) PEMEX - how are their transportation and sales tariffs structured
                  how is it changing (undbundling?)
4) Regulatory intiatives of the CRE

Is there anything else you would like to know? We look forward to our meeting ...

Regards,

Stephanie"

Roger,

I hope you're reading your E-mail, because I can't get to you by phone.

Our attorney is checking the contract T&Cs, but I noticed that none of the
corrected company information I provided the last time around is included.
The name of our company is incorrect.  You have Ralph Mill's name with my
address, phone number, and my (incorrect) fax number. The facility name is
incorrect and the street name is misspelled.  All of this was correct on the
last copy I sent you.  Plus, there is no customer contact information on the
second page.

Since the file is protected, I can't even correct this.

How are we going to get this fixed in the next 2 hours?

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, ""I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?""

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

MIke,

Attached is the updated summary regarding expansions in the west.  There is only one change - PGT 2003 expansion.  The expansion has now dropped from 230,000 MM/d to 160,000 MM/d due to PPL dropping out.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Brad, further to our conversation of yesterday morning, please find attached 
Enron's payout table and alternative payout table regarding the permanent 
assignment of PGT capacity. 

The onus will be on Enron to deliver long dated capacity to Calpine and we 
will begin working on this immediately.

Below is a summary of some of the key next steps. Please review and we can 
discuss on Monday the numbers and final steps as required. 

ENA and Calpine will formalise  % discount, volume grid, lump sum $ amount or 
annuity amount. 
As discussed our cost of funds implied will be LIBOR + 200 basis points. ( to 
be confirmed ).
ENA will raise a precedent agreement with option language in favor of Calpine 
which allows you to request that the period 2 volume  be no less than the 
period 1 volume and up to the total delivered volume of 67,500 based on the 
agreed to % discount as referenced in point #1. 
ENA will forward the draft precedent agreement which will include the 
necessary conditions precedent required and with the general commercial terms 
as agreed per items above (ETA - Tues/Wed). 
ENA will provide a bid to Calpine on Monday afternoon with a number on the 
Spark Spread proposal.
Contact name @ Trans Canada and ANG is Kay Coad Ph: 403-267-2480.  
  
I trust the information as provided above is consistent with our previous 
discussions.  Please contact me once you have had a chance to review. 

Regards,

BT

I have also received the bridge loan documents and have signed these forms

Chris, further to our conversation of yesterday I believe that we should 
impliment the plan that we had discussed.  Effective immediatly, we should 
instruct all parties involved that West Gas marketing issues will be handled 
by the Houston based team.  Coverage, Accountability, origination, 
structuring will now become the sold responsibility of Kim and myself. The 
only thing that we ask of your people is an expeditious transition with the

For your information. please find attached the spreadsheet that I sent to 
Calpine for their consideration. 

Action: 

Peter is going to review the assignment doc's and with Steve raise the proper 
legal document that protects ECC/ENA's interests.  At this time, Peter and I 
are of the opinion that a new agreement may be all we need but we will 
discuss on Monday.

Julie/ Stephanie/Eric....we need to discuss the numbers again. The real 
producer unwind costs may be really ugly, which basically means that our 
numbers may be too low to Calpine.. even with the counter offer, the front 
end economics are pulling a lot of value out of the deal. 


Assuming numbers can be agreed too by everyone, we are positioning ourselves 
for a package out to the producers for early next week. 

Stephanie.. one of our customers has asked for California fundamentals... 
overview... do we have anything available.  

Talk to everyone on Monday.

We still need to decide where we are going to put this money. For right now, 
we should plan on me signing the promisary note by fax, and then have a

Subject: Enron - PGT Payout Table

Brad, further to our conversation of yesterday morning, please find attached 
Enron's payout table and alternative payout table regarding the permanent 
assignment of PGT capacity. 

The onus will be on Enron to deliver long dated capacity to Calpine and we 
will begin working on this immediately.

Below is a summary of some of the key next steps. Please review and we can 
discuss on Monday the numbers and final steps as required. 

ENA and Calpine will formalise  % discount, volume grid, lump sum $ amount or 
annuity amount. 
As discussed our cost of funds implied will be LIBOR + 200 basis points. ( to 
be confirmed ).
ENA will raise a precedent agreement with option language in favor of Calpine 
which allows you to request that the period 2 volume  be no less than the 
period 1 volume and up to the total delivered volume of 67,500 based on the 
agreed to % discount as referenced in point #1. 
ENA will forward the draft precedent agreement which will include the 
necessary conditions precedent required and with the general commercial terms 
as agreed per items above (ETA - Tues/Wed). 
ENA will provide a bid to Calpine on Monday afternoon with a number on the 
Spark Spread proposal.
Contact name @ Trans Canada and ANG is Kay Coad Ph: 403-267-2480.  
  
I trust the information as provided above is consistent with our previous 
discussions.  Please contact me once you have had a chance to review.

Mark, Stephanie further to our conversations please find a summary list which 
I will need some help on.  As part of our business plan for 2001 Phillip and 
myself will make a presentation to Delainey et al regarding the West 
Initiatives.  This is going to happen by Dec. 8.  

As you guys know our group in total is going to be made up of a few key areas.

Producer Services 
Transportation
Origination/ Middle Marketing
Trading


Can you put together in draft form a business plan for next year that 
outlines some key items. Once we have a first pass at this, we can 
incorporate into the overall package and decide how this fits in with our new 
group. 
 
The key subject items should include:  

SM/MW/BT 1> Market Overview - supply demand fundamentals in your area. 
SM/MW/BT 2> Strategies and opportunities for 2001 ( What new initiatives will 
we implement ?)
SM/MW/BT 3> New products and structures for your area
SM/MW/BT 4> Issues in 2000 ( what didn't work ?)
BT  5> Organization Issues / people /transition etc. 


If you could start thinking about these in greater detail, we can then go 
through and incorporate into the west orig. objectives. 

Call me to discuss, but we should start to discuss detail early next week.  

BT

(there may have been a third).  The PD by ALJ Brown denied the application.
The PD by Cmmr. Bilas allowed it to go forward, subject to conditions.  The

Judy, you were?assigned to my U.S and Canadian  tax returns. I am a
employee of Enron North America and previously was an  employee of Enron
Canada in Calgary.

As we had discussed at the time of my filing, I was  never given any
advise
on my relocation to the U.S. regarding tax issues, As  such I am not
sure
what some of my next moves should be.?I very much  require some
assistance?regarding spousal employment. My wife is a  registered nurse
and
would like to work in the U.S., but I have been advised  that this may
affect my filing in the U.S. and perhaps could cost me more in  U.S.
Taxes.

Can we set up a meeting to discuss strategies on  making sure I am going
about this properly.

This is my home e-mail address, you can contact me  here or at my work
address, Barry.Tycholiz@enron.com.

Thanks in advance.

BT

I can make time.  Let's try to let Leslie vacation.  Also, I'm having a memo prepared that should be ready first thing Monday AM on the CA Commission's policies regarding utility use of hedging instruments.  Just let me know when you'd like to talk.

Dear Western Region:

	I would like to thank Phillip Allen for his leadership of the west desk for 2000 and 2001.  He will continue as Managing Director at Enron North America and trade a financial book for the natural gas trading group.  Phillip will be sitting near the western region and will continue to participate in our goal to analyze the western market fundamentals to maximize wholesale trading efforts.  I will be assuming all management responsibilities of the west trading group effective immediately.

	I would like to take the opportunity to discuss our new organization for the Western Region trading group.  I have organized a vertical based trading structure that clearly defines each employee's responsibilities going forward.   Our goal is to organize all of our efforts in the west such that we will offer Enron North America the most profitable wholesale trading model.

The most significant change to the western region organization will be Keith Holst's role as Director of West Fundamentals.  Keith will manage this unit from the west desk, while using the services of Enron's centralized fundamentals group, headed by Chris Gaskill.  Our western region Fundamentals group will be responsible for delivering the most complete and market sensitive data to the trading desk.  We will all share in Keith's efforts to make our fundamental analysis the standard for all trading units within the company.

West Origination, led by Barry Tycholiz, will play a larger role in our term trading efforts going forward.  They will be joining our desk for fundamental forecasting meetings and discussions.  Our goal is to capture a majority of the term risk management efforts of our customer base.  We must succeed in capturing a majority of our customers' business to increase our share of lower risk earnings.  This contribution, along with our wholesale trading, will help our desk beat earnings expectations consistently.     

The West trading organization is structured to maximize profitability by sub-region.  The emphasis for the trading group will be to increase profitability and market information from each trader's sub-region.   We will be evaluated on how we organize and build the business and profitability in our respective trading areas.  This structure, however, does not preclude west traders from trading positions throughout the Western region and the North American gas market.  The West trading organization will be successful by creating accountability for trading responsibilities.
  
Please review the attached outline for the new trading structure.  We will be meeting as a group to discuss the changes soon.  The implementation of this structure will rely on our back office to set up the new books for each trader.  

Sincerely,

Michael D. Grigsby
West Gas Trading

Judy, you were assigned to my U.S and Canadian  tax returns. I am a
employee of Enron North America and previously was an  employee of Enron
Canada in Calgary.

As we had discussed at the time of my filing, I was  never given any
advise
on my relocation to the U.S. regarding tax issues, As  such I am not
sure
what some of my next moves should be. I very much  require some
assistance regarding spousal employment. My wife is a  registered nurse
and
would like to work in the U.S., but I have been advised  that this may
affect my filing in the U.S. and perhaps could cost me more in  U.S.
Taxes.

Can we set up a meeting to discuss strategies on  making sure I am going
about this properly.

This is my home e-mail address, you can contact me  here or at my work
address, Barry.Tycholiz@enron.com.

Thanks in advance.

Electric:  SCE, PG&E and SDG&E are all authorized to enter into bilateral

Barry

Thanks for taking time Friday to meet with us......Sorry I missed you but I agree the meeting did go well.....I think you were successful in helping Michael Lynch over his hurdle concerning transport and gas supply which you rightfully point out are two distinct and separate issues.

I appreciate Stephanie Millers role in assisting our group in identifying obstacles and solutions in our development effort.  I hope you are not thinking of redirecting her.  She works well with our group.

With regard to Longview, lets coordinate the Gas Services Agreements through our development group.  I would prefer not to send McCook any further documentation until they have responded to our PSA and Management Agreements.  McCook is good at making us work and never responding. They owe us some Good Faith if you know what I mean.

I would appreciate it if you would continue to respond to McCooks questions about transport and supply...It sould like they need to get into an open season at the right time and you have a much better feel for that timing that I do.

Regards,
Jake

Jake, sorry I missed you on Friday. I took off around 4:00 and assumed you were tied up with MCCook.  If you have time today, give me a call.

If there is any chance that these guys are going to buy the plant, then they really need to get into the open seasons with Williams and PGT.... timing is everything. 

I also would like to discuss Stephanie Millers future role in the development game and would like your direct feedback. 

Thanks for having us at the meeting, I thought it went OK, but there really were two seperate agenda's and they were as much concerned about the price of their gas as they were interested in how it is going to get to the plant... and as you know, one doesn't really have to do with the other.

Paul,

Welcome back.  The Wyoming Governor's office wants to meet in August re energy issues.  I have identified the appropriate Enron nat gas people.  I would recommend a conference call with your Wyoming contact in advance of that meeting to determine if it makes sense to fly a lot of people to Wyoming.  Mark Whitt is based in Denver and focuses on nat gas marketing.  I believe he has had some discusions in the past with Wyoming re their royalty positions and will likely call to discuss. 

Scott Josey runs our producer finance business which finances/invests in upstream producers and projects.  He has some clients that may be interested in expanding a Wyoming position.

Let me know how you would like to proceed.

Please let me know how we can help.  We have alot of experience in Wyoming and have invested in excess of $150 Million in pipeline assets in the state over the last 2 years.  ENA has since divested them to Northern Border but we remain very involved in the day to day operations and manage all of the commodity services associated with those assets.

For clarification, we have had numerous discussions with the Feds (BLM) regarding the federal royalties take in kind program and see applications for similiar structures with the State royalties.  In addition we have several ideas regarding potential projects that would/could benefit the state.

You can reach me at 303-575-6473.

Thanks for the reply. It would be my expectation that Enron will pay but

will be.

Judy, you were?assigned to my U.S and Canadian  tax returns. I am a
employee of Enron North America and previously was an  employee of Enron
Canada in Calgary.

As we had discussed at the time of my filing, I was  never given any
advise
on my relocation to the U.S. regarding tax issues, As  such I am not
sure
what some of my next moves should be.?I very much  require some
assistance?regarding spousal employment. My wife is a  registered nurse
and
would like to work in the U.S., but I have been advised  that this may
affect my filing in the U.S. and perhaps could cost me more in  U.S.
Taxes.

Can we set up a meeting to discuss strategies on  making sure I am going
about this properly.

This is my home e-mail address, you can contact me  here or at my work
address, Barry.Tycholiz@enron.com.

Thanks in advance.

BT

Barry and Stephanie, I'll check on this when I get in in the morning.  I ha=
ve a faint recollection that copies of the agreement were included in PGT's=
 filing, but I may have it confused with another proceeding.  I was going t=
o check it out from home but changed my mind when I discovered that the RIM=
S copy of the filing is over 900 pages!

Yep - in fact, they did.  I just haven't got around to summarizing the orde=
r yet.  Here's some excerpts:=20

""We reach no determination regarding whether PG&E Transmission's system-wid=
e cost of fuel will increase above the current cost, since the outcome depe=
nds on numerous factors, such as the total pipeline volumes transported and=
 the price of fuel.  Instead, as discussed below, and in accordance with En=
ron's request [way to go, FERC!!], we will act to insulate existing shipper=
s from increased fuel costs attributable to the proposed expansion.""

After suggesting that it would have been more appropriate to calculate fuel=
 costs by using the average of the latest twelve months of actual data in p=
lace of the theoretical maximum rate, FERC directed ""PG&E Transmission to d=
esign a surcharge to ensure that expansion shippers are subject to an incre=
mental fuel charge for fuel costs above the costs attributable to fuel abse=
nt the proposed addition of 97,500 horsepower of compression.  In addition,=
 PG&E must indicate compliance with this condition whenever it files to adj=
ust its compressor fuel surcharge and whenever it files its annual gas fuel=
 reimbursement reports."" (emphasis added)

According to the Draft Order that was voted out at the Commission meeting t=
oday, the subject project, as amended to reflect the approval of the Califo=
rnia Action Project, is approved, subject to certain conditions including r=
estrictions on rolled-in rate treatment. =20

The Commission was concerned that the additional fuel costs could exceed th=
e rate reduction to existing shippers.  Kern River's projections were based=
 on a $3.00/dth cost of gas.  The Commission conditioned its approval of ro=
lled-in rate treatment by providing that, ""in its future compliance tariff =
filing to roll-in the costs and lower transmission rates, Kern River must s=
ubmit revised exhibits showing the excess revenues over the incremental cos=
t-of-service, and the net benefits after anticipated fuel costs are conside=
red"" (Kern River's settlement in RP99-274 requires it to reduce its rates f=
or existing customers coincident with the in-service date for newly certifi=
cated facilities if it receives approval for rolled-in rate treatment).  Ad=
ditionally, if during any year, the combined level of the electric and gas =
fuel expenses exceed the benchmark level(s) of excess revenues established =
in the tariff filing, then Kern River must allocate the excess portion of f=
uel costs to its expansion shippers.  Thus, Kern River must always assure t=
hat this expansion does not increase costs for existing shippers.

The Commission rejected concerns of the existing firm shippers as well as S=
oCal Gas about the potential for additional curtailment at Wheeler Ridge.  =
The Commission found that the potential for increased curtailment did not w=
arrant rejection or modification of Kern River's proposal, in part because =
SoCal Gas does not offer firm service on its system and therefore existing =
shippers have never had any assurance that Socal Gas would accept their gas=
. =20

The Draft Order is 49 pages long.  Please advise if you would like a hard c=
opy."

I filled in the utilities on our industrial customer list for WA & OR.  It looks like there are 17 major industrials behind Cascade (according to our list).  I would suggest we exclude these from the Agency agreement if we ever decide we want to go that direction.

Mark, I'll look at the protest that Burlington and Amoco/BP filed and see if they raised any of the same issues.  I do know Pete Cervin, and I also know the Amoco attorney as well as the outside counsel who will be representing them.  If the FERC data base is up to date (not always the case), there weren't that many other parties who protested.  I'll check their filings, too.

If we decide to join with Burlington and Amoco/BP, we would probably need to sign some sort of agreement on splitting expenses for outside counsel and any consultants.  This would make it more difficult to back out so we'd need to be sure before we committed.

I'll let you know what it looks like after I've had a chance to review all the filings.

I spoke with Lee Hanse at Burlington Resources about the CIG Rate Case.  He invited us to join BR and Amoco in sharing the cost of the intervention, assuming that we agree on the issues.  The contact person at BR is Pete Cervin, I believe Stephanie and Rebecca know Pete.  Becky, Please advise me as to how we should proceed.

Mike, further to our conversation of this week.. let's get together early next week... ( Tues ) to sit down and hash out expectations of Jane and Keith as they relate to your needs, my needs and how they mutally benefit our efforts.
 
I think we may have to formalize the reporting process on the regulatory but before I worry about that, I am more interested in you and me working out expectations... we may be far off as to what the priorities are and as such our regulatory focus may need to splinter.
 
I have decided to go up to Canada for a couple days to handle some family affairs.  I can be reached on my cell, otherwise I will talk to you on tues.

As a reminder...EFFECTIVE AUG 1. ENA has appointed Nevada Power / Sierra Pacific as our agent for the term of the transportation agreement. What this means is that NP will nominate the supply gas into the pipeline and deliver to themselves as they are the market for the whole volume and term. ENA will have to instruct NP what our supply looks like ( on a daily basis) 
 
We have sold all the Kern gas to SPPC for the entire period.... at a Socal Monthly Index minus $.42/$.95 related price and our obligation is 100% takes.
 
I know some supply has been purchased for the term but some gas will be procured in the spot market.  I expect that Steve South and Paul Lucci will coordinate those efforts as required but we need this gas to show up every day.  
 
Let me know if there are any questions regarding this note... but primary supply and market obligations are in the hands of the trading group.

I have had several conversations with EPNG about the possibility of ENA turning back capacity to satisfy 1) requests for new capacity in the Power Up 2000 project and 2) any possible capacity that EPNG may need to provide to satisfy incremental needs of full requirements customers as they convert billing determinants to Contract Demand quantities.

In order to preserve our position, should I send a formal letter to Al Clark stating our desire to turn the capacity back? The Power Up 2000 deadline is noon, Thursday, August 2, 2001. They did not provide for turn back in the posting that is currently on the capacity system. While we do not know how EPNG will be forced to resolve their capacity issues in the receipt point allocation proceeding, I believe that a letter can help us preserve our position should we choose to turn back capacity under either scenario.

We have approx. 54,000 of Block I and III capacity and 200,000 of Block III capacity. The Block II capacity is subject to PG&E recall - PG&E paid approx. $58 million for those recall rights in a settlement. Could EPNG pay a negotiated sum of money for the remaining value of the recall rights to fund the needs full requirement customers? I have to believe this option would be cheaper than adding new  capacity.

Leslie - could you help me with the letter?

Many thanks!

I had planned on attending with Dave.  I thought you might have some interest as well.  Would you like Dave to find out who is attending from Portland?

We should probably discuss this conference, including coordination with the Portland Office. Although it is a gas conference, I would still like to know who else thinks they should be going.

Mark, 

Thank you for your help identifying the right speaker for the ZEG/NW Gas Association Conference in Portland - October 3.  I have attached an advanced draft agenda so you can see the line up of executives and topics. We certainly hope that Enron will agree to speak and sponsor....I would recommend the reception sponsorship....I believe a good value for the $.....see attached letter to David Fuller re sponsorship and Sponsorship Detail Sheet. 

As you will see from the agenda, the topic is PRICE...natural gas price.....what I believe would be of interest is the relationship between gas and electric prices in the West....factoring hydro etc.,......identifying the wildcards.... 

The morning of Day 2 is high level - CEO discussions of DEMAND - consumer/industry/gas fired gen and PRICE...as I said Enron - as largest marketer in NA - should be the company delivering the discussion. - This is a GAS industry conference - not a ""public"" forum.  Louise Kitchen would be an great choice - I've heard she is an excellent presenter - and I believe of equivalent stature to the other a.m. presenters....... 

Thanks...... please give me a call as soon as you can after the holiday. 

Regards, 

Janet Lynch

Regarding our discussions about the subject issue, I believe that the following orders would sufficiently document FERC's policy regarding solicitation of capacity turnback from existing customers to get El Paso's attention:

From ""Order Denying Rehearing and Accepting Compliance Filing"", issued  March 19, 2001, Mississippi Canyon Gas Pipeline, LLC, Docket No. RP00-226-002 and -003 (94 FERC ? 61,324)

Prior Solicitation of Capacity Turnback

BP claims (Petition at 4-7) that MCGP should be required to solicit the voluntary turnback of capacity from its shippers prior to requiring them to submit production profiles.  As BP correctly notes (Petition at 4-5), the Commission did state in the Northern Border case that a pipeline should solicit turnback capacity from its shippers before filing an application to construct expansion facilities.

7Northern Border Pipeline Company, 90 FERC ? 61,263 at 61,879 (2000).


From ""Order Issuing Certificate"", issued March 16, 2000, Northern Border Pipeline Company, Docket Nos. CP99-21-000, CP99-21-001, and CP99-21-002 (90 FERC ? 61,263)

Further, we find below that Northern Border properly applied the Commission's policy regarding the solicitation of turnback capacity.  (from Footnote 46)

and

We conclude that Northern Border properly complied with the Commission's requirement that pipelines solicit turnback capacity before filing an application for authority to construct new capacity.

Stephanie - I question whether your buy-out idea would fly.  The major thing that got the CPUC in the settlement was the recall rights of Block II which assured that the former PG&E customers would always have firm rights to cheap gas - at least for the term of the settlement.  Removing them would require a tariff change, and I can't see the CPUC agreeing.

Subject:	Kern River 637 Segmentation Issue

Report from yesterday's technical conference.  FYI, Kern River originally argued that there is no viable segmentation opportunity on its system because there are currently no gas supply sources available to its shippers between the Utah and Nevada markets to source a segmented transport.  After a technical conference last October, Kern River did file a segmentation proposal, but I'm not sure how much value it would have as a practical matter.  Note the Southwest Gas arguments (summarized in #3 below) for allowing backhauls from California to Las Vegas under a segmented agreement.

Subject:	Kern River 637 Segmentation Issue

Becky,

I did attend this morning's Kern River technical conference in Docket No. RP00-337 at FERC.  The discussion was only on the segmentation proposal made by Kern River.  They have filed pro forma tariff sheets to allow:
segmenting of firm contracts at any point
segmentation and release
subject to a limitation of MD at any overlapping points
backhaul from supply pooling points or points where gas is physically received
sets out secondary priorities for transportation within the path and outside the path

After Kern River made this pro forma filing, there were two protests by Dynegy and Southwest Gas.  Kern River discussed these protests at this technical conference in attempt to resolve all issues.

1.  Kern River agreed with Dynegy's point that a segmenting shipper should retain primary rights to mainline capacity when using points within the original contract path or even when outside of path but the mainline constraint remains the same as within the path.

However, after determining priorities on mainline capacity, if constraints occur at specific new points in the segmented transaction, then the transaction could be given secondary priority based on the receipt or delivery point capacity.

Indicated Shippers needed to be assured that their capacity to Wheeler would not be diminished due to this new policy.  Kern River responded that this is how they have always treated flex points and that because Wheeler was a constrained point, any segmented transactions that used Wheeler (new) would be secondary to the current rights (not on the basis of mainline but on the basis of the delivery point scheduling).

2.  In response to Southwest's first issue, Kern River also agreed to make changes to provide parity between segmentation for release and segmentation for a shipper's own use of transportation.  If a shipper segments a contract, it can get additional primary receipt or delivery point capacity within the path if it is available from the pipeline.

It was also noted that a shipper can segment a contract that goes from A to C into two transactions - A to B and then a backhaul from C to B.  In doing this, since there is no overlapping of mainline capacity, both transactions can be at the original MDQ.  The result could be double the MDQ at the new delivery point B.  This seems very flexible of Kern River and perhaps more than many other pipelines currently are willing to offer.  

3.  The last issue raised by Southwest was the controversial one and was not resolved at today's technical conference.  Southwest wants to use its firm transportation contract on Kern River through segmenting to backhaul from Wheeler Ridge delivery point or from PG&E delivery point to Las Vegas.  Kern River currently will provide this kind of service only on a IT basis - a separate service to Southwest.  They claim that this cannot be provided on a firm basis.  Southwest states that this is displacement service and barring insufficient deliveries at Wheeler or PG&E (very unlikely, according to Southwest), could be provided under their firm contract.  They are willing to take the risk that the capacity would not be available if Kern does not have enough forward haul to Wheeler or PG&E.

Indicated Shippers claimed that this is similar to a service provided by Transwestern; however Transwestern offered this as a pipeline firm service.  Kern River claims that it does not and cannot offer this backhaul as a firm service.  Kern River also argued that per GISB once gas is scheduled on a firm contract to a secondary point that it is considered firm.  IT can be bumped intraday and this backhaul service may be bumped.

Mirant also supported Southwest on this issue because they know of some power plants in the Las Vegas area being built that could use this kind of service.

Kern River maintained that this service is not required by Order No. 637.

Kern River will file changes to the pro forma tariff by May 15.  Comments by the parties are due June 1 and Kern River can file in reply by June 11.  Comments should be emailed to the parties.

Here is the Commission's basic policy on reverse open seasons.  I've asked Randy Rich to look into the other aspects of your questions, which we'll discuss shortly.
The Commission has a two-step process for determining whether the market finds an expansion project economically viable. The first step, which occurs prior to the certificate application, is for the pipeline to conduct an open season in which existing customers are given an opportunity to permanently relinquish their capacity. This first step ensures that a pipeline will not expand capacity if the demand for that capacity can be filled by existing shippers relinquishing their capacity.  The second step is that the expansion shippers must be willing to purchase capacity at a rate that pays the full costs of the project, without subsidy from existing shippers through rolled-in pricing. 
The reverse open season requirement (i.e., the requirement that a pipeline give customers the opportunity to turn back capacity) is established Commission policy.  It was stated in the Commission's Pricing Policy for New and Existing Facilities Constructed by Interstate Natural Gas Pipelines, 71 FERC P61,241 at p. 61,917 (1995), reh'g denied, 75 FERC P61,105, and later reiterated in Certification on New interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities (Certificate Policy Statement), 88 FERC P61,227 (1999), order clarifying statement of policy, 90 FERC P61,128, order further clarifying statement of policy, 92 FERC P61,094 (2000).  
My research has indicated that the Commission has provided few specifics on how a reverse open season is to be conducted.  This probably allows pipelines considerable discretion in how they conduct their solicitations of turnback.  General Commission policy would probably require only that shippers be given adequate notice of and opportunity to respond to the reverse open season.  If the procedure used by El Paso for soliciting turnback becomes an issue, please let me know and let's discuss it.  I'll be up in a few minutes for our call to Randy.

I assume you received this information already and I know that we have not discussed Tyrell being ranked here.

Although the forced ranking creates problems at time, I am satisfied that Ty's ranking is appropriate...

Below are the final PRC rankings for the Analysts and /or Associates who were assigned to you for the mid-year PRC process.  Please communicate these results to the appropriate supervisor.  PRC reviews with the Analysts and Associates should be completed by early August, and the signed evaluation forms should be returned to me at EB3539b.

Barry,

I have spoken to my insurance agent.  Please take the car in for an estimate
and let me know what they say.  After that I can work with the insurance
company to get them to do the rest of the coordination.

Thank you.  I am sorry for the inconvenience and for the whole incident.

Barry,

I've left hard copies of the attached on your desk.  The EPNG document is my memo regarding the information you had requested on EPNG's tariffs, etc.  The Marathon Oil doc shows the deltas on the legs of the PNM sale.  The +757 thousand change from Thursday's value is primarily due to an increase in Winter 02/03 border prices and a drop in SJ basis from Nov 02 out.  

Please let me know should you have any questions.

Phil

Good morning Barry,

Just to let you know that I am on holidays August 11-26, so your
counselling will have to be this week or when I return.

Did Enron provide you with approval for a ""Post Arrival Consultation""/PAC?
This is the counselling our PwC Houston office does.  (So, in effect there
are two possible counselling sessions for assignees - the predeparture
counselling you are supposed to receive before you depart Canada and then
there's the PAC).  PwC Houston is prepared to set up the ""PAC"" - they
simply want to know if you received approval for it.

Thanks,

El Paso Rests Its Case in Gas Hearing
 Energy: Firm accused of price gouging ends arguments, though judge warned there's evidence it manipulated market.

By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER


WASHINGTON -- A Texas natural gas conglomerate accused of price gouging in California unexpectedly rested its case Monday, even though a judge warned that the state has presented credible evidence the company attempted to take unfair advantage of the energy crisis.

Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said he had wanted El Paso Corp. to present witnesses to explain tape-recorded phone calls that he says raised suspicions of an inside deal to manipulate California's natural gas market.

The California Public Utilities Commission is alleging that El Paso created artificial natural gas shortages last year, helping drive electricity prices to record levels. The state wants FERC to order refunds of at least $184 million. But the company said its critics had not presented any new evidence and had failed to prove their allegations. FERC's governing board had initially dismissed complaints of insider dealing, but it recently authorized Wagner to take a closer look.

""If anything happens here, I am sure it is going to be all political,"" said El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn. ""There is absolutely no new evidence. FERC already looked at this the first time and found that El Paso did not violate any rules. How can they come back and say we did?""

Kevin Lipson, a lawyer for plaintiff Southern California Edison, called El Paso's decision ""one of the dumber moves I've ever seen"": valid from a legal standpoint but ""a public relations disaster. . . . The judge is saying we're going to have to draw our own conclusions if they don't present witnesses.""

The case is considered the closest thing to a full-blown trial of allegations that corporate scheming--not merely an imbalance of supply and demand--contributed to California's energy woes.

At issue is a controversial contract between two subsidiaries of the Houston-based company: El Paso Natural Gas Co., a pipeline regulated by FERC; and El Paso Merchant Energy, an energy marketing company.

The marketing company last year acquired the right to ship 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day through a critical pipeline serving Southern California. CPUC alleges that Merchant used inside information to win the deal and later withheld supplies of gas to drive up prices. Once the contract expired May 31 and some 30 other companies acquired the shipping rights, natural gas prices plunged.

Wagner, FERC's chief administrative law judge, has until early October to render an initial decision to the agency's governing board. FERC has the power to order the return of any ill-gotten profits, but the company would likely appeal such a penalty to the federal courts.

A few weeks ago, Wagner dismissed Gov. Gray Davis' demand for $8.9 billion in electricity refunds from out-of-state suppliers. In the El Paso case, however, he has been a thorn in the side of industry.

El Paso chief executive William Wise had been expected to take the stand Monday afternoon, when the company abruptly shifted its strategy in a dramatic legal gambit.

Dan Collins, an El Paso attorney, told the judge that the company would rest its case. Collins held out the possibility that Wise might yet testify, but only to answer questions from the judge, not from plaintiff's lawyers.

After a short recess, Wagner returned to the hearing room and ruled that CPUC had met its initial burden of proof--akin to finding probable cause in a criminal trial.

""I do find that the complainant has made a prima facie case and the burden of proof now shifts to El Paso,"" Wagner said. When El Paso's lawyers tried to respond, Wagner ordered them to ""please be seated.""

Wagner said he was disturbed by transcripts of conversations taped in February 2000 between Robin Cox, an official of El Paso Merchant, and Harvey Rodman, an official of yet another El Paso subsidiary, Mojave Pipeline Co.

Cox was seeking a shipping discount from Mojave a few days before Merchant finalized its bid. The Mojave pipeline would provide an alternative route into Southern California in case of shipping bottlenecks.

Securing the Mojave discount made the El Paso contract more valuable for Merchant, the plaintiffs allege. In one taped conversation, Cox asks Rodman to refrain from publicly posting the discount for a few days. Plaintiffs allege that other shippers might have competed with Merchant for El Paso's capacity had they known a discount was available on Mojave.

But Merchant official Mark Mitchell testified that the Mojave discount was of no real importance in the company's decision to enter into the deal.

The judge wanted to know more. He urged El Paso Corp. to produce Cox and Rodman as witnesses.

""If ever a deal was being made . . . the words are clear,"" said Wagner. ""It's all buddy-buddy stuff.""

The judge said he was concerned that the Cox-Rodman conversations violated FERC rules that require pipelines to maintain arm's-length relationships with marketing affiliates.

CPUC attorney Harvey Morris, who has spearheaded the case against El Paso, said the judge's ruling made it clear that Merchant obtained preferential treatment.

Morris said he was baffled that El Paso chose not to bring on more witnesses, despite the judge's warning.

""If I were in their shoes,"" said Morris, ""unless I had something to hide, I'd call my witnesses and give them another chance to defend themselves.""

Responded William Scherman, a lawyer for Merchant: ""You make a judgment that you have produced evidence that is sufficient to win your case, and we believe we have done that.""

Price gouging case strong, judge says
El Paso Corp. executives decline to testify -- hearing cut short

Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer
Tuesday, August 7, 2001
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle

URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/08/07/MN173922.DTL>


A federal regulatory judge buoyed California's hopes for a major refund on energy costs yesterday when he said the state had presented credible evidence that a giant Texas natural gas company broke the rules against favoring an affiliate.

Curtis L. Wagner, the chief administrative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said lawyers for the state had made a convincing case that the El Paso Corp. acted improperly. He urged El Paso executives to rebut the allegations.

But they declined, bringing an unexpectedly sudden end to the evidentiary hearing in Washington, D.C., and boosting the spirits of California officials who have asked the regulatory commission to order El Paso Corp. to refund up to $200 million.

Wagner plans to file a recommended decision to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Oct. 9.

At issue is an allegation by the state Public Utilities Commission that El Paso rigged the bidding for use of its natural gas pipeline in Southern California last year. The PUC said El Paso steered a huge block of crucial pipeline space to its own marketing affiliate, effectively freezing out competitors.

The PUC, utilities, say that El Paso's pipeline division and its marketing arm then cooperated to choke off the flow of gas to the state, setting off increases in the price of natural gas -- as well as in the price of electricity from gas-fired power plants.

Wagner said internal El Paso memos and transcripts support the first part of the state's allegations: that El Paso violated federal regulations that prohibit coordination between regulated natural gas pipelines and their unregulated affiliates, which are required to operate independently.

""The California Public Utilities Commission had shown a prima facie case, and the burden of proof shifted to the other side,"" Wagner told The Chronicle yesterday. ""Now I have to look at the whole record and decide the case.""

El Paso denies the allegations that it improperly shared information about the bidding process with the marketing affiliate and arranged discounts.

Top executives, including El Paso Corp. chief executive officer William Wise, had flown to Washington to testify at Wagner's suggestion.

""I told them what I thought they needed to do to show there was no affiliate abuse or no (market manipulation),"" Wagner said. But he said the company had the right to cut the hearing short and rely on the evidence already presented. ""That's up to them.""

Whatever penalties the commission might impose, they could be dwarfed by damages sought in a series of private ratepayer lawsuits against El Paso. Those suits claim the company is largely responsible for billions of dollars in skyrocketing energy costs suffered by Californians over the past 18 months..


AMOUNTS TO CONCESSION
The decision to keep executives off the witness stand yesterday amounted to a concession that El Paso violated Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulations against affiliate abuse, asserted PUC attorney Harvey Morris.

""I infer from their actions it was not going to get any better (if executives testified),"" Morris said. ""They were doing damage control.""

El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn denied that the company has conceded wrongdoing.

""That's absolutely insane,"" said Dunn.

Wagner said transcripts of a telephone conversation between an employee of El Paso's marketing arm, El Paso Merchant Energy, and one of its pipeline affiliates ""tend to show there was communication between the marketing agency and the pipeline."" The two were discussing discounts.

""It looked like hanky-panky,"" Wagner said. The judge said he was also influenced that a memo outlining El Paso Merchant Energy's strategy for boosting profits from its pipeline contract was shared with the top executive for the company's pipeline division.

We need to discuss this NBPL opportunity and how we can front run Tenaska. As discussed there is a ton of Canadian Producers who own this pipe and if we can structure a deal to segment the pipe that has Rockies gas supply attached to it we should pursue.

I am disappointed with this ranking and find it hard to believe that with the year that we have had and the strides that have been made by Mark and the producer services group in Denver that he would be ranked as average. Am I missing something?

Steph, as you know we are not a shipper in this expansion, and I do not foresee any issues related to Enron other than the primary delivery point service that Kern continues to put into Wheeler ( although ) kern maintains this is a takeaway issue, not  delivery. I do not see us filing on this issue however, do you? 

Pls advise if you have a different opinion, but I see no reason for ENA to intervene.

Stephanie, I have booked my flights to San Fransisco.  I will arrive on thurs aug 30 around 4:00 PM via continental. 

can you book meetings with Calpine, Jeff Dasovich, and PG&E ( we can discuss who at PG&E ).  We should also review the Sonoran shippers list and as part of this trip see some of these shippers who could use the PG&E recallable capacity (incl. Calpine).

I  am staying in California for the weekend so I can book meetings all day on friday.  Also, if you want to go out thurs a.m. and come back friday afternoon, that works for me also. please advise asap.

FYI

State building natural gas reserve
Officials refuse to reveal details of the contracts
Bernadette Tansey, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Staff Writers
Thursday, August 16, 2001
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle

URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/08/16/MN209239.DTL>


California has quietly started buying natural gas in response to the energy crisis, forming a gas supply operation that could become one of the largest in the state.

But in a repeat of the state's tactics when it lined up $43 billion in electricity contracts, officials won't say how much they have spent so far -- or how much they plan to buy in the future.

The state is already supplying gas for one power plant this month in an attempt to keep generating costs in check, and it has signed a small contract for gas storage space, state officials said. But they refused to provide The Chronicle with records of any of the purchases.

Releasing additional details -- such as the price officials paid -- would jeopardize the state's goal of keeping electricity costs down by delivering cheaper fuel to natural gas-fueled power plants that serve California, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the state Department of Water Resources.

If private energy traders knew what the state planned to buy, Hart said, they could rush in, scoop up the supplies and demand substantially higher prices to resell them to the state, he said.

Details of the state's gas deals will be made public as much as six months after they're signed, when they no longer give traders any advantage, he said.

That stance has raised an outcry among Republicans and consumer advocates, who criticized the Davis administration earlier this year for delaying disclosure of state power contracts that locked in a huge percentage of California's power needs for more than a decade.

""If there were a competitive bidding process, then, yes, the price should be secret while it's pending,"" said Marcel Hawiger, a natural gas analyst for the consumer group The Utility Reform Network. ""But in a situation like it is now where they're just negotiating backroom deals, we think they should be disclosing everything right away.""

Critics of the Davis administration who think the state already got rooked on the power contracts are equally leery about the state's foray into the natural gas market.

'A DISASTER'

""The governor's secrecy and lack of oversight has been a disaster for the people of California over the last six months,"" said Republican gubernatorial candidate and current Secretary of State Bill Jones. ""These are the same novices who signed those energy contracts.""

Hart said the gas operation would reinforce the state's long-term power buying effort that he credits with taming the out-of-control electricity market in California. His department was pressed into service as an emergency electricity buyer in January after skyrocketing power prices drove state utilities deeply into debt.

The state's new natural gas endeavor is intended as an insurance policy to make sure power plants under long-term contracts with the state don't hike their prices by claiming steep costs for fuel, a justification used by many generators during the height of the energy crisis last winter.

Under terms of some of the state electricity contracts, if the power plants don't make low-cost deals for gas, the state can step in and deliver the fuel itself.

The plan is to stand ready to provide fuel to generators throughout the state by lining up natural gas supplies, setting up to ship gas through pipelines within the state, and arranging for temporary storage space so any state gas surplus can be saved instead of being sold at a loss, Hart said. If the state were to step in as supplier for all the contracts that give it that option, the government would become one of the largest gas purchasers in the state, he said.

Hart's agency signed a four-year, $2 million contract in May with a Livermore gas consulting firm, Interstate Gas Services. The firm was authorized in July to make short-term gas deals with four suppliers in Texas and one in California.


STRATEGY QUESTIONED
Whether the state will be a successful player in the natural gas market is already being questioned by TURN and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. They say the state is reading the future gas market incorrectly by predicting prices close to double what experienced utility gas managers say the state will see by late 2002.

Bill Marcus, a TURN energy consultant, said the state's high forecasts alone could lead to unnecessary rate increases. Ron Low, a PG&E spokesman, said state gas cost overestimates would add $300 million to consumers' bills statewide through 2002; about $140 million would be paid by PG&E customers.

Hart scoffed at PG&E's claims.

""For them to say the price of gas is going to stay the same is ridiculous,"" Hart said. Gas prices have dropped this summer because of the cool weather and conservation efforts, he said. But things could change rapidly when demand peaks in the future. ""You're going to see prices go up again.""

Mark Allen Bernstein, an analyst with RAND, said the state might be doing the right thing if it buys natural gas when prices are low in the spring and fall and socks it away in storage basins to release when demand spikes in the summer and winter.

""We need to make sure there is sufficient storage to weather demand and price fluctuations,"" he said.

The state has lined up a small contract with the Wild Goose storage basin in Butte County and is supplying gas to an Alliance power plant as it starts operations this month, water department officials said. It has also locked in gas supplies at a set price for Dynegy plants in Southern California. The state has still not decided whether to contract for space on the interstate pipelines that bring gas to California from out-of-state producing basins, Hart said.

Hart said critics of the state's electricity contracts who said the deals all should have locked in a fixed price had already been proved wrong. By allowing some of the contract prices to float up or down with the price of gas,

Hart said, the state has been able to take advantage of a steep drop in gas prices this spring.

""We got totally hammered by the media for those (variable) contracts,"" Hart said. ""My God, we're saving billions of dollars.""

Further to our discussions about our EPNG capacity: 

Our research had resulted in an opinion that there is little value associated with PG&E's (northern CA customers) recall rights on Block III capacity.  While it was not part of the original settlement, the 24 hour RE-recall rights to the shipper of record appear to give PG&E a DAILY call on capacity at best. 

Because we have pieced this opinion together based upon rulings in various proceedings, we would like a more formal regulatory/legal opinion of the mechanics of the RE-recall provision that has been developed over time. Is this something that either of you can provide or should it go to Randy? The results of this inquiry will set the tone of our next round of dicussions with EPNG.

 By the way, still waiting on their written reponse to our letter..... I think they have bigger fish to fry.

Please advise.

Stephanie

Steph:  Exactly what are you looking for - I'm not sure we could give you an opinion of the mechanics.  If you remember, we looked at this issue back in March and I sent you the e-mail message below.  Since then, FERC has issued orders in Docket No. RP00-241 on 3/28/2001 and 6/11/2001 which reaffirmed its rulings in the orders discussed below.  There is no discussion in any of the orders on the specific mechanics of the recall other than what I already noted, namely, if the capacity has been recalled by El Paso or a shipper to serve a PG&E market, and the original shipper wants it back, it can re-recall the recalled capacity on 24 hours notice as long as it is using all of its other Block II capacity.  If you need something more ""legal"", we'll see what we can do.  If we have to go to Bracewell for a law firm legal opinion, there would be a charge since they'd have to do the same research before they could sign off on one.

Subject:	Re: block II  

I would note also that the recent reallocation of Topock rights takes care of one of the issues -- namely that El Paso allowed Dynegy to take Block II capacity to SoCal Topock.  The 4/14/00 order should have taken care of it, except for El Paso's position that they had capacity at Topock in the aggregate so they weren't overselling it.  

Order Date	Block II Rulings	
6/14/2000 Denial of Rehearing by Operation of Law	Denies Indicated Shippers request for rehearing of 4/14/00 order.	
4/14/2000 Order on Rehearing (Enron)	Clarifies the January 19 order to provide that El Paso may remarket the PG&E turnback capacity, including Block II, for primary delivery to delivery points other than PG&E Topock if capacity is available at those other delivery points.	
1/19/2000 Order on Negotiated Rate Transactions  (Enron & Williams)	Block II capacity has primary delivery rights only at PG&E Topock and alternative rights at the other Topock delivery points. Rejects CPUC argument against the recall provisions, which are the same as ultimately accepted in the Dynegy deal (see 10/19/99, 7/29/99, 9/17/98 and 6/11/98 orders) and provide (1) that there is no right of recall if the Block II capacity is simply idle, (2) that the capacity may be recalled if it is being used to serve points other than those behind PG&E Topock, and (3) if so recalled, it may be recalled by the original shipper for its own use in the PG&E service territory upon 24 hours notice. Clarifies, as in Dynegy, that the shipper (Enron) must use all its other Block II capacity before recalling other Block II capacity, but is not required to use Block I or Block III capacity first.	
10/19/1999 Order on Rehearing and Clarification (Dynegy)	Denies rehearing of 7/29/99 order 	
7/29/1999 Order on Rehearing and Compliance Filing (Dynegy)	 Affirms that PG&E and the CPUC are entitled to have the Block II capacity recalled to northern California even if it is under contract [to Dynegy]. Reverses previous ruling -- does not require that all other capacity to California be utilized before Block II capacity can be recalled. Per Settlement, recalling shipper must pay max rate to recall if its contract is one month or less.  If for more than one month, the rate must equal or exceed the rate of the existing shipper. On 24 hours notice, the existing shipper (i.e., Dynegy) may recall for its own use to serve northern California markets, capacity that was recalled for use by other shippers, even if those shippers are willing to pay a higher rate. Clarifies that if the Block II capacity is idle but is not being used to serve areas outside of northern California, [Dynegy] may hold the capacity without any obligation to release it.	
9/17/1998 Letter Order on Compliance Filing	Requires the Dynegy/El Paso agreement to clearly state that Block II capacity was recallable even though Dynegy had a minimum take requirement. Requires El Paso to eliminate use of alternative delivery points as the defining point for the service that would be recalled -- issue is markets served, not delivery points. Requires elimination of a clause requiring recalling shipper to submit a sworn statement that no capacity was available on other pipelines.	
6/11/1998 	Shippers in northern California cannot recall Block II capacity simply because it is not actually being used by [Dynegy]. Block II is recallable if [Dynegy] is using it to serve end users not within PG&E's service territory. Shippers who want to recall Block II capacity must have an actual need and may only recall if firm capacity is not available to PG&E's service territory via El Paso or via any other pipeline available to the shipper.

Subject:	Block III Recall Rights

Further to our discussions about our EPNG capacity: 

Our research had resulted in an opinion that there is little value associated with PG&E's (northern CA customers) recall rights on Block III capacity.  While it was not part of the original settlement, the 24 hour RE-recall rights to the shipper of record appear to give PG&E a DAILY call on capacity at best. 

Because we have pieced this opinion together based upon rulings in various proceedings, we would like a more formal regulatory/legal opinion of the mechanics of the RE-recall provision that has been developed over time. Is this something that either of you can provide or should it go to Randy? The results of this inquiry will set the tone of our next round of dicussions with EPNG.

 By the way, still waiting on their written reponse to our letter..... I think they have bigger fish to fry.

Please advise.

We are just looking for further verfication that the RErecall can be enacted on 24 hours notice regarding of the term of the proposed recall.  I believe there are some distinctions relative to the requested term. To the extent that there is a perpetual 24 hour RErecall (is 24 hours based on date recall is effectuated or the date gas flows pursuant to recall?), PG&E paid $58 million for protection that is not worth very much.

Just looking for greater clarification. To the extent it may help us with our position regarding the ability to turn back the 200 M2/d of capacity, it may be worth the expense to have independent verfication.

Thanks,

STeph

     Barry:
     
     You probably thought I had forgotten about you! I had not. I wanted to 
     iron out some areas of concern from my end here. As you know, I am not 
     supposed to do an investment for you while you are a resident of the 
     US. I have discovered that if we put the money into an account and not 
     make moves on it until you move back to Canada, then we can do it if I 
     use a Canadian address. I was advised to put the money into a balanced 
     fund and leave it there for now. My thoughts are to move it to a 
     couple of funds in a self administered account and NOT make any moves 
     with it. 
     
     Please review this note, and let me know what you think. If all is ok 
     I will mail you the forms to sign (which you signed here), and we will 
     get this moving.
     
     Hope all is well with you down there.
     
     Regards
     Rob

Sorry for the delay, but I finally have a revised version of your contract from our legal department.  Although we have made what appear to be substantial revisions, I believe the key aspects of the agreement remain intact and the revised contract adheres to industry standards.

has there been a change in the way we are calculating field receipts for Alberta that supports the significant month on month growth.  Do we now include Alliance in here ? It appears to be a dramatic increase relative to historicals.

     Barry: I will send a note to Jacy. Also the funds I think we will go 
     into are going to be more heavily weighted towards stocks, but will 
     have some bonds as well, that what makes them a balanced fund. Also, 
     do want us to manage the money Jacy has, or do you want to leave it 
     with him? No problem either way, just let me know.
     Rob

I wasn't worried for a second.
     
I would like to have these funds in a portfolio that has a better 
performance than money markets. I already have a decent amount of money 
( 60K) in the Rice portfolio thru andrew agencies in Virden. You may 
want to look at exactly what that is, contact Jacy Whyte at Andrew 
Agencies... he will get you the details for Kim and I. 
     
Was there a particular index fund you had in mind? What do you mean by 
balanced ? Once we put it there I don't plan on touching or managing 
this until I return to Canada.  
     
Thanks, talk to you soon.

     Barry:
     
     You probably thought I had forgotten about you! I had not. I wanted
to 
     iron out some areas of concern from my end here. As you know, I am
not 
     supposed to do an investment for you while you are a resident of
the 
     US. I have discovered that if we put the money into an account and
not 
     make moves on it until you move back to Canada, then we can do it
if I 
     use a Canadian address. I was advised to put the money into a
balanced 
     fund and leave it there for now. My thoughts are to move it to a 
     couple of funds in a self administered account and NOT make any
moves 
     with it. 
     
     Please review this note, and let me know what you think. If all is
ok 
     I will mail you the forms to sign (which you signed here), and we
will 
     get this moving.
     
     Hope all is well with you down there.

     Barry, I just sent out your stuff to get you to sign and return, and I 
     just realized I forgot to put a return envelope in there, (cheap 
     bugger). My apologies.
     
     I am just transferring it to a money market fund until it all gets 
     there,then I will do the direction from there, and I will let you know 
     which funds I think will do the job then.

We are in the process of redesigning our application of the fundamentals in our  sales/coverage programs.  We are moving to a much more formal process and your needs dovetail nicely with ours.  We will want to make sure that we are utilizing the best available information in our sales programs so I look forward to working with you on this in a close manner.  We will try to get you what you need and make it a priority.

Mark

If you are unaware of this, I have put placed in charge of the fundamentals for the Northwest, Rockies, and Southwest on the desk.  Matt and Steve are currently working on the Northwest and Monique is working on the Southwest.

I am in desperate need of some help on the Rockies as this is the largest fundamental task we have to present in the West, including California in my opinion.  I want to make a full presentation to the group next Wednesday of the complete Rockies picture.  I have already done a lot of work on this, but I am in need of additional information and help.

Paul...we have already talked about load.  I need to know by Monday whether or not we can get numbers from PSCO.  If so, I need them on Monday.  If we can't, I understand the problems with that and I will go forward with what I have.

Tyrell...you seem to have the best handle on production numbers in the Rockies.  Could you please update your production numbers out through the winter.  If you can get your hands on any historical production data showing trends that would be great.  I was thinking that maybe we could ask some of the producers we have done deals with to  give us their production history back to last September or October.  Also, if you have any good information on decline curves (especially the difference between CBM in Powder and the deeper wells in other areas) I would love to include that.

Theresa...can you talk to Trailblazer, CIG, WIC and get the latest on any significant capacity increases (including quantities and schedules) through the middle of next year.  The major thing is the Trailblazer expansion...are they on time...what is the timing...what is the exact volume coming online...etc.  Also, if they know of any major maintenance issues over the next several months I would like to know them.

I know I am asking for quite a bit in a short period of time, but you can also see that there is no way that I can do all this myself plus everything else I am trying to work on.  Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  I would like to have all this information to me by midday Tuesday at the latest.  Call me with any questions or comments.

Thank you,

Jay

     Actually, the money that is in Clarica is part pension and part rrsp, 
     however the pension money, (that should cause it to be locked in) is 
     actually not locked in. I guess that it was not vested. As a result of 
     this, I am looking to transfer it all the one rrsp.
     Let me know if you or Jacy have questions.
     Rob

Jacy called me last night and I think will get in touch with you 
today... Is the money that I have with you locked in or part of a RRSP

     Barry: I will send a note to Jacy. Also the funds I think we will
go 
     into are going to be more heavily weighted towards stocks, but will
     
     have some bonds as well, that what makes them a balanced fund.
Also, 
     do want us to manage the money Jacy has, or do you want to leave it
     
     with him? No problem either way, just let me know.

I wasn't worried for a second.
     
I would like to have these funds in a portfolio that has a better 
performance than money markets. I already have a decent amount of money 
( 60K) in the Rice portfolio thru andrew agencies in Virden. You may 
want to look at exactly what that is, contact Jacy Whyte at Andrew 
Agencies... he will get you the details for Kim and I. 
     
Was there a particular index fund you had in mind? What do you mean by 
balanced ? Once we put it there I don't plan on touching or managing 
this until I return to Canada.  
     
Thanks, talk to you soon.

     Barry:
     
     You probably thought I had forgotten about you! I had not. I wanted
to 
     iron out some areas of concern from my end here. As you know, I am
not 
     supposed to do an investment for you while you are a resident of
the 
     US. I have discovered that if we put the money into an account and
not 
     make moves on it until you move back to Canada, then we can do it
if I 
     use a Canadian address. I was advised to put the money into a
balanced 
     fund and leave it there for now. My thoughts are to move it to a 
     couple of funds in a self administered account and NOT make any
moves 
     with it. 
     
     Please review this note, and let me know what you think. If all is
ok 
     I will mail you the forms to sign (which you signed here), and we
will 
     get this moving.
     
     Hope all is well with you down there.
     
     Regards
     Rob

Here is everything that you requested.  The Sierra Pacific chart is in the PG&E document.  As far as the origination diagrams, I redid the physical chart, but for the paper chart, I need for you to look it over and I will make the necessary corrections.  Have a great weekend!

Barry,
How about Friday at 11:00 in my office? Then we can go out to lunch around
noon--did you have a place in mind? Also, I'd like to include our legal guy,
Dave Anderson, and our contracts person, Charlotte Baxter.

Ray, thanks for the return call the other day.  As discussed in our
voice mails there remains a variety of reasons that ENA should be
talking to you.  As such we would like to meet with you on Friday  for
an early meeting and or lunch  just to bring to a current status all the
legal,credit and commercial opportunities that should be reviewed. 

If Lunch on friday ( aug 31 ) is good for you, please set it aside.. we
can pick at spot for lunch... next week if the schedules line up.
Stephanie Miller will be joining me.

thanks in advance.

missing information on my wife and as such disallowed me claiming her as

Good morning Barry,

Just to let you know that I am on holidays August 11-26, so your
counselling will have to be this week or when I return.

Did Enron provide you with approval for a ""Post Arrival
Consultation""/PAC?
This is the counselling our PwC Houston office does.  (So, in effect
there
are two possible counselling sessions for assignees - the predeparture
counselling you are supposed to receive before you depart Canada and
then
there's the PAC).  PwC Houston is prepared to set up the ""PAC"" - they
simply want to know if you received approval for it.

Thanks,

Jay is looking at updated financial information we received yesterday but I haven't heard from him.  Stacy is working on a Master Draft as well as the other documents we received from them.  Her ETA as of this morning is this afternoon.  Basically, jay is ok with using the GISB for up to three months if Stacy is ok with it.  He said that he would require a master for a 6 month transaction or longer.  

Will update you as soon as I get more info from Credit and Legal.

This is the final version of the interruptible storage transaction we closed yesterday with MPC.  We will track the value of the transaction over the term of the agreement and then agree on a split of the value with the desk at the end of the transaction.  Please contact me if you have any questions.

Barry, thanks for the number.  Also, I just thought of something.  The 1:30
I referred to is 1:30pm Calgary time,,,, is that all right with you?  I
don't think you need to bring any homework.  We've got your 2000 file and
that should be sufficient.

Hi, I'm back.

Please fax the IRS notice to me at the number below if you haven't
already
and I'll review it for you.

Regarding the counselling session, I am available tomorrow all day,
Wednesday afternoon after 1:30pm, Thursday afternoon after 2pm and
Friday
after 2pm.  Next week I'll be out of the office Tuesday and Wednesday as
well as Thursday afternoon.  The next week I am out of the office on a
course all week (Sept 8-14).

Will any of these time slots work for you?

Send me a note when you get back and we can set up a meeting then.

Also, I received a notice from the IRS and it appears that they were
missing information on my wife and as such disallowed me claiming her as
a dependent.  I will send to your attention to review and clarify. Based
on my filing and actual refund there is about a $ 1k difference which I
believe is owed to me.

Good morning Barry,

Just to let you know that I am on holidays August 11-26, so your
counselling will have to be this week or when I return.

Did Enron provide you with approval for a ""Post Arrival
Consultation""/PAC?
This is the counselling our PwC Houston office does.  (So, in effect
there
are two possible counselling sessions for assignees - the predeparture
counselling you are supposed to receive before you depart Canada and
then
there's the PAC).  PwC Houston is prepared to set up the ""PAC"" - they
simply want to know if you received approval for it.

Thanks,

Natural Gas Futures and Cash Tumble=20

    Natural gas futures for September delivery on the NYMEX tumbled $0.162 =
to $2.544 per MMBtu yesterday, after hitting a 18-month low on weak overall=
 fundamentals. The October contract dropped $0.154 to $2.582 per MMBtu. The=
 September contract traded at its lowest price since February 2000 when it =
reached a low of $2.53. Bearish fundamentals are triggered by last week's r=
evised storage, mild weather and no tropical storm action on the immediate =
horizon. Last week, the AGA revised the prior week's reported data up 47 Bc=
f in addition to the higher than expect injection for the that week. The fa=
lloff is in preparation for this week's expected much higher than normal.  =
Most of New England and interior New York state will experience mild weathe=
r this as will most of the Pacific coast. Temperatures will turn mild in th=
e Midwest, northern Plains and Northeast later this week, putting more pres=
sure on the market. Look for prices to open lower this morning and continue=
 under pressure. September options expire today and futures tomorrow. Look =
for next support at $2.43 and then $2.39; with resistance seen at $2.83, an=
d then $2.97. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada wa=

JP Morgan Cuts Forest and Louis Dreyfus Ratings

     JP Morgan has cut its ratings on Forest Oil and Louis Dreyfus Natural =
Gas to 'market performer' from 'long-term buy', citing lower forecasts for =
natural gas prices. The downgrades came after JP Morgan revised its 3rd qua=
rter Henry Hub natural price forecast to $2.90 per MMBtu from $3.25 per MMB=
tu. It also dropped its 4th quarter forecast to $2.75 MMBtu from $3.75 per =
MMBtu. Other than lower expected natural gas prices, JP Morgan had nothing =
but good things to say about both companies, calling Louis Dreyfus as a wel=

ive exploration upside potential relative to peers and appears to be set fo=

Enron Wind May Be Overvalued

    Enron is reportedly having problems in a effort to sell Enron Wind, wit=

o need to consolidate. The world's largest supplier of wind turbines with a=
 third of the global market, Danish Vestas Wind Systems, says their strateg=
y is grow on their own as the market grows, and will not even consider buyi=
ng Enron Wind. The global wind power market is predicted to increase by an =
annual average rate of 19% per year over the next ten years. Enron Wind has=
 unofficially been up for sale for several years, but has not received any =
reported serious interest near the asking price. German-Danish Nordex is ac=
tively seeking potential acquisition candidates and was talking to Enron Wi=
nd, but says it is too highly valued. Last week, Enron's wind turbine unit =
was valued at $725 million. NEG Micon, with a market share more than twice =
as large as Enron Wind, is worth $860 million based its stock price.=20

New California Energy Board at Odds with FERC

    In its first meeting, the California Consumer Power and Conservation Fi=
nancing Authority was told that plans to build additional natural gas stora=
ge fields will provide the state with insurance against sudden price hikes =
resulting from supply shortages. California's governor has given the author=
ity for up to $5 billion to build more power plants, add natural gas storag=
e, increase renewable energy, and create conservation incentives. However, =
there are concerns that the agency will dampen enthusiasm for private inves=
tment in the state's beleaguered power system. In order to control their ow=
n destiny, officials say that California needs a sufficient surplus of natu=
ral gas to ensure competition. Mirroring its accusations against power gene=
rators, California has alleged that natural gas pipeline companies created =
non-existent shortages to drive up prices. However, the mandate given to th=
e authority by the governor could put the state on a collision course with =
the FERC, which claims exclusive jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act. =
The authority will expire in 2006, unless the state legislature revives it.

Well, we are having to sell it because we are so short of cash right now.
Really for a lot of reasons. We have had to make an investment of our own to
do a demo so we could shop it to labels in the U.S. This is working out well
as we have had a few discussions already. Also there have been some serious
changes in the way U.S. Immigration is working and it has really screwed a
lot of touring bands. It has made us cancel already 10 shows for September.
They basically changed the rules overnight on everybody. There is nothing we
can do about it unless we know a member of Congress or we have a $1000 U.S..
We may have to come up with the $1000. We think that we may be able to book
tours that will allow us to just rent a vehicle when we need one. That is
what we are looking at right now. I am at home by the way, and here until at
least the 15th of September.

Why are you selling the van. Don't you need to get around?  I am not
sure what the outstanding balance is... I will have to check my notes...
Are you in Canada or the U.S.

I was going to send you one in a day or so after I figured out what was
going on. We have put some money already in the bank this month. Ken put
in
$400 and we are trying to get the rest in before the end of the month.
We
are also trying to sell the van. It's tough right now and we need to
make a
few changes. We of course would sell it and pay off the loan with you. I
believe it is around or just under $4000. We will have to work out a
specific balance with you. I hope to sell it soon, but we will have to
wait
and see. Mom does sound well although I wonder if you think she is
getting
the best advice from her lawyer?????? I just think she should get this
over
with. Sounds like maybe she is reticent to go any further. Let me know
what
you think of all this.

here is the presentation our group has made to Jean Mrha regarding potential products we've been developing for year-end closure.  I think we all understand that the first three are more viable than the last couple, but it's all up for grabs.  Thanks for hearing me out, and good luck tomorrow!  Eva

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and are currently parking in an Enron Contract garage you are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The  Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until  Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a an information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.

My dear friends (yes I want something):
I have a proposal in front of Colin for the provision of services and wondered if you might get it back in the conversation at dinner in San Fran.

Actually in all seriousness, Stephanie mentioned that you're meeting with him and I thought you might be interested in seeing what we'd proposed.  Is someone in Producer Services also selling services to Calpine, or would it fall into your shop?

Is this what you think John wants to see, or should we go into more detail?  I tried to get the storage guys a meeting with these guys earlier in the summer but I was not successful.  I do not know if they were ever successful in getting that meeting.  I do not think so.

Did any of the gas commercial people respond?  Also, any communications from ENA and Barry T. on this?

Subject:	Southwest Gas filing in Nevada

You may remember that Southwest Gas filed a tariff revision in Nevada that would keep a transportation customer who returns to sales on sales for a term of 5 years.  They modified that request to grandfather customers who returned as a result of this past winter's fiasco.  We filed an opposition to this tariff change back in April (I think it was).  Anyway, the PUC of Nevada has scheduled a hearing on the SW filing for Sept. 24 and I need to know if this is an issue you want to pursue.  I can attend, or I can have outside counsel attend, or we can skip it and rely on our written comments. IF we want to file testimony, it would be due 9/17.  Please let me know what you would like me to do on this.  Thanks."

BT;
- I feel like foghorn leghorn on this project (ie: ""I'm pitching but not one's catching"")...I have been trying to find ABC/ANG capacity (per your inquiry for 10,000 capacity for winter only) in addition to looking for 5,000 of ABC only capacity for Petrobank (they actually have firm ANG/PGT but let their ABC go) 
- fyi, (this has not been press released) but it looks like NOVA/ANG will have an additional 60,000 of contracted capacity avail this Nov 1 (part of the expansion that was to go with the PGT expansion but is being done early as it only goes as far as kinsgate)...no surprise that the shipper to get the capacity is BC Gas (to use for Southern Crossing) 
- I'm afraid that the best we can offer is IT Tolls (.17 C/GJ for Nova + .08 C/GJ for ANG + .06 for Fuel on ANG) = .31 C/GJ
- as far as ABC capacity, there are mismatches (that are complicated by higher fuel rates in the winter) but I will keep working the phones
- do you know if any of the PNW/Calif shippers-utilities have excess ABC capacity and an interest in ANG/PGT??? (Petrobank will likely look at any term winter/1 yr/longer)
- based on previous dealings, Petrobank is motivated 
   

Thanks,

Faizal.... sorry for the delay in providing a quote to you on this
project.

We continue to work on numbers and have had other co's contact us for a
quote.

At this time, do you know if TransAlta is going to pursue submitting a
response to this project?  Do you still require numbers from us?

If so, then I need to coordinate with the appropriate desks pricing and
ENA's response to you and other co's!! ( if any)

Drop me a note as soon as possible and I will go from there. Thanks. BT

Hi Barry!
I was getting ready to email you. Yes, I will be at the game on Mon. night.
I am coming with my friend Linda. She is from Denver. Her parents live
about an hour away. We are going to her parents on Sat. and then coming
into the city on Sun. I got an email from Brian and told him I would be
coming in and it would be great to hook up with you guys before the game. I
have both of your cards. Brian's doesn't have a cell on it, but I see yours
does. I sent him my cell number already. It is 310-346-3086. I'm not sure
where our seats will be since they are from the Giants ticket pool. Just
let us know which local watering hole we can expect to find you!

See you soon!

Are you looking after the transportation / tariff file.... If so, can you send me a copy of this file.

We are or may be building a tariff ( book ) for our West Gas Orig desk and I keep telling them I want to look like the canadian version... 

Thanks in advance.

Subject:	DWR Gas Supply 

Jeff, further to our conversation... this is the list of companies that have entered into contractual agreements with the DWR. I don't know if this means they have transaction but perhaps between Kim Ward and yourself, you can advise.

What I need to know is the legal status/issues ( if any ) of any of the companies listed here today as it relates to the state of California. 
Pan Canadian Energy Services, Occidental Energy Marketing, Dynegy Marketing and Trading , Texaco Natural Gas, BP Amoco, and Coast Energy Group. 

Can you advise If any of these companies form part of ongoing legal action against the state?

Once I know this, then we can decide on a plan what we should discuss with Mark Baldwin.

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

	My name is Iris Mack.  Currently I work on Enron's Power Options Trading desk.  

	I am primarily responsible for building our business in long-term, derivatives structures/trades on multiple commodities and financials.  For example, we are exploring potential structures and trades which involve power, gas, crude oil, weather derivatives, metals, etc.  Some of the building blocks for these multi-commodity derivatives products may be found in the attached document.

 	We are looking to build this business via utilizing as many of Enron's internal resources as possible.  Hence, it would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals in Gas Trading who would be interested in the development of multi-commodity derivatives trades/structures which may used to develop customized risk management tools for our clients.
	
	Thank you in advance for your assistance.
    
Kind regards,
Iris Mack, MBA/PhD
Enron Power Options Trading Desk

Would you know, or do you know who would know, whether ENA serves any end use customers off of Southwest Gas's system in Nevada?  We have a case before the Nevada PUC where SW Gas is trying to force transportation customers who return to sales service to sign up for a minimum term of 5 years and then to give one year's notice before they can return to transportation.  Some customers went back to sales because of delivery and pricing problems last winter, so it became an issue (although most of those customers only had to sign up for 1 year of sales)."

I thought you understood from my email and phone call that I was going to track down El Paso's interpretation of the 24 hours recall rights.  Regulatory treatment of the 58 million by PG&E is a CPUC issue.  I just talked to Becky and I don't have a good response to the question of whether our capacity could replace expansion capacity in light of the dueling recall rights, but I will think about it and talk to Becky some more.

As to the 24-hour recall, I can only tell you what the FERC order says, I have no special knowledge of how El Paso and the parties intended the 24 recall to work.  The order is fairly terse, and just says ""and if it so recalled (by PG&E), that Enron may further recall the capacity for its own use in the PG&E  service territory upon 24 hours notice.""  The language says to me that you can recall it 24 hours before you want to use it.  However, I can call El Paso and find out how they interpret it.

As to the ""traditional rate making"" valuation of the $58 million, I have to confess I don't understand what you mean.  PG&E paid the 58 million as part of a negotiated settlement.  Typically that is part of a black box settlement, meaning that revenue dollars are not tracked to particular costs.  We can pull the settlement and see if it stipulates some sort of treatment, but I would doubt it.  If your question relates to how PG&E is tracking that expense in a regulatory sense, perhaps Jeff Dasovich can find out.

When is the 24 hour notice on re-recall effective - 24 hours from the day of recall (varies depending on term) or 24 hours before the recall is supposed to start?

How would you value what's left of the $58 million that PG&E paid based upon traditional rate making policies? I believe there are at least 5 years left on the term of the settlement.

Please call if you have any questions,

Regards,

Stephanie

I looked over all the orders and the contracts and I agree with both of your interpretation of the recall rights of Block II.  PG&E did not make a very smart deal for $58 million.

Gerald, I have attached a term sheet that I would like you to review.

As I mentioned we need to determine which contract we will use for these deals, (dedicated reserves or enfolio).  
In addition, we need to send renegotiation letters to several of the parties.  If you need the list Theresa can provide it.

Let me know your thoughts as soon as you can.

Mark

During the discussion there was a question from one of the Commissioners to Sourthwest Gas asking why they were not looking into developing a gas storage site.  I believe that Leslie has been talking to Miguel in your group and that possibly there is a meeting set in the near future to discuss development of storage with Southwest Gas?

We have developed a good relationship with several of Governor Hull's staffers, one of whom was at the meeting.  He expressed to me later a strong interest in gas storage development and opined that more  gas storage could be very helpful to the region. It would be helpful for me if I could set up a call between you or whoever would be most knowledgeable on the development of gas storage in your group and the Governor's staffer (Craig Marks) so that he can get a sense of what the real financial/physical/regulatory issues are in such a development.  He has a close relationship with the ACC, and could very well be helpful in moving something forward if we had a strong interest in doing something to move gas storage development in Arizona.

Could you give me a call to discuss?  #612-339-4599.  Thanks."

I just spoke with Krystal at Kern and John Stafford at Patina:
Kern Legal will not finish reviewing until Monday.  At that time they will approve, revise, or reject the changes to the Assignment Agreement.  I reiterated that Enron is comfortable with the changes.
John Stafford is comfortable with Gerald's Indemnity Letter Agreement (below), but would strongly prefer to have the indemnity language incorporated into the Assignment Agreement itself, if it is possible in a timely fashion.
John indicated he would be willing to conference in with Gerald and Kern's attorney(s) first thing Monday morning if we felt it would be helpful.
Bottom line:  It looks like we can shut the door on this, one way or the other, on Monday morning.

UNION members:

The attached presentation provides one format to develop a general orig ""plan"" for attacking the industrial market.  The objective is to encapsulate our ""common view"" of the industrial market opportunities, resource strategy, product strategy, etc..(it also shows Louise that we are working together), .   A more specific plan would be needed for each region driven by specific market needs.   There is no pride of authorship for this format - changes/rewrites are expected.

I you agree this has some value as a way to capture the results of our discussions, I will have an Associate from my group, JD Buss, to develop this further and coordinate comments and input from you or someone on your teams.  Let JD know who he should get in touch with.

Regards,
Brian

At Peter's request, please find attached a copy of the most recent draft of the PG&E Master as compared to the modified version forwarded to us by PG&E in May.  The document also has my comments as to the reasons for some of the key changes.  Those comments are in red (so it might be easier to read the document on line).

Sharon will be coordinating a meeting to discuss the document in advance of our anticipated meeting with PG&E (which I believe is expected to occur on next Tuesday).

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please give me a call (6708).

Barry, I'm trying to see if we can do it from 10 - 11 a.m. (Houston time) on Tuesday.  Is this time slot good for you?
Can you also give me some other times on Tuesday (just in case one of the other participants can't do 10 -11)?

Thanks,
S

Gentlemen,

  As you know, I have been working with Steve Lins to negotiate the ISDA agreement so that Enron and the City of Glendale are able to enter into financial transactions.  I spoke with Steve today and he plans to review our latest draft and get back to me with any final changes so that we can send him an executable copy, along with our required documents, for signature next week.  In other words, I am confident that we will have an executed ISDA within the next couple of weeks.

  My boss, Barry Tycholiz, and I are going to be in southern California September 17 & 18 and would like to set up a meeting with you guys to discuss alternatives to swaping out some of your index priced gas supply.  We are available to meet with you after 2 pm on the 17th or at any time on the 18th.  Please let me know when you guys are available and I will set that time aside for you.  

We look forward to meeting with you and expanding our business with the City of Glendale.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Barry,

As promised, here are some of the current redeployment candidates that have a marketing/structuring/trading background for consideration concerning your West Origination opening.  I believe that you have seen Jim Lowe before and expressed some limited interest in him.  The other candidates are most likely new to you.

Let me know if you would like to pursue any of these redeployed employees.


     

Also, I spoke with Mark McConnell today, and he mentioned that he had accepted the offer to join the Transwestern group of ETS.  He primary motivation for selection of this option was his desire to work with asset deals.  As we know, given EWS ""asset light"" approach to deal making, this option would be difficult to fulfill within the West Origination group.  However, he mentioned that he was very impressed with your group, and short of the asset piece maintained a high interest in your open position.

Regards,
Todd Peikert"

Barry,

I had a long chat with Malowney and we agreed to work together on L-P, we're meeting them here on the 24th.  Regarding other industrials - I'm the gas guy. We're going to share contact lists and try to put forth a cohesive effort on the part of Enron, but I'm gas and he's power, L-P is an exception given their request that he be the contact (for now at least).  Make sense?

John, here is a brief summary of the Williston Basin Storage.... The numbers don't lie... the cushion gas is 160Bcf in the ground sitting idle. It is huge..with 20 bcf of working gas!  Is that some idle capital or what?   

.. There is alot of history here and Mark Whitt and I have been discussing structures/ideas. I will update you immediatly if we are able to kindle something.  

Pls advise if any direct / comments.

Is this what you think John wants to see, or should we go into more detail?  I tried to get the storage guys a meeting with these guys earlier in the summer but I was not successful.  I do not know if they were ever successful in getting that meeting.  I do not think so.

Barry/Mark,

Please see the attached files for the 2002 direct expense plan.  The goal was to reach a combined plan of about $4,220,000.  The numbers included only add up to about $3,905,000 so we can discuss if and where to add the additional $315,000.  I'll try to reach you both at Mark's number around 9:00 Denver time (10:00 Houston time) tomorrow morning.

I had not received the information that Patty Sullivan told me about the gas flows of August and from you about the first days of this month.  Please call me at your convenience

Barry Tycholiz wanted me to contact you regarding next Monday's meeting.
Due to the events in New York and Washington Barry has been stuck in
Denver.  Because of this and other associated business delays, we would
appreciate it if you could reschedule the meeting.  Either Barry or
Stephanie Miller will contact you later to firm up a date.

Thank you for your understanding.  If you have any questions please feel

Dan, I am interested.  I know that Sue Mara spoke with Ron on this subject also, although I was not on the call.  The matter was not discussed on our Western Wholesale call this morning either, since I did not become aware of it till later.  I would therefore like to receive input from Sue and others on our team about this, getting final sign off to proceed from Linda Robertson and Jim Steffes.  If we elect to proceed, it would be appropriate to bill all participating marketers in equal shares.  Thanks.  Ray

Eric, I received your message on discussions with Energy West.  Firstly, I was unaware of any pricing discussions or notional prices being put out to the customer and I have not discussed with Dave, or Mark Whitt. With that being said, I am sure Dave is out marketing products and services to all of the Utilities in the PNW. 

With out a doubt, we need to discuss this effort as it relates to and creates conflict or duplicate coverage.. I look forward to the discussion and did try to call you earlier today to discuss directly.

Phil,
I have attached a presentation that I threw together for the Calgary office regarding Rockies fundamentals.  It doesn't flow particularly well, but it contains the most significant information from a few different prior presentations relating to the Rockies.  Thought it might be useful as you work on the ""Fundamentals Packet"".

 

Give me a call if you have any questions.

Energy West has been covered by the Canadian Desk for the last 5 years..... I think dave priced a 10 year deal lower than what Canada had already priced the deal at... so we have two issues, 1.  coverage (ownership), 2. coordination efforts.

No, canada is not part of the union but at times the thinkness of the 49th parallel ocelates.

We estimated 27,700 (including 3,000 for airfare for Enron people)
We spent 25, 096 (not including airfare or fishing or anything that was put on credit cards)

I will need to get an actual cost for the airfare and anything that was expensed to be able to give you a complete cost of the event.  I will contact Jessica to get this information from her.  I will then include it and send it back to you.

The bill has not been paid. As soon as I got it I put the list together for you.   I am sending it to accounts payable to get paid tomorrow.

I'll get everything to you as soon as I get it.

Don Baldridge indicated that they would prefer to front-load the re-priced swap, with a higher price next year and a market-based price for '03-'05 and no lump sum payout this year.  This structure probably works better for us also due to the increased focus on funds flows.

I also have John Disturnal (ENA Canada) pricing up an at the money swaption for '03-'05, which might be an attractive hedge for Crestone.  Don is going to run some traps on his end and get back to me this afternoon.

Hi, everyone. Sorry for the delay in responding to all the messages and
emails regarding the meetings sponsored by SRP. There were a few people who
were in Phoenix before the WTC disaster and we did meet on Wednesday to do
some brainstorming. This email is an attempt to share the discussions with
those of you who were not here.

The parties who met were SRP, APS, PD, SWG, SoCal and the ACC. Joel Greene,
Barbara Jost, Kelly Daly and Dave Huard were here as legal counsel and Greg
Lander was here as a consultant. There are no new proposals on the table. W=
e
did discuss ways to get to a point where we might be able to talk settlemen=
t
and whether or not parties might be willing to turn back capacity. No
surprise that we keep coming back to ""what do you use to allocate the
existing capacity"". Greg is going to run some numbers for the EOC based on
different starting scenarios using the assumption that CD capacity will be
made available at some level. He will also be looking at the impact of
seasonalizing the EOC loads.

SRP will reschedule the meetings (or arrange a conference call) to discuss
settlement once we have Greg's analysis. I wouldn't expect anything before
the end of September unless it is a conference call.

Thanks to everyone for letting me know your status during the week. It was =
a
relief to know everyone was safe somewhere.

John,
As we discussed, our attorney, Gerald Nemec, will incorporate your language from the red-lined Assignment Agreement in an amendment to the existing letter agreement between ENA and Patina.  The amendment to the letter agreement should be completed this afternoon, at which time Gerald will e-mail you a copy for review.

To the extent that the language is agreeable, Patina can execute Kern's original Assignment Agreement and the amendment to the letter agreement concurrently.

Please call myself or Gerald Nemec (713-853-3512) if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tyrell Harrison

Jaime, further to our conversations earlier. I look forward to our proposed meeting and will coordinate efforts with Stephanie Miller to prepare for ENA's discussion items.  I have decided for at least the next week or so to defer my travel plans ( I am not the best flyer at the best of times ).. As such, we should work towards the end of the month as a timeline for us to come down. 

We can nail down specific dates soonest.

Hello Barry,

My name is Todd Neugebauer and I am a manager in EBS Wholesale Origination in Europe.  I came over here as an associate in February and was promoted in June.  I am looking to move back into one of our more core areas and Ted Bland recommended I speak to you, or someone in your group.  If you have a need, I am going to be in Houston late next week and would be able to meet then to discuss any opportunities.

Regards,

Todd

Randy Maffet would be a good reference, if needed.

As we discussed during our September 7 meeting, attached is a matrix
showing the 10 Northwest Aluminum Direct Service Industries (DSI's).
Since the curtailment agreements BPA has with Alcoa and Columbia Falls
are confidential, am not privy to all their terms. However, I think the
overall status is pretty accurate.

We can use this chart in our October 8 meeting to discuss possible DSI
candidates for Enron services. Please let me know if you need any more
information.

Tyrell,  I Kern won't accept changes, then we can insert into Patina letter amended a clause which states the ENA will keep whole Patina for those obligations and liabilities.

I agree . . . if Kern remains stubborn, is there any short, sweet side agreement that could be drafted between ENA and Patina (maybe as an add-on to our letter agreement amendment) that would effectively pass through the pre-assignment liabilities?

I just received Chris Kennedy's marked up version.  I will forward immediately.

You can direct Kern that we are prepared to underpin that exposure such that Enron wears that risk.... as
 1. there should be no risk anyways, and 
2.  if there were to be any, it should be ENA's anyways.

Mark can do, but as general proposition I think tht you can assume that none of the changes to the Canadian form have been made to the US form, some of which will be jurisdictional to Canada and others of which will not.  Mark please prepare a brief summary.

If one of the exercises is to standardize ( as best as possible the two agreements) I think we need to create a document that identifies the variance in the agreements. Has this been done and if so, can I have a copy to review. I have gone through both the US and Canadian agreements but am not sure where some of the subtle differences lie.

Barry,
No, I didn't receive this before. Regarding the plan for us to build credit
by selling day gas, yes, a bit more detail on the mechanics would help. Any
trading with Enron would have to be approved by my management. Regarding El
Paso, Gas Procurement needs to see what the utility's plan of reorganization
is before we can look at that seriously. The plan is due Dec 6 at the
latest. I have a call in to Eric LeDain regarding the Canadian contract, so
we should be getting to that soon.

I can confirm Peter's assertion that the changes we have requested to the Canadian form have yet to be incorporated into the US form. Generally, the US form is the same as the form which PG&E provided to ECC back in 2000 (with the exception that the US form has been amended to contemplate confirmations through EnronOnline and the insertion of the price indices to use to calculate liquidated damages).  As a result, some of our comments (i.e. the idea that a transaction is entered at the time of the telephone conversation/online transaction and is not dependent upon a confirmation being issued) would apply equally to both the US form and the Canadian form.

 However, there are a number of changes which would have no bearing on the US form.  They are:

1.	insertion of representations and warranties relating to:
a.  eligible financial contracts under Canadian insolvency law;
b.  certain Canadian securities representations;

2.	amendments to Article 4 - Delivery Point - whereby the delivery point is to be in Canada (However, the US Form does contain the clause relating to extraction rights at Cochrane Extraction Point (in s.4.1) which we are seeking to fix.);

3.	amendments to the liquidated damages mechanics in the Canadian form which utilize AECO/NIT as a basis.  The amended US Form includes a number of alternative indices (however, the amended US form does not contemplate changes to or lack of availability of the chosen indices); and

4.	in Article 11, amendments to the Canadian form re: Delivery Point force majeure may not be applicable to the US form.

In addition to the Canadian jurisdiction matters, there are certain amendments which we are seeking for Enron Canada which are not applicable to the US form.  These requests were needed for the Canadian form because PG&E's counsel made a number of unsolicited changes to the Canadian form in his draft in May, 2001 which are not found in the US form.  For example:

1.	amendments to section 2.2 on tape retention is not necessary in the US form as there is merely an obligation to protect the tapes from improper access (as oppose to an obligation to protect the tapes from loss or tampering);

2.	      our amendments to the payment netting provisions of section 7.7 are not necessary for the US form as the US form does not restrict netting of payments solely to monthly payments for Gas deliveries;

3.	      our proposed amendments to the collateralization provisions of section 8.2 are not as key as the US form does not have a clause which (i) would effectively bar Enron from calling for collateral or (ii) include an acknowledgement that any security may require the approval of the Bankruptcy Court; and

4.	      our proposed changes to section 8.3 are not applicable as the US form does not provide PG&E with the excuse of ""lack of Bankruptcy Court consent"" with respect to the provision of collateral.

Hopefully, this gives you an idea of where we are at with the two documents.  If you have further questions prior to our meeting tomorrow, please give me a call at 820-6708.

Thanks,

Mark

Mark and Barry

I have talked to Crestone about backing us in a Northern Border transportation deal.  Basically they are on board, however I have not shown them any economics.  What I believe needs to take place is to identify Northern Border shippers who would be willing to release their capacity.  Once we are able to put the capacity release economics together, which will be driven by the Northern Border shippers, we will be able to 
show Crestone a deal.  I do not have any potential parties willing to release Northern Border capacity.  I have talked to the Central desk about this opportunity, they informed me that they had no interest in this type of an arrangement.  I personally believe we can manage ENA's current Northern Border position more efficiently but have been unable to convince others of this.  Any ideas you can provide would be helpful.

Attached for your review and comments is Enron's Answer to Motion for Partial Summary Disposition by the Texas, New Mexico and Arizona full-requirements shippers in the complaint proceeding that they filed in July (RP01-486).  The shippers have asked the Commission to (a) summarily determine that El Paso's mainline capacity is not adequate to serve its existing firm customers and (b) expeditiously establish a remedy phase in this proceeding.

Enron's answer reiterates the comments it filed in the original proceeding, namely that the Commission should consolidate this proceeding with the complaint filed in RP01-484 by the Joint Complainants (producers, California LDCs) which also deals with issues of adequacy of capacity.  We also reiterate and emphasize our original proposal that the Commission require El Paso to immediately give existing firm shippers the opportunity to turn back capacity they no longer need as one means of making additional capacity available to those who need more.

You do not need to respond, but if you desire to, please get any comments back to me or Leslie by noon tomorrow.  Thanks.

Talked to Mark.

First thing he has to do is convince Davis' lawyers that his companies' client list (which includes TW) shouldn't conflict him out of working on DWR gas deals.
He should have that figured out by this week--sounds like he may have to make some decisions about his current client list and working for DWR.
I told him that we'd like to sit down as soon as possible to discuss opportunities for us to help out DWR with its gas needs.
He said that he'd be happy to do that, once he's got all conflict issues worked out with the Governor's office.
He's going to get back to me to set up a meeting; and if I don't hear from him by Monday/Tuesday of next week, I'll call him back to set up a meeting.
I'm assuming that you'd be part of that meeting?
I asked him what sort of deals they're working on. As you likely know, some of the contracts permit DWR to either 1) provide gas to the plant providing DWR power under the power contract or 2) manage the plant's fuel supply.  So they're looking to get ""soup-to-nuts"" supply service for those contracts that include a fuel-supply option.

Best,
Jeff"

Subject:	El Paso's Bid to Hike Export Capacity Opposed 

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : September 20, 2001
El Paso's Bid to Hike Export Capacity Opposed 
Southwest local distribution utilities and municipal distributors have called on FERC to reject, or convene a technical conference to consider, El Paso Natural Gas' application to boost export capacity on the Samalayuca Lateral by about 100 MMcf/d to meet natural gas demand in northern Mexico. They argue that such action would deprive existing El Paso customers of already-tight capacity on the pipeline's South Mainline. 
There are a number of ongoing cases at the Commission addressing the limited capacity on the El Paso system, and its capacity-allocation procedures, the distributors pointed out. ""Yet...El Paso proposes to allow a unilateral reallocation of 100,000 Mcf./d of capacity to serve customers outside the United States without fully disclosing from which customer the capacity will come and its likely impact on all these pending matters,"" said Southern Union Gas Co. The utility asked the Commission to convene a technical conference. 
Southwest Gas Corp. and the El Paso Municipal Customer Group said they were concerned the proposed increase in the lateral's capacity may ""adversely affect"" them and other customers because capacity on the South Mainline would be needed to move the additional export load. FERC ""should not approve increased export capacity without a corresponding increase in mainline capacity"" on El Paso's system, they said. 
Southwest and the municipal distributors urged the Commission to either: 1) reject the El Paso application outright; 2) in the alternative, set the case for hearing to assess the impact on existing customers; or 3) absent rejection or hearing, defer consideration of the application until other pending cases related to the level of capacity on El Paso are resolved. 
In its application, El Paso asked FERC for the go-ahead to increase the maximum daily export capacity on the lateral by about one-third to 308 MMcf/d to correspond with the ""rapid development"" of the gas infrastructure in the northern Mexico state of Chihuahua. It said it already had entered into a long-term agreement for the entire proposed increase of 100 MMcf/d of export capacity with MGI Supply Ltd (See Daily GPI, Aug. 31 <d20010831e.html>). "

Barry - For your cost center, I increased travel by $25k and Conferences & Training by $2,697.  I didn't make any other changes to Mark's.  

These two files show the detail.

  

This file shows the combined plan for West Origination.  The ""Income Statement"" tab is what will be presented to Office of the Chair.

 

Let me know if you need anything else.

Barry, I understand you have some reservations about my involvement with L-P's request for assistance to financially hedge their natural gas exposure.  I have no problem working with Dave Fuller as I did regarding another entity or with whomever from your group regarding this matter, as long as I am financially rewarded for my time and efforts.  As you will see for the attached letter from L-P, I have put a great deal of time and effort into positioning Enron as L-P's preferred ESP to the point of being asked to join their internal energy team.  If you would please advice me how you'd like to proceed and we'll take it from there.  Thanks,  John

In consideration of the sensitivities regarding this asset and ENA's efforts to manage this risk. I believe we need to formalize and coordinate any external communication with El Paso.

Please advise by name who your lead contact is or would be and what the general purpose of the conversations is concerning.  If you do not have a primary contact or do not talk directly to the pipeline, pls advise. 

thanks, BT

PG&E restructuring bid draws state ire 
By Dale Kasler and Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writers 
(Published Sept. 21, 2001)

In a controversial attempt to dig its way out of bankruptcy, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. proposed a radical restructuring Thursday that would pay off its debts but end state regulation of the utility's valuable hydroelectric and nuclear plants. 
To make the plan work, PG&E asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to override state laws and regulations governing power-plant ownership -- a request that triggered immediate opposition from California officials. 
PG&E said the plan, a complicated blend of asset transfers, debt refinancing and corporate spinoffs, would restore the utility's financial health and creditworthiness without requiring additional rate hikes or a state ""bailout."" Divorcing the utility from its parent company, the plan would pay off the entire $13.2 billion of debt PG&E accumulated during California's poorly executed era of deregulation. 
The plan, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco, had the support of a key block of creditors, including independent energy generators, whose approval is necessary to any reorganization plan. 
But it ran into immediate opposition from Gov. Gray Davis and other state officials, setting up a potentially fierce battle. Despite PG&E's claims to the contrary, they warned the plan could trigger more hikes because PG&E could charge nearly double the amount it currently charges for electricity from the hydro and nuclear plants. The proposal would have the state Public Utilities Commission relinquish control over those plants to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
FERC ""has proven over the last 18 months to be ... no friend of the ratepayer,"" Davis told reporters Thursday. ""The PUC, while far from perfect, has been a stronger advocate for ratepayers than the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ... I'm very wary of PG&E's proposal to transfer all of its generating capacity from a regulated environment to a non-regulated environment."" 
The PUC vowed to fight the plan in court. ""I don't think the judge is going to do it,"" said PUC President Loretta Lynch. 
Consumer advocates noted that PG&E has been pushing for years to end state regulation of its hydro plants. ""It's complete piracy,"" said Nettie Hoge, head of The Utility Reform Network of San Francisco. ""It's the most audacious thing I've ever seen."" 
Filed six months after the utility sought bankruptcy protection, the plan calls for PG&E to be spun off from PG&E Corp., but the utility would transfer its hydro and nuclear plants and some other assets to the parent. 
That would violate a state law, passed as a response to the energy crisis, prohibiting utilities from selling any of their generating plants before 2006. The law was intended to keep electricity in California hands at a time when out-of-state generators were charging ultra-high prices to PG&E and Southern California Edison. 
PG&E acknowledged the conflict with state law but said it will ask the bankruptcy court -- a federal entity -- to override the state law. Legal experts said it's not clear whether a bankruptcy judge would ignore state law, and in prior rulings U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali has sided with state officials. 
""Any federal court would be very reluctant to go in and override state laws,"" said influential state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, chair of the Senate Energy Committee. 
Robert D. Glynn Jr., PG&E's chairman, called the transfer a good deal for customers. He said the electricity from those plants would be sold back to the utility at about $50 a megawatt hour -- ""the lower end"" of current rates -- under a 12-year contract. 
But that's almost double the existing rates for those plants, critics said. 
And Gary Cohen, the PUC's general counsel, said the company would be free to charge market rates when the contract runs out, putting utility customers at the mercy of an independent, unregulated generator. 
""This is more of what got us into this mess to begin with,"" Cohen said. 
Despite the friction between PG&E and the state, the plan requires assurance from the PUC that the utility will be allowed to collect its wholesale power costs in the future from ratepayers, regardless of how high they go. Such assurance will make the utility creditworthy again and able to borrow money to fund the reorganization, PG&E said. 
The plan also requires approval from federal officials and a ""yes"" vote from a majority of PG&E's creditors, along with Montali. 
Glynn said the plan could be completed by December 2002, enabling the utility to resume buying electricity. The state has been buying power for PG&E since January, when it became insolvent. 
While the PUC raised rates an average of 40 percent this year, the reorganization plan doesn't require another rate hike, Glynn insisted. ""From the customers' view, this transaction will be seamless,"" he said. The same should be true for most employees, he said. 
The PG&E chairman, whose company has feuded with Davis for months, also boasted that PG&E isn't ""asking the state for a bailout or a rescue"" -- a jab at Davis' as-yet-unsuccessful effort to sell the Legislature on a multibillion-dollar rescue for Edison. 
It's unclear what impact PG&E's proposal would have on Edison's attempt to avoid bankruptcy. Edison's creditors, already angered that the Legislature adjourned without passing the Davis-backed plan, might conclude that Edison is better off in bankruptcy and could push the Southern California utility into court, analysts said. 
The PG&E proposal involves a complicated series of property transfers and bond offerings that would leave the current PG&E Corp. split into two separate, publicly-traded companies. 
The utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric, would become strictly a retailer and would sell other assets -- including its hydro and nuclear plants, transmission wires and gas pipelines -- to PG&E Corp. for $4.06 billion in cash and IOUs. PG&E Corp. shareholders would receive stock in the slimmed-down utility, although the details of the stock transaction haven't been worked out. 
The bankruptcy proposal represents the fourth time in three years that PG&E has tried to remove its hydro plants from state control. The PUC and Legislature have resisted because of potential impacts on costs and the environment. 
Despite the criticism, PG&E said removing those assets from regulators' oversight is essential to making the plan work. Why? Because PUC rules limit how much money the utility can borrow against those assets, said utility spokesman Ron Low. If the assets became property of PG&E Corp., the corporation could borrow a lot more money and use the proceeds to pay its debts. Glynn said he's had ""in-depth discussions"" with investment bankers about issuing new bonds. 
Also, by removing the generating plants from PUC oversight, the plan can produce more cash for debt repayment, said credit analyst David Bodek of Standard & Poor's Corp. in New York. 
If state officials fight the plan, ""the question arises, 'How do you discharge these (debts)?' "" Bodek said. ""Here's a plan that does that."" 
The plan would pay creditors $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in bonds. Creditors with debts of more than $100,000 would get 60 percent in cash and 40 percent in bonds, which will be paid in 10 or more years, said Paul Aronzon, attorney for a committee of unsecured creditors. 
""There's some credibility here, and it works,"" Aronzon said of the plan. 
Gary Ackerman, a spokesman for independent generators, said his group would probably accept the plan, even if it means they have to wait years to get some of their money. 
Shareholders also endorsed the plan. PG&E Corp.'s stock jumped $1.22, to $15.72, on a day when the markets took another bad fall"

Bill -

I have attached a breakdown of our gas inventories by location.  The valuations have not been updated to take into account the downward move in gas prices.  

When we meet with you here in Purchase we would like to this to be one of the topics of discussion.  If you need any additional information (or more detail), please let me know asap.

Jeff, did Mark H. sign off on us removing triangular set-off between affiliated entities.  We have removed the concept as instructed by Barry, but do not want to send to PG&E unless we have Mark's OK.

Also, Eric/Barry you were going to canvass Bill in terms of what he would require for Credit.

Peter.

We have 200,000 mmbtu/day of ""Block II"" capacity available through May 31, 2006. It is labeled ""Block II"" because PG&E owns recall rights on the entire block through 12/31/2005.  The ROFR rights that go with this capacity add a tremendous amount of value (i.e. market rates with short term commitment vs. 15 - 20 year obligation of new build)

Capacity currently has access to all supply basins. However, the current FERC proceedings on receipt point reallocations will probably result in a supply split of 60% San Juan and 40% Permian. 

Rates for the capacity and my Duke proposal are attached.

Please call if you have any questions.

In furtherance of discussions between our commercial counterparts (Barry Tycholiz, Eric Le Dain and Ray Welch) and our meeting tentatively scheduled for next week, we have made certain anticipatory revisions to the agreement reflected in the document attached entitled the ""Comprehensive Blackline"". 

We also attach a blackline of the agreement which separately indicates these most recent changes (as compared to the version which we sent to you on July 3, 2001)(the ""Incremental Blackline"").

The Incremental Blackline includes a number of changes which address concerns communicated by Ray Welch.  Most importantly, we have removed the concept of set-off of obligations of the affiliates of non-defaulting parties.  We have also reinserted the concept of ""Interruptible"" transactions; however, we have clarified that ""Baseload Gas"", ""Multi-Month Gas"" and ""Swing Gas"" transactions shall be firm.

In addition to the foregoing, we have proposed a number of other amendments which help clarify the representations, obligations and transacting procedures under the agreement.  For example, we have distinguished payment defaults from other failures as events constituting ""Defaults"".

Similarly, we have amended the confirmation procedures of Article 2 to clarify the mechanics of transacting.  As you saw in our previous comments, Enron Canada wants to clarify that, although the practice is to always send a Confirmation Notice, a transaction is not dependent on a Confirmation Notice.  In addition, the Incremental Blackline includes amendments which eliminate the potential confusion/uncertainty which would arise in the event that Confirmation Notices were issued by both parties.  Section 2.4 has been amended such that only one party confirms the transactions.  In this case, because Enron Canada will be issuing the Confirmation Notices for all Enron Online transactions, we have inserted Enron Canada as the party to issue the Confirmation Notice for all transactions, subject to a three business day review period. 

Should you have any questions or concerns relating to our proposed changes prior to the meeting, please give me a call.  You can reach me directly at (403) 974-6708.

Regards,

Mark Powell

The overview last week was great.  Are you going to have Phil put together a graph of all expansions?  That would be a nice visual for the desk.
 
Thanks,
Mike

Mike, here is a very brief overview of planned or approved expansions by major pipeline.  There is a lot of detail that supports each of these pipe expansions including, proposed start dates, delivery points, probability etc... 

Let's discuss needs... 

Perhaps, we can give your group a general overview on expansions in the west, current status etc.

Hi Barry,

I have sent to you in the mail an article regarding the situation with your
stock account at TD.  Our best advice is to probably close out the account
per TD and do online trading, if that suits you, or move the funds to the
US.

Re the cottage in Riding Mountain - go ahead.  Two things:  it isn't
useable in the winter, so it's not available for your use and the second
thing is that you are going to be purchasing it AFTER you've become a
non-resident.

Amex Card - probably isn't a huge issue to use the Canadian one, but it is
a tie.

Please call with any further enquiries or for clarification.

Best regards,

Barry,

Interstate Gas Services, on behalf of the DWR, will be soliciting bids for
gas supply.  We are currently contemplating limited gas purchases, and would
like to get a GISB in place.  We would like to do a quick follow up in
regards to the status of the GISB contract between yourselves and the
Department of Water Resources.  If your legal department has any questions
or concerns, please contact Mark Baldwin of Interstate Gas Services at
925-243-0350.

To address any credit concerns you may have, the department is currently
preparing a complete credit package which we will forward to you upon its
completion.

Again, please do not hesitate to call.

Thank You,

Mark,

Rate case settlements reached between a pipeline, its customers and Commiss=
ion Staff sometime prescribes the treatment of gains on the sale of assets =
and specifically the sale of base gas volumes (eg Columbia, CNG settlements=
).  In review of the past two rate case settlements of Williston Basin (WBI=
) I found no such provisions.  In its current rate case proceeding before F=
ERC a limited settlement was reached which dealt primarily with net plant a=
nd labor costs.  A hearing was held on all remaining issues and is currentl=
y in the briefing stage.  Neither in the limited settlement, nor in the hea=
ring was disposition of base gas revenues addressed.

However, the reorganizational settlement that conveyed facilities from MDU =
to WBI may be a factor.  As a result of restructuring under 636 WBI was obl=
igated to sell certain excess volumes of company owned working gas (priced =
at $.47 /mcf) to its customers.  WBI proposed to sell the gas at market and=
 retain any profits.  As mentioned in the LeBeoeuf, Lamb memo the Commissio=
n addressed this issues several times, reversing itself in the process, and=
 finally ordered that WBI must sell the working gas at cost.  Though not re=
lying entirely on the reorganizational settlement, throughout the various o=
rders, the Commission referenced the 1985 reorganizational settlement as re=
quiring any gains on the sale of working gas to be flowed through to WBI cu=
stomers.  WBI sought rehearing, arguing that the Commission was taking a ve=
ry broad interpretation of the settlement.  The Commission raised the issue=
 again in its order on rehearing, among other things, and WBI didn't seek r=
ehearing or pursue that particular argument further, which the Commission p=
oints out in its final order.

As LeBeoeuf Lamb asserts, the environment (Order 636 restructuring) in whic=
h the Commission ordered flow-through of profits on the sale of storage vol=
umes has changed and those arguments may not be applicable anymore.  But, t=
he reorganizational settlement might be something to take into account and =
should be discussed with WBI.  Just something to be aware of.

If you have any questions please call.

Robert

Subject:	Fantastic Friday/Super Saturday Interviewers

As you all know, the recruiting season is in full swing and the AA Program's recruiters are hitting campus as we speak.  One of the most important parts of the process and a key to Enron's future success are the Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday interview dates where we make the selections on those candidates who will receive offers from Enron for the 2002 recruiting class.  It is important that these candidates be interviewed by business leaders from each business unit and specifically those who utilize AA pool members.  Our goal is for each business unit to identify a core group of interviewers for each of the four interview weekends which will be held as follows:

		Dates						Total Number of Interviewers Needed**

October 25-26           Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview        
November 2 -4 -        Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview		
November 15-16        Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview
November 30-Dec 1   Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview

I have attached a list of those individuals in various business units that have participated in the interview process in the past for your review (as a sample of the type of individual we are looking for as interviewers).  Please provide me a list of your business unit's interviewers by date by Friday, October 5.  Individuals are encouraged to interview more than one selected date and we will forward details to them at least a week prior to the interview date.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.  Thanks again for all your help.  Ted and Traci

 
**  We do not expect you to provide all the interviewers.  This number reflects to total needed from all business units and will include those needed for both the evening and interview days..

Hey Paul----I did get together with Barry Tycholiz this afternoon when I was in Houston to review the matrix that we have on price risk management initiatives and current practice at the state PUCs in the west.  As you know, the matrix is a starting point, and I encouraged Barry to take a stronger look at his opportunities in each state and that we would do further spade work in those states as he identifies his prospects.  We talked about 3 states that he has initial interest in--- California (Barry is already talking to Dasovich and I will touch base with Jeff tomorrow to follow up), Colorado and Nevada.  

I will be reviewing the proposed rulemaking in Colorado in the next few days and will send Barry and Mark Whitt an outline of what the issues boil down to so that we can have a discussion on how active/what strategy we might want us to pursue at the PUC.  As you will recall, we have the opportunity to submit comments until the end of October. While the appetite for taking sustantive action on PRM in at the Commision is limited (only the Chair has a strong interest--his other two commissioners are skeptical and the primary staff person has been quite negative), Barry is not adverse to considering a long shot position.

Although we didn't get into alot of detail on Nevada, Barry is in discussions with Sierra on gas supply and I indicated that you had past experience and ongoing relationships with both the Nevada commission and Sierra and could be a great resource for him.  Could you please give him a call (#713-853-1587) when you get a chance.  Thanks!  

I think you're in meetings most of the day tomorrow, but if you get a chance, catch up with me. I am back in Minnesota.

Eva, I was talking to Jean the other day and she has advised me that you will be working in the Producer One group.  I would like to talk to you about some of the things you worked on this year as they relate to storage development etc... 

Can you contact me early next week to get together for 1/2 hour.

Thanks in advance.

The Origination Track manual is being drafted by Tom Wilbeck and Ted Bland in HR. We should have a copy to circulate for your comments shortly.

1) Attached is a list of potential Origination Track candidates. These are analysts and associates ranked 1, 2 or 3 who have had at least one rotation in a relevant area. These are people who could be interviewed by us to determine if they would be a good fit for the track. Please have a look at the list. If you spot any errors or omissions, please let me know.

 
2) There are an additional 30 analysts and associates who have relevant rotations, but who have not yet been ranked. Any who rank 1-3 could be additional candidates for us to interview.

3) In addition, any analyst - 2 or associate - 1's who rank 1-3 could be candidates for the track. I will forward this list when received from HR.

I will forward lists #2 and #3 once I have the info.

Dave

Timely note, and once again I am already hard at work prospecting for you up here.
They are getting ready to drill CBM this fall. I've been meeting with them on this and actually set them up to do a deal with ATS on production/revenue/lease acctg in the US (next mtg Oct 9 in Calgary).  I gave them a presentation a few weeks ago on the general things we and ATS can do for them in Denver/Dallas.  I want to send them something more specific about all we can do in the Rockies on the gas mktg side.  I'll also build in some data on Hanover for them so will draw that from Producer One.
Can I get some general slides about all the good things Mark and the gang do in Denver.
Timing is next few days.  I'd like to get this to them by sometime Friday if possible (not the end of the world if it's early next week). 
Thanks.

Mara, 

Attached is the spreadsheet for billing Palo Alto.  I think that everything we need for billing purposes is there, we just need to improve it and make it user friendly.  We will provide this spreadsheet to accounting by the 10th of each month for the previous flow month. therefore, once we get August done, we will need to work on September.  Once you've had a chance to look at it, we can discuss.  Also, I have a notebook at my desk that details everything about Palo Alto.  

Thanks,

Kim

Are you having any further luck on a counterparty for this IT from Williston/Rockies.
The PG&E legal guy is out this weeek!  Powell has had a call in since last week - no answer.  Perhaps they could have told us...  I waited for that contact before calling Ray.  Let you know.

What's the view on Nymex that you're getting down there - one month, winter, summer.   Thanks.

Don,

Attached is a request for a gas proposal for a retail customer in California.  Now that Roger Ponce is gone, and I am unable to get in touch with Derick Kelley, I no longer have a contact at EES to send these potential customers to.  Can you tell me who is handling retail customers in the West, particularly California?

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Mark/Barry--- I finally had a chance to look this week at the Colorado PUC proposed rulemaking amendments regarding price risk management (PRM) for gas utilities.  As we had generally talked about, the appetite for meaningful change to the PUCs rules has been pretty weak by staff and to a great extent by the Commissioners themselves.  These proposed rules reflect some movement toward encouraging utilties to implement PRM, but does NOT require them to implement, nor is there a clear statement that the PUC will allow recovery of costs.  Here's a short list of what's in the rules:

	> costs related to prm may be allowed, and new language is added to better define the standard of review as ""whether the utility action was reasonable in light of the information known, or should have been known, at the time of action or inaction"".    

	> in the utility's annual Gas PUrchase Plan they must include an exhibit that describes and analyzes the steps the utility has taken to reduce gas price volatility.  It appears to be an informational filing only, but clearly signals that the PUC expects them to take some action or explain why they didn't. 

	> the utility's actual portfolio purchases, included in the costs of purchasing risk managment products,  need to be included in a Gas Purchase Report to be filed annually. This report presumably is the document that the PUC will then use to determine reasonableness of gas cost pass thru.


There are numerous areas that we could comment on in this proposed rulemaking---anywhere from pushing them to be more explicit in advocating that the utility must do prm and that they will recover the costs, to something along the line of turning over their gas supply portfolio to a company that can more effectively manage it.  There is a hearing scheduled for November 1 in Denver, with comments due on or before October 21.  

We would be happy to intervene and file comments in the proceeding and work the issue if you guys would like us to. Might be kind of fun to tweak our friends at Xcel just a bit! Is there a time on Monday Oct 8 or Tuesday Oct 9 that we could talk via phone to determine your level of interest?  I am available mid day on Monday (between 10 and 2:30 central) or Tuesday anytime up until about 3:30.  Please let me know via return e mail or give me a call   #612-339-4599"

As could be expected PSCO has finally implemented PRM this year and did a great job of ""buying the high'.  Now the rate payers will have lower prices than last year but probably twice as high as they should be.  I would definitely like to discuss it with you.  How about 1:30 central on the 8th?

One of the guys here recieved a call from a guy at EES looking for contacts at gas utilities in the Northwest.  They are hoping to sell them some sort of deal where they provide the utility structured products and the utility pushes them through to the endusers... isn't that my Cascade deal?  Let's discuss Monday, it sounds like something we need to nip in the bud."

FYI.  Appears that the two sides may be crawling toward renegotiation. 

Best, 
Jeff 

Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01 
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 

This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 

In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 

Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 

But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 

As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 

Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 

Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 

Duress alleged 
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 

""We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically,"" said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. ""We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal."" 

Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 

Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 

""The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts,"" Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 

""Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts,"" Shames said. 

Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 

Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 

He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
""To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster,"" said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. ""There were other means to manage the emergency."" 

The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
""First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms,"" said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.

Willingness to deal 
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 

The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are ""just and reasonable."" FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 

Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 

For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
""In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so,"" said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. ""We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone."" 

Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 

Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
""The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market,"" said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 

The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 

Sempra says contract fair 
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 

San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 

Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 

""It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' "" Niggli said. 
But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 

White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
""There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to,"" White said. ""The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 

""But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?"" 
***************************************************************** 
State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
OC Register, 10.07.01 
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 

Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 

The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 

Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 

""We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 

A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 

In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 

Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. ""The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. 

Said Freeman: ""We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks."" 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 

Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 

The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called ""peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 

The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 

Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 

""I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 

Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 

Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 

Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 

""I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 

The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 

The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
""It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But ""it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 

Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 

Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
""The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. ""Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''"

I see how you are doing this.  You are using some early estimates of fuel I
gave you.  You know you should not trust me.  We have some better numbers
now.  It turns out that our average fuel usage rate for calendar 2000 was
.0044 % per pipeline mile.  Stretching this out over 612 miles, KG to Malin
yields a rate of 2.69%.  This is just one place to start when examining the
impact of the expansion.  The modeling of the expansion yields an
incremental rate for the 200,000 mcfd of 7.46%.  If you combine those on a
weighted average you will get 3.24%.  The quantities at KG are significantly
higher than in your estimate.  Regardless, these are the numbers we are
currently predicting.  The actuals will be different and perhaps lower as
the operators optimize the system performance.  Who knows.  Also we are
predicting that the pipeline looping will be constructed in advance and put
into service ahead of the compression.  So on a long term basis (like the
first year) the fuel rate will decrease due to the  looping.

I had promised that I would send my fuel calculation over! Please check on
this:

Current fuel (king to malin) = 2,200,000 mmbtu/d*.03 = 66,000 mmbtu

Proposed fuel = 2,400,000 mmbtu/d*.036 = 86,400 mmbtu

Difference = 20,400/200,000 incremental capacity = 10.2%

Please advise!!

Craver will head up any of these specific deals that Edison enters into.  I've known Fielder for a long time (very much the company guy, but pretty easy to work with).  I've met Craver, but don't know him as well as Fielder.  Won't be a stretch to get a meeting with Craver if we choose to do it.  Edison is the counterparty.  Regarding the credit issue, in addition to Edison, we should also view the California PUC as a ""co-counterparty"" to just about anything Edison does over the next 24 months or so.

Jeff, I was talking to Mike Etringer yesterday regarding this subject and he gave me the name of the CFO Ted Craver. I understand that you guys were dealing with John Fielder.  
 
For sure we want to know what they are up to.  I think like all deals in California we are going to run into issues with credit, and probably paper but that would pretty much depend on the counterparty. ( is it edison), or DWR? 
 
It is VERY important that trading and marketing are aware of the hedging activities in a very timely fashion so however we need to ensure that happens will be my plan. 
 
Do you know the CFO ?

Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.  Please could you ensure the numbers are both;

(i) Correct, and 
(ii) Correctly allocated

Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.   These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.   If you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from Faith.

Please send all alterations to Faith Killen or call her on 30352.

Thanks

Barry,

I would rather not get into the habit of locking in curves before the deal is officially closed (signed).  Can we just agree on a sharing policy, so that we may avoid the event underlined below.  I would like to consider the curves floating until it is booked.  We are all sharing the risk of Huber not signing.

Thanks,
Mike

Further to our conversation please find attached the curves on the JM Huber transaction that we have agreed to work off of. The 30,000/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with HUBER is effectively completed. In the event that this deal does not close, then the West desk will resume with the same MTM risks that you presently have.  

Any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk... plus ENA Orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals. 

In addition to the transportation income being generated, additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks. I believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book ( by Mark Whitt ) and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly.

I trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and I am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone..

Pls review file and if there are any questions give me a call.

BT

Dave, I will provide as much detail as possible but may not have all the detail that you are requesting below.  I think that a history of the general activity will help identify the problem and/or potential problem.

ENA East Gas has been working with all of the major Northeast clients (New Jersey Natural, PSE&G, NUI, South Jersey, KeySpan etc.) on gas products and services.  EES has requested that the Regulatory Affairs group use their contacts with those clients to get EES in to meet with Sr. Management.  These are ENA's primary target markets.
The West and Central groups within ENA have witnessed the same encroachment with EES requesting wholesale customer lists and contacts.
Texas has bumped into EES more in the industrial sector then in the LDC/IOU client base.
EES Product Approach - As I understand it EES is proposing to support regulatory changes (where needed) that would allow the wholesale entity to provide market based products and services to retail clients in exchange for EES being the exclusive provider of such product/service to the wholesale entity for redelivery to the retail entity.  To date, I am not aware of any actual proposals that have been provided.  However, as you can see the approach creates confusion for our customers.

I would like to confirm EES's product/service offering and determine from them if they are directly approaching our wholesale customers.

Frank

Frank,

Thanks for offering to help assembling this info.

If you could include the following in your list, that would be great (and consistent with what we are pulling together for Power):

Company
Timeframe (when contact occurred)
ENA Rep (in case we need to follow up for further details)
Notes ( a few words description of issue)

I'd like to keep this confidential, but someone inside PG&E's gas group (for what it's worth) told me that participants will have a choice under PG&E's proposed extension of its Gas Accord.  Either the participant can retain the capacity for the term of the extension (less the cost escalators in the original deal) or release the capacity back to PG&E with no penalty.  I'll try to confirm that this is the view among most in PG&E.

Best,

24,500*4.2%= 1,029 mmbtu

24,500+1,025 = 25,529 mmbtu

25,529 *95.8% = 24,457 SHORT GAS!


Correct method:

24,500/95.8% = 25,574 mmbtu

Barry,

The rate plan all of you are on is 89.99 for 650 nationwide anytime minutes.

Name	Monthly Average of Minutes	Suggestions	
Barry Tycholiz	450	Lower rate plan to 69.99 (550 minutes)	
Kim Ward 	650	Keep rate plan	
Stephanie Miller	300	Lower rate plan to 49.99 (350 minutes)	

RATE PLANS	
$ 29.99	$ 39.99	$ 49.99	$ 69.99	$ 99.99	$ 149.99	$ 199.99	
100 min.	175 min.	350 min.	550 min.	900 min.	1500 min.	2000 min	

Any extra charges you see on the bill, doesn't mean they are getting charged for roaming/long distance.  They most likely include:  411 calls, accessories, or exceeding minutes.

I will get back to you with how much is being spent in Denver.

Jessica

Jessica, it appears that we pay a monthly fee of $ 89.99 / mth plus monthly optional charges and all long distance and local charges.  I would like to discuss the details of a bill. What is this base fee, are there other plans available? Are we getting any value in using cingular ( especially this plan). How many minutes are we getting what are the  long distance and roaming rates? 

In aggregate, my monthly cell phone bill for my group looks to be around $1,400 - $ 2,000/mth for 7 people total and this is a little high. 

Also, pls verify who has cell phones in Denver and what the monthly bills look like for this office.

Thanks, BT

with you and assisting your efforts in maximizing customer satisfaction and
delight.  We believe that meeting customer needs, and exceeding expectations
is not only one of the most important business processes, but also builds
loyalty and increases profits.

We would be delighted to have you subscribe to the 2001 multi-client Natural
Gas Marketer Customer Satisfaction Study.
The main benefit of Mastio's multi-client report is, not only will you be
able to discover what customers think of you on 30+ customer service
attributes, you will also learn what customers think of 45+ other gas
marketers, as well.  This study will be an excellent tool if you want to
maximize & improve customer satisfaction, measure & plot progress for
improving customer service, benchmark yourself against competitors, retain &
find new customers and build customer loyalty.
Mastio & Company is convinced you would reap substantial benefits by
discovering your perceived level of customer satisfaction.  As in other
highly competitive industries, natural gas marketers are discovering that
ignoring customer dissatisfaction can be a crucial mistake. The bottom line
is, superior customer service is a given these days, not a difference.
Customers now take superior customer service for granted. Customers are
raising their expectations. Leading companies are responding to this trend
by instituting customer service initiatives and measuring their progress,
versus customer needs and their competition.
Customer satisfaction matters with winning companies, especially for
companies interested in profitable growth.  These leading companies have
actually moved customer satisfaction from a slogan to reality.  They have
made a commitment to value and are realizing superior growth and
profitability because their business strategies focus on enhancing the value
of what they offer customers.
I would like to further point out that our report comes with an electronic
version.  The electronic version allows the segmentation of all the
respondents by state, volume, and customer-type, switching status, head to
head comparisons with competitors, etc. The software can be installed on
your network and up to 50 people can query the software at the same time.
The biggest advantage is the custom tagging feature.  This feature allows
the grouping of your customers, for example, by the key person responsible
for interaction, customer service teams by name, territory, profitability,
strategic importance, etc.  The options are unlimited.  This powerful tool
will empower people to do additional analysis on their own.  They will take
ownership, because the analysis of the data is personalized.

In closing, Mastio & Company would welcome the opportunity to deliver you
actionable information when you are ready.

Sincerely,
MASTIO & COMPANY

Hi Dave,

As we've been running our numbers on this proposal, I was curious if your
offer of $13MM factors in any kind of tax make-up for the up-front payment?
I'm continuing to try to identify where we have differences in value so we
can discuss further tomorrow.  By the way, I think there will be 3 to 4 of
us tomorrow:

Myself
Tim Miller - Origination (Southwest)
Bill Burden - Business Development Gas and Power
Kim Colburn - Business Development Gas and Power

Give me a call and we can set up a place to meet in front of the restaurant
- they won't seat anyone until everyone is there anyway.

Penny,

We do not have a hard deadline for placing this capacity, however, some
of it has already been spoken for.   We could do something as early as
Nov 01 but I understand that may be a bit aggressive.  Our offer
currently stands at about $13MM for 100,000/day, Nov 01 - May 06.  We
will look to you to take on the obligation for that payment or make us a
counter offer.  We would be happy to sit down with you as early as next
week to work through any questions or issues.  I hope that answers your
question, please let me know if it doesn't.

Dave

PS - I'll be in Houston next week if a meeting would be useful.

Dave,

Just wanted to clarify what kind of deadline your aiming for with this
transport proposal.  The reason I am asking is I have taken this to the
next
level and we will probably need several days to run through our internal
processes.  I know you are working with multiple parties so if you let
me
know how you would like to proceed then we can be working on a similar
timeline. 

Thanks,  Penny

Hey Penny,

One more thought on the EPNG capacity valuation we've been discussing...
physical gas in the San Juan is selling at a discount to index,
therefore we are incorporating that into our valuation.  I thought you
might want to consider that as well. 

Thanks,

Dave Fuller

The list is based on priority.  We would be willing to cover them for their West Gas business only.  Fred could continue to cover their East, Central and Oil/Liquids business.

The state treasurer sent a letter this afternoon to Loretta Lynch.
The treasurer claims in the letter that, by extending DA  through Sept. 20th, the PUC could have shifted more than $8 billion to small customers.
He urges Lynch to immediately roll back the date to July 1.
We have started working with large customers to refute the letter.
If you would like a copy of the letter, please send your fax number to Joseph Alamo.

Best,

Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.


OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

Barry,
Sorry for not getting back to you. The Power MTM positions are approx $570,000 and all related to physical positions with a total Net Power  position of approx $1.2MM. I have been working with Beverly Ikeda of Puget on the issues and so far so good. Puget is going to deliver a $10MM  Letter of Credit to cover the financial positions. From our conversations, her traders do not anticipate hedging any further and really only need access to short term EOL business. In addition, she and I discussed the needs of bilateral contracts with margining rights to prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future. 

Thanks,
-D

Stephanie:

I attach a copy of the presentation we gave to Eric Gonzales last week.  Based on our analysis and the information we received from yourself and gas traders here and in Portland, we made certain assumptions about how the NW Pipeline system works.  During our planned meeting on Friday (we will learn for sure whether the meeting is taking place only on Wednesday -- Kirk Morgan will be reporting for jury duty that day and will let us know whether he's released or not), we wanted to confirm that our conclusions are correct, whether the LNG terminal idea is completely crazy and whether there are any synergies that we may get from working with NW P/L and/or Williams on LNG terminal development.

Please let me know what you think,

Z

All,

Further to your recent discussions surrounding the ENA Origination Track I will shortly be scheduling an interview date for you to interview recommended candidates.    You have already received the attached list of suggested candidates and as I understand it you have no comments on these individuals thus far.   

In order to match the success of the ENA Trading Track it requires your 100% commitment and participation in the following areas:

1.	Interviewing
2.	Training
3.	Mentoring
4.	Promotion of the Track

I will contact each supervisor of the attached list of candidates to gain further feedback on these candidates, prior to contacting them, and ensure their respective buy-in.

 
If you have any questions please call me.

I look forward to working with you on this Track.

Kind regards,

Karen Buckley

I was in Mexico City... for school

What has happened to your stock price.... you will have to work for many
more years.  

What is the hedging loss about that I saw reported? 

When are you coming to cowtown and have time for a quick visit?

Where were you flying to?  

I turned 39 yesterday... that sucks....

Kim has worked one 8 hour shift in a year... not exactly pounding the
hours and the way the stock is going she might need to put together a
few more shifts than that.

How much longer for school for you? ... I know you will do fine!!

All in all things are going pretty good, work is OK, pretty busy myself.


What have you guys been up to? Traveling sure sucks now...  How is Bryn?


Are there anymore Canadian E&P Co.'s left... it seems like they have all
been bought up by U.S. Kids?.. how is the House? 

I noticed Anandarko... wrote down $ 464 MM because of their Canadian
assets... could that be the Berkley indigestion? 

I better run.. come and visit me soon.. but let's talk sooner.

best regards,

BT

FERC today issued an Initial Decision in the hearing in the Transwestern case concerning several negotiated rate agreements to which Indicated Shippers and the CPUC had raised objections.  Briefly, the Judge ruled that Transwestern had not exercised market power and that the capacity was advertised and awarded in accordance with Transwestern's tariff.  However, Transwestern must modify its tariff to add a separate provision where all the posting, bidding and award procedures for purposes of awarding capacity are clearly stated.  A highlighted copy of the ruling is attached for your information.

FERC today issued Draft Orders denying rehearing in the following:

Kern River, CP01-31 (2002 Expansion Project)
Rejected arguments of the Firm Customers that the project should not have been approved or, alternatively, the rights of the expansion shippers at Wheeler Ridge should be subordinate to those of the existing shippers.

PG&E Gas Transmission, NW, CP01-141 (2001 Expansion)
Rejected Newport Northwest LLC's assertion that requiring the expansion shippers to pay a fuel cost surcharge to recover any incremental fuel costs due to the additional compression approved for this project is contrary to FERC precedent and the policy statement on expansion facilities.

These orders should be issued within the next few days, and we will circulate copies.  Let Melinda know if you want to see the draft copies before then (they are not available electronically)."

FYI. The California AG has announced that he is investigating conflict of interest charges against consultants who were involved with arranging DWR's long term power contracts. May be part of Davis' attempt to ""re-negotiate"" the contracts.  There's been some assertions that, under California law, any contracts negotiated by consultants with financial conflict of interests must be nullified."

Subject:	LADWP Gas Contract


Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

Contract.doc)

Baldwin's traveling--meeting with DWR today.  But he knows we want to meet and knows the days we're talking about--left a message with his secretary.  I suspect that, if DWR is free on either Monday or Tuesday, we'll be meeting.

Followed up with Fielder this morning.  He's at an off-site all day and is supposed to call me back COB today.  He knows we want to meet with Craver and offered to set it up.  If he hasn't got it scheduled when I talk to him, I'll go directly to Craver.  I'll hopefully have things more set in stone by end of today or tomorrow by noon.

That work?

Best,
Jeff

Jim:

As we have discussed, ENA is trying to close a gas supply transaction with Citizens Gas in Arizona to provide gas supply to Citizens for ultimate delivery to PP&L for the Griffith power plant.  As part of this transaction, Enron Asset Management Resources (EAMR) would provide services to operate a pipeline that interconnects El Paso and Transwestern to the pipeline header system that ultimately interconnects with the Griffith power plant. To date, it has been the reasonable position of EAMR that its liability for services provided to Citizens should be ""capped"" at the sum of its annual fee of $144,000.  Citizens wants a $1,000,000 limit.  Citizens and EAMR have agreed to all aspects of the services deal except this liability question.  Although it might be possible to close our gas deal without EAMR, this is far from certain.  I have been trying to come up with an approach that would bridge this gap so that the ENA gas deal can be closed. 

This e-mail is intended to indicate the value of this transaction to Enron and get your viewpoint as to the feasibility and cost of one of two deal structures:

1)  ENA buys insurance to cover the cost of our buying a policy to bridge th gap in liability from $144,000 to $1,000,000.
2)  EAMR decides to increase the laibiltiy to $1,000,000 in return for increasing their earnings on the deal by the amount ENA would pay fior the insurance product - about $120,000.

ENA's preference is clearly for approach 2.

The attached spreadsheet indicates the value of this transaction to Enron.  ENA will earn approximately $3 million on the deal.  Please keep this number in confidence.  In addition, we have budgeted about $120,000 for the insurance product to increase the liability of EAMR from $140,000 to $1,000,000.

Can you please advise me as to the feasibility of 1) or 2) above?  If there is no way we are going to get there, I need to know fairly quickly so I can explore other options.  If it is possible, which of the above 2 approaches is better from you perspective?

Citizens will be here today at 3:00 pm.  I would greatly appreciate some feedback from you by that time.

To contact me please call Kim Ward at 713/853-0685 and she will be able to find me.

Thanks very much for you time.

Mark, I have reviewed resume and although Kevin may have very good trading credentials for this area I am of the opinion that he is a trader and am unclear as to his actual customer contact knowledge... I am sure he knows who they are, not sure if they know who he is other than short dated structures.

There may be a handful of small QFs which have not returned but I would say the a majority of the QFs are back on line and are being paid for what they generate on a go forward basis.  Right now the SCE QFs are negotiating with SCE on 2 major points:  when will they be paid for the outstanding receivables (est. at $1.3 B for SCE and about $1.0 B for PG&E)  and when will the 5 yr fixed price SRAC of 5.37 cents/kw apply for those that have selected this option.  Right now SCE appears to be indicating that they will be paying the receivable sometime around June/July of 2002 and that the 5.37 price would apply at that time or as much as 4 months after that.  The logic is that they are trying to indicate that the MOU, if it had been passed, would not have applied at least until that time.

Mike, have the QF's been paid for the power they were selling to the utilities.  I have not heard much about that and was wondering if these payments were all part of the Bond issue.? Are the QF's generating power today?

I spoke with Dale Sanders at Williams today.  They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work.  I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003.  I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity.  However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity.  Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality. 

Williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d.  I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d.  Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely.

If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest.  Especially on the heels of the Kern River expansion. In addition, the Cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years.

Call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments.

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PA  have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

I don't have a problem with it.  I think he would be as good or better of a trader as some of the ""kids"" I have seen down there losing $30 MM.  At least he has some concept of the physical market and how it works.  I would think to get the best value he would have to be located in Houston for that role.  Especially if Steve wants to ""pick his brains"".

Barry,

My name is Alisha Mahabir and I have been working on negotiating the MGI/ENA GISB.  I have been in contact with Lourdes Cervantes at MGI; her phone number is 525-232-5990.  There are still a few issues left to be resolved before we can proceed with the execution of this document.  Per Geral Nemec's request, I will outline these changes as they are addressed in Exhibit B to the GISB that was sent over by Lourdes.

Initially I want to note that some changes must be made to the front page of the GISB.  MGI has previously agreed to allow ENA to be the confirming party under Section 2.5.  Additionally, there have been a few problems with allowing payment to be made on the 30th day of the month.  It appears that MGI has been construing this provision broadly so as to make payment on the 2nd day of March after a short month in February.  Thus, we would like Section 7.2 to read ""30th day or, for the Month of February, on the last day of the Month"".  

As for Exhibit B, the changes are as follows:

#4 The words ""or interruptible"" should be deleted from this provision.  The interruptible language conflicts with the ability to do 30 day firm deals under this contract.

#11 This provision deals with when notices are deemed received.  The provision as written provides that notice by first class mail is deemed received 2 business days after mailing.  MGI would like to change this to allow for receipt to mean actual receipt.  Lourdes told me that she will check to see whether the change can be stricken or at least to extend 2 business days to 3 business days.

#12 (a) MGI has agreed to strike the term ""letter"" from the requirement that the Parent issue a guarantee should doubt arise as to Enron's ability to pay.  
      (b)  Originally the GISB provides that a contract can be terminated without prior notice should certain conditions be met.  MGI wants to change this to require the parties to provide 48 hours notice.  Lourdes told me that she would check to see whether this could be changed to 24 hours prior notice.

#16  The language designating ICC is acceptable, however any redundant language should be stricken.

If this memo is at all unclear, please feel free to call me.  My extension is 52722.  

Alisha Mahabir"

WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN

Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.

The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application (CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction by the following April.

Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as ""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""

Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""

To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.

""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months."" With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.

The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub."

Good morning Barry:

I am attaching a copy of my updated resume.  I am looking forward to meeting with you to discuss any possible opportunities that you may have in your group.  I began the Analyst Program in July and have been working in Generation Investments under Carl Tricoli.  The experience has been tremendous thus far.  We discovered last week that our group is being restructured and I am forced to look for re-deployment.  Thank you for time and consideration.

Barry,

Generally, the seller of an option does NOT incur taxable income on the receipt of an option premium.  Instead, the option premium is held as an ""open transaction"" (ie. no current tax consequences) until the option is exercised, sold/terminated in a closing transaction, or lapses.  Similarly, the purchaser of an option does not get an immediate tax deduction when it pays an option premium.  

The ultimate tax impact to the option seller and purchaser depends on what happens with the underlying option.  For example, if the option is exercised, then the option seller adds the option premium to the strike price to determine the total amount realized on the sale of the underlying commodity.  (This total amount realized is then used to determine whether the seller has taxable gain or loss on the underlying sale).  From the option purchaser's perspective, the option premium is added to the strike price to determine its tax basis in the underlying commodity.

In the case where the option is allowed to lapse, the option seller treats the option premium as taxable income on the date that the option lapses.  Similarly, the option purchaser takes a deduction for the option premium on the date that the option lapses.

Hopefully this gives you a little bit of an overview of the general rules governing the taxation of options.  Notwithstanding the above overview, I would still like to visit with you regarding the proposed transaction as there are certain ""exceptions"" or ""nuances"" to the general rules that could apply.  As such, once you have had a chance to review, please give me a call at ext. 3-5846 so that we can discuss further.  Thanks.

MRC

Morris... if ENA were to sell options to a third party and receive the option premium up front... for example $ 10MM $'s.... would that be considered taxable income?

We would also be buying the option from another party or hedging this structure and this cash would be used to offset future liabilities related to the deal.

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang


Registration is required for a head count.

Hey there Barry! Just wanted to drop you an note to say thanks for the
cocktails and laughs the other night in Denver. We had a great time with
you guys.

I will store your card and give you a call or drop you a note before we
come to Houston next season. Maybe you can round up some Houston buddies
that could entertain us as much as your Denver ones!

We are off to San Antonio this week with the Lakers. It is a fun town. I am
sure we will manage to find some kind of trouble to get into. Do you ever
go there? Any good restaurant recomendations? There are so many to choose
from.

Talk with you later,

Debra"

Governor wants to cut costs of power 
Tough sell for Davis as suppliers balk 
By Steve Geissinger
SACRAMENTO BUREAU 
SACRAMENTO -- With an economic ""perfect storm"" and an election looming, Gov. Gray Davis wants to renegotiate several of the state's expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians. 
But the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion, even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state. 
""If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away, ... who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any (new) contracts?"" asked Peter Cartwright, president of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., a major supplier of California power. 
And many experts and analysts are skeptical about Davis' chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state, which, in turn, supplies California customers through various utilities. 
""Good luck!"" former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governor's plan. 
Davis, however, has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly power-supply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal, political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis, the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit. 
The outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years, perhaps decades. 
""This could save billions of dollars,"" said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the consumer groups that has embraced Davis' power contract renegotiation plan. 
Barry Goode, Davis' legal affairs secretary, said the administration is ""not targeting every contract"" because the pacts have been ""extremely valuable in keeping the market stable."" 
The governor's aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies, whose contracts don't require them to reopen negotiations with the state. 
The governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year. 
The state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state's power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years. 
Though the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses. 
The long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for Davis as he heads into a re-election bid next year. 
The liability is compounded due to the pacts' potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at Stanford University termed a brewing ""perfect storm"" of fiscal calamities. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts. 
The standoff has pitted Davis and Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides against another of the state's most powerful Democrats, Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC. 
Burton has called ""for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts."" 
The deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California's future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history. 
Without the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials. 
The projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California's annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast. 
Against the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. 
But some analysts are pessimistic, like Wilson. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. 
The Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. 
""We're not going to say no. We'd certainly sit down at the table with them and say, 'Let's see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that,'"" said Calpine's Cartwright. 
If state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be ""very, very severe,"" but also ""they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them,"" Cartwright said. 
His comments coincided with reports that Calpine's third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine's performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. 
Heller, one of the state's most vocal consumer advocates, said Davis ""is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts."" 
""Last spring,"" Heller said, ""power companies had a gun to the governor's head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals."""

Subject:	EES Agreement

Earlier this week, EES (Dave Delainey and Janet Dietrich) agreed the following with ENA:

- EES will continue to approach utilities/munis to sell their ""whitepaper"" concept, but will restrict their efforts to only the following, until such time as the concept is proven or abandoned:

	- City of San Antonio
	- City of Austin
	- Brownsville Public Utility Board
	- City of Anaheim
	- Peoples
	- SMUD
	- Silicon Valley (Santa Clara)
	- City of Memphis

- EES agreed that they should not be approaching industrials which fall within the previously established ENA SIC codes and committed to reigning their people in. It was agreed that EES would work with ENA to determine if there are subgroups within the SIC codes which are too small for ENA, but which EES should be covering. Chris Calger agreed to work with EES on determining this. The SIC Code categories which ENA is responsible for are as follows (note that while the categories have been agreed, the actual code numbers are my own interpretation of the categories):

10 - Primary Metals Mining and Extraction 
13 - Oil and Gas Extraction
26 - Paper and Forest Products
5169, 2899, 5191, 5169 - Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers  (DOW Chemical)
2911 - Refining
29 - Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
30 - Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing
5191 - Fertilizer
3531 - Rail
2891, 3559, 5094, 1422, 3241, 3297, 5032 - Cement
3274, 1422, 5191, 2041, 2869 - Large Agricultural Processing

Davette,

We need to credit Barry Tycholiz (P # 564185) with 40 hrs extra vacation time.  His offer letter said that he would receive an additional 40 hrs vacation.  He has not yet been credited with the extra hrs.  He should be receiving a total of 160 hrs vacation.  Please let me know when this has been completed.

Thanks,

Barry, 

It is working great.  Thanks for the support.  One small format issue......Phil has it titled Pacific Gas & Electric Company and it should be PG&E Energy Trading - Gas Corporation.

I will let you know if I need anything else.

Bill

Subject:=09One Way vs. Two Way Payments

I have reviewed the master physical gas agreements for the 10 counterpartie=
s (excluding trading companies) at the top of the exposure list to determin=
e whether the contracts contemplate one-way or two-way payments.

1.  Petro Canada Oil & Gas - One Way
2.  Canadian Natural Resources - Two Way
3.  Marathon Canada Limited - One Way
4.  Husky Oil Operations Limited - One Way
5.  Murphy Canada Exploration Company - One Way
6.  Encal Energy Ltd. - One Way
7.  Talisman Energy Inc. - One Way
8.  Premstar Energy Canada Ltd. - Two Way
9.  Rio Alto Exploration Ltd. - One Way
10.  Sunoco Inc. - Two Way

The basic operation of a one way payment provision is that, if the defaulti=
ng party has a net in-the-money position based upon the Early Termination D=
amages calculation, the Early Termination Damages are deemed to be zero and=
 the non-defaulting party is not required to pay that amount to the default=
ing party (the defaulting party's position is wiped out).  However, we woul=
d still be entitled, prior to default, to call for collateral where a count=
erparty's out-of-the money position is in excess of its collateral threshol=
d, which would provide us with security to ensure the counterparty continue=
s to pay.  In addition, if the counterparty failed to post such collateral,=
 they would be in default, we could terminate the contract and, as the non-=
defaulting party, we would be in a position to realize on our in-the-money =
position.  If, after we received the collateral, we were then to become ins=
olvent or otherwise default under the master, the counterparty could termin=
ate the contract, our mark-to-market position would be wiped out and we wou=
ld be required to return any unused collateral.

The operation of a two way payment provision is that the early termination =
damages are calculated by the non-defaulting party and whoever has a net in=
-the-money position based upon such calculation is owed the termination pay=
ment, regardless of whether such party is the defaulting or non-defaulting =
party.  In other words, unlike a one way payment, if the defaulting party h=
as a net in-the-money position upon termination of the contract, the non-de=
faulting party will be required to pay that amount to the defaulting party.=
  Therefore, if we were to become insolvent or otherwise default under a ma=
ster and we had a net in-the-money position under that master, the counterp=
arty could terminate the contract but we would still be owed our mark-to-ma=
rket position.  The other point to consider in the situation where there is=
 a two way payment provision is that, of the three counterparty masters abo=
ve that contain two way payments, all three also contain cherry picking lan=
guage that, upon the occurrence of an event of default other than insolvenc=
y, allows the non-defaulting counterparty to pick and choose which transact=
ions to terminate.  In other words, the counterparty need not terminate all=
 transactions, which could effect the amount otherwise owed to the defaulti=
ng party.  Even with cherry-picking, upon the occurrence of an insolvency, =
all transactions are deemed to terminate, so cherry picking would not be a =
factor.

You had also asked whether the failure by a party to call for collateral wh=
en it is entitled to under a contract would have an impact on the ability o=
f such party to collect on a termination payment owed to it upon terminatio=
n of the contract.  Other than the fact that the failure to call for collat=
eral may mean that we do not hold credit support that would be usable to of=
fset a termination payment owing if the party obligated to pay fails to pay=
, the right to call for collateral is just that, a right and not an obligat=
ion, and the failure to call for collateral does not colour the right of th=
e party owed the termination payment to require it be paid.

Let me know if you need anything further with respect to this matter.

Barry,  The information on the top 10 from your contract list

1.  Duferco-Farrell Corp. - Could not find any contract in our database.  Do we have the name correct?
2.  XTO Energy Inc. - There is no MAC clause in the contract.  So they can't terminate unless we fail to perform.  One way termination payment
3.  Power Authority State of New York - No Master Found.  Only a GTC and Master Interruptible.
4.  The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company - Found an old Columbia Energy Marketing and Consolidated Natural Gas Company.  No MAC termination clause and no termination payment calculation.  If party fails to perform then other party can seek damages.
5.  NUI Utilities, Inc.  - MAC Clause triggered at BBB-.  Two way termination payment
6.  Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas - No Master found.  Just GTCs and a Master Spot
7.  Florida Power and Light Company -  MAC Clause triggered at BBB-.  FPL can terminate unless we provide LC equal to their Termination Payment.  One way termination payment.
8.  The American Coal Company - Couldn't find any contracts.
9.  Trigen Energy Corporation (Found Trigen-Nassau Energy Corp.) - No MAC Clause.  No  specific remedy for default (i.e. termination payment)
10.  PrimeSouth, Inc.  - Could not find any contracts

Sorry for the delay.  Let me know if you need more information."

Subject:	Terminations Process

Following is a suggested order of events:

1) Contact customer to float concept. If they are interested in a termination, present an initial suggested number. If they are interested in an assignment to a third party, ask for their permission to discuss their deals with other companies, such as Duke and Williams. It is preferred to do a simple termination to the assignment

2) Ask Melissa Murphy (31886) for a list of transactions, the MTM values and copies of the confirms associated with them. Ensure the values represent today's MTM

3) Show the transaction list and valuations to the gas and power traders responsible for those delivery points. Ask them to initial the MTM values and the volumes. Ensure they understand that terminating the deals will make them longer/shorter at each location and obtain their approval to proceed with doing so.

4) Contact customer with the fresh MTM number and obtain final verbal agreement.

5) Work with Jim Meyn/Leonardo Pacheco to put together final contract, complete with copies of the terminated confirms.

6) Bring the final contract to Dave Forster for final signature/approval.

7) Ensure full contract execution ASAP. Chase counterparty as necessary.

Barry,

How are you? Just want to say hi. It must be a very hectic week and
stressful. With the talents of people at Enron such as yourself being the
major asset of the company, the industry recognizes that fact. I am sure
that you will do well. In the mean time, hold tight, pray, and have faith. 

Keep in touch.

Barry, what did you do to the company!?  Listen, sorry to hear about the 
problems at ENRON.  What a strange turn of events.  It is pretty bizarre 
after 10 years of ENRON being the model for other companies on how to 
succeed in the energy industry. What's your take on why it happened?  We get 
a little bit of news down here but we're a little out of touch.

How are you taking it?  Are you pissed? Do you feel like you squeezed pretty 
much what you wanted out of the job? What's the next thing for Barry Tic?  
Well, like all of life's curve-balls there is always something sweet in the 
next pitch you get (jeez, how sappy is that!).  Anyway, hope you're taking 
it all with the good nature you always do.

Hey, maybe this will give you the chance to take a holiday in Ecuador 
(Christmas turkey at our house this year?).  Say hi to Kim for us, drop me a 
line as soon as you can (a better address to reach me is craigh@ph.com.ec).  
Sorry I haven't sent a note before this but you know we are always rooting 
for you.

Your pal, Craig.

Mr. Tycholiz:

I represent SCE's Energy Supply and Marketing Department with respect to
the above-referenced subject.  It is my understanding that the account
number in Section 2 of the Transaction Agreement Regarding Collateral
(""Agreement"") is incorrect.  I propose that the parties correct the error
by lining out the incorrect number and inserting by hand the correct one.
I have drafted and attached a letter agreement reflecting that intention.
Please review and call me at your earliest opportunity so tht we may
discuss further.  Thank you.

Barry,

Definately give a call before you come to LA. Either ""the girls"" can show
you arond or I can definately give you some good info. You can reach me at
310-372-3086.

I also dropped ""Ceasar"" a note but haven't heard back from him. Did he make
it back alive from Cabo or did a big fish pull him under?

Later,

Debra"

Greetings Steve:

We have had many inquiries regarding our transportation agreements, specifically PGT, Kern River and El Paso.  

Most pressing is PGT's request to market capacity on our behalf. Although I do not believe we need to have PGT perform this function, I do believe we could mitigate some demand charge exposure for ""the estate"".  

Are you available to meet with Barry and I first thing tomorrow morning? We need to have an answer for PGT's request. We need to know what the contractual rights are for 1) the pipeline when a shipper declares bankruptcy and 2) our ability to mitigate demand charge exposure by releasing capacity on a short term basis (month at a time?).

Better yet, can we unilaterally turn capacity back to any of these pipes or do we need to reach some type of court approved settlement?

Obviously, we have many questions. Please advise of your ability to meet ASAP.

Thanks,

Stephanie

Thanks to each of you who help in the review process yesterday.  As many of you know, we found that several of the contracts that we reviewed did reconcile with the Total Exposure (in other words, the agreements were not the right ones).  Eric Moon and Russell Diamond are working with IT, Credit and Risk to access deal specific information in a way that will let us link deal numbers to contract numbers.  Thereafter we can get the right agreements and finish the process.  I will update you later today on the status.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Ed

Here's the draft that we discussed on Friday morning. Please take a look at
it and let me know what you think (Jim is on vacation in New York this
week). We've kept it brief. We put the upstream capacity in here in case you
had achieved any further clarity on the disposition of those contracts, but
it should be easy to remove if needed. We also changed from a two-month term
to a three-month term because in the event that neither of us terminates the
contracts by Feb. 15, we could then extend this agreement if we desired and
not end up trying to sell the awkward block of March/April. Please let me
know if you have any questions, and I look forward to discussing the draft.
Thanks, and talk to you soon.

Subject: AECO Storage Proposals-May 16, 01


Lori Lei


Below are some examples of storage services that AEC Storage & Hub Services
can provide at the AECO Storage Facilities located in Alberta.  I priced out
a profile based on our conversation this morning where you indicated that
typically Sierra Pacific usually required a greater withdrawal rate then
injection rate.  I also selected an inventory capacity of 500,000 GJ
(Approximately 0.5 BCF), although I can price out the AECO storage at
utilizing different Withdrawal/Injection rates as well as different
Capacities if you desire.

Proposal #1 (10 Month)
Contract Profile: Standard Profile where Withdrawal/Injection rates are tied
to daily inventory levels, see table below for rate details.
Term: June 2001 to March 31, 2002
Capacity: 500,000 GJ
Withdrawal Rate: 20,000 GJ/d
Injection Rate: 14,000 GJ/d
Demand Cost: CAD 49,844 per month
Commodity: CAD 0.18/GJ on injection only

Proposal #2 (34 Month)
Contract Profile: Standard Profile where Withdrawal/Injection rates are tied
to daily inventory levels, see table below for rate details.
Term: June 2001 to March 31, 2004
Capacity: 500,000 GJ
Withdrawal Rate: 20,000 GJ/d
Injection Rate: 14,000 GJ/d
Demand Cost: CAD 44,860 per month
Commodity: CAD 0.18/GJ on injection only

The following table illustrates the Withdrawal/Injection rate profiles as it
relates to inventory for Proposals #1 &#2.

	MAX	MAX
	WITHDRAWAL	INJECTION
INVENTORY	RATE	RATE
(PJ)	(TJ/D)	(TJ/D)
0.00	10.0	14.0
0.05	12.0	14.0
0.10	14.0	14.0
0.13	15.0	14.0
0.15	16.0	14.0
0.18	17.0	14.0
0.20	18.0	14.0
0.25	20.0	14.0
0.30	20.0	12.6
0.35	20.0	11.2
0.38	20.0	10.5
0.40	20.0	9.8
0.45	20.0	8.4
0.50	20.0	7.0


Proposals #3 &#4 are based on Flat profiles for Withdrawal & Injection
regardless of your Inventory position.  These proposals provide maximum
flexibility.

Proposal #3 (10 Month)
Contract Profile: Flat
Term: June 2001 to March 31, 2002
Capacity: 500,000 GJ
Withdrawal Rate: 20,000 GJ/d
Injection Rate: 14,000 GJ/d
Demand Cost: CAD 85,882 per month
Commodity: CAD 0.18/GJ on injection only

Proposal #4 (34 Month)
Contract Profile: Flat
Term: June 2001 to March 31, 2004
Capacity: 500,000 GJ
Withdrawal Rate: 20,000 GJ/d
Injection Rate: 14,000 GJ/d
Demand Cost: CAD 81,182 per month
Commodity: CAD 0.18/GJ on injection only

Please review the above proposals and call me when you have had time to look
them over.  Additional please note that all the prices I quote above are
negotiable.  If you have any other profiles you would like priced please
give me a call and I'll get them priced out ASAP.

Thank you,"

As some of you might already know, I resigned today.  I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron.  Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.  I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January.  I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life.  

As always, it has been a pleasure working with you!  Keep in touch.  I will be interested to see what happens.

For those of you that will be in the office after New Year's, we will begin an informal fundies meeting each day to cover what has happened in the market since we filed for bankruptcy.  We will go over pipeline flows, storage balances, weather, monthly and daily prices, etc. With a few of the Banks showing interest in showing a bid, I thought it would be good for us to begin our preparation to trade the market.

Chris Gaskill will be providing the daily packet and Patti Sullivan will provide the daily operations report.   

I was thinking that we should start around 9:30 each morning.

Will we be acting as agent for Pasadena in January?  Should we turn this contract back?  Let me know what your thoughts are.

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side	
+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)
				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)
+	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers
				Phase  2 Customers
				Phase  3 Customers
+	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc)
+	Customer visit schedule

Product Side
+	List of Products	Phase 1 - First Week
				Phase 2 - First Month
				Phase 3 - First Quarter

Target Number of Transactions
+	Phase 1
+	Phase 2
+	Phase 3

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise"

Subject:	Re: STatus of PGT and CIG

1.	CIG, RP01-350
CIG  has filed an answer to the comments and protests.  Although they referenced our protest, they did not discuss it in any detail except to say that our issues and those of PSCo and Barrett could be explored through ""normal procedures"" after the suspension, presumably through settlement conferences or hearing.  Note that I gave you a copy, though I can't remember exactly when.  It might have been when we met with Paul in my office.

The suspension order was issued on 4/25 -- rates effective 10/1/01, subject to refund.  Copies were distributed to parties on my list on 4/30.  All of the issues in the ""Appendix B"" tariff sheets are set for the technical conference (basically, everything except the rates and cost of service, which are to be addressed at hearing).  The hearing schedule is held in abeyance until after the technical conference issues are resolved.  At that point, a procedural schedule will be established, with a target hearing date and dates for testimony, discovery, rebuttal testimony, etc.  Of course, settlement negotiations will also be going on at the same time, I would assume.

2.	PGT, CP01-141

The application was filed on 4/2, and interventions/protests were not due until 4/25.  As you know, certificate proceedings do not have the same requirement for FERC to act within 30 days.  Environmental issues will be of primary concern initially.  On 4/12, FERC issued a notice of intent to prepare an Environmental Assessment with reqeust for comments.   FERC sent PGT a data request on environmental issues, to which PGT responded on 4/30.  Interestingly, on 5/3, REBOUND, an organization of skilled construction trade workers, filed a letter arguing that a ""full and complete"" Environmental Impact Statement is the proper avenue for consideration of the environmental impacts of the project.  An EIS is much more extensive than an Environmental Assessment.  REBOUND's justification for an EIS didn't seem to be very strong.  

While the environmental work is ongoing, FERC will probably issue a preliminary determination on the non-environmental issues.  If RIMS is correct, there weren't many protests -- only us, DEK Energy Company, and Pan Alberta Gas -- and only PanCanadian Petroleum filed comments.

PG&E will announce via press release very early next week an open season on Redwood, Baja and Silverado.
It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into California by pipelines.
The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the original Gas Accord.
The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31.
Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03.
Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what generators want).
Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03, or some time during Q103.
About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed ""Gas Accord II,""  (the first one expires end of 02).
As part of that filing, PG&E will offer its proposed ratemaking treatment for the next five years (beginning 1.1.03).
PG&E will not include in the open season 1) core capacity and 2) certain EAD contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date.
In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and EAD), to be ""open-seasoned"" at some ""future"" date.
The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual) on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado.
How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing.
No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level of capacity they choose).

Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.  If you have any questions, just holler.

Best,
Jeff"

Are you referring to the Kern origination?  If so, it appears that the orig has not yet been redistributed.  Who controls the changes/updates to the orig reports?

Regarding your comments on the Pricing Sheet - I just want to make sure I understand what you are looking for.  Where you suggesting that I include historical NYMEX  final settles (previous 12 months?) in addition to the current forward strip?

Jeff, thanks again for attending the discussions with DWR.

Do you have any recon.... on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on. As Mark indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.'

There is a zero sum game on fuel... but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it! 

Any thoughts.

Key Enron Employees Aren't Jumping Ship, Recruiters Say
Dow Jones International News Service via Dow Jones
By Michael Rieke Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp.'s (ENE) current problems aren't sending its
key employees running for the door, according to two executive recruiters.
While employees at Enron's underperforming units are shopping around for new
jobs, those working for its core wholesale energy trading and retail energy
units seem content, the recruiters told Dow Jones Newswires.
""We've been getting resumes from their international group over the last
year,"" said Bruce Peterson, managing director for Korn Ferry in Houston.
""But its been a very well-known fact that they're getting out of those
businesses.""
Another Houston recruiter, who didn't want to be identified, said he has
gotten ""a flood"" of resumes from employees at Enron's natural gas and power
assets in South America.
Employees at Enron's broadband unit are also sending out resumes, said the
recruiter. That business has brought the company losses of more than $100
million this year despite hundreds of layoffs. Enron continues to cut costs
in its telecom business.
Neither recruiter has seen many resumes from Enron's big moneymakers - the
wholesale energy trading group and the retail energy services group.
Some of the lower-level employees of those units have sent out resumes but
Peterson said he hasn't seen higher-level executives in the job market.
However, he attached a caveat to that statement.
""Quite a few of the senior people at Enron have left over the last 6-12
months,"" he said.
When Enron's share price was flying high last year and early this year, some
of Enron's top executives cashed out their stock options and left the
company.
Those executives included Cliff Baxter, former vice chairman and chief
strategy officer; Ken Rice, former head of Enron Capital and Trade as well
as former chief executive of Enron Broadband Services; Kevin Hannon, former
president of Enron Broadband Services; and Lou Pai, former chairman and
chief executive of Enron Energy Services.
The lure of cashing out lucrative stock options won't cost Enron any more
employees any time soon. The company's share price has fallen too far too
quickly, leaving the options underwater.
The company's shares traded as high as $80 early this year. By July the
price had dropped to around $50, leaving employees with options that were
virtually worthless. So Enron told employees it would issue new options in
August.
But the company's share price continued to fall as more and more bad news
came out. The new options issued in August, when the share prices were
around $40, are now underwater also.
Now that the options are out of the money, Enron employees are more
vulnerable to the lure of other companies, Peterson said.
Enron could face another problem in keeping key people. Its employees work
under two-year contracts. If they leave Enron before their contracts
expires, a noncompete clause could prevent them for working for a
competitor.
Some of those contracts will expire at the end of the year. Without the
incentive of lucrative stock options, Enron might have a difficult time
getting employees to agree to new contracts with a noncompete clause,
Peterson said.
An Enron spokeswoman said the company isn't planning to issue more new
options to employees.

Just got off the phone with Rick Hawley--Puget's CFO.  He was very cordial and indicated the company was interested in talking with us.  We had a fairly open discussion of who we should contact.  In the end, he suggested that we call Bill Gaines, VP Energy Supply.  He said that as CFO he is head of the Risk Management Committee and that anything that was discussed with Bill would go through his committee.  I highlighted the notion that we were interested in talking about services that could be helpful to their risk management efforts and that would be beneficial to both of our companies.  

By the way, at the beginning of the call, I made clear that we were not talking about total outsourcing.  

He didn't immediately respond, but in the context of our discussion re:  who to talk to he stated that we should talk to him if we wanted to have a more strategic discussion on outsourcing.  Then he said something to the effect of ""of course, we're not at all interested in a more comprehensive outsourcing product.""

Bill's number is 425.462.3145.  He said that we can tell Bill, Rick suggested we call him directly.  "

shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed
company.

Grant, ENE trades at 7x 2001 expected recurring earnings and 0.9 times book value.  This is far lower than a quick industry average of 15.5 times 2001 expected earnings and 2.8 times current book value (industry includes Duke, EL Paso, Williams, Dynegy, Kinder Morgan, and Aquila).  I think what these ratios demonstrate is the risk of the unknown that is being priced into ENE.  For example the current price to book seems like a suspect ratio to use for ENE given that it is unclear what is on our books and what else needs to be written down.  If you look at ENE on a price to earnings after non-recurring items for 2001 it looks far less attractive at 22.9 times.  If you take ENE's earnings after ""non-recurring"" items and slap on the industry average multiple of 15.5 times ENE's share price is $8.51 (ouch).  Now obviously not everything in the non-recurring events are actually recurring but there is talk of some wholesale losses being buried in the ""non-recurring"" loss.

ENE's long-term debt to equity is 0.9 times but if you include all the off balance sheet leverage and the leverage inherent in our trading business the true number is significantly higher than 0.9 times.  On a positive note the ENE's debt is trading higher today (price not yield).

Here is a spreadsheet from Bloomberg with the S&P pipelines sub sector P/Es, and P/Bs. and dividend per share (ENE's is 4%, nothing like a share price falling by 85% to get that div yield up).  I have also attached the latest Wall Street Journal article touting Berkshire, Royal Dutch, and GE as potential suitors (do you think Buffet can understand ENE?).

Hope this helps
--Derek

Barry and Kim,

Attached is my first go at our European option model.  It is capable of valuing monthly physical or financial calls/puts.  I've tried to make it user friendly by using a similar format as we are using for our swap/spread models.  Please let me know if you like its functionality, and provide me some input on how you might want to fiddle with it when doing real time pricing.

Phil

Kids are doing well... my boys turned 1 in September and running rampant
around our house... the rest of the family including myself are scared of
them.  Olivia turned 4 recently and has quite a British accent now... I
sometimes wonder where she came from.
Josee has her hands full at home right now and after a weekend I am more
than ready to return to the office for rest.  
Markets have been choppy... my trading strategy over the past 2 months has
been very simple however.. as Randolph Duke said in the OJ futures pit on
Trading Places... SELL MORTIMER SELL.


Will send you a picture soon.. 
say hi to the wife for us.

PS-  took some clients up to play Turnberry in September for a few days...
what a peach, you would have LOVED it...

Subject:	LADWP Gas Contract


Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

Barry,

In spite of the news in the media about Enron, I see
opportunity. Since we've communicated last I've been real
busy selling my services to major energy traders. Actually
Enron is one of the traders that have my company listed as
one of three or four minority businesses that will be
involved with supplying the power for contracts. These
contracts start at $100,000,000 and go up.

Barry, I'm going to forge ahead, but I'd still rather have
the opportunity to work and learn from the biggest and
best.
One of my strong points is to get the deal done, another is
to understand my limitations. If you give me the shot on
the origination side you'd be most pleased. If I can
convince the world's largest energy trader to put me on
their contracts and RFPs after being in business for less
than a year, just think what could be done with a
supportive back office and timely information.

What I'm seeking is a chance to excel with all the tools at
my disposal. Drop me a email and tell me your thoughts.

Tyrone Killebrew

This was forwarded to me by Paul Kaufman 

Today's GD reports that the Colorado PUC is seeking public comments on policy changes necessary to provide price stability for customers.  The article states that the PUC is seeking comments on 3 methods:  (1) requiring utilities to hedge more of their gas supply; (2) requiring utilities to offer an optional service that would be less volatile than standard offer service; and (3) implementing gas unbundling to give customers supplier choice. 

Apparently, the Commission has received comments from the state's LDCs (and maybe others, although the article didn't speak to them).  It is asking for another round of comments, which are due June 18th.

I recommend that we file comments which advocate our hedging proposal, including weather products.

Calif PUC To Pass Power-Bond Measures By Jan -Counsel

Nov. 1, 2001
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California utility regulators expect to approve a measure in January that will allow the state to sell $12.5 billion in bonds to repay the state's general fund and banks for power purchases made this year. 


Delays in the bond issue, originally planned for May, may deepen the state's budget deficit in the coming fiscal year and threaten to further tarnish the state's credit ratings. 


""At this point, we are aiming to have everything done by January related to the revenue bond sale,"" said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the California Public Utilities Commission. 


The PUC refused earlier this month to pass a so-called rate agreement, which would spell out how the bonds would be repaid, because it would give the the state's power buying arm carte blanche to raise electricity rates without public hearings and without oversight by the PUC. 


In addition, PUC President Loretta Lynch wants the governor's office to renegotiate the tens of billions of dollars in long-term power contracts it signed with more than a dozen energy companies at the peak of the market. One of the commission's objections to the rate agreement is that it would lock the state into overpriced, overlong deals that will saddle ratepayers with high electricity costs for the next decade. 


So far, neither the state nor the PUC have identified which power pacts they want to renegotiate. Spokesman for Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Williams Cos. (WMB) Calpine Corp. (CPN) and Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), have said they haven't been formally contacted by state officials to talk about renegotiating the deals. 


Williams and Dynegy said they would consider renegotiating the contracts, but only if the result would benefit both parties. Calpine said it would be difficult to rewrite the pacts, but the company is willing to talk with state officials. 


The PUC met with members of Gov. Gray Davis' staff last week to figure out a strategy for renegotiating the contracts, and talks are ongoing, Cohen said. 


""We are all in agreement that we want to renegotiate at least some of the contracts,"" Cohen said. ""We have technical people looking at the contracts to figure out what we want to accomplish, what kind of portfolio we want in terms of duration and price. My view is we need to have a solid plan before we embark on renegotiations."" 


Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis, said the governor's office had no comment on the renegotiation talks. "

Barry,

It was a pleasure to discuss the upcoming gas supply needs of DWR and the
potential supply options that Enron may be able to provide . I am interested
in further exploring the discounted transportation/ supply program we
briefly discussed at this week's meeting. As for the payables, DWR is
following standard payment terms; the latter of 10 days after receipt of
invoice or the 25th of the month following delivery. DWR would not agree to
accelerating payments. Additionally, please be advised that DWR would be
contemplating relatively short term transactions with Enron at this time. If
you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call.

Mark Baldwin, IGS.

We have a very good relationship, and long term gas sale with Thermo Partners who manage the 270 MW Ft. Lupton facility.  They have inquired as to Enron's interest in either buying the energy, tolling or buying the entire plant.  The effective date would be July 2002.  The plant is currently under a QF contract with PSCo.

Mike, I would like to see if you have some time on Monday afternoon to discuss the particulars and we can devise a game plan to get you connected with these guys.  Let me know your availability.

Thanks
Mark

Subject:	Discussion with Rick Hawley

Just got off the phone with Rick Hawley--Puget's CFO.  He was very cordial and indicated the company was interested in talking with us.  We had a fairly open discussion of who we should contact.  In the end, he suggested that we call Bill Gaines, VP Energy Supply.  He said that as CFO he is head of the Risk Management Committee and that anything that was discussed with Bill would go through his committee.  I highlighted the notion that we were interested in talking about services that could be helpful to their risk management efforts and that would be beneficial to both of our companies.  

By the way, at the beginning of the call, I made clear that we were not talking about total outsourcing.  

He didn't immediately respond, but in the context of our discussion re:  who to talk to he stated that we should talk to him if we wanted to have a more strategic discussion on outsourcing.  Then he said something to the effect of ""of course, we're not at all interested in a more comprehensive outsourcing product.""

Bill's number is 425.462.3145.  He said that we can tell Bill, Rick suggested we call him directly.  "

We will but choose the words you use very carefully with regards to what those may be.... LC's, cash are difficult. Basically the most that they are ever exposed to us for is 55 days of gas... and very little mark to market valuations.

Subject:	RE: Northwest Pipeline Discussions: LNG Terminal


Dear Colleagues:

Yesterday, Jeff Slaughter of ENA, Kyu-bong Lee and myself met with Northwest Natural Gas'  Nick Potts, Director - Gas Storage Operations, Charles Stinson, General Manager - Engineering Services & Storage, and Randy Friedman, Manager - Gas Supply.

Full report on the meeting is attached, here is a summary of the main points:

They do not object to the development of an LNG terminal by Enron on the Columbia river or to Enron's efforts to negotiate a land lease option at Port Westward.  Their pipeline system is not set up to take advantage of the regasified LNG to supply their core customers in Portland but they would consider buying directly from us for customers in the Port Westward, St. Helens, Longview area if the price was right, i.e., the lower of Sumas and Stanfield price MINUS some discount from the NW Pipeline postage stamp tariff.
They perceive some risk in relying on an LNG supply with price formula linked to Nymex that would not provide a floor for the LNG producer.
They would like to see the LNG terminal in southern Oregon, where the NW pipeline system telescopes down to 10 inches, but realize that the terminal would be lost somewhere around Coos Bay with over 150 miles to go to connect with the PGT line across the Coastal Range and the Cascades, through an area of strong environmental concerns.
At this point, the best option for Enron seems to be (pending positive report on navigational issues on the Columbia from Golder): 
a terminal close to the N/W Pipeline in the Port Westward/Longview area
selling gas directly to local customers (i.e., bypassing NW P/L transportation charges)
selling rest of gas on NW P//L
Eventually, we will need to talk to the Kelso Beaver (KB) Pipeline which operates the small diameter line to Port Westward.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Best,

Z

Attached is a summary of the conference call held between Enron, Citizens, and PP&L on October 18th.  Proposed procedures on how we will handle cuts from now on are also included.  Enron is making every effort available to ensure that PP&L receives 100% of the gas that they call on.  I feel that we need to formally agree to these procedures, either in the form of an amendment to the agreement or a formal letter signed by all parties.

Please let me know if you have any comments regarding these procedures and how you would like to proceed.

Thanks,

Hey guys, not sure if you are all still at this
address or not but I wanted to get in touch and give
you an update on where I am in case your e-mail
addresses chnaged.

I left San Francisco a couple of months ago and am now
in Sydney Australia with my girlfriend, working on the
federal election campaign for the local Australian
Liberal Party candidate.  It's been a great experience
so far and a lot of fun.  

I'm planning on being back in school in September for
an MBA if I can pull myself together and finish the
applications.  Our apartmnet is nice and close to
Bondi Beach and the Royal Sydney Golf Club so there
are plenty of distractions.   

I'll keep this short because I'm not sure if it will
reach any of you but if it does, it would be reat to
get a quick note back to let me know what's up.  

Dorland, I still owe you a tie by the way.   

I hope everything is going well guys,
Matt

No new details to report.  Same settlement to unbundle socal that's been before the commission for about a year.  On the commission's agenda to consider, but as has been the case for over year, they've delayed any movement--at least one commissioner doesn't like competition and has the discretion to continue to ask that it be delayed.  Some hold the view that there's a push to try to get it moved, but best guess is 50-50 at this point.  Substantively, though, same thing that's been before them for a very long time, i.e., emulate PG&E's gas accord (more or less) on socal.

Best,
Jeff

Stephanie:  Confirming our phone conversation today, based on my reading of the Transco order and the PGT order, the FERC relied on a different standard in the Transco case (the 1995 Pricing Policy Statement) than they used in the PGT case (the 1999 Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities).  

The 1995 Policy Statement said that, when the roll-in increased rates to existing shippers by less than 5%, the pipeline needed to make only a general showing of system benefits, and FERC said that Transco had satisfied that showing.  

The 1999 Policy Statement, however, has a threshold requirement for expansion projects requiring that there can be no subsidization from existing customers - in other words, no increase in costs of any kind.  The PGT order found that there was a possibility that fuel costs could increase for existing shippers; therefore, PGT had to establish a surcharge mechanism to subject expansion shippers to an incremental fuel charge for fuel costs above those that would apply absent the new compression.  If the fuel costs do not increase, then there will be no surcharge.

Greetings Becky:

Met with PGT the other day. Based upon a recent FERC ruling on the treatment of fuel on a project on Transco's Leidy Lateral (last 2 weeks), PGT is going to ask FERC to reverse its ruling on the 2002 expansion. If you remember, FERC was very clear on the notion that existing shippers should not subsidize increased costs associated with incremental shippers. I've been told that Transco received approval for rolled in treatment of higher fuel because they did not have an ""incremental"" tariff.  

This sounds very suspicious - can you please investigate?

Yes.  See attached.  Note that even the Commission decision overturning the ALJ's rejection of roll-in dates back to early 1999.  The 1999 Policy Statement was not issued until September 1999. 


     Procedural History

          This proceeding arises from two general section 4 rate cases
     filed by Transco in Docket Nos. RP95-197-000 and RP97-71-000. 
     Those cases have a long and complicated history which need not be
     repeated here.4/  A controversial issue in these proceedings has
     been whether the costs of Transco's twelve incrementally-priced
     Leidy and Southern expansion projects should be rolled into
     Transco's system-wide rates.   

           On April 16, 1999, the Commission issued an order5/
     reversing the ALJ's rejection of Transco's proposal to roll in
     the costs of the twelve projects.  The Commission held that, in
     determining whether Transco and the proponents of rolled-in rates
     had met their section 4 burden, the Commission would apply its
     1995 Pricing Policy Statement, 6/ which was issued one year after
     the last of the projects at issue here was certificated and
     built.  The Commission concluded that Transco had satisfied the
     conditions in the 1995 Pricing Policy Statement for rolling in
     expansion costs.

Greetings.  I'm assuming that we're still on for the call.  Let me know.  Hope things have calmed down somewhat since the deal was announced on Friday.

Best,
Jeff

Update - 

this afternoon Kris, Sarah, Gloria and I talked with Bob Detonte and Carol Consolver from SoCal.  They will provide Kris with information reconciling imbalance data.  They clarified that imbalance trading will be reflected immediately, thus lessening our exposure.  They agreed to several changes in the contract including procedures for posting of margin.  They agreed to consider our requests to increase imbalance tolerance from $2.5 million to $10 million, and to scale the requirement according to our credit rating.  We expect an answer on these latter issues later today or early tomorrow.  The first reaction was that $10 million may be a ""little too rich"".

Attached are comments which ENA proposes to file in response to FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking establishing the right for releasing shippers to recall released capacity from the replacement shipper for nomination at each of the first three GISB prescribed nomination deadlines.  The comments support the NOPR except that we say the FERC should make it absolutely clear that the intraday recall right must be part of a specific and express agreement between the releasing and replacement shipper, and that FERC should schedule a workshop after issuing the order so that operational concerns, such as accounting and gas tracking issues, can be worked out.

Comments must be filed by Monday, so please let me know if you have any concerns or suggestions by noon CST on Friday, 11/16.  Thanks.

The following is a summary of the estimated costs of our buildout/subdivide project:

Blueprints	$6,000
Construction	$70,000
Furniture	$3,000
Voice/Data	$4,000 	
*Commisions	$16,000

*Commisions were negotiated by Enron Realty

We had a profit of roughly $70,000 on the sublease over the term of the lease and will save approximately $11,000 per month on the sublease."

,=09 RP00-139
Importance:=09High

Salt River Project, in an effort to bring resolution to the mainline and
receipt point allocation issues pending in the above-captioned proceedings,
is filing today (and serving hard copies of) the attached ""Motion of SRP fo=
r
Adoption of Strawman Alternative to March 28, 2000 Proposal of El Paso
Natural Gas Company"".  Unlike any other proposal before it, it seeks to
weave into one workable solution, the concerns raised by shippers in their
initial and reply comments filed in the Order 637 proceeding, as well as
address the 3 complaints.  It is a share-the-pain proposal among CD -
Converted FR - and El Paso.  Under it, FR shippers would convert to CDs at
levels reflecting actual usage over the past 5 years, weighted to the
present. It assures each westward flowing firm shipper, based on the curren=
t
physical mainline capacity (including L. 2000), 93.1%(winter) and 94.2%
(summer) of their contractual entitlement.  On a daily basis, all westward
FT shippers are assured of receiving approximately 60% of their 93.1 and
94.2% allocation from the San Juan.  FT-2 shippers would continue to be
served off the top.  This Strawman adopts the in-line pooling methodology
set forth in SoCal Gas' initial comments.  It includes North and South
system segmentation rights, and narrowly defined demand charge credits for
unprovided capacity as long as there is a shortfall.  Provision is made to
encourage turn-back of capacity and to have capacity under expired contract=
s
dedicated by El Paso to meeting the approximately 7% shortfall. Provision i=
s
also made to treat each primary delivery point as a receipt point, and to
give priority to Alternate Receipt- to- Primary Delivery point in the
systemwide scheduling process, all intended to encourage a strong
supplemental market to meet peak seasonal needs.

This Strawman Alternative is not filed as an offer of settlement, but as a
basis for a merits decision, eliminating the need for lengthy evidentiary
hearings, and providing certainty and flexibility to the system once
implemented.  Alternatively, we have left it to the Commission to decide
whether other procedures should be adopted.  Because it is a motion, it may
be responded to within 15 days of filing.  SRP strongly urges each shipper
and state commission to contact SRP for answers to any questions before
taking a position in response to the motion.  Any shipper that has question=
s
but does not seek answers, but merely sticks to their litigation position
will only be delaying resolution. This proposal is a viable
compromise...everyone gains and everyone loses something.  That is why it
works.  We look forward to hearing from you and reading your constructive
comments.  Joel Greene

Subject: RE: Stock Options after merger


Tyrell,

The following is the information that we have been provided thus far
regarding your questions below.  If the merger between Enron and Dynegy
closes, all terms and provisions of the option awards before the close are
preserved through and after the close except:

(1) number of options in Dynegy will be number of Enron options before the
merger times the merger ration of .2685

(2) the strike price for Dynegy options will be the strike price of Enron
options before the merger divided by the merger ration of .2685

The proposed transaction is considered an ""approved"" change in control for
purposes of the Enron Corp. stock plans.

I hope this helps with some of the questions.  If you have further questions
that I have not answered I would refer you back to Enron for clarification.

Subject: Stock Options after merger


What happens to the Enron options after the merger?
Are all options vested upon completion of the merger?
What happens to the number of options and the strike price, given the
ratio of 1 share of ENA = .2685 share of DYN?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Barry -

My name is Brian Wood and I am an Associate who is currently up for rotation. I spoke with Shelly Friesenhahn from the Associate/Analyst Program and she recommended that I contact you about openings within your group.  I would be very interested in talking to you in order to find out if I would be a good fit for your needs.

I have spoken with an Associate in your group, Phil Polsky, and am excited about the business and learning opportunities in West Coast Gas Origination.  In my previous rotations, I have participated in a broad base of structuring, modeling, and origination activities.  To provide further detail about my experiences and achievements, I have attached my resume for your review.  

With everything going on in the company, I know it may be difficult to find time to meet with me.   Please let me know when it would be most convenient to stop by.  I look forward to having the chance to explain how I could provide value to your group.

Thank you for your consideration,

Brian Wood

I called Bill Gaines of Puget to try to relax our credit constraints.  We just traded voicemails, but agreed to talk on Monday.  My general message, unless you have something to add or subtract, will be: ""lots has gone on at both companies, makes sense to get together to meet your team to talk about gas and power - probably is more we can be doing together, etc. meeting in late Nov/early Dec"".  

Thoughts?

Chris

Howard, can you please verify what you mean by renewal rights.. specifically who owns what rights and until which period.

It is my expectation that with the exception of CNRL, ENA/ECC holds the obligation and annual renewal rights on Nova, ANG. We have assigned the PGT permanently out of Nov 08 to Calpine and Sierra Pacific.. We also have the obligation to give them the matching upstream capacity at that time.

Also, where do you think AEC, Talisman and CNRL will be to take permanent assignment of this pipe effective asap... thus changing the deal delivery point around..( an the credit situation). 

Included in the shuffle will be the liquids obligations, nominations, ( ENA /ECC can still act as the agent) but most importantly the thing we need to transfer over is the pipe obligation on PGT..... stat !!! 
 
Pls advise.

I was advised by Lad Lorenz of Socal that their original application sets forth the plan by which they will sell the residual gas in the Montebello storage field.

Can you please advise me of the final tems of the PUC decision (should have been announced yesterday) and get a copy of the application?

Based upon yesterday's conference in D.C., I  think the restructuring of Socal's backbone transportation is about to become a hot topic again! Please keep us apprised.

Greetings Becky 

Wanted to make sure we protested the filing based on fuel treatment - page 10 description.  You and I have talked about their interpretation of the Transco ruling - we need to reinforce the currently effective FERC policy of incremental treatment for projects that would raise rates/fuel for existing shippers, regardless of their claim that their tariff does not provide for an incremental fuel charge.

I believe Newport Generation tried to get the previous incremental fuel ruling for the 2002 expansion overturned - they were unsuccessful. FERC's answer to that request may provide good language to cite...... 

What is the timeline?"

Boys,  
I am bored today and have proof to show you... 
Go to this website and type in 1031 in the sale number field..
It's a beauty and would be a fine addition to any collector's gallery.
I would consider a joint venture with you for investment purposes on this
find of a lifetime.
Personally, I think it looks a little like a late 70's drummer but it is the
Great One nonetheless. 
It is a fine specimen of the era ' Short on the sides, but keep the length
in the back'

http://www.auktionsverket.se/starte.htm


PS- the price is about 25,000 swedish kroners which i think is about $5000

I gave you the wrong lot number... type in 1032 instead to get the Great

I think 1031 is Haakan Loob.

Sorry,  click on Modern Art and then click on 'see catologue' then type
1032.  I thought the link would take you straight to the print.  I feel
shame.  Nobody said collecting art was easy.

Gerald, I attach a copy of the current form of master physical gas agreement ECC has in place with CNR.  Randy will send you a credit worksheet in the next half hour.  Can you make sure that your form of master has the triangular setoff language that Mark Haedicke distributed a month or so ago to be included in all agreements, as CNR wants to ensure there is cross-affiliate setoff.  Once it is prepared, Howard Sangwine, the commercial contact in Calgary, will walk the document over to CNR, so you can send it to me and I will get it to him.

Thanks for your help.

Greg

Dave, as you'll see our presentation was well received.  I've spoken to Roger a couple of times and next week they'll be meeting with ""management"" to obtain their approval of our concept, following that I'll be working on them to using Enron exclusively.  If we are successful, they will be expecting us to develop and manage the whole portfolio.  I appreciate your help and look forward to working together on this.  John

Well I appreciate the feedback.... I feel both Roger and Jeff liked and
understood the concept, but were concerned we ""controlled"" the number.   I
liken it to checking in the paper as to what the Prime interest rate is
prior to negotiating a home loan.  Once you know the relative interest
rate, you talk to a few mortgage bankers regarding points, services, etc.
and then move forward.  I would hope this is what L-P would do and
naturally I'd hope they would move forward with us.  John

Barry,

Could you go through the attached list and identify which of your customers in column B correspond to the names in column D?  There may be no match in column D.  If so, please indicate as such.

This is part of the project with structuring and credit to identify which of our customers have master firm and master swap agreements in place.  Credit has a number of different subsidiaries in its database, and these subsidiaries do not necessarily correspond to the customer names in our own database.  

Thanks, and let me know if you have any questions.

Phil

Hi Mr. Tycholiz,

My name is Tamara and I work with Judy on the Enron program here at
PricewaterhouseCoopers.  I have been looking over your file and have a
question with regard to the fax which you sent to us on August 29, 2001.
There may have been a misunderstanding regarding the intention of you
faxing those documents to us.  We looked at the fax and understood it to be
for our files.  However, from your most recent email, we are now thinking
that you had expected us to take some kind of action on your behalf with
the IRS.

The original notice from the IRS is dated June 23rd, 2001.  It states that
should you not agree with their figures, you should contact them.  We
assumed that you did not agree with the notice and had contacted them.  Our
question is: did you contact the IRS and/or send in the forms with your
wife's SSN or was it action that we were meant to take?  If you could
please clarify this at your earliest convenience, we will try to get this
resolved as soon as possible.

Kind regards,

Tamara L. Utsch

Per Barry's request, attached is the Agency and Management Services Agreement to be executed between Enron North America Corp. and Mexicana De Cobre.  Also attached is the form of agency agreement to be attached as Exhibit B to the Agency and Management Services Agreement.  This agency agreement is El Paso's form and must be executed by ENA, Mexicana, and El Paso.  The El Paso form requires that you open as a read only file.
Please review.

  

We are working on the gas purchase agreement and should forward shortly.

We received the power of attorney and bylaws you emailed.  I had a Spanish speaking attorney in our office assist me with their review.  The bylaws look fine. We would like you to follow up with a certified copy in the mail.   For now can you confirm via a response to this email, that these are the latest bylaws on file?  

 He noted that under the Power of Attorney, it would be required that two of the gentlemen listed on page 2 of the power of attorney documentation, execute our agreements.  Can you confirm?  Would be happy to discuss this with you.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Don?t  you think that the redaction of article 13 of the Agency & Management  Agreement will be better this way::
 
IF  ENA BECOMES LIABLE TO CUSTOMER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE EL PASO AGENCY  AGREEMENT FOR ANY REASON, WHETHER ARISING BY NEGLIGENCE OR INTENDED CONDUCT OR  OTHERWISE, , IN NO EVENT SHALL ENA'S LIABILITY HEREUNDER EXCEED THE AGGREGATE OF  THE SERVICES FEE PAID TO ENA HEREUNDER FOR

We have accepted your suggested revision to Article 13 of the Agency and Management Agreement.  Attached is a new executable with the language revised.   Also attached for execution are the gas purchase confirm and associated GTC for the gas purchase through Monday June 4.  The GTC was revised to remove the $0.15 per MMBtu liquidated damages.  Thanks.

The memo was written requesting that the name of the trading book not reflect Denver any longer.  There are several technical issues involved with the IT group which could make this difficult.  It is being looked at to see if it can be changed.  The memo at least documented the fact that this inconsistency exists and may be enough to suffice for the time being.

Subject:	PGT CP01-141 Fuel and Roll-In



The enclosed spreadsheet contains data extracted from PGT's semi-annual fuel
tracker filings which might be of interest.  It is possible PGT might claim
the increasing fuel cost parts of your intervention as ""unsubstantiated"" and
therefore should be excluded and ignored by the Commission.
 <<PGTfuel.xls>>

There could well be a case for roll-in.  If there is, PGT didn't include it
in their filing.  I guess we will see how it all shakes out.  It's
interesting no-one has yet asked FERC to require a new rate case by a
specific date or to force the trivial rate reduction through to Shippers.

Estimate of marginal/incremental fuel consumption due to new capacity:

NEW CONTRACTS
210,800 dt; 612.46 mi => 	(210,800)/(1 -0.0050%*612.46)*(612.46) =
133,185,095 dt-miles/day
  20,380 dt; 612.46 mi =>	(20,380)/(1 -0.0050%*612.46)*(612.46) =
12,876,244 dt-miles/day

				annual average (5 mo winter, 7 mo summer) =
138,550,197 dt-miles/day

BASE CASE, FULL EXISTING SYSTEM
1.385 e9 dt-miles/day, useage of 68.6 Mdt/day, or 0.0050%/mile

MARGINAL FUEL PERCENTAGE ESTIMATE
0.0101 %/mile, slope of line from chart 'ex5' as computed on sheet 'regr'
Sheet 'ex8' has all the historical data points and their derivations.

Additional Fuel estimate
0.0101 %/mile * 138,550,197 dt-miles/day = 14.0 Mdt/day

Total Fuel Used
68.6 + 14.0 = 82.6 Mdt/day

Total Throughput
1.385 + 0.139 = 1.524 e9 dt-mi/day

Estimated resultant average fuel:
82.6 Mdt/day / 1.524 e9 dt-mi/day = 0.00542 %/mile.

Increase in average fuel to existing shippers
0.00542%/mile - 0.0050%/mile = 0.00042 %/mile
612.46 mi * 0.00042 %/mile = 0.257% on a Kingsgate-to-Malin path.
At $5.00 /dt, 0.257%*$5 = $0.013 /dt

Since the combined toll (cash toll plus fuel value) goes up, PGT must make a
case that roll-in is beneficial.

12/22/93	RP94-88

These comments on FERC's proposed gas reporting requirements are due on June 18.  The draft takes the position that the FERC should NOT adopt reporting requirements for natural gas sellers, which is a different approach than some of you had discussed earlier.  If after reading my very persuasive comments, the consensus is we should not oppose the reporting requirements but rather attempt to water them down, I will of course rewrite the comments (or resign in protest).

On page 6, I make the argument that we do not do our business in the manner the reporting requirements seem to contemplate.  I go through a very high level description of our ""books,"" but I really do not want to be more specific, as we then get into proprietary matters.  Where we have given FERC the more detailed description, we have asked for confidential treatment.

Please get comments back to me and Becky as quickly as you can.  Thanks.

Hey there Barry! No, I never heard from him. Guess I will drop him another
note and see how he is surviving this series! We actually went to get the
Av's in NJ. Lisa, Lynn, myself and another girl who is flying the Laker
trips with us got snagged to fly the trip since we were sitting around with
nothing to do until Sat. when we go to Philly. I guess they decided rather
than pay us for sitting on our butts they would put us to work! I am not
particularly fond of their players. Some of them are OK. Joe Sakic is nice.
And of course, I got to see Rob Blake which was a plus. He just doesn't
look right in that Av uniform, or sitting on the plane in a different seat
with all of those ""other"" guys around him! Patrick Roy sits in the seat he
use to sit in with the Kings, so I guess we know who won out on that deal!
I sure wouldn't ask him to get up! Yikes, he scares me! Now, Bob Hartley,
he is THE nicest guy! And not bad to look at either! All of the coaches are
nice, and quite amusing! Until they lost last night I was hoping to take
them back to NJ this week. How awsome would that have been to bring them
home with THE cup on the plane! Now that it isn't going to happen that way
it is just as well we are not going out there. I guess they found some
other charter FA's to handle it.

I am planning to go to Denver for the opening Bronco game on Mon. night
Sept. 10th. We may have to have a reunion! Are your buddies Bronco fans
too?

Take care, talk with you soon,

Debra "

We actually use the same airplanes for both NBA and NHL. They were
originally configured for the NBA then we added some hockey teams to our
contract. There are 12 international first class seats and a table with
four chairs in the front cabin, the middle has 2 tables with 4 chairs and
an additional 4 world business class seats, then the back has 24 domestic
first class seats and a sofa. They are old 727's that were reconfigured.
Obviously, the NBA players sit in the front cabin since that was the idea
of the 12 seats, and coaches in the middle with tables to work,  but the
hockey players sit in the middle and back with coaches and staff occupying
the front or middle. Each Hockey teams seating is different depending on
the teams preference. Just to have a private flight makes the hockey guys
happy. Most of them still remember when they had to fly commercial. They
are not too picky. And with the steller service we provide, they don't even
notice the decor!!!

Off to bang that little white ball around grass, sand and trees!

See ya,

Debra"

Barry,

It was good talking to you today.  I believe that you mentioned that you may
be working something up regarding the potential release capacity and sending
it to us next week.  I just wanted to confirm that we are interested and
look forward to you contacting us.

Barry:

This is the insurance language that would appear in the contract between Enron Asset Management Resources (EAMR) and Citizens.  I will send you a second e-mail that summarizes the proposed deal between EAMR and ENA.  As we discussed I would like you to look at this insurance arrangement and see if ENA has any risk.  My view of it is that this creates no risk to ENA, but I have not structured a deal in this way before and would appreciate a second opinion. 

Thanks

Subject:	Citizens - Deal structure summary

As a follow up to yesterday's meeting, below is a summary of the course of action to be taken in response to Citizens comments on the service agreement with EAMR.

Enron will work with Citizens to put an insurance policy in place, which meets the insurance provisions requested by Citizens and which names both Citizens and EAMR as policy holders.  See attached file for proposed policy details.
The cost for this policy (not to be revealed to Citizens) will be between $5,000 and $7,500 and will be paid for by ENA.
ENA will enter into a side letter agreement with EAMR, which will provide for the insurance premium payment.
Upon agreement with Citizens on the insurance policy details, EAMR is agreeable to executing a services agreement with Citizens, however, Citizens must agree to EAMR's indemnity and liability contract language as written in its original draft (see attached below). 


Attached is a file containing Citizens' comments on its draft services agreement with EAMR.  Article 8 of the draft agreement details the insurance provisions requested by Citizens.
 
For reference, the original draft sent to Citizens dated effective January 15, 2001 is attached below:

Our liability should be limited to recoveries from the insurances required in the contract and specifically purchased for work under this contract. If covered by the policy, we will respond.  Losses, costs and expenses not recovered from the insurance, shall remain the obligation of Citizens. 

Once again, if they agree to the limitation, the continued concerns would be:
1. The indemnity would be set aside by a court.
2. The indemnity from Citizens does not hold or they are financially unable to respond.

Please advise if there are further questions.

I'm very interested.  Can you put together a proposal?
Brian

>>> <Mark.Whitt@enron.com> 06/08/01 10:27AM >>>

I have been working on the San Juan deal we discussed.  The expansions
don't look very good.  Sonora Pipeline which is the Kinder
Morgan/Calpine
project is doubtful.  The rates on it look pretty good ($.39) but that
is
because they need subscriptions of  750 MM/d for 20 years.  It doesn't
seem
to feasible right now and they don't seem very confident in their
ability
to get it done.  The Transwestern expansion is only out of the Permian
basin so it won't fit and we believe that El Paso will be the same
although
that has yet to be determined.  However, it seems unlikely  that El
Paso
will expand out of the San Juan becuase their load growth is primarily
on
the south leg.

That is the bad news!  The good news is that we have existing space
that we
acquired on El Paso that began in June and continues through May of
2006.
Since the spreads have come in it is probably priced pretty well and I
believe we would give it to you at market.  We could structure it like
our
Wyoming deal in that we would manage the capacity and California
Border
sales for you.  I believe the space we have goes to PG&E.  The other
good
point is that you could control the ROFR in 2006.

Let me know if this is something you are interested in and I will work
up a
proposal for you.

Thanks

Mark

Hope all is well with both of you! 

As Colin and I discussed, we are looking to place some transportation capacity. In that regard, I offer the attached proposal for your consideration. I believe these transportation paths are a good fit for your needs on PG&E. This proposal offers diversity of supply (Baja and Redwood) for your generation projects on the PG&E system. You would also receive the future benefit of existing tolls relative to incrementally priced expansions.Start date is open for discussion.

Please call me as soon as possible - we are going to move fast.

Best regards,

Stephanie

INTEROFFICE MEMO

From: John Lavorato & Dave Delainey

To: All of ENA and EES

Re: ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes

As Enron continues to build its origination and customer business in the US, it is becoming increasingly important that both ENA and EES target the appropriate industries and customers with our respective value propositions.  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.

Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before customer contact. 

Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption or number of sites, the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in ENA.  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be managed by EES.

ENA SIC Codes:

Primary Metals Mining and Extraction 
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper and Forest Products
Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers
Refining
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing
Fertilizer
Rail
Auto - restricted to the Big Three - Ford, GM and Daimler-Chrysler
Cement
Aerospace - restricted to Boeing, Raytheon, GE Aircraft, Allied Signal, Hamilton-Sundstrom
Large Agricultural Processing"

Kim:

Here is a summary of the structure we are using to buy gas from the gas desk for Harbor.  This is basically what I plan on using for any future tolling deals that come up.  We can always enhance the structure by replacing the Gas Daily with a fixed price or NGI border price.  

Also, can you get me an indicative 5 year offer for PG&E Citygate out of August for 10,000 MMBtu/d?

Thanks!

Concur Expense (XMS)
Common Questions


1.  Where can I find online documentation on Concur Expense?
Answer: Documentation on Concur Expense is stored in the ISC Document Library.   Go to the following link:
http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/default.asp  and click on the XMS - Concur Expense folder on the left.

2. How can I sign up for Concur Expense training and how much does it cost?
Answer: Go to the following link: http://iscedcenter.enron.com/docentlm/login.htm.  Log in using your Enron email address.  Enter your birth date as the password in the following format: MMDDYYYY.  Under the Courses section, select Concur Expense (XMS).  This will show the training schedule.  Click the Enroll button to sign up for a class.  The cost is $250.

3. Will old XMS expense reports be converted to the new Concur Expense system?
Answer: No.  History data was not converted to the new system because of our move to an Application Service Provider (ASP) solution for Concur Expense.

4. How can I view my old expense reports?
Answer: Call the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727.  The ISC will be responsible for printing out old expense reports and forwarding them to you.  Other options are being reviewed to allow you to view old expense reports.

5. Are there any Enron specific help instructions for Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes.  If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Enron Help on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also you will see a button for Enron Help at the top of the screen when entering expense reports.

6. Is Enron's Travel Policy available in Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes. If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Travel Policy on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also you will see a button for Travel Policy at the very top of the screen when entering expense reports

7. What if I am unable to see any of my credit card charges in Concur Expense?
Answer: Since there are a number of factors that could cause this problem, it is best to call the ISC Customer Care group first.  The ISC will research the problem and get back to you with an answer.

8. Does Concur Expense have a time-out feature?
Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense will automatically time out after 20 minutes of inactivity.

9. How do I enter foreign currency into Concur Expense?
Answer: Go to the ISC Document Library described in #1 above.  Go to the XMS - Concur Expense folder.  Next go to the Special Procedures folder and following the directions stated in the document called Add a Foreign Currency Expense to an Expense Report.

10. Are there any other sources to quickly get me started using Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense provides a Quick Tour for new users.  Log into Concur Expense and click the Help button in the top right corner of the screen.  Then click the button labeled Quick Tour at the top of the help screen.  The ISC intranet home page also contains some helpful information.  The following link summarizes some of the topics discussed above:  http://isc.dev.corp.enron.com/site/XMSchange.htm.

11. Can you quickly describe some of the internal changes in the new Concur Expense system?
Answer:  There are minimal changes in the new upgrade.  Here is a list:
?	The first screen only has one tab instead of two
?	New expense types were added
?	Attendees and approvers will now be printed on the expense reports
?	Manager and receipt dunning notices will be sent out
?	The statistical order and statistical WBS element fields have been separated out


Please direct all other questions to the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727."

It looks like we are done on the new Citizens deal effective July 1.  I have sent original contracts for execution.  We now have to put the deal in the system.  This is a little complicated.  

The attached spreadsheet indicates how this deal will work, using June as an example.  The only differences between June and future months are:

1)  In the future, we will collect a $.09/MMBtu demand charge with $.02/MMBtu of this going to EAMR (ENA gets $.07/MMBtu)
2)  In the future, the PG&E discount is $.10, not $.25.

Some of the complicated booking issues are:

1.  We need to show the John Cogan commission as a separate deal and a cost to ENA
2.  We need to show the payment to EAMR as a separate deal and a cost to ENA
3.  We will continue to bill Citizens for the TW Mainline cost on our utility deal

1 and 2 above are pretty straight forward and should not create any deal entry difficulties other than someone will have to enter the deals.  Number 3 is more difficult.  The complexities relate to where we are making the sale and what costs should be included.  

Can you get with the folks who can help us here and have them come up with a recommendation on how this deal should be booked?  Let me know if you have questions.  I also believe I can add value in speaking with Darren Giron or others.  I guaranty their initial recommendation will not be 100% workable.

Thanks!

Chris

Scott Yule advised that ANG system contracted for roughly 290 M2/day of new delivery capacity (210 to PGT & 80 to Southern Crossing). The Alberta system will expand by 222 M2/day plus an additional 37 M2/day for LRS 2 service. No capacity was relinquished. All of this is timed to come on line with the 2002 PGT expansion.

Can you tell from the queue that I forwarded to you -  What is the split between Shippers going to PGT versus Southern Crossing?

Thanks,
Stephanie"

Good morning Barry,

I'd be happy to provide you with assistance in this regard.  Will Enron be
paying for this service?

Please let me know when it would be convenient for you to meet (I am
assuming this will be over the phone).

Judy, you were?assigned to my U.S and Canadian  tax returns. I am a
employee of Enron North America and previously was an  employee of Enron
Canada in Calgary.

As we had discussed at the time of my filing, I was  never given any advise
on my relocation to the U.S. regarding tax issues, As  such I am not sure
what some of my next moves should be.?I very much  require some
assistance?regarding spousal employment. My wife is a  registered nurse and
would like to work in the U.S., but I have been advised  that this may
affect my filing in the U.S. and perhaps could cost me more in  U.S. Taxes.

Can we set up a meeting to discuss strategies on  making sure I am going
about this properly.

This is my home e-mail address, you can contact me  here or at my work
address, Barry.Tycholiz@enron.com.

Thanks in advance.

BT

I have two copies of the Citizens deal Kim and I did in hand, signed by Citizens but not ENA.  I can sign them, but I wanted to see if you want to sign them or initial them.  I want Kim to initial them as well.  How do you want to handle the ENA signature on these docs?

This is to quickly summarize our call on July 11 on California gas intrastate matters and set a direction for future activity.

Unbundling:	 PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.
  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

I am really only available Monday am (I am on a well-deserved vacation next week), but if that works for you, that would be great.  Jeff is pretty full up with the CA legislature and all the electric stuff.  We can try him, tho.  What I would like is to come up with a coherent message on hedging in CA, particularly the core-non-core issues, so that at the end of the day, EES still has a market and ENA can sell hedges to the LDCs.  Sue Landwehr in Gov Affairs is the leader/coordinator of our hedging activities before the state commissions and we should get her involved as well.  In fact I will cc both Sue and Jeff on this.

Barry,

As promised, here are some of the current redeployment candidates that have a marketing/structuring/trading background for consideration concerning your West Origination opening.  I believe that you have seen Jim Lowe before and expressed some limited interest in him.  The other candidates are most likely new to you.

Let me know if you would like to pursue any of these redeployed employees.


     

Also, I spoke with Mark McConnell today, and he mentioned that he had accepted the offer to join the Transwestern group of ETS.  He primary motivation for selection of this option was his desire to work with asset deals.  As we know, given EWS ""asset light"" approach to deal making, this option would be difficult to fulfill within the West Origination group.  However, he mentioned that he was very impressed with your group, and short of the asset piece maintained a high interest in your open position.

Regards,
Todd Peikert"

Interesting.... and probably true... I was watching the news last night and it is unbelievable how much scrutiny all of these assets are going to get in the next little while,  the reality is that everything could be a terrorist target... Nukes, water, tall buildings, stadiums,electrical generation assets, fuel depo's, crop dusters...
 
Pls keep us posted.. the implication here is that expansion projects like TransWestern could receive pressure on their ability to expand as the generation equation gets stirred up.

I was just talking to counsel in Phoenix who informed me that a number of planned merchant generators in Arizona were in danger of being killed by the Arizona Corporation Commission.  There are apparently concerns with interconnecting these plants where existing plants already are located, and reliability and terrorist-threat possibilities that they raise.  I don't know if this matters to you but in case it does, just wanted you to know. "

Also, can you provide for him a report on what systems his group currently has and whether or not there is an opportunity to reduce some of his costs by using the system that you set me up with.

Jacy called me the other day and said you guys met... He is a really good guy.. they have three young kids... 

For right now, the best thing that we can do is try to find a nasdaq related fund and possibly by half of that and the balance in some sort of term bond fund. I have not set you the documents back as of yet.

     Hey Barry, how's things going down there. Must be a bit crazy for you 
     Americans about now. By the way, I met your bud Jaycee at a meeting a 
     couple of weeks ago. Seems like a nice guy. I never had a chance to 
     visit with him much, we didn't stick around after the meeting. Maybe 
     next time.
     Was just following up on that stuff I sent. You may have some concerns 
     about now on the suggested funds. Email me if you do.
     
     Rob

I condensed the two charts into one on the ""Santa Clara Load/Supply Profile"" page.  Is it too busy?

Also, I have included two pages (10&11) on the forward value of the EPNG capacity.  Which do you like better?  Regardless of which one we use, we do need to talk about the appropriate SJ/Perm split and physical premiums (if any).

I'll call in the morning.

Eva, I was talking to Jean the other day and she has advised me that you will be working in the Producer One group.  I would like to talk to you about some of the things you worked on this year as they relate to storage development etc... 

Can you contact me early next week to get together for 1/2 hour.

Thanks in advance.

Gerry, I talked to both storey and Lucci late friday... here is the latest.  You had indicated your customer wanted a monthly related price... is that off of Ventura or Harper or both.   

Paul Lucci ( Denver office) will contact you today or Tues., to generate a bid for the Ventura and Harper gas. I talked to storey on Friday and he will work up a firm bid for your customers.   He thinks pricing will be near a Ventura Monthly Index + $ .04. ( that's with no orig to Canada).  That is also with no ancillary deals behind this structure and that is what Lucci is trying to pull together. Paul, can you please investigate nom procedures, potential dry run structure ( Oct. 01) and verify what the structure looks like as the upstream diversions take place.( incl. default positions ).    

At a minimum let's buy the gas and sell it base load to storey.... then ENA - Denver will try to back fill some gas into the deal on a Interruptible basis.

Call if you guys want to discuss. 

regard,  BT

Barry,

As promised, here are some of the current redeployment candidates that have a marketing/structuring/trading background for consideration concerning your West Origination opening.  I believe that you have seen Jim Lowe before and expressed some limited interest in him.  The other candidates are most likely new to you.

Let me know if you would like to pursue any of these redeployed employees.


 << File: Alok Garg.doc >>  << File: Mark Dypiangco.doc >>  << File: Laura Odenthal.doc >>  << File: Audrey O'Neil.doc >>  << File: Jim Lowe.doc >> 

Also, I spoke with Mark McConnell today, and he mentioned that he had accepted the offer to join the Transwestern group of ETS.  He primary motivation for selection of this option was his desire to work with asset deals.  As we know, given EWS ""asset light"" approach to deal making, this option would be difficult to fulfill within the West Origination group.  However, he mentioned that he was very impressed with your group, and short of the asset piece maintained a high interest in your open position.

Regards,
Todd Peikert"

Barry,

Here is a list and the status of the customers I'm dealing with concerning the El Paso Transportation;



Texaco-I have sent the presentation to my rep (Mike Duval) he is trying to arrange a telephone conversation with the appropriate parties within Texaco
Devon-I have sent the presentation to Devon and have had discussions on the subject.  They seem to be somewhat interested but will be slow to move.  They have committed all their San Juan production until April 2002.
Amoco- Talked to my rep who referred me on to the San Juan trader, these two are not very interested, however Dave Fuller has a contact at Amoco who seems to like the theory.
Reliant-I have had multiple conversations with these guys they are not very interested in this capacity.


I will continue to work with Dave on Amoco, as well as Devon and Texaco.  As new information develops I will pass it on.

Paul

Actually, I believe compensation did not properly grant your options at year end and this  grant is to make up for that error.  VPs are handled by executive comp so I don't review or send out that info.  Let me know if you need more info and I'll give you a direct contact.

Timely note, and once again I am already hard at work prospecting for you up here.
They are getting ready to drill CBM this fall. I've been meeting with them on this and actually set them up to do a deal with ATS on production/revenue/lease acctg in the US (next mtg Oct 9 in Calgary).  I gave them a presentation a few weeks ago on the general things we and ATS can do for them in Denver/Dallas.  I want to send them something more specific about all we can do in the Rockies on the gas mktg side.  I'll also build in some data on Hanover for them so will draw that from Producer One.
Can I get some general slides about all the good things Mark and the gang do in Denver.
Timing is next few days.  I'd like to get this to them by sometime Friday if possible (not the end of the world if it's early next week). 
Thanks.

Subject:	Cost of Funds

As we are all aware ENA structuring is applying a Cost of Funds to all transactions that have a '""cost of funds"" implication.  The issue that has surfaced is that the COF is only applicable to originated transactions and not to deals done at the desk level.  This has primary concerns for the mid-market effort.  Due to the noise that was occurring around this topic Joe Deffner suggested that we all get together with him to discuss.  He is available 10/3/01 before 11:00.  Are you interested and available at 9:30 am (today) to participate ?

Please find the attached LOI.  See if it meets with your understanding of the deal.  The document is non-binding but will serve as a framework for the actual agreements.  I will send you draft versions of the other documents on Monday.

Louise, my marketer out of the Portland office had word that a EES marketer ( George Dickinson ) was looking to contact a Utility in the Northwest.... the reason that EES was looking to do this was to work with the utility on gas structures that perhaps the utility could market to some of their customers and EES would help them create or structure ..

This marketing effort is at the core of what ENA - Wholesale Gas is trying to promote and any third part mix into this effort does not help. 

Regardless as to where we are at in our marketing efforts and success to date in these efforts.... Utility business is a ENA customer and I consider them a primary wholesale customer.

I have not discussed this is anyone at EES but in my discussions with my peers was led to believe that this issues was tabled with you already and my comments would support your conversations with EES on our behalf.

Pls advise if you need to discuss or require anything from me.

regards,

Patrick, sorry for the short notice to try to catch up with you in L.A. this week.  As mentioned, I am responsible for the Gas Marketing efforts in the West. For a variety of reasons we have been slow in contacting you but I know that from a Trading perspective you have a strong relationship with our staff and were probably getting covered on most items you were needing. 

My groups interests are around transportation, risk management, Strategic Assets, storage etc... .items that we believe are more of a term fit that real time position management issue.  

We spend a lot of time on fundamentals, research, hedging strategies, load forecasting etc.

You had mentioned being in town in early November and if your schedule allows I would welcome the chance to get together.

Please contact me as you know your calendar and in the interim.... if I end up in the city prior to the end of the month, I may try to contact you then.

Thanks in advance.

I have talked to Sierra Pacific and they have some storage... I will advise.

I think fuller was doing some leg work also.

Do you think there are any displacement issues that they may be forced to adhere to that would no allow them to shift flows?

Also, are you able to replicate the delivery point off of JP to make this happen?

Tych,

Just wondering if you guys have talked to any storage guys in the PNW about storage deals for this Nov to next summer ect. The market is essentially saying that JP storage is worthless for this winter (Nov-Dec) and I don't think that should be the case. I think there is free money on the table for someone like Puget or Avista to roll their scheduled storage withdrawls to next summer. Let me know if you have any thoughts.

To that end, a representative form Mastio will be in to provide a demonstration of the system at 10:30 Tuesday October 16.  Please notify Kim Bates if you are interested in attending.

Jeff, I was talking to Mike Etringer yesterday regarding this subject and he gave me the name of the CFO Ted Craver. I understand that you guys were dealing with John Fielder.  
 
For sure we want to know what they are up to.  I think like all deals in California we are going to run into issues with credit, and probably paper but that would pretty much depend on the counterparty. ( is it edison), or DWR? 
 
It is VERY important that trading and marketing are aware of the hedging activities in a very timely fashion so however we need to ensure that happens will be my plan. 
 
Do you know the CFO ?

As you guys know the 2003 PGT expansion plans are supposed to be 230,000/day. The landscape of the shippers list is ever changing... Rumors of PPL pulling out 85,000/day to Malin and Stanfield is unconfirmed ( we are trying to validate)... and potentially Avista pulling out as they have been downgraded... they hold 35,000/day in 2003. Combined this is almost half of the planned expansion. 

Although not confirmed the bottom line is as the 03 shippers back out the expansion it becomes compromised and ultimately I believe the 2002 expansion and 2003 expansion start to blend together. As you guys know the 2002 shippers lists of 211,000 / day is made up 2 shippers Calpine 35,000/day and Newport Gen 175,000/day and this expansion has it's own issues.  

As we know more about shippers moving around I will pass on... pls do same.

Further to our conversation please find attached the curves on the JM Huber transaction that we have agreed to work off of. The 30,000/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with HUBER is effectively completed. In the event that this deal does not close, then the West desk will resume with the same MTM risks that you presently have.  

Any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk... plus ENA Orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals. 

In addition to the transportation income being generated, additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks. I believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book ( by Mark Whitt ) and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly.

I trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and I am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone..

Pls review file and if there are any questions give me a call.

BT

Eric, pls ensure that this meeting comes with a defined plan from legal for discussions related to capacity release ( purchase or sale ) at full tolls, discount or premium. In addition to this and most importantly what is ENA's legal position on the disclosure of commercial terms that accompany and structured transportation agreement. I.E. if we buy gas at a market based rate and assign capacity to the customer ( at full tolls ) are we going to be required to post the commercial terms to the street.

Assuming that our bid's stay in the range discussed previously, what are we going to do? 

I am not going to hard trade the buyers at this point until we know for sure Suncor is there.. 

So, can you pls advise. 

I would suggest we get Suncor to give you a ""Stand Still"" for the rest of this week which includes a firm number ( or better ) that they will sell capacity for. By the way, this number needs to be close to zero as there is not much left over.


Current economics.... approx $400,000 Bid on the table, plus ENA holds option Apr 02 - oct 02 to put capacity to buyer.  Under this structre Suncor keeps capacity until Apr. 02. There are no liquids conversations being conducted at this time and pending structure may not be.

None of the financial markets support premium payments ( for any term ). 

Give me a call.

As you guys know the 2003 PGT expansion plans are supposed to be 230,000/day. The landscape of the shippers list is ever changing... Rumors of PPL pulling out 85,000/day to Malin and Stanfield is unconfirmed ( we are trying to validate)... and potentially Avista pulling out as they have been downgraded... they hold 35,000/day in 2003. Combined this is almost half of the planned expansion. 

Although not confirmed the bottom line is as the 03 shippers back out the expansion it becomes compromised and ultimately I believe the 2002 expansion and 2003 expansion start to blend together.

Jessica, it appears that we pay a monthly fee of $ 89.99 / mth plus monthly optional charges and all long distance and local charges.  I would like to discuss the details of a bill. What is this base fee, are there other plans available? Are we getting any value in using cingular ( especially this plan). How many minutes are we getting what are the  long distance and roaming rates? 

In aggregate, my monthly cell phone bill for my group looks to be around $1,400 - $ 2,000/mth for 7 people total and this is a little high. 

Also, pls verify who has cell phones in Denver and what the monthly bills look like for this office.

Lorelie, attached is a Price Distribution table that is set up as a template for SPPC Power load as it relates to market prices  and load.  As you can see, this distribution protects your rate base against a rising price environment and partially floats with market prices as they move down.  The distribution ( fixed price vs floating ) may move up a percent or two in relation to the outright price desk that we face today ( relative to the historical numbers) but those iterations can be made as required.

Pls review and we can discuss at your convenience.

Also, as discussed, I am looking for ways to enhance our ability to transact with you on gas structures but in light of the overall credit positions that may be difficult.  With that being said however, I do believe that we can stream some structures to the physical contracts in gas and ensure that from the physical point of view ENA and SPPC are both protected and I would like to pursue this with you. One area that I would like to start with to have SPPC sell ENA physical gas ( 30,000/40,000/day) against a physical gas daily related price.  Once I have accumulated a payables position, we inherently create a secured line without having to change any of the contracts/paper currently in place.  I am also sure this will require further discussions and look forward to catching up with you soonest.

regards, 

Barry Tycholiz

Louise, further to our conversation of yesterday... here is a list ( in order of priority) that I have reviewed with the Denver office.  In all cases, if Fred's group is able to make a case that the CFO truly is the financial contact, then we are prepared to leave as is.... otherwise as per Mark's note, I would like to clarify the marketing role regarding all Rockies and San Juan producers ( both physical and paper ) and transfer the primary responsibilities back to the Denver office as we had always planned.

Pls review and advise if you need anything further.

In all cases except for Hallwood, ENA Denver has a relationship with these customers that primarily covers their physical business, we would like to expand that business to cover their Derivative business as well.  The list is based on priority.  We would be willing to cover them for their West Gas business only.  Fred could continue to cover their East, Central and Oil/Liquids business.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

I have decided for at least the next week or so to defer my travel plans ( I am not the best flyer at the best of times )..

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

Where were you flying to?  

I turned 39 yesterday... that sucks....

Kim has worked one 8 hour shift in a year... not exactly pounding the hours and the way the stock is going she might need to put together a few more shifts than that.

How much longer for school for you? ... I know you will do fine!!

All in all things are going pretty good, work is OK, pretty busy myself.  

What have you guys been up to? Traveling sure sucks now...  How is Bryn?  

Are there anymore Canadian E&P Co.'s left... it seems like they have all been bought up by U.S. Kids?.. how is the House? 

I noticed Anandarko... wrote down $ 464 MM because of their Canadian assets... could that be the Berkley indigestion? 

I better run.. come and visit me soon.. but let's talk sooner.

best regards,

BT

I was going to add a footnote to this note but thought I didn't need to as I know for a fact ( by individual ) that we do not have any issues in West Gas Orig.  This note was for your information only to reflect the increased level of expectations that Mike holds his trading organization to and I support this completely.

Your work hours are not in question... nor are those of Denver, and Houston based origination. However I will reiterate that we need to get back to basics and stay focused and I will promote that message given every opportunity.

Also, Louise has reviewed the headcount plan submitted for 2002 and asked that we reduce the West Origination count by one.  The attached file shows what was initially submitted.  If you will let me know what position to eliminate, I will make the necessary adjustments.

Mark, attached is a file regarding what the payment structures could look like. The plug is the total PV $'s that we will put towards the equation... other than that it is simply a demand charge calculation.

Pls coordinate and let me know.

Subject: Natural Gas Origination


Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John"

Jeff, Gas Daily has an article on DWR activities for purchasing gas.... do you know Pete Garris and is he the guy we want to get together with... or is Balwin's co. going to carry the ball. I remain unclear as to who actually is doing the gas buying..

Further to our conversation of last week... let's meet with these guys soonest.

Dave,

I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning. I don't really feel that it is Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer. If you would like we could look at doing an  MSA with Cascade where by we could sell them gas at Sumas DI.

I am not waiting for the stock... just cash now.  Don't know if I will get enough of that either.  

I don't mind working for a few more years.. just don't want it to be 20 more.

I don't think I will be in Denver that early.... What's going on?

Calgary, Who knows????? 

Stock meltdown is a long story... perhaps a bit more rumor than fact but that doesn't matter much at this moment.. we are in preservation mode right now.... but I believe things will be fine. All in all we have had the best year ever, the street just hated the way we set up some of our off balance sheet vehicles because they created conflict of interest...time will tell who is correct.

Better run, let's talk soon.

Barry,
Sorry for not getting back to you. The Power MTM positions are approx $570,000 and all related to physical positions with a total Net Power  position of approx $1.2MM. I have been working with Beverly Ikeda of Puget on the issues and so far so good. Puget is going to deliver a $10MM  Letter of Credit to cover the financial positions. From our conversations, her traders do not anticipate hedging any further and really only need access to short term EOL business. In addition, she and I discussed the needs of bilateral contracts with margining rights to prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future. 

Thanks,

Subject:	RE: QF payments

There may be a handful of small QFs which have not returned but I would say the a majority of the QFs are back on line and are being paid for what they generate on a go forward basis.  Right now the SCE QFs are negotiating with SCE on 2 major points:  when will they be paid for the outstanding receivables (est. at $1.3 B for SCE and about $1.0 B for PG&E)  and when will the 5 yr fixed price SRAC of 5.37 cents/kw apply for those that have selected this option.  Right now SCE appears to be indicating that they will be paying the receivable sometime around June/July of 2002 and that the 5.37 price would apply at that time or as much as 4 months after that.  The logic is that they are trying to indicate that the MOU, if it had been passed, would not have applied at least until that time.

Mike, have the QF's been paid for the power they were selling to the utilities.  I have not heard much about that and was wondering if these payments were all part of the Bond issue.? Are the QF's generating power today?

Chad,  hope trading is going well.  Weather has been cool so I expect Sumas
basis has been tightening appropriately.   Per our conversation last week,
attached is my resume for your consideration.  Please pass on to the
appropriate people.   I am motivated in finding a position with a
progressive marketing company who could use my experience and knowledge of
the NW gas and electric market and where I can be part of a team that has
much larger view on the markets..   I definitely know that Enron fits that
model...

Thanks, Kevin

Thank you for meeting with us this week. Speaking on behalf of Enron U.S. I know there was some very good clarification, information and hopefully action required by all the parties.

I look forward to working through some transportation/supply structures and will contact you next week to discuss.

I have also met with our legal team to discuss the commercial and legal issues related to the GISB ( under 30 day firm agreement ) and need to discuss the details with you to see if we can get the proper paper completed. I have also raised a draft Master Firm agreement ( to handle term structures) and will begin to review this for early next week also.

Morris... if ENA were to sell options to a third party and receive the option premium up front... for example $ 10MM $'s.... would that be considered taxable income?

We would also be buying the option from another party or hedging this structure and this cash would be used to offset future liabilities related to the deal.

I am very interested in what the wholesale customers have to say about our issues.  Do they have a mandate to not trade, are they wanting to turn down their exposures etc. If any customers say this, then let me know.

BT - Pardon my spelling.... I like to think its more of a typing issue, however.  

Regarding uranium:

Prices for oxide (mined material) are up from a low of $7.10 last December to a new high this month of $9.20 (still low by historical standards).  Perhaps more important though, fuel cycle components (conversion & enrichment) are very strong.  Conversion at $5.00 up from $2.20, enrichment at $105.00 up from $80.00.  These fuel cycle components are required to turn ore into fuel. - DF

If you have time, give me a call and you can update me on things you are looking for.

Jeff, I will arrive late evening tonight. I have a car and will talk to you enroute to Sacremento.  I am staying and meeting with SMUD at 11:30 - 1:00 and then probably meeting with PG&E on tues at 3:30.  I will either leave for Houston tues night or weds a.m. pending any possible meeting with SocalEd in L.A.  If we cannot meet with them this week, then I may reconsider that trip for next week. 

Thanks, BT

Jaime, thanks for setting up last weeks meetings... I thought the time together was well spent and there is some action items required on all parties.

We will follow up directly with Pemex on some contractual issues and potential transport deals.

Did you get anywhere with regards to your regulatory matters? 

Is there any specific action required by west gas at this time, if so, pls contact me to coordinate?

We need to figure out how much short term and long term obligations Pemex believes they will have in the next 1 - 5,10 years.  The more obligation they have at the border, the better off we are..

What they used to deliver upstream of the border, we can replace for them synthetically. 

Pls update and let's discuss in next couple of days.

Good morning Barry:

I am attaching a copy of my updated resume.  I am looking forward to meeting with you to discuss any possible opportunities that you may have in your group.  I began the Analyst Program in July and have been working in Generation Investments under Carl Tricoli.  The experience has been tremendous thus far.  We discovered last week that our group is being restructured and I am forced to look for re-deployment.  Thank you for time and consideration.

Dave, I have discussed the schedule related to orig track and until further notice, we will suspend interviews and discussions.  Louise does expect that this program will continue but agrees that at this time, priorities lie elsewhere! 

Pls contact me if there are any questions, otherwise can you coordinate with Karen Buckley ( et al ).  Let's re-visit program in mid-december.

Bill, as part of our conference call this a.m.... please have Debbie identify the top 20 companies that we have out of the money positions to and that we would want to assign in the money deals to. Included in this list we must know the contractual terms of these counter parties including, company name, collateral threshold limits, collateral posted, type of contract ( gas or power ...etc.) Physical or financial. Master Netting... 

In addition to this, we must determine if we can cross pollinate agreements... I.E... a gas agreement is used to offset a power position or vice versa.

Lot's of questions but to start, let's get your list of "" Co's who are seeking collateral from us today"" and fill in some of these blanks. 

Thanks, BT "

Jay, do we have copy's of all the executed documents... and if so, where are you going to put them. 
Also, did we change the counterparty names in the system and put in offsetting transactions with SOCAL etc.... and new positions with PG&E.  These need to go into the system. MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THIS.

Barry, what did you do to the company!?  Listen, sorry to hear about the 
problems at ENRON.  What a strange turn of events.  It is pretty bizarre 
after 10 years of ENRON being the model for other companies on how to 
succeed in the energy industry. What's your take on why it happened?  We get 
a little bit of news down here but we're a little out of touch.

How are you taking it?  Are you pissed? Do you feel like you squeezed pretty 
much what you wanted out of the job? What's the next thing for Barry Tic?  
Well, like all of life's curve-balls there is always something sweet in the 
next pitch you get (jeez, how sappy is that!).  Anyway, hope you're taking 
it all with the good nature you always do.

Hey, maybe this will give you the chance to take a holiday in Ecuador 
(Christmas turkey at our house this year?).  Say hi to Kim for us, drop me a 
line as soon as you can (a better address to reach me is craigh@ph.com.ec).  
Sorry I haven't sent a note before this but you know we are always rooting 
for you.

Your pal, Craig.

Leon, the account number in the original document is actually not incorrect. This was the account to which the funds were to have been deposited to. However, SCE deposited the funds to a different account.  As a result, I agree that we should amend the document to reflect that the account where these funds where they actually ere actually sent and this will conclude our busines. 

Your file did not come over correctly but if you could hand correct the original documents by changing the banking instructions and fax to me, i will provide proper signatures on amendment and we are done.

Mr. Tycholiz:

I represent SCE's Energy Supply and Marketing Department with respect to
the above-referenced subject.  It is my understanding that the account
number in Section 2 of the Transaction Agreement Regarding Collateral
(""Agreement"") is incorrect.  I propose that the parties correct the error
by lining out the incorrect number and inserting by hand the correct one.
I have drafted and attached a letter agreement reflecting that intention.
Please review and call me at your earliest opportunity so tht we may
discuss further.  Thank you.

I tried to call you last night around 6:00.  I was unable to leave a message on your home machine or cell.  Really nothing too pressing but Schonne is wanting to follow up with us on our plans.. I did talk to him and told him not to assume that our PGT capacity will go to NEWCO, because NEWCO does not really exist and may never... SO, I told him to review  the tariff and make a determination as to whether or not it is still ours to use, if it isn't, then we don't really need to talk.. it they determine it is still ours, then we need to think about what the estate should do with it, including the upstream parts.  
 
Call me this a.m.

stephanie, I know that Ed McMicheal has appointed someone from the estate to start to consolidate all of our transportation positions ( if any remain ) and also our obligaitons.  I will confirm his name and from here on in, you may be asked only to assist, not lead these discussions.  However, for the purposes of PGT ( at this time ), I would ask that you continue on your path of resolution. 
 
I will follow up with Canada this a.m. to ascertain what they have done with the NOVA and ANG portions.

Subject: Contractual Obligations Associated with Long Term Pipeline Contract



Greetings Steve:

We have had many inquiries regarding our transportation agreements, specifically PGT, Kern River and El Paso.  

Most pressing is PGT's request to market capacity on our behalf. Although I do not believe we need to have PGT perform this function, I do believe we could mitigate some demand charge exposure for ""the estate"".  

Are you available to meet with Barry and I first thing tomorrow morning? We need to have an answer for PGT's request. We need to know what the contractual rights are for 1) the pipeline when a shipper declares bankruptcy and 2) our ability to mitigate demand charge exposure by releasing capacity on a short term basis (month at a time?).

Better yet, can we unilaterally turn capacity back to any of these pipes or do we need to reach some type of court approved settlement?

Obviously, we have many questions. Please advise of your ability to meet ASAP.

Thanks,

Stephanie

I am still here and probably will be here until atleast the end of Feb.  I have had to lay off about 5 of 12 people which includes outright termination ot allocation to the estate( clean up, bucket brigade ).  I have been designated to go to the NEWCO which is the trading and marketing core asset business that will be sold lock stock and barrel to a Wall Street firm.  It is looking ok at this time and we will find out in the next couple of weeks what happens.  

We are still planning to be home for christmas and plan on seeing you guys... somehow.

Lorelie, I know we did not get to finish our conversation. call me on Friday ( if you so desire or have time) . 

In thinking through this issue, I am not really sure that it matters how these deals are now being confirmed, nominated or paid. settled or netted against. I am not even sure that we can do anything to change them once we filed.  

There is a good chance I am not thinking about it properly and will be happy to discuss on friday.

Thanks,

Thanks for looking after this.  I am not as interested in who or how we spent the money, but more so on where our estimates were off.  The whole reason for setting up and getting approval is being accountable to the plan. 

Give me a call.... when you have a moment.

I will need to get an actual cost for the airfare and anything that was expensed to be able to give you a complete cost of the event.  I will contact Jessica to get this information from her.  I will then include it and send it back to you.

The bill has not been paid. As soon as I got it I put the list together for you.   I am sending it to accounts payable to get paid tomorrow.

Steph, what do you think about RFPing the PGT capacity if and when we get a standstill from Suncor...I was thinking we could send to SMUD, Morgan Stanley, Calpine, perhaps avista.  It might be a bit radical... but perhaps can drive out the highest value.

Pls hunt down a contact who handles this and find out if they want to see our piece.  We will probably have 10,000 MMBtu/day. starting out of Nov 2002. 23 years. at expansion rates.

I don't believe that the agreement you had sent to me for Cochrane is the latest version. I thought we executed a new agreement with tiered volumes... can you have someone re-check this and get back to me.

Eric, can you have someone fax to me a copy of the TCPL Cochrane shrink agreement and also the PC ( empress ) shrink agreement.  SPPC has asked me to help her figure out the deal she has and I need to refresh on paper issues. Don't know if there is a deal here or not?

Jeff, thanks again for attending the discussions with DWR.

Do you have any recon.... on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on. As Mark indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.'

There is a zero sum game on fuel... but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it! 

Any thoughts.

Mike, I have asked INA to check into the coordination of a tour for our group( trading and marketing) prior to the official move in.

I would like to restrict the attendees to the commercial staff, traders and marketers... and this will give everyone a chance to see the new digs.. and then I would also like to suggest that we all slide out to the local watering hole for a drink... it is long overdue.. 

Any suggestions on a date, perhaps 3:00 - 3:30 for a tour.. then out for a drink... what about next tues.... 

Pls advise.

Meeting with PG&E went OK... they are unable to commit to a letter that I had sent them on swapping out some capacity, but still very much want to trade with us and would like trade access to EOL.  PROGRESS I guess.... 

Flights were good.. got home around 1:45 am houston time, so it was a long day... 

IF you think we can get the plant names they they are have the toll on.. .that would be great.

On 9/15/01, Enron failed to take full volume at Harper on T1134F.  This
backed up to Aeco.  Tenaska is planning on purchasing this gas at Aeco daily
for 9/16/01.  The volume not taken is 1,917 dth at Harper.  This equates to
2,103 gj's @NIT.  I don't know why Enron did not pull all of the gas.
Please let me know if you do not agree with selling to Tenaska.  
If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks Theresa

Barry,

My name is Alisha Mahabir and I have been working on negotiating the MGI/ENA GISB.  I have been in contact with Lourdes Cervantes at MGI; her phone number is 525-232-5990.  There are still a few issues left to be resolved before we can proceed with the execution of this document.  Per Geral Nemec's request, I will outline these changes as they are addressed in Exhibit B to the GISB that was sent over by Lourdes.

Initially I want to note that some changes must be made to the front page of the GISB.  MGI has previously agreed to allow ENA to be the confirming party under Section 2.5.  Additionally, there have been a few problems with allowing payment to be made on the 30th day of the month.  It appears that MGI has been construing this provision broadly so as to make payment on the 2nd day of March after a short month in February.  Thus, we would like Section 7.2 to read ""30th day or, for the Month of February, on the last day of the Month"".  

As for Exhibit B, the changes are as follows:

#4 The words ""or interruptible"" should be deleted from this provision.  The interruptible language conflicts with the ability to do 30 day firm deals under this contract.

#11 This provision deals with when notices are deemed received.  The provision as written provides that notice by first class mail is deemed received 2 business days after mailing.  MGI would like to change this to allow for receipt to mean actual receipt.  Lourdes told me that she will check to see whether the change can be stricken or at least to extend 2 business days to 3 business days.

#12 (a) MGI has agreed to strike the term ""letter"" from the requirement that the Parent issue a guarantee should doubt arise as to Enron's ability to pay.  
      (b)  Originally the GISB provides that a contract can be terminated without prior notice should certain conditions be met.  MGI wants to change this to require the parties to provide 48 hours notice.  Lourdes told me that she would check to see whether this could be changed to 24 hours prior notice.

#16  The language designating ICC is acceptable, however any redundant language should be stricken.

If this memo is at all unclear, please feel free to call me.  My extension is 52722.  

Alisha Mahabir"

Hello Barry,

My name is Todd Neugebauer and I am a manager in EBS Wholesale Origination in Europe.  I came over here as an associate in February and was promoted in June.  I am looking to move back into one of our more core areas and Ted Bland recommended I speak to you, or someone in your group.  If you have a need, I am going to be in Houston late next week and would be able to meet then to discuss any opportunities.

Regards,

Todd

Randy Maffet would be a good reference, if needed.

Pls do not restrict my ability to kill my career.... the problem with me sending this note internally is that they would probably want to hire the writer of this note to help restructure some of our outstanding agreements.

Mark, thanks for seeing us this week. 

I am working internally to get our corporation over the top on the primary contractual and credit issues and believe I am making progress. I shall get back to you soonest.   

Can you please advise as to the payables policy of DWR. For example, if I were to sell you gas via Enron Online for the month of November, would DWR be paying that invoice on the 25th of the month following delivery? 

Is there any possibility that this could get paid on the 5th of the month following delivery( at least in the beginning).

WOW.... I am positive that your beautiful wife did not sign up for hauling three rug rats( plus 1 dad )  around the back streets of London.... what have you done???? 

I would love to talk market conditions with you but I think we are banned from doing any work for the next three months while this co. continues to fucks with my money.... HACKS !!! 

Although not bitter, for years I have heard the story about being paid fair value for a job well done.. and that my time was coming...( just around the corner).... !! little did I know that when I made that turn, some guy named Jerome.( take a minute to imagine) ...was standing there with a baseball bat looking to smack my head a few times just to make sure I knew I wasn't quite there yet.

Kids are doing well... my boys turned 1 in September and running rampant
around our house... the rest of the family including myself are scared of

sometimes wonder where she came from.
Josee has her hands full at home right now and after a weekend I am more

Markets have been choppy... my trading strategy over the past 2 months has
been very simple however.. as Randolph Duke said in the OJ futures pit on

Will send you a picture soon.. 
say hi to the wife for us.

Subject:	ENE comps

Grant, ENE trades at 7x 2001 expected recurring earnings and 0.9 times book value.  This is far lower than a quick industry average of 15.5 times 2001 expected earnings and 2.8 times current book value (industry includes Duke, EL Paso, Williams, Dynegy, Kinder Morgan, and Aquila).  I think what these ratios demonstrate is the risk of the unknown that is being priced into ENE.  For example the current price to book seems like a suspect ratio to use for ENE given that it is unclear what is on our books and what else needs to be written down.  If you look at ENE on a price to earnings after non-recurring items for 2001 it looks far less attractive at 22.9 times.  If you take ENE's earnings after ""non-recurring"" items and slap on the industry average multiple of 15.5 times ENE's share price is $8.51 (ouch).  Now obviously not everything in the non-recurring events are actually recurring but there is talk of some wholesale losses being buried in the ""non-recurring"" loss.

ENE's long-term debt to equity is 0.9 times but if you include all the off balance sheet leverage and the leverage inherent in our trading business the true number is significantly higher than 0.9 times.  On a positive note the ENE's debt is trading higher today (price not yield).

Here is a spreadsheet from Bloomberg with the S&P pipelines sub sector P/Es, and P/Bs. and dividend per share (ENE's is 4%, nothing like a share price falling by 85% to get that div yield up).  I have also attached the latest Wall Street Journal article touting Berkshire, Royal Dutch, and GE as potential suitors (do you think Buffet can understand ENE?).

Hope this helps

Ray... seems like its been a while since we met in San Fransisco, ....  and of course so much has happened since then. 

I have been talking with our in house legal and with Canada and I know Eric and yourself have also been talking. I believe that the door has been pushed open a little and if everyone tries to get these agreements cleaned up  and executed that PG&E and Enron ( Canada & US ) can start to transact.

With that being said, there are two areas which I would like to refresh from our discussions..

1.  Did you give any further thought to the utilization of Daily gas sales as a collateral.. I truly believe that this vehicle is a very efficient,easy way for PG&E to enhance the credit with ENA and once we have a 30 day bucket... we can get you trading access to EOL.  Lot's of details to work out, but I would like to keep this discussion at the forefront. I can send the details of how this proposal would work if required. ( let me know ) 

2.  As discussed, ENA holds some 5 year El Paso capacity. I am looking to assign this capacity and possibly and would like to investigate your supply requirements and possible alternatives such that you can consider our capacity.  

I trust all is well and look forward to talking to you soon.

Amy, can you add the cash and rest of month price for Henry Hub onto your daily pricing sheet. I think the cash to futures spreads for pretty relevant in today's market place as the cash market continues to trade well below futures.

Jeff, thanks again for attending the discussions with DWR.

Do you have any recon.... on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on. As Mark indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.'

There is a zero sum game on fuel... but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it! 

Any thoughts.

Good morning Chris.  Further to our conversation of yesterday.  

I believe that your skillset would be a positive addition to the West Gas origination group. We can provide for you a new learning experience by becoming a key component of the team. You will be asked to provide real time modeling, DCF, research on wellhead to burner tip strategies. You will learn a tremendous amount about the Natural gas business with exposure stemming from the wellhead to the burner tip. Some areas include, commodity price risk structures, risk management initiatives, financial and physical markets, structured products and transportation related initiatives.  

Please use this note as a formal offer of employment. I would like you to start as soon as you can.. ( next 2 weeks) and will leave this for you to think about until the end of day on Monday. 

Pls contact me directly if there are any questions regarding this note or any other matters. 

regards, Barry Tycholiz

Barry,

Do you want to call Bill and set up a joint power/gas meeting or do you want to pursue this separately?

In the end, he suggested that we call Bill Gaines, VP Energy Supply.

Then he said something to the effect of ""of course, we're not at all interested in a more comprehensive outsourcing product.""

Bill's number is 425.462.3145.  He said that we can tell Bill, Rick suggested we call him directly.  "

Thanks for the reply.. 

Let's talk asap regarding this transportation. I can send you a summary sheet as to what we are looking to place. You had indicated that your a larger portion of your load is south. We have some 1,2 year service starting now, and we have the five year to PG&E.( we also have the baja).  

25th of month following on payables is normal protocol...that works fine!

I had assumed that for starting out, we would only work on sales to you on a Cash basis, or very short term( intra-month).


Thanks in advance,  Barry Tycholiz

Barry,

It was a pleasure to discuss the upcoming gas supply needs of DWR and the
potential supply options that Enron may be able to provide . I am interested
in further exploring the discounted transportation/ supply program we
briefly discussed at this week's meeting. As for the payables, DWR is
following standard payment terms; the latter of 10 days after receipt of
invoice or the 25th of the month following delivery. DWR would not agree to
accelerating payments. Additionally, please be advised that DWR would be
contemplating relatively short term transactions with Enron at this time. If
you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call.

Mark Baldwin, IGS.

Ray... seems like its been a while since we met in San Fransisco, ....  and of course so much has happened since then. 

I have been talking with our in house legal and with Canada and I know Eric and yourself have also been talking. I believe that the door has been pushed open a little and if everyone tries to get these agreements cleaned up  and executed that PG&E and Enron ( Canada & US ) can start to transact.

With that being said, there are two areas which I would like to refresh from our discussions..

1.  Did you give any further thought to the utilization of Daily gas sales as a collateral.. I truly believe that this vehicle is a very efficient,easy way for PG&E to enhance the credit with ENA and once we have a 30 day bucket... we can get you trading access to EOL.  Lot's of details to work out, but I would like to keep this discussion at the forefront. I can send the details of how this proposal would work if required. ( let me know ) 

2.  As discussed, ENA holds some 5 year El Paso capacity. I am looking to assign this capacity and possibly and would like to investigate your supply requirements and possible alternatives such that you can consider our capacity.  

I trust all is well and look forward to talking to you soon.

Mike, from what I am hearing, we will not get into the 6th floor to show the staff around ( prior to the move in).  I still think it would be timely for all of us to get together for a drink but in light of this small logistical issue we may want to postpone until we move in and then go out next week. 

Once things settle down ( assuming they do) I look forward to talking specifically to you regarding increased initiatives on our parts to ensure we are getting everything we can out of marketing and trading efforts.  It is my observation that we have not made the progress I would have liked in terms of information flow... and although there has been progress, there is a ways to go. This probably has as much to do with individuals as it does anything else.

Looking forward to those discussions.

Bill,as requested,  I talked to Michael Tribolet last week and he felt that transactions under 1 year would be ok with PG&E Company . I would like to take the next step with them and assuming we get paper executed for ECC and ENA ( which is pending).... I want to give them TRADE ACCESS TO EOL.  

Cumulative unsecured exposure would be about $300,000/day. ( estimated ) and  I would try to get the payments from them to us made on the 5th business day vs the 25th business day following delivery. Our master will give us rights for reasonable financial assurances but not definative collateral threshold amount, infact we should keep this at zero for both sides until the air clears. 

All transactions will come through EOL and the products being sold by ENA, ECC will be cash or rest of month, AECO, Sumas, Malin or PG&E Citygate.

The bottom line on this is do we want to enter into Gas related cash transactions that increase of exposure on a receivables basis to PG&E.  Commercially, I believe they are someone we want to do business with and we can increase deal flow on EOL for some Canadian and U.S. products. I do not think we are in a position today to ask for pre-pays. 
 
Please advise if any questions otherwise I am seeking the GREEN Light from you to take the next step.

regards, BT "

Please respond with available dates for those you assist ASAP.  We are looking to interview candidates toward the end of November, ideally November 26-30.  
 
Attached is the list of the management team as well as assistants.  Please inform me of any incorrect data I have.  
 
I will call you later today to discuss in more detail and confirm dates.

Entering into term agreements with Enron today is probably not the best play until our credit / restructuring issues are resolved.  What are you thinking about? 

All is fine, hanging in there, pissed off like you would not believe... but not much I can do now but wait it out.. I have very little interest moving back to canada at this time so it should be interesting.

Bill, FYI, I have received a formal request from PGT asking Enron to provide security on their pipeline.  The request is for approx $ 11MM. They are referencing a provision in their tariff  that says that if a co. goes below BBB by S&P, then they have the right to ask for security.

I have discussed this request with them and they assure me we are not being singled out. I told them we will review the letter with credit and management and get back to them prior to the deadline imposed on their request( Nov. 20).

A copy of this request will be on your desk first thing this a.m.

regards, BT

Carl, just wanted you to know that I have decided to NOT offer William a rotation in west gas and I have talked to him this a.m.

As discussed, I like his basic skill sets but I decided this a.m. to hold off for the next 2 weeks or so before filling any spots for the end of the year.  I am sure he will find a good rotation, just wasn't the best fit for me at this time.

I've updated the spreadsheet to show the payables totals for the existing and proposed deals as Jan 25, 2002 and July 25, 2002, respectively.  I have also modified the payables calculation to consider only 2002 prices, as this is the applicable period for our exercise.

Leslie, I presented a form of assignment to PG&E as recently as 2 weeks ago( including other structures).. Generally speaking, they HATE the El Paso pipe because of it's flow risk and are not interested in discussing this with me until such time that EL Paso deliverability becomes more reliable. 

Having them take this pipe as a vehicle to help offset our bankruptcy claim works from an economics point of view ( assuming you can agree on values), but I think you will have a battle regaring the quality of service that they are going to get. Regardless, it is a an out of the money position for us and we could accomodate if they wish to discuss further. Have Lisa or Michael call me if they wish to discuss logistics around this asset.

Thanks, BT

Steffes and I were just chatting and an idea came up, that we try to offer our El Paso capacity to PG&E in their bankruptcy suit (in which a settlement is being negotiated) and perhaps we can, in turn, reduce our claim against PG&E in that case.  Maybe this is already being done, but if not, it is a thought.  Lisa Mellencamp and Michael Tribolet are doing the bankruptcy case. "

Dave, although we need to track deal count, I continue to get orig amounts granted to you for $ 40.00... that is to small a number to worry about... I would think $ 500.00 / transaction would be a better cut line...

Subject:	Heidi Dubose Performance Issues


As a follow up to the written warning on August 14, 2001 to Heidi Dubose regarding her poor job performance I would like to submit the following commentary:

Heidi's phone coverage is still very inadequate.  I have had two discussions with her in the last 2 weeks regarding this.  She consistently does not take messages properly.  Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding.  When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time.  She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled.

The kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty.  She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them.  If she does it is after they have been in there for days.

We continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs.


In summary, Heidi's performance has improved some since August 14 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis.  She has not elevated her performance to the level which is required to manage the office.

As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?

Thanks,

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.  "

Howard, can you please verify what you mean by renewal rights.. specifically who owns what rights and until which period.

It is my expectation that with the exception of CNRL, ENA/ECC holds the obligation and annual renewal rights on Nova, ANG. We have assigned the PGT permanently out of Nov 08 to Calpine and Sierra Pacific.. We also have the obligation to give them the matching upstream capacity at that time.

Also, where do you think AEC, Talisman and CNRL will be to take permanent assignment of this pipe effective asap... thus changing the deal delivery point around..( an the credit situation). 

Included in the shuffle will be the liquids obligations, nominations, ( ENA /ECC can still act as the agent) but most importantly the thing we need to transfer over is the pipe obligation on PGT..... stat !!! 
 
Pls advise.

Chris, why does Puget have credit concerns with us?  It was my understanding that we had a MTM of $50 MM in which they were out of the money.I thought the risk was realtively short term. ( winter Gas).  You would think that they would be fine with loading up on Enron. Irony comes in all shapes and sizes when a LDC doesn't like our credit!!!! 

With regards to a meeting.... I have yet to make my way up that way, and would still like to make that tour which includes Puget, Northwest Natural, Cascade etc. 

I think that a meeting with these guys on a consolidated risk management plan would  be ideal.  I will call you today.

Thanks for the note back.... yeah, I am still kicking.... and I am sure you know this that it will take a little more than a bankruptcy to shake this guy... when I grab on , I grab on tight.... 

Sorry for putting you through the inconvenience of having to read our documents.. I think we have all had to dust off the paper... but I sincerely hope most of it is behind us. 

I knew Karen was at Progas, glad to hear that she is enjoying work... 

I have not been to Calgary since May, and am not sure when I will be back up... and if it will be on a permanent of temporary basis.... all in all Houston is treating us pretty good.  Work really has been great and I have such a good marketing region... california, arizona, Denver.... vegas... are some of the highlights... so when I need to, I go blow a few braincells out in one of these fine regions..

Kim is working a little ( 2 shifts in 1 year).... she may have to pick up the pace on that effort... ( she is fighting me on that one)... House is good, weather right now is great... 80 degrees ( all the time)... there is something to be said about living in shorts and sandals... 

Better run, take care, talk soonest.

Paul, thanks for the note... do we have a position with these guys today either in the form of MTM or payables/receivables? 

Like everyone else, the street continues to pick it's spots on new dealings with us but I wouldn't mind knowing what our existing exposures are to them.

As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  

I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, ""it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new.""

If one of the exercises is to standardize ( as best as possible the two agreements) I think we need to create a document that identifies the variance in the agreements. Has this been done and if so, can I have a copy to review. I have gone through both the US and Canadian agreements but am not sure where some of the subtle differences lie.

Call if you want to discuss.

Mike, here is a very brief overview of planned or approved expansions by major pipeline.  There is a lot of detail that supports each of these pipe expansions including, proposed start dates, delivery points, probability etc... 

Let's discuss needs...

Perhaps, we can give your group a general overview on expansions in the west, current status etc.

Make sure we charge the proper cost of funds ( int. rate ) for basically putting money out the door for the deal.

Barry,

As promised, here are some of the current redeployment candidates that have a marketing/structuring/trading background for consideration concerning your West Origination opening.  I believe that you have seen Jim Lowe before and expressed some limited interest in him.  The other candidates are most likely new to you.

Let me know if you would like to pursue any of these redeployed employees.


 << File: Alok Garg.doc >>  << File: Mark Dypiangco.doc >>  << File: Laura Odenthal.doc >>  << File: Audrey O'Neil.doc >>  << File: Jim Lowe.doc >> 

Also, I spoke with Mark McConnell today, and he mentioned that he had accepted the offer to join the Transwestern group of ETS.  He primary motivation for selection of this option was his desire to work with asset deals.  As we know, given EWS ""asset light"" approach to deal making, this option would be difficult to fulfill within the West Origination group.  However, he mentioned that he was very impressed with your group, and short of the asset piece maintained a high interest in your open position.

Talked to Mark.

First thing he has to do is convince Davis' lawyers that his companies' client list (which includes TW) shouldn't conflict him out of working on DWR gas deals.
He should have that figured out by this week--sounds like he may have to make some decisions about his current client list and working for DWR.
I told him that we'd like to sit down as soon as possible to discuss opportunities for us to help out DWR with its gas needs.
He said that he'd be happy to do that, once he's got all conflict issues worked out with the Governor's office.
He's going to get back to me to set up a meeting; and if I don't hear from him by Monday/Tuesday of next week, I'll call him back to set up a meeting.
I'm assuming that you'd be part of that meeting?
I asked him what sort of deals they're working on. As you likely know, some of the contracts permit DWR to either 1) provide gas to the plant providing DWR power under the power contract or 2) manage the plant's fuel supply.  So they're looking to get ""soup-to-nuts"" supply service for those contracts that include a fuel-supply option.

Best,
Jeff"

Mark, Dave, I talked to Lavorato regarding a non-compete... he was fine with proceeding to negotiate a commercial deal but did not want us to commit to a non compete ( just yet) for these reasons.

1. He wants to not restrict EES in their abilities to market in that region ( I will discuss with Delainey).
2. Unless we have an exclusive he thinks we are boxing ourselves.

Pls digest these points as you proceed and keep me posted on where Cascade is even with the paper we showed to them.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : September 20, 2001
El Paso's Bid to Hike Export Capacity Opposed 
Southwest local distribution utilities and municipal distributors have called on FERC to reject, or convene a technical conference to consider, El Paso Natural Gas' application to boost export capacity on the Samalayuca Lateral by about 100 MMcf/d to meet natural gas demand in northern Mexico. They argue that such action would deprive existing El Paso customers of already-tight capacity on the pipeline's South Mainline. 
There are a number of ongoing cases at the Commission addressing the limited capacity on the El Paso system, and its capacity-allocation procedures, the distributors pointed out. ""Yet...El Paso proposes to allow a unilateral reallocation of 100,000 Mcf./d of capacity to serve customers outside the United States without fully disclosing from which customer the capacity will come and its likely impact on all these pending matters,"" said Southern Union Gas Co. The utility asked the Commission to convene a technical conference. 
Southwest Gas Corp. and the El Paso Municipal Customer Group said they were concerned the proposed increase in the lateral's capacity may ""adversely affect"" them and other customers because capacity on the South Mainline would be needed to move the additional export load. FERC ""should not approve increased export capacity without a corresponding increase in mainline capacity"" on El Paso's system, they said. 
Southwest and the municipal distributors urged the Commission to either: 1) reject the El Paso application outright; 2) in the alternative, set the case for hearing to assess the impact on existing customers; or 3) absent rejection or hearing, defer consideration of the application until other pending cases related to the level of capacity on El Paso are resolved. 
In its application, El Paso asked FERC for the go-ahead to increase the maximum daily export capacity on the lateral by about one-third to 308 MMcf/d to correspond with the ""rapid development"" of the gas infrastructure in the northern Mexico state of Chihuahua. It said it already had entered into a long-term agreement for the entire proposed increase of 100 MMcf/d of export capacity with MGI Supply Ltd (See Daily GPI, Aug. 31 <d20010831e.html>). "

Mark and Barry

I have talked to Crestone about backing us in a Northern Border transportation deal.  Basically they are on board, however I have not shown them any economics.  What I believe needs to take place is to identify Northern Border shippers who would be willing to release their capacity.  Once we are able to put the capacity release economics together, which will be driven by the Northern Border shippers, we will be able to 
show Crestone a deal.  I do not have any potential parties willing to release Northern Border capacity.  I have talked to the Central desk about this opportunity, they informed me that they had no interest in this type of an arrangement.  I personally believe we can manage ENA's current Northern Border position more efficiently but have been unable to convince others of this.  Any ideas you can provide would be helpful.

In consideration of the sensitivities regarding this asset and ENA's efforts to manage this risk. I believe we need to formalize and coordinate any external communication with El Paso.

Please advise by name who your lead contact is or would be and what the general purpose of the conversations is concerning.  If you do not have a primary contact or do not talk directly to the pipeline, pls advise.

Todd, further to your voice message. Yes, I did meet in person with Robert Ayers, the meeting went well, and he was going to contact me on Friday. He was considering another offer ( a different co.) and wanted to make a decision this week. As such I committed to informing him as to whether or not an offer will be made to him.

At this time, I am not going to make an offer and will advise him as such upon my next contact. Although he has some good qualities I am going to continue in my search.

Guys, has there been any arrangements made for a send off for Phil.... 

We need to get him a card and a wedding gift ( I assume you would agree).

I would also be more than happy to take the group out for lunch 11:30 - 1:00  if people are interested. 

Pls advise.

Barry - For your cost center, I increased travel by $25k and Conferences & Training by $2,697.  I didn't make any other changes to Mark's.  

These two files show the detail.

  

This file shows the combined plan for West Origination.  The ""Income Statement"" tab is what will be presented to Office of the Chair.

 

Let me know if you need anything else.

Mark, I was looking at that pricing sheet and would like to suggest that the shading in the commentary boxes... under the assumption that this becomes a printed document and that it is printed in black & white, it is very difficult to read. Perhaps a more solid background would work better.

Steph, further to our discussion, Pls review.  I took a quick look at the locations and most appear to be East based.  You might want to use an analyst to figure this out. Also, they have valued the inventories off of the Nymex only ( or so it appears) and I would have to believe that the value of these molecules is materially different than this. 

Pls review and let's discuss asap.

Todd, further to your voice message. Yes, I did meet in person with Robert Ayers, the meeting went well, and he was going to contact me on Friday. He was considering another offer ( a different co.) and wanted to make a decision this week. As such I committed to informing him as to whether or not an offer will be made to him.

At this time, I am not going to make an offer and will advise him as such upon my next contact. Although he has some good qualities I am going to continue in my search.

Barry, trust all is well. 

I just wanted to update you on a couple of things and re-check SMUD's interest.

1. The on again off again PGT assignment of 10,000 MMBTU per day out of Nov. 2002. appears to have surfaced from our counter party again and under the assumption you are still interested I will forward to you latest offer once we have FIRMED it up with the third party. 

2. It is my understanding that you own El Paso - PG&E Topock capacity until May 31, 2003.  ENA has some of the same capacity and is prepared to offer this into the market place from the period June 1, 2003 - May 30, 2006. ( with the renewal rights), PLUS some sort of "" Payment "" from ENA to SMUD.  Rather than renew your existing capacity at full tolls, this is a way to pick up transport below the normal tariff and retain renewal rights after 2006. 

Pls advise if either of these points capture your interest. 

Thanks in advance, 

Barry Tycholiz"

Peter, Eric.... I talked to Bradford this a.m. regarding another matter and managed to discuss with him general credit terms for PG&E. He said he would review Post Petition credit status and also needs to discuss these credit lines as potentially part of our ongoing issues related to PG&E. He was going to discuss internally and advise.

I am not sure he will have any comments back by this weds, so this may conflict with the timelines Eric and I discussed this a.m.

Mike, for your info... we just received this message from IGS re: DWR purchases.  As previously discussed seeing the DWR rfp will require some credit and contract enhancements and that process is underway but it is moving slower and with less push than I would like... For sure, there are alot of hurdles...

It is our opinion that any transactions that are being done by the DWR with third parties are relatively short dated..  1 month, 2 month etc.. but we will keep you posted as we move forward.

Benny, I don't know if you knew Brad or not... but he used to work at Coral in Calgary. I think he traded Merc. Anyways, he has contacted me a couple of times to play hockey and really wants some players..
I told him I would forward this note.  I am going to try to get out one of these days.

I have received the signed CMS Agreement.  I have signed it and returned it and we will be booking the earnings over the next couple of days.  Huber is trying to figure out how they will structure the purchases at the wellhead for royalty purposes.  They are doing this as part of their counterproposal to us.  I do not have very high expectations for this deal happening in the 3rd quarter.  However, Brian Stone will be stuck in a boat with just me and a guide for a total of 8 hours on Wed and Thurs. and I hope to make significant progress in that time.

 Well, I am glad you made it home from Denver. It must have been a little hairy around there Sept. 11. Were you in the air already or just getting ready to leave when it all happened. Does any of this change you plans for Xmas?
 
We have not made a decision yet. The reason for that is, we can't make a 'good' decision until we know whether we will get to the U.S. or not for the tour. It is that up in the air. If things work out for the worst, we will not recover from this and will be forced to sell the van. It will be the end of the band obviously. Hopeful y that will not happen. My problem is that I don't want o get in any situation that might cause you and I any problems. This business that you and I do together is for the band. The band is just not that important to let it get in the way of family. I won't let it get in the way of Michele and I ..........so. I just want to make a good decision on this. I( guess for you it does not make too much difference either way, does it? I mean either you will get the balance paid or a payment in November. Sorry I did not get back to you about it, it's just that I really didn't have an answer. How's Kim. I guess you know Marge got a dog.

I would probably drop the range volume and go with a specific amount... 10,000 - 25,000 instead of up to 200,000 as I am sure there is no way they will get that high.

Good morning... Tim Belden ( Trading) and Chris Calger ( Origination) are in charge of all power issues in the West U.S.  I would also think Paul Kaufman may already have a hand in these issues ( if PUC related ).

New Mexico is starting to reinvent their electric restructuring rules.  Do you know if ENA has any interest in this or who I should check with? Thanks "

Brad, further to our conversation of yesterday morning, please find attached 
Enron's payout table and alternative payout table regarding the permanent 
assignment of PGT capacity. 

The onus will be on Enron to deliver long dated capacity to Calpine and we 
will begin working on this immediately.

Below is a summary of some of the key next steps. Please review and we can 
discuss on Monday the numbers and final steps as required. 

ENA and Calpine will formalise  % discount, volume grid, lump sum $ amount or 
annuity amount. 
As discussed our cost of funds implied will be LIBOR + 200 basis points. ( to 
be confirmed ).
ENA will raise a precedent agreement with option language in favor of Calpine 
which allows you to request that the period 2 volume  be no less than the 
period 1 volume and up to the total delivered volume of 67,500 based on the 
agreed to % discount as referenced in point #1. 
ENA will forward the draft precedent agreement which will include the 
necessary conditions precedent required and with the general commercial terms 
as agreed per items above (ETA - Tues/Wed). 
ENA will provide a bid to Calpine on Monday afternoon with a number on the 
Spark Spread proposal.
Contact name @ Trans Canada and ANG is Kay Coad Ph: 403-267-2480.  
  
I trust the information as provided above is consistent with our previous 
discussions.  Please contact me once you have had a chance to review. 

Regards,

BT

Mark, Stephanie further to our conversations please find a summary list which 
I will need some help on.  As part of our business plan for 2001 Phillip and 
myself will make a presentation to Delainey et al regarding the West 
Initiatives.  This is going to happen by Dec. 8.  

As you guys know our group in total is going to be made up of a few key areas.

Producer Services 
Transportation
Origination/ Middle Marketing
Trading


Can you put together in draft form a business plan for next year that 
outlines some key items. Once we have a first pass at this, we can 
incorporate into the overall package and decide how this fits in with our new 
group. 
 
The key subject items should include:  

SM/MW/BT 1> Market Overview - supply demand fundamentals in your area. 
SM/MW/BT 2> Strategies and opportunities for 2001 ( What new initiatives will 
we implement ?)
SM/MW/BT 3> New products and structures for your area
SM/MW/BT 4> Issues in 2000 ( what didn't work ?)
BT  5> Organization Issues / people /transition etc. 


If you could start thinking about these in greater detail, we can then go 
through and incorporate into the west orig. objectives. 

Call me to discuss, but we should start to discuss detail early next week.  

BT

For your information. please find attached the spreadsheet that I sent to 
Calpine for their consideration. 

Action: 

Peter is going to review the assignment doc's and with Steve raise the proper 
legal document that protects ECC/ENA's interests.  At this time, Peter and I 
are of the opinion that a new agreement may be all we need but we will 
discuss on Monday.

Julie/ Stephanie/Eric....we need to discuss the numbers again. The real 
producer unwind costs may be really ugly, which basically means that our 
numbers may be too low to Calpine.. even with the counter offer, the front 
end economics are pulling a lot of value out of the deal. 


Assuming numbers can be agreed too by everyone, we are positioning ourselves 
for a package out to the producers for early next week. 

Stephanie.. one of our customers has asked for California fundamentals... 
overview... do we have anything available.  

Talk to everyone on Monday.

We still need to decide where we are going to put this money. For right now, 
we should plan on me signing the promisary note by fax, and then have a 
cheque sent up to me in Canada so that I can consolidate with the rest of the 
funds required for closing.

Subject: Enron - PGT Payout Table

Brad, further to our conversation of yesterday morning, please find attached 
Enron's payout table and alternative payout table regarding the permanent 
assignment of PGT capacity. 

The onus will be on Enron to deliver long dated capacity to Calpine and we 
will begin working on this immediately.

Below is a summary of some of the key next steps. Please review and we can 
discuss on Monday the numbers and final steps as required. 

ENA and Calpine will formalise  % discount, volume grid, lump sum $ amount or 
annuity amount. 
As discussed our cost of funds implied will be LIBOR + 200 basis points. ( to 
be confirmed ).
ENA will raise a precedent agreement with option language in favor of Calpine 
which allows you to request that the period 2 volume  be no less than the 
period 1 volume and up to the total delivered volume of 67,500 based on the 
agreed to % discount as referenced in point #1. 
ENA will forward the draft precedent agreement which will include the 
necessary conditions precedent required and with the general commercial terms 
as agreed per items above (ETA - Tues/Wed). 
ENA will provide a bid to Calpine on Monday afternoon with a number on the 
Spark Spread proposal.
Contact name @ Trans Canada and ANG is Kay Coad Ph: 403-267-2480.  
  
I trust the information as provided above is consistent with our previous 
discussions.  Please contact me once you have had a chance to review. 

Regards,

BT

FYI - - Below is an email that I sent Frank as a follow-up to a discussion he and I had regarding the subject matter.  The focus was primairly external factors that are negatively impacting the liklihood of these deals, with only cursory mention of internal issues.  I thought it might be helpful as part of our discussion at 4:00 PM today.

Subject:	Gas Supply Outsourcing (""Asset Management"") Issues   

Frank, below are my initial thoughts.  If I come up with others I will forward them along.  Please review and then let's discuss.  Feel free to forward this to anyone you wish.
Regards,
Ed  

1.  Stranded Costs are no longer a risk. 
Gas LDC unbundling has slowed or stopped.  Hence, the previously perceived market risk (i.e. stranded costs) is no longer present.

2.  Gas Cost disallowance risk is diminished.
Even with extraordinarily high prices this winter and most every LDC buying monthly index gas, there was virtually no PUC gas cost disallowance.  It was a political 'hot potato"" for a few months, but any previously perceived price risk is diminished.  In many states, LDCs are now being encouraged by their PUCs to start using a portfolio approach, incorporating fixed price, caps and collars to dampen commodity price volatility.  Such initiatives is certainly not consistent with an exit of the merchant function.    

3.  Minimizes the importance of the VP of Gas Supply.
Many LDCs have created Gas Cost Incentives and/or Transport Demand Cost Incentives to generate shareholder value.  The previously ""pass through"" aspect of the LDC gas supply function has given way to a situation where the VP of Gas Supply for most LDCs now have some profit potential.  These profits are usually necessary for the LDC to achieve its regulated rate of return, but in some cases are incremental.  Hence, in many cases these individuals have become more ""valuable"" to their organizations.    

4.  Loss of ""core competency.""
Most LDCs have created groups and empowered people to ""manage"" their commodity and service contracts for profit (as discussed above).  As such, eliminating these jobs and redeploying and/or terminating employees is viewed as a risk.  The risk is that they would potentially loose these skill sets that they think they have developed over the past several years, which many now view as one of their ""core competencies.""       

5.   Ego factor
Along with the ""core competency"" issue above, many LDC executives do not want to admit that Enron can manage their assets better that they can do it themselves.  Further, many view Enron as a competitor in cases where they have set up a ""wholesale"" trading business on the backs of their ratepayers.  Some examples include AGL/VNG, KeySpan (BUG/LILCO), NUI, NJ Natural, and PSEG.

6.  Many LDCs have standardized outsourcing.
Many LDCs, especially those who do not have Gas Cost Incentive mechanisms, have been doing seasonal (Nov-Mar or Apr-Oct or one year) RFP type partial or full outsourcing for several years.  These LDCs use these arrangements to either make money or appease their PUC and ratepayer advocate by illustrating that they are optimizing their assets and/or reducing gas costs.  However, to either mitigate the need to seek PUC approval or minimize the risk of gas cost disallowance, these standardized deals limit opportunity and/or add risk in a number of ways:
	(a)  RFP deals go to the highest bidder, most of which have little/no internal controls/discipline and are frequently dominated by origination (not trading).
	(b)  The deals are in an RFP format where new ideas and original thought is typically shared with competitors.
	(c)  LDCs often demand structures that allow them to retain most/all of the optionality, thereby reducing/eliminating the ability to mark income (i.e. accrual only).     
	(d)  Load following deals (which most all of these deals are) for only one (1) season increase the likelihood of a warmer/colder than normal season.
	(e)  The start up costs (e.g.. dedicated people, web site, special accounting, special reporting, etc.) have to be recovered over a short time frame.		     

7.  Industry consolidation
Several LDC mergers have occurred over the past two or three years.  In many cases, these mergers were done for ""synergistic"" reasons and frequently with LDCs that are served by one or more of the same pipelines.  It is safe to say that most have ascribed some acquisition value to and/or used asset optimization in an attempt to gain PUC approval of the merger.  In many of these situations, the LDCs try to consolidate gas supply across the companies and have frequently pushed to have such functions considered an ""unregulated"" part of their business.  Some of these mergers include KeySpan (BUG, LILCO and the Boston Gas/Essex/Colonial), Southern Union (PG Energy, ProvGas and Valley Gas), Energy East (NYSEG, Southern Connecticut, Connecticut Natural), ConEdison (Orange & Rockland), NUI (Elizabethtown, Virginia Gas Company, City Gas of Florida, North Carolina & other smaller ones) and Atlanta Gas Light (AGL, Chattanooga and Virginia Natural Gas).

Kim

In addition to reviewing our Q3 gas and power portfolios, we are currently
assessing various new local generation resources.

As part of our assessment, it would be quite helpful to have a relatively
current forward curve for NYMEX gas, CA Border gas, and SP15 electricity.
Could you provide monthly data for 12-18 months and annual data for 5-10
years for forward transactions?
This doesn't necessarily need to be today's curve, as long as it is recent
and the prices are from the same point in time.

Also, please provide current SP15 and Border gas quotes for Q3 and 12-month
strip.

Thanks!

I'm still going to do it.  I found out about one trip/lessons - 7 days in Austrailia (Great Barrier Reef) - October - 40 ft. Beneteau - you are ASA certified at the end.  In other words, you could rent a sailboat anywhere in the world when you are done.  However, as fun and as cool as it sounds - it may not be doable.  

Also, got the name of a guy in Keemah that my friends took lessons from a few years ago.  I might give him a call - he may be expensive - they had their own boat.

I will keep you posted -

For Crisis Intervention of Houston.  It is a big gas business event.  Craig elias is heading it up.  Donna Newman is on the committee as is Mike Nolan and Linda Roberts of Enron.  I am suppose to give them a list of people and I don't know that many people.

Sara,

Salt River Project has attached their Schedule to the Master and their Credit support Annex to this email.  I know we have sent them our docs in the past so I don't know where this will take us.  It doesn't look like they have entered the pertinent credit information into the annex.  Are they expecting us to do this?  Please let me know what you think.  The guy that sent this to me is Mark Russell and his email address is below.

Thanks,

Kim

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

Hey,

Can you send over a list of people you know in this industry,  their companies and maybe their phone numbers?  For my charity golf tournament.  They were due on Tuesday.

Thanks,

Jay,

Please call me when you get a chance. I have a list of customers that we use to serve out of our Socal pool that we want back.  However, we need to establish credit.  and then maybe some contracts.  Can I do < 1 year with these guys without a master ?  Maybe use the GTC?

I need to make some $ so WE can go to Pebble beach.

Kim

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Dan,

An EFO is a result of parties not complying with an OFO after multiple noti=
ces.  PG&E can confiscate gas if a scheduling party is not in compliance.  =
The same rules apply to an EFO as an OFO.  EFO stands for Emergency flow or=
der.

   I am not familiar with the concept of EFO, but do not think that  the OF=

Once again, I will be visiting Houston for a brief time.  If for some reason
you have not completely forgotten me, I will be flying in tomorrow night
(Thurs) and going directly to Downing Street/Taco Milagro so that I can hang
with you for a drink (I will get there b/w 9:30pm and 10pm).  Would love to
catch up with you, see how you are and what life is like at a Fortune 7
company.

Hope all is well!

I have set up a meeting to discuss invoicing for City of Pasadena for February production going forward. Tori Kuykendall is no longer
involved in that deal and will no longer be invoicing. Kim Ward will explain the structure of the deal to all of us and it is my goal that
the traders will not be involved in creating invoices. Let me know if you will be unable to attend. Thanks.

The answer about environmentalist making it hard to build power plants in california is YES.   Even with load growth and, asset divestiture they wouldn't face the facts that the supply/demand picture was messed up.  They wanted all of the plants to be built in other states such as Arizona and Nevada.

Environmentalists (fish people) were trying to get rid of the hydro dams in the Pac NW.  It is definitely an issue they, as well as California will experience this year as the dams are only filled to 55% of normal.  This equates to approximately 3000-4000 MWh short.  Typically in the summer, the pac NW exports about 4200 MWH to California.  Guess what - there will be no exports this summer.  The light WILL go out in Cali!!!!

Kim

You seem to be up on current affairs associated with power.

 

Reference to the power crisis in California, did the whacko environmentalist have anything to do with it???  I am hearing that California has not built any power plants in the last 10 years due to environmentalist putting on too many restrictions.

 

One other question about the environmentalist trying to get rid of the hydroelectric dams in Washington State, will this lead to more power problems for California if they accomplish their goal?

 

Let me know? jp

Hi There!

Here's the scoop on Friday night.  I have attached the ""e mail"" I received in case you are wondering what's going on.  I reserve the right to blow it all off and go to dinner or whatever we feel like, OK!  

It was great up at Lake Conroe this last weekend.  Weather was perfect.  It was even warm enough to go out on the wave runners.  This weekend should be even better!  

I might go to Las Vegas tonight .  A friend was served with divorce papers today and is not doing real well and wants to go for 24 hours.  We would have to be back Wednesday night since he has to be over in Louisiana Thursday.  If I go what number do you want me to bet for you on roulette?  I would have said 38 but that's to high a number, (JUST KIDDING)   Your laughing , right!  Its not really a great time since I have such a large position, but Its something I need to do.  I would appreciate it if you did not say anything about Las Vegas here at work since Im not sure how much Im going to tell everyone.

Im looking forward to Friday night!
Don't forget your number for roulette.

	Jim

Chris,

I didn't make that many changes and I didn't change the ENA profit section.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I will be on my cell phone after 4:00 p.m. here - going to opening day at Enron Field!!  

Here it is - and I will have a copy and be able to discuss with you when you are ready.  Most of the desk is gone.

Thanks,

Dan, 

Thanks for looking at this for me.  I did remove the phrase you mention in number 1 below.  As for a volume cap, I don't think that one is necessary in this case.  Their TW contract limits them to 1000 MMBtu/day.  Any prices that are fixed will not include TW transport charges.

Thanks again,

Kim

ps, once their board approves this term sheet, we will need to do a confirmation.  Will this be generated by you or when the deal is entered into the system?

Kim,
	I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions.  
1.  Under Term, you have included the phrase ""with annual redetermination"" however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would suggest that the phrase be deleted.
2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap?
3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?  
	Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay.  
						Dan

Dan,

Attached is a term sheet that has been sent to Eastern New Mexico gas company to extend a four year deal that ends on April 30, 2001.  Could you look into the confirmation for this transaction?  They will be going to the board for approval at the end of next week so you have some time.  Sorry to bombard you!!  This one should be easy.

Thanks,

Kim

this looks good to me.  Stephanie is checking with Transwestern to see what their parking/lending fees would be for weekends, just for an idea.  I am also talking to the desk.  I will keep you posted.

Kim:

Please review and add anything you want and return.

John/Sean:

A few thoughts on the Griffith deal:

1.  Term:  PPL indicates they want to do the deal through 2003.  That is really 2003 - 2004 as it incldues Nov - Mar.  Extension until this time might require extension of our underlying deal.  This would be OK with us.
2.  Character of service:   The text indicates that PPL would have the right to request deliveries be made to an alternqate point on TW.  Why would they want this?  This could be a problem if we know the gas wouldn't flow as we would shut in puchases.  We would like to make this on a mutually acceptable basis.
3.  Pricing:  Does the reservation cahrge include variable transport?  I think that is what we proposed.  If not, then the Commodity rate flow needs to include the variable cost of  transport plus fuel.
4.  Conditions:  Noms must be in at 8:00 am.  This is very important and the a deal killer.  We need time to manage the position.  Also, the weekend issue needs to be addressed.  As we have discussed, weekends trade as the same quantity each day.  If they want to vary the daily amoount during the weekend and make Sunday higher than Sat or Monday, that is fairly ewaasy to deal with.  If they want to have lower takes on Sunday, this is more difficult ad increases costs.  We might be able to craft a solution to this however.

I know that we have lost one transaction due to paper not being in place.  Can you send me the final document and I will forward to Monica?

Hi Jeff,

Laird gave me your name and number so that I can pass on notional price information that you asked for.  Let me know anytime you need to see our price indications and I will do what I can to help you.  I know that Laird has worked with you guys extensively.  The prices that he said you were looking at are listed below and are based on PG&E City gate prices:

Q4, 2001                			    $11.70
2 years - Jan. 2002-Dec 2003		    $ 6.80
5 years - Jan. 2002-Dec 2006		    $ 5.85
Oct. 2001 - Dec. 2003	  		    $ 7.38

I tried to call but it was after hours for you.  Give me a call and let me know where you are with your gas supply negotiations and I will try to pick up where Laird left off.

Regards,

Kim Ward

CalPeak was formed as a project company, and is being funded by UTC.

CalPeak was formed less than two months ago, and has no financials.

We will provide a pro forma balance sheet should the bidder be selected.

Types of typical project support are things like a UT gurantee for one
month's fuel supply, etc.

Laird,

You can get prices from me any time - but you know I am always up for wine!!  Anyway, notional prices for Q4 at PG&E City gate are $11.65, 2 years out of  Jan., 2002 are $6.75, and 5 years out of Jan 2002 are $5.80.

Let me know if you need to do anything. 

Also, what is your take on providing gas to all of these power plant developers.  I get at least one call per day from a different developer.  I am thinking that some of them will get built - for the state - but I can't determine who is worthy.  I have been short listed on PRMs RFP for Calpeak power, a sub of United Technologies.  They have no transport across Socal's or PG&E's systems (and neither do we) and United Technologies won't guarantee them 100%.  They said that they would provide ""credit mechanisms built into the projects"".  I asked what these mechanisms were and said that we take cash.  I haven't heard back!! Ha.

Kim,

I need your help.

Knauff is looking for fixed, notional prices @ PG&E city-gate as follows:

1.  Q4 2001
2.  2 years:  Jan 1/02 - Dec/03
3.  5 years:  Jan 1/02 - Dec/06

They use 60,000 MMBtu per month or about 2,000 MMBtu/d.

Can you help me?  I owe you and I expect that the only thing I've got of value is wine.

I emailed chuck and told him we would be willing to take cash!!  I also just spoke with Ann Donnelly and she understands that if she wants us there, she will have to come up with something.  She is working on helping us establish the link between united technologies and calpeak as well as provide other info.  I will let you know what they come up with.

Thanks for your quick responses!

Kim -

A couple of thoughts regarding Charles Hinckley's email and your pending trip to San Diego:

1.  I have scoured all of United Technologies' filings and even their website.  I found exactly ZERO references to CalPeak Power, LLC.  I'm not saying that CalPeak ISN'T a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Technologies, but I find it strange that I can't find anything on CalPeak in United's filings/online info.  

2.  If CalPeak is indeed a subsidiary and WILL guarantee CalPeak's obligations, then we are in great shape.  United Technologies is A+ rated, with lots of liquidity available in the form of unused lines of credit.

3.  If CalPeak will not benefit from a United Technologies guaranty, then we definitely need to see their financials/management notes.

Will they send you the financials/notes before you leave for San Diego?

What's your take on this?  They want to meet with me on friday in San Diego to discuss a potential deal as we were short listed on the RFP to supply gas to the Calpeak power plants.  If we can't get credit established and contracts in their hands, I don't know if we want to waste our time - or money.  Let me know what you think ASAP.

Thanks,

CalPeak Power, LLC is a project company and is now a wholly owned subisdiary
of Untited Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTC).  UTC information is

It is not invisioned that CalPeak will benifit from an absolute gurantee

April 6, for approximately two hours each.  Times we would like you to
consider are: 8:30 am, 11 am, and 1:30 pm.  Please let me know tomorrow if
possible how many of these time slots are possible for you.

The meetings will take place at the law offices of Latham & Watkins, 701 B

Later in the week, I will circulate a draft agenda and list of key issues
and questions pertinent to our final selection process.

Kim:

I would argue that the physical premium should actually be ($.012/MMBtu) as you are displacing gas that would have to be sold as indexed.  That said, we have never done it that way.  My thought is that you would simply do it at the swap offer and have no physical premium arguing that that approach still leaves the desk better off compared to a sale at minus .012.  You could book it as a physical sale with no phyisical premium.

Chris,

The deals I do with Tom Broderick, are these volumes priced at I-.012 as well, or when I fix the prices, do I need to add a new phys premium?

16:36 29Mar2001 TEP, Phelps Dodge Sign Long-Term Power Contract <UNS.N>

TEP, Phelps Dodge Sign Long-Term Power
Contract
   TUCSON, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 29, 2001--Tucson Electric
Power Co. (TEP) has signed a five-year wholesale contract to supply 60
megawatts of electricity to Phelps Dodge Energy Services.
   The contract calls for TEP, beginning in March of 2001, to supply
the power at all times except during the company's peak customer
energy demand periods from July through September of each year.
   TEP Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer James S.
Pignatelli said the contract is an important one for both companies.
""This agreement provides a comfort factor for Phelps Dodge as it plans
ahead for its energy needs,"" Pignatelli said. ""And for TEP, the
contract provides a stable, profitable margin for five years and a
solid boost to our financial outlook in a volatile energy market.""
   Pignatelli said the company expects the agreement to generate
revenues of about $30 million annually.
   The contract gives Phelps Dodge the option of receiving the power
at several of its operations outside TEP's service territory. Under
the contract, TEP also can interrupt delivery of power to Phelps Dodge
if the utility experiences significant loss of any electric generating
resources.
   Separate from this agreement, the Phelps Dodge Sierrita copper and
molybdenum mine south of Tucson is a TEP retail customer.
   TEP is the primary subsidiary of UniSource Energy Corp.
(NYSE: UNS), and Arizona's second-largest investor-owned electric
utility.

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully, we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Hi Manny & Jack,

Attached is our draft Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical natural
gas transactions.  Once we get the ISDA signed and executed we can start on
this contract.  It would be good to go ahead and get it in place so that
when/if we want to do a physical deal, we won't have to worry about paper.

Did we get you everything that you need to go forward with the ISDA?

I will talk to you next week.  Have a good weekend.

Thanks,

Kim

Hi Manny & Jack,

Attached is our draft Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical natural gas transactions.  Once we get the ISDA signed and executed we can start on this contract.  It would be good to go ahead and get it in place so that when/if we want to do a physical deal, we won't have to worry about paper.

Did we get you everything that you need to go forward with the ISDA?

I will talk to you next week.  Have a good weekend.

Thanks,

Kim

Chris,

Attached is a draft copy of a Master Purchase/Sale Agreement  for physical natural gas transactions.  We are working on some of the information that Bonnie sent us and will be in touch next week with some ideas.  It would be good for us to go ahead and get things rolling with this contract so we will be prepared to enter into transactions, whether they fall within the the realm of the management services agreement or not.

Please call me with any questions you might have.  My legal guys are standing by to assist, too.

Have a good weekend -

Kim Ward

Darla,

This is what I have been able to find so far regarding fixed prices for citizens for Feb:

50,000/mo @ $7.55
50,000/mo @ $7.96
100,000/ mo @ $9.07

we also did a deal for 1,565/day @ $7.12.

Have they given you any information that you can compare this to?  Let me know if you have any questions and I will send you a spreadsheet with all fixed price deals I have done to date.  March and april should be final.  You can send me a monthly email when you are ready to do - say - mays invoice - and I will send you everything I have done with them.

Call me with questions -

Kim, the attached e-mail is from John Gregg.  He is a lawyer from Washington DC.  His firm represents alot of the Muni's across the country.  He represents Mesa and others in the West.  It appears that Enron is having some problems with WIlcox.  Did we give that account to EES ?  Do you know this JAmie Bellamy ?  If possible we need to get this cleared up so that John does not take it out on us in the furture.

Good to talk with you Frank.  Funny you called when you did.

While you were ""gone,"" the mighty City of Wilcox, AZ signed up with Enron.  I got a call today from a frantic city clerk because Enron has fallen a few months behind in billing after many months of fine service.  This is bad for several reasons, not the least of which is that Enron is paying the pipeline for Wilcox.

The reps name is Jamie Bellamy.

Could you kick him in the butt for one of the smallest munis in the country?

Kathy,

Just had another moment to say hello.  How are you and how are things?  Still busy here - and I haven't even seen Robin - I think she has given up on me!!  In fact, I think I will call her when I finish this email.  At least I know I will see her in a couple of weeks when Chris and Katie come to houston.  Wish you could come with them - that would be fun!

Still working on the man situation - it was a topic of coversation amongst my friends last night.  I will keep you posted!

Hope all is well and keep in touch!!

Love, Kim

I was thrilled to hear from you today.

I sure miss you and Robin.  Seems strange not to be driving to your house
on Thursdays now.  I have a little more free time now so I can quilt and
visit with my grandchildren.

Mel is back to work now and maybe things will be getting back to some
what of a normal life for us.  The past year and half has been hard on
us. I know we just have to be patient and things will get better.  You
just go along with life and then when you or your spouse has health
problems it creates a whole new ball game.  I have great faith in the
Lord to see us through any thing.  Mel said to say hi too. ( he just came
up to my office)

When you get an address please email me that so when I finish your quilt
I can mail it to you.

Hope you find a nice man and your life becomes so full that
maybe work will take a back seat.  Maybe a  big house you can fill with
kids?????

Take care of yourself and let me hear from you again.

Love, Kathy

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Chris,

Attached is a new spreadsheet with the PG&E, Large Packages Gas Daily prices.  This price is for the PG&E topock point.  It is VERY illiquid.  The desk is going to start posting prices for it on EOL in order to add more liquidity.  As you can see, there are days where there were no prices published for this point in Gas Daily.

As for Griffith, maybe PG&E topock should be the benchmark because Citizens truly doesn't have an alternative market.  Although they can change their primary delivery point to the border, the fact is that it probobly wouldn't flow because the line is already full.  Where can Citizens actually (not theoretically) extract the greatest value for this capacity?  I disagree with Griffiths comment that this price is more reflective of the market - what market?  Very little has traded there in the past.

One issue that we/Citizens needs to think about is hedging capabilities to PG&E topock.  I know when we were talking to them about our capacity, we priced it based on the SJ/Socal spread and they were agreeable to that.  But then again, we could actually flow gas to the border.

Sorry for rambling -

Congratulations on a healthy new baby!  Tyler is sort of a southern name - I like it!  As for me - I got a call last November to come back and market gas in the west.  I didn't think there was much going on out there but decided to go for it for personal reasons.  got here Jan. 2 and gas had completely blown out in the west.  So far, it seems like it was a good move for me.  

My house in PDX sold in 4 days and I came to Houston between Christmas and New years and found a place here.  Still trying to move in as I can't get anything done during the week!  Just had new blinds put in yesterday.

Let me know if you are ever in town - keep in touch

Kim

Hey you. I didn't know you were in Houston. You are over there on the gas
side?! WOW!! When did that happen?
You always did like Houston didn't you. I bet you are having a great time
doing gas. It is quite a market these days.

I didn't go to Phoenix because I just had a baby boy. Tyler is his name. He
was born March 6th. I have a couple of boys now  they will be just fine if
they take after their daddy.

Other than the new arrival things are pretty much steady in my life. Things
are going very well here at Mirant (quite the new name eh!).

Give me an update on your life - being in Houston and all now.

Talk to you soon


Cheers

Didn't see you in Phoenix last week - I actually was in PHX for meetings

great right now.  Let me know how you are -

VERY relaxing.

We leave sunday at 1:30 pm.

Chris,

I can't read these - but my real quesiton is - If the $.07 is a demand charge and Grigsby gets $.04, we should still get the other $.03 because it will be charged on all volumes that CAN be taken, whether they take them or not - right??

Dan, 

El Paso Electric's lawyer is Will Garant and his number is 512-495-8832.  He is the one dealing with our LT contract and is familiar with the collateral issues.  Matt Henry is the lawyer that drafted their long term contract attached.  I can get his number if you need it but I think he works at the same firm as Will.

Let me know what I can do to help and if you have any questions.

Thanks again for your help.

I did make it home - and I managed to catch an airplane at 8:00 the next morning, have two meetings, attend a reception, and go to dinner.  Needless to say, I was very tired by the time I got home on Friday night!!  It was a fun week for me too - I got to see people that I hadn't seen in four years.  As for the weather, you aren't missing anything here this week - cold and rainy - just like portland!

Let me know when you're around - margaritas on a patio is always fun

Dan,

Thanks for looking at this for me.  Could you recommend something not so awkward?  Sat, Sun & Mon would be the price published on Tuesday.

Thanks,

Kim,
	The language is awkward but okay.  Question, for weekends, Sat, Sun & Mon you probably want to use the Gas Daily Midpoint Price published on Tuesday. Otherwise, the Tues price is published wednesday, etc  and the friday price is published on Monday.  Or do you want to use and average of the price applicable for Friday flow and the price applicable for Monday flow for the weekend period.  Just questions to consider.  Please call if you need to include any of the above concepts in the offer.

I can not mention how jealous I am about this trip - but here are some GREAT recommendations -

1)  Indian Springs in Calistoga, which is just on the north side of the wineries.  It has a spa and a huge mineral pool.  Also, the rooms are little bungalows.

2)  A more expensive option - which I havn't tried but comes HIGHLY recommended - Auberge du Soleil.  It has great rooms, a great spa, and great food and wine selection.  In fact, you can go to their we page @ www.aubergedusoleil.com.

You can't go wrong with either one.   Also, a restaurant that has been recommended to me is the Culinary Institute.  It is suppose to be awesome!!

The guys on the gas desk are going to cayman tomarrow - I am very jealous of that too.  Can you tell I need a break??

Let me know what you think of my suggestions -

Bob, 

I had our contracts folks look into any contracts we had with LADWP.  It looks like we have something that would cover short term transactions.  However, in order to enter into a 12 month or longer transaction, we will need to put a master purchase/sale agreement in place.  I asked legal to send our standard agreement to you.  I hope that you will take a look at it.  Any questions or issues that you might have with it, you can bring to my attention and I will make sure the appropriate parties are brought into the conversation.

Also,  I have attached the prices that you asked for earlier.  Let me know if you need anything else!!

Thanks,

Kim

Guys,

Attached is the latest and greatest term sheet for April through August, 2001.  Please let me know if I have addressed all of the issues we discussed.  If not, just let me know and I can fix it.   

Also, for your KRS supply for April 1 -10, we are a Gas Daily minus $.50 bid.  For the 3500 fixed priced gas at the Border, we will pay Gas Daily minus $.10.  Also, for the EPNG capacity delivered to PG&E Topock, our fixed price bid is $2.10 plus variable.

Let me know what you think about these prices so I can get them in the system if we agree.  Also, call me if you have any questions!

Thanks,

Kim

I hope it is ok that I have him your name.  Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to help and keep me posted on developments.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Jan,

Thanks for the email.  It is amazing what two days out of the office will do to my workload!!  I had two RFPs due yesterday - very busy!  I am going to work on our 'thoeoretical' deal that we discussed on Friday to see if there is anything there.  Hopefully, I can come up with something.  Thanks for the info on that.

Call me any time you want to discuss power - I will be glad to share with you what I know.

Thanks again for spending some time with us and hopefully we can come up with a good structure that is good for both of us!!

Have a good day - 

Kim

Thank both of you for stopping by to visit last Friday.  It was good to see you.
I hope Enron can get some of their ""creative juices"" going and figure out a way
that the City of Mesa can compliment their gas contract with their electric
needs.   I think there are some opportunities out there.

Kim, two things.  One regarding capacity releasing:  our billing determinant is
14,247 and we can release the difference of this number and what our load will
be.  Sorry, I just had to think about it after the meeting.  Also, regarding
this matter, one must consider the conditions of pre-arranged deals.  There are
some hurdles, but all ""doable"" once we get our thinking caps on.

Two, I did not realize that you were on the electric side for awhile.  I am in
somewhat of a ""learning mode"" regarding electric and was wondering if you could
just ""jam"" with me about the electric side.  I understand the concepts because
of my position on the gas side, but I want to learn the players and some
strategies.  Dave, I think you could teach me a thing or two also.

Let me know.

Jan

David

The only reason why a gym expense form would not be authorised, is if there was no prove of payment. (receipt).  If you do have a receipt for the gym expenses please send the form directly to me and I will authorise the form immediately.

Thanks

Abu

Abu,

I have just rec'd back from HR an expense form for Kim Ward claiming back gym membership expenses.  All there is on the sheet is a tick indicating 'not authorised'.  Perhaps more information from you would help us solve the issue as I have absolutely nothing to work on?

Ann,

Attached is a draft of Enron's response to your request for proposals for gas supply to power generation plant in development by Calpeak Power, LLC.  As requested, Enron has provided indexed pricing with the option to convert to various fixed priced products during the term of the agreement.

The options presented are not intended to represent a complete list of opportunities, but are representative of the different pricing structures Enron offers.  There are several additional structures available  and we look forward to discussing these options with you.

Please call me with any questions you might have regarding the proposal.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,

Kim Ward
Manager, West Gas Origination

Chris, attorneys have indicated there is no affiliate problem with EAMR negotiating a contract with ENA for the operation of the Citizens assets as described in the contract I sent you Friday.   IF we can make it work it makes more sense this way and tells a good story in support of the ""One Enron"" message. 

Please let me know what your availability is for Wednesday so I can set up a conference call with legal and marketing services to discuss the work to be done so we can flush out the liability issue.  You and I can continue our discussion on price one on one.

Thanks,

Don

Bonnie,

Sorry I am just now getting back - I was out of the office Thurs & Fri.  What I am trying to determine is the rate that Long Beach wants to beat and what it is made up of - so I would say both transmission and commodity prices.  Let me know if you have any more questions -

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Kim, just a clarification on the last question of your data request --

By historical retail rates vs. SoCal's rates, do you mean the
transmission rates or the commodity prices?

	One kiss from you, however, and I will turn back into the dapper,
young Prince that I am and then, my sweet, we can marry and setup
housekeeping in yon castle with my Mother, where you can prepare my meals,
clean my clothes, bear my children, and forever feel grateful and happy
doing so.

	That night, while enjoying lightly saut?ed frog legs seasoned in a
white wine and onion cream sauce, she chuckled to herself and thought:  I
don't fucking think so.

Diane,

Also, could you check for reservations at the Georgian hotel in Santa Monica?  If the rates are around $250, I would like to book one for Barry Tycholiz and one for myself for the night of April 26th.

Thanks,

Frank,

I just spoke to Jan Kennedy and they are going out for an RFP for their gas supply once our contract with them runs out.  She ""recommended"" that I tak e a look at your response to the last RFP because it was so good - far surpassing any of the other responses!!  If you still have a copy or a file of that response, would you mind if I took a look at it? 

thanks,

Kim"

Scott,

Attached is our physical firm Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for Natural Gas Transactions.  Give me a call if you have any questions.  Once we get this in place, we will be able to enter into any gas transactions and we won't have to worry about contracts. 

Thanks,

Kim

Kim
 
Just wanted to follow up with you.  I have reviewed all  of the data, and brought the power people in on this issue to  assist.
We have placed a call to John Ewing and expect to hear back  today.  It appears that this was all effective April 1, 2001.I do not  believe that John has a choice in running.  It is quite likely that he has  had his opinion heard through the Cogeneration Council.
 
I will let you know, but I would move forward for May  2001.

we should get financials from Knauf friday morning in the over night mail - I will keep you posted.  I think we can get this deal.  Also, we are three more deals and $100,000 closer to Pebble Beach - I sold gas to Palo Alto yesterday.

How are things coming with Willis Bennett's customers?

And who told you what I do when I am in Scottsdale??  Palo Alto is in Cali - Have you ever heard of Stanford University?  What do you do in Moab?  My friend Harriet was in Vail this past weekend and said it was snowing like crazy.  I don't know - maybe a second date is in order - just for kicks.  when are you coming back to houston?

Moab is in the southeastern part of Utah.  I burned my feet at lake Powell which is also in Utah.  So no second date with your new boyfriend?
By the way I heard that the spa isn't only what, or should I say who, you visit when you go to Phoenix.  Where is Palo Alto, AZ?

Kim,
 
We are very interested in putting in place  an ISDA for weather derivatives, power, and natural gas transactions in regards  to Citizens Communications.  Please get with me as to Enron's interest no  later than Monday, April 23rd.  There is also some opportunity to do  physical power purchase and sales with Citizen's.  It might be worthwhile  for you to set up a meeting with you, me, and the appropriate power guy (Mike  Grigsby?).
 
Hope all is well.
 
Sincerely,

----- Original Message -----  
Subject: Kids: Gotta love them!!



Thought you might enjoy a little humor from some  children who know more about relationships than some adults. 

What do most people do on a date? 

Dates are for having fun, and people should use them  to get to know each other.  Even boys have something to say if you listen  long enough.

--Lynette, age 8 

On the first date, they just tell each other lies,  and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date. --Martin,  age 10

What would you do if a date was not working  out?  

I'd run home and play dead.  --Craig, age   

When is it okay to kiss someone? 

When they're rich. --Pam,age 7 

The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't  want to mess with that.  
--Curt, age   

The rules goes like this:  If you kiss someone,  then you should marry them and have kids with them.  It's the right thing  to do. --Howard, age 8

How would the world be different if people weren't  married? 

There sure would be a lot of kids to explain,  wouldn't there?  --Kelvin, age 8 

What is the right age to get married?  

No age is good to get married at.  You got to be  a fool to get married.  --Freddie, age 6 

Is it better to be single or married?  

It's better for girls to be single but not for  boys.  Boys need someone to clean up after them.  
--Anita, age 9 

I don't know which is better, but I'll tell you one  thing, I'm never going to have sex with my wife.  I don't want to be all  grossed out. --Theodore, age 8

How do you decide who to marry? 

You got to find somebody who likes the same  stuff.  Like if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports,  and she should keep the chips and dip coming.  --Alan, age 10

No person really decides before they grow up who  they're going to marry. God decides it all way before, and you get to find out  later who you're stuck with. --Kirsten, age 10

How can a stranger tell if two people are  married? 

You might have to guess, based on whether they seem  to be yelling at the same kids. --Derrick, age 8 

What do your mom and dad have in  common? 

Both don't want any more kids.  --Lori, age   

How would you make a marriage work?  

Tell you wife that she looks pretty even if she looks  like a truck. --Ricky, age 10

Because  I had an updated curve for PG&E and not for Malin.  I asked the Malin trader - he hadn't updated his curves but the other guy had.   I am going to start asking so that I am consistant.  Let me know what you want to do and I will show you transactional numbers.

Thanks for letting me know.

Kim,

Do you know why the winter strip (November 2002 through March 2003) is lower
at PG&E Citygate ($7.30) than at Malin ($7.49)?

I will call you tomorrow to let you know what I want to buy.

Thanks

Monica

Good morning, 

Hope you had a great Easter weekend. 

Attached are two (2) word files for your review.  First, there is the latest  
draft of the Sales Proposal which reflects the best efforts and intra day  
provisions.  Second, there is the Alternate Nominations provisions.  I spoke  
with PPL this morning and said that I would try to get both of these  
documents to them today.  Your timely review and comments are greatly  
appreciated. 

The Alternate Nominations language is being separately provided at the  
request of PPL so that they can review it.  If they would like to have it  
incorporated, it can easily incorporated into the proposal and/or agreement. 

Chris, I used the working draft of the Enron/Citizens agreement from our  
meeting last Monday in Houston to draft the Alternate Nominations language.   
That draft did not provide for a price differentiation for nominations  
between 8:30 and 9:00 am CPT.  Should there be one? 

Best regard, 

John

That price indication does reflect the time value of money - so - if bought - power in 2001 would be billed at $61/MWh.

Thank you so much! That is quite useful information.

Question relevant to longer-term quotes...are those cash-flow year
""settlement"" prices (in other words, if a deal was done today for on-peak
power in the year 2011, would an invoice in the year 2011 be settled at
$61/mwh, or would that price somehow need to be adjusted to reflect
inflation).

In addition to reviewing our Q3 gas and power portfolios, we are currently
assessing various new local generation resources.

As part of our assessment, it would be quite helpful to have a relatively
current forward curve for NYMEX gas, CA Border gas, and SP15 electricity.
Could you provide monthly data for 12-18 months and annual data for 5-10
years for forward transactions?
This doesn't necessarily need to be today's curve, as long as it is recent
and the prices are from the same point in time.

Also, please provide current SP15 and Border gas quotes for Q3 and 12-month
strip.

Thanks!

Arnold,

I must have been looking at the wrong index or report.  I have now gotten access to Natural Gas Intelligent's web-site so I can give very fast and accurate prices.  I am sorry for the confusion and hope that I didn't cause a lot of trouble.  Just so you know, april was $12.56 plus the $.05 premium.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thought you might enjoy a little humor from some  children who know more
about relationships than some adults.

What do most people do on a date?

Dates are for having fun, and people should use them  to get to know each
other. Even boys have something to say if you listen  long enough.

--Lynette, age 8

On the first date, they just tell each other lies,  and that usually gets
them interested enough to go for a second date. --Martin,  age 10

What would you do if a date was not working  out?

I'd run home and play dead. --Craig, age

When is it okay to kiss someone?

When they're rich. --Pam,age 7

The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't  want to mess with
that.
--Curt, age

The rules goes like this: If you kiss someone,  then you should marry them
and have kids with them. It's the right thing  to do. --Howard, age 8

How would the world be different if people weren't  married?

There sure would be a lot of kids to explain,  wouldn't there? --Kelvin,
age 8

What is the right age to get married?

No age is good to get married at. You got to be  a fool to get married.
--Freddie, age 6

Is it better to be single or married?

It's better for girls to be single but not for  boys. Boys need someone to
clean up after them.
--Anita, age 9

I don't know which is better, but I'll tell you one  thing, I'm never going
to have sex with my wife. I don't want to be all  grossed out. --Theodore,
age 8

How do you decide who to marry?

You got to find somebody who likes the same  stuff. Like if you like
sports, she should like it that you like sports,  and she should keep the
chips and dip coming. --Alan, age 10

No person really decides before they grow up who  they're going to marry.
God decides it all way before, and you get to find out  later who you're
stuck with. --Kirsten, age 10

How can a stranger tell if two people are  married?

You might have to guess, based on whether they seem  to be yelling at the
same kids. --Derrick, age 8

What do your mom and dad have in  common?

Both don't want any more kids. --Lori, age

How would you make a marriage work?

Tell you wife that she looks pretty even if she looks  like a truck.
--Ricky, age 10

No person really decides before they grow up who  they're going to marry. God decides it all way before, and you get to find out  later who you're stuck with. --Kirsten, age 10

How can a stranger tell if two people are  married? 

You might have to guess, based on whether they seem  to be yelling at the same kids. --Derrick, age 8 

What do your mom and dad have in  common? 

Both don't want any more kids.  --Lori, age   

How would you make a marriage work?  

Tell you wife that she looks pretty even if she looks  like a truck. --Ricky, age 10

I'm still going to do it.  I found out about one trip/lessons - 7 days in Austrailia (Great Barrier Reef) - October - 40 ft. Beneteau - you are ASA certified at the end.  In other words, you could rent a sailboat anywhere in the world when you are done.  However, as fun and as cool as it sounds - it may not be doable.  

Also, got the name of a guy in Keemah that my friends took lessons from a few years ago.  I might give him a call - he may be expensive - they had their own boat.

I didn't get a fax - but if you didn't put my whole name on it - it won't get to me.  That fax is used by many!!  What is the name of the place you charter through?  I just want to let my friend know that things are in the works!!  Sailing sounds good - we can get Camille to come too.  

Thanks for your help!

Kim

Of course I remember you.........did you get the fax I sent yesterday?
Actually looking forward to taking you sailing on my boat!  We usually try
to gather a group and go for the day/evening and stop at the boardwalk after

for chips/margarita's at Cadillac Bar.  Yes, place I charter though does all

the lessons - ASA certified - can get you info or you can pick it up
when we go out on my boat too.

Have a great trip/weekend..........lets talk next week and catch up!

Hey Doug,

How are you?  (Do you remember me - from El Tiempo?)  Just wanted to touch
base with you about sailing lessons.  Although the Austrailia trip sounds
really cool - I don't think I can manage this year.  Also, I did commit to
doing this with one of my friends - can't leave him in the dust!!  Anyway,
can you recommend a good place for lessons in Keemah?  Maybe the place you
are taking your lessons to be an instructor?  I would appreciate any
recommendations!!  Going to AZ tonight - I'm sure I will run into you when
I get back.

Have a great weekend,

Kim Ward

 customer,    We're Changing To Serve You Better This Thursday evening Apri=
l 12th 2001, we are launching a new version of our web reservations system,=
 eService Online.  This marks the start of an exciting new beginning as the=
 reservations platform is 100% provided by Continental.  We're making this =
change because our current product, while good, will not provide us with th=
e flexibility in the future to offer the features that will make travel arr=
anging easier and to tailor the online Continental experience for you.   He=
re's What You Need To Know:  Your Profile Your profile information, includi=
ng your username (KWARD1) and password, has been transferred to the new ver=
sion of eService Online.  To protect your personal information, credit card=
 information has not been transferred.  You will need to update your profil=
e.  Your Itineraries Information on your reservations created before April =
12th will not be saved. If you want to keep a copy for your records, you wi=
ll need to print them prior to 9pm/CDT April 12th.  This change does not af=
fect the status of any previous reservations and tickets, but you can not v=
iew them in the new eService Online.    Signing In To enhance security, you=
 will have to sign in for each transaction session to reserve and purchase =
flights.  This means you will have to use your password each time.  To have=
 your password e-mailed to you  click here .  You are strongly encouraged t=
o sign in at the beginning of the travel arranging process.   24 Hour Hold =
Option To prepare for this Thursday's release we will be turning off the ""H=
old for 24 hours"" option.  The ""Hold"" option will not be available between =
April 10 and April 12.   Here Are Some of the Changes  More eTicketing The =
new eService Online offers expanded opportunities for electronic tickets (e=
Tickets).  We can now provide eTickets for code share flights operated by N=
orthwest Airlines or Northwest Airlink (CO5000-8059) and America West Airli=
nes (CO2000-2349).   Aircraft Seat Maps We rearranged the seat map pages fo=
r easier viewing. We also enhanced the seat selection process and enabled E=
lite-status available seating.   Pricing  The pricing system is enhanced to=
 deliver more current fares based on your selection of either ""Search By Lo=
west Fares"" or ""Search By Schedule.""  We also added a gold star to denote ""=
continental.com promotional fares,"" so you know for certain when you receiv=
e a discounted, online-only airfare.   Customer Service  Our customer servi=
ce is streamlined and enhanced as Continental employees now handle all supp=
ort for online inquiries and reservations services.   While we've made a nu=
mber of improvements to the overall experience, this new version may not, o=
n the surface, appear to offer significant benefits.  These changes lay the=
 foundation for outstanding capabilities we have planned for the future.  W=
e welcome your comments and suggestions as we move ahead.  Based on feedbac=
k from customers, we're already at work adding enhancements.  Overall, we'r=

Dan:

To help your prepare for your meeting in Stamford, here are some thoughts.

PG&E Large Packages Index Trends

1.   PG&E Large Packages is the interconnection between El Paso/Transwestern into PG&E.  The interconnection between El Paso/Transwestern and Kern into SoCal is referred to as SoCal Border.  

2.   PG&E gas supply comes in from three main pipelines:  PGT (Canada), El Paso/Transwestern (San Juan and Permian) and Kern River (Rockies).  With the exception of a few very cold days in Canada and the Northwest, the cheapest supply comes from Canada.  The other two pipes are similarly priced, based on the incremental cost of gas out of the Southwest and what options the supply has.  There is always some marginal demand for supply out of the Southwest into PG&E, but it can be a small number of only about 500,000 MMBtu/d in a shoulder month and 1,000,000 MMBtu on a peak day.  When it is a low demand day PG&E large packages will trade like Malin (PGT interconnect to PG&E).  On a peak day PG&E large packages trades like SoCal border.

3.  Effective April 1, El Paso changed the way gas moves on their system.  It used that anyone with primary delivery point capacity to PG&E could deliver into SoCal on a primary basis.  Now, if you have PG&E primary, you can only get into SoCal on an alternate delivery point basis.  Because capacity is constrained, PG&E primary capacity will generally not flow into SoCal.  Thisis why PG&E Large Packages trades at a discount to SoCal Border.

4.  PG&E large packages is the relevant index for the PP&L deal:  PG&E trades at a significant discount to SoCal because of the reasons listed above.    Anyone with primary SoCal delivery will want to go into SoCal.  This leaves the PG&E capacity as the marginal capacity that folks could use for delivery to Griffith.  If anyone owns primary delivery into SoCal they will use it there.  Citizens is offering Griffith a discount relative to these suppliers.  The good news is that PG&E delivery is still very strong because given the gas supply balance in California the marginal supply out of the southwest is needed.  

5.  PG&E large packages is becoming more liquid:  Now that El Paso has changed the way gas moves on their pipeline there is a much more distinct difference between the types of capacity on El Paso.  Folks that own capacity want ways to hedge its value.  Enron has recognized this and plans to introduce the PG&E large packages point on Enron Online, our internet based trading system.  Trading volume at the PG&E point has increased in the last month and is expected to continue to increase.  This is good for Citizens as the liquidity makes the index more reflective of the market.  It also reduces the risk that the index doesn't print as has often occurred in the past.  (See historical data attached).  It also reduces the spread between the bid and offer at that point.

6.  PG&E Large Packages has gotten much stronger:  it used to be that the San Juan/SoCal Border spreads barely covered variable transport expense.  Now the demand is much stronger in CA and the transportation value has increased.   California is short storage due to growth in demand with the new power plants and the strong economy.  Although demand due to the economy is likely to fall, the new power plants and short storage position still create a very bullish situation.  For example, current valuations for the PG&E index are in the attached spreadsheet below:

thanks for your help as always.  i think we might try the auberge place.  if
you ever decide to get out of the energy business i think you have a place
as a travel consultant.  You need a break?  you were just in scottsdale.
how drunk was kevin mcmahan that night, i was worried he was going to follow
you up to your room.  i have seen him drunk, but nothing like that....

I can not mention how jealous I am about this trip - but here are some
GREAT recommendations -

1)  Indian Springs in Calistoga, which is just on the north side of the
wineries.  It has a spa and a huge mineral pool.  Also, the rooms are
little bungalows.

2)  A more expensive option - which I havn't tried but comes HIGHLY
recommended - Auberge du Soleil.  It has great rooms, a great spa, and
great food and wine selection.  In fact, you can go to their we page @
www.aubergedusoleil.com.

You can't go wrong with either one.   Also, a restaurant that has been
recommended to me is the Culinary Institute.  It is suppose to be awesome!!

The guys on the gas desk are going to cayman tomarrow - I am very jealous
of that too.  Can you tell I need a break??

Let me know what you think of my suggestions -

Where is Moab - the place where you burn your feet?  Barry is in Canada - for his grandmother' funeral.  Went out with him - too forward and outspoken for me - at least for a first date!!  And you thought I had a strong personality!!!  Going to Palo Alto Thursday - hope to get a management services deal.

Just got in from Moab.  Is Barry in today?  Was that guy that you had the bad date with the one that told you ""call me within 24hrs or lose my card?""
I was thinking about that guy after we talked, I hope he was joking or else he is a major loser!!!

Monica,

Attached are the price indications that you asked for.  I pulled these off of our curves and adjusted them for today's price movements.  If you would like to transact, we will have to get more refined prices approved by the desk, which shouldn't take too long.  

Just let me know - 

Thanks,

Kim

Sorry for not leaving a message - I just thought that maybe you would get an email faster.  We ended up leaving Downing a little after midnight.  Not too much later than you.  My weekend was OK.  I am tired of working on my house!  Anyway - went to the baseball game yesterday.  It was nice to be  out in the sun.  Hope your weekend was good.  And now that you have my number - you will have to be the brave one!

Kim

Ms. Ward, what no message on the voice mail? I really think it is kind of
cute that you were chicken to leave a message. Modern technology.  I guess I
will have to be the brave one and pick up the phone. I hope your weekend was
fun. What time did you and your friend from California leave Downing? Look
forward from hearing from you soon...Stanton

Linda, 

Here is my very short list for the tournament. My friend Melissa Reese has
said she will volunteer. Gas has been so crazy over the past week - I have
been extremely busy! Sorry I am so late. I will continue to add or fill in
blanks until you tell me I can't any more. I have been asked if there is room
for sponsors - I said yes to sponsoring teams. 

I will also try to gather trinkets as I get a chance. 

Keep in touch - 

thanks, 

Kim

Willis,

I just got off of the phone with my credit guy - He says that most of the people on this list are not public companies.  It would be very helpful and will expedite the process if you could get the latest audited financial statements, with notes, from each of these companies.  With the PG&E thing, credit is swamped, but, if I had the info in hand, I could push our cause.

Thanks,

Kim

I figured you were pretty tired and just sleeping, which was the best thing for you anyway.
I went over to the Kinder Morgan party.  

You missed a great weekend.
Saturday was a little cool up at the lake, but Sunday was fantastic.

I hope you feel better before your trip to the spa.
Don't work so much!

Mary,

I have been unsuccessful at finding your phone number so I will try this 
email address I received from Kim Olinger.  I have recently moved from 
Enron's Portland office where I worked for Chris Foster, to Houston to 
re-initiate our gas marketing efforts in the west.  Chris has been turning 
over the gas responsibilities he retained after moving to Portland.  Could 
you change the Enron contact that you have in your system from Chris Foster 
to me?  My name is Kim Ward and my number is 713-853-0685.  Please call me 
with any questions you might have. 

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Attached are the completed Exhibit A's that are required for the Kern Open 
Season.  The bid requires that a seperate Precedent Agreement (PA) be 
submitted with each Exhibit A, so that means your customers must sign two 
PA's and submit one Exhibit with each.  Also the credit worthiness and the 
affiliate statement must be submitted with each PA.  Instead of submitting 
all your affiliates you can instead submit the following statement:

 ""Shipper warrants and represents that no other affiliate is participating in 
the open season""

Good Morning Kim,

I rec'd the temporary password, etc to get into enron on line but unable to
access as we must have a firewall set up through our corporate data group.
So I need to ask you what is the most recent forecst cost for March Natural
Gas? also for April.

thanks,

p.s. ""Happy Valentine's Day""

It was a billing error. We didn't bill them for enough back in early 2000 and 
then too much in Dec.  I don't think you need to worry about it unless they 
mention it to you.  If so, try to blame me and have them call me to explain.

Chris, 

I am assuming this is ok.  Why would they be invoiced for Feb - April now?  
Was this an error?

Have they called you with any questions and should I get back with them?

Chris,
I am sorry to keep bring this account up.  Thank you for the price change.  I 
have all the months corrected; however, Akzo got invoice incorrectly for 
February, March and April.  The coordinator who invoice them use the January 
NGI index price instead of the correct month index.  The amount they owe ENA 
is $17,561.05.  ENA owes them (7,922.93) for some volume allocation for 
December 2000.  So the net amount they owe ENA is $9,638.12.
I need to invoice them for the incorrect NGI index used and also to give them 
back the credit owed to them.   Let me know if this is ok with you.
isabel


PS I promise this is it.

I agree with the way you wnat to change the deal in the system (i.e. making 
the 1125 MMBtu * # of days/month the first gas through the meter on a monthly 
basis rather than a daily basis) is the correct way to do it.  That is what 
the client expects and it will be difficult to get money out of them based on 
the other way.  Kim might want to contact the client if she wants to use the 
daily approach for future business.

Chris,
I am back to this issue.  I have been told that the way we can fix the a/r 
issues is to change the way the deal is entered in sitara.  I wanted to make 
sure you agree with the change.  The way the deal is entered now is 
1,125 daily  and the rest at the NGI index.
The days that Akzo takes less than the 1,125 the volumes allocation changes.  
Making the system want to charge them more since it adds more volumes to the 
NGI price.

I was wondering if we can change the deal to:
1,125 * #of days in month @ $2.6676
remaning volume  @ $NGI index.
This way it reflex the way ENA has invoice Akzo(since Akzo takes the require 
1,125 on a monthly basis.

Please e-mail me back letting me know if this change agrees with how you 
wanted Akzo to be invoice and that will reflex how Akzo has been invoice.
thanks

Subject: akzo

Good morning Chris,
I have a question on Akzo's invoicing.  Since we invoice Akzo manually I am 
trying to reconcile the system with what we have invoice Akzo.
The way we are invoicing them is that we assume that they take the 1125 mmbtu 
daily.  However, there is one or two days of each month(almost) that they 
take less than the 1125/day.  That changes the numbers.  As it looks I may 
have to go back and do PMA invoices to invoice them balance.  I wanted to 
speak with you on this before I actually do anything.  Here is an example:

August manual invoice:
34,875 @ 2.6676 =  $93,032.55
24,520 @ 4.4775 =  $109,790.09
Total        $202,822.64


System Invoice:
34,633  @  2.6676  = $92,386.99
24,762  @   4.4775=   $110,871.86
Total          $203,258.85

Difference         $436.21
The reason to the difference in volume is that on 8/8 only 883 mmtu flowed. 

The balance is not a big one but it is over my limit to overwrite. 
My questions is do you want me to go back and send Akzo PMA invoices???
Give me a call if you need to speak to me about this.
thanks
isabel

Kim,
 This appears a little too iffy.  Please get with SCGC to find out the notice 
period. If it is greater than 10 days then we will change our language to the 
greater notice period.  If less, we will leave our notice period at 10 days 
prior to the month.  Please call if you would care to discuss.

Dan,

Instead of saying that the customer has just 10 days written notice to get 
out of the deal, we should add something to this effect - ""subject to the 
monthly deadline established by Southern California Gas Company for 
terminating authorized marketer arrangements.""

Let me know if you have any quesitons - 503-464-3826 or cell 503-805-2117.

Genia - These documents are FINE with me and they conform to Ed's Credit 
Worksheet. As far as I am concerned they are ready to be sent out. 

I did see Ed's email though and I have tried to call him to ask if he wants a 
Unilateral MAC to apply to Enron as well (the language is in there for the 
CP.) Can you please get an answer from him on this?

If for some reason Ed wants a unilateral MAC to apply to Enron too- just put 
it in where it needs to go and send the doc's out. The doc's need to go to 
Dave Hutchens who is the trader at TECP.  His email address is 
dhutchens@tucsonelectric.com.  His number is 520-745-7118. He is a client of 
our marketer - Kim Ward. Please mention her name in the email as well as mine.

I can be reached today on (503) 464-8814.

Thanks!

Kim

It looks like the Smurfit deal is a gas only deal.  Susan works for Summit a 
consulting firm representing Smurfit.  I sent you the RFP last week.  In 
addition to Smurfit they are looking for gas for several other accounts.  I 
would give all the others to EES and focus your time on Smurfit.

 I have reviewed the contract form that you provided in November and have 
attempted to make the changes which would be required for Enron to utilize 
the form.  I believe that the red line document attached  should address a 
majority of the issues which  need to be changed.  Please review and give me

  Rationale


    Debt reduction, cost cutting, and increased sales have brought El Paso=
=20
Electric Co. back toward
    investment-grade benchmarks. The company has exceeded debt-reduction=20
targets and expects debt to be
    about 50% of total capital by 2002. If sales continue to grow at even=
=20
one-half the historical 3% to 4% per year,
    cash flow interest coverage should improve to 3.5 times by then. Still,=
=20
the ratings on El Paso Electric continue to
    reflect the company=01,s high leverage, dependence on nuclear power, hi=
gh=20
fixed costs, and high rates.=20

    The company borrowed heavily to fund its 15.8% interest in the Palo Ver=
de=20
nuclear plant, which supplies 50% of
    the utility=01,s power. The plant=01,s past operating problems and cont=
inued=20
structural problems add some risk to the
    company=01,s already weak financial profile. Most importantly, customer=
s in=20
the generally low-income service
    territory fought against rate increases needed to recover the nuclear=
=20
investment, helping to put El Paso Electric
    in bankruptcy. A settlement signed with Texas customers in 1995 allowed=
=20
the company to keep a $25 million
    rate increase implemented in 1994, permitted accelerated depreciation o=
f=20
generation and transmission assets,
    and froze rates until 2005 in exchange for extending the El Paso Electr=
ic=20
franchise.=20

    In 1998, the company agreed to reduce rates--mainly residential--in New=
=20
Mexico and Texas, bringing them
    more in line with Southwestern averages. By the time retail competition=
=20
comes to either state (2002), El Paso
    Electric will have a fairly competitive cost structure which should all=

    time, El Paso Electric will have separated its assets into a regulated=
=20
transmission and distribution business
    and an unregulated electricity generation business, as required by New=
=20
Mexico and Texas law. Costs incurred
    to effect this change will be recovered in a competitive transition=20
charge. Stranded costs (accrued charges
    related to generating plant costs which would have been recovered in a=
=20
regulated market) will be recovered over
    a five-year transition period in New Mexico. In Texas, the rate=20

Next wednesday at 8:00 AM there is a conference call with Houston about EOL.  
Basically Bob Schults wants to communicate the objectives of his group in 
getting new accounts and getting existing accounts more active.  I have 
talked with him about our frustration in coordination with his sales team 
George Hope and Dan Diamond.  The objective of the call is to figure out a

 <<Book2.xls>> Kim. This is a view of a gas customer in our service
territory. Forecasted load over the next ten years, to the nearest thousand
MMBTU.  Let me know how you like to quote something like this. (To the
nearest thousand or five thousand.)  I want to give these guys full
requirements contract to their meter with a take or pay amount with whatever
imbalance met at spot index prices.  I am leaning toward using the low
forecast (thinking gas prices may go down in the long term.)  How would you
like to proceed on this?  Mike.

P.S. I only gave you the other forecasts in case you thought it would be a
good idea to go another way.  They are for information, not action.

Lynn,

Attached is a gas proposal that was submitted  to John Ewing at Smurfit
Stone Container Corporation on January 17, 2001 by  Chris Foster.? This is
an index proposal with the assumption that  Enron and Smurfit would
regularly enter into forward fixed price  transactions to hedge Smurfit's
cash flows.? Enron would be actively  assisting Smurfit Stone in making
forward price decisions by providing  insight into market fundamentals.

I can provide fixed price indicators  if you need.? Give me a call with  your
questions.

Thanks,

Here is another one.  We have a deal with this muni - Eastern New Mexico Gas 
Company.  The price is Permian plus $05/MMBtu plus transport.  Deliveries are 
on TW.  The deal is expiring 4/30/01.  John Mattics is the contact 
(505/355-2468).  He called me yesterday to see if we were interested in 
extending the deal.  The desk likes the deal as it gives them some 
flexibility on TW (I am not sure exactly what the value is there, but I think 
Janie likes the deal).  Can you check with Tori or Janie and see if they want 
to extend the deal?  Is the price OK?  Also, what is your fax number....I 
will fax you the contract.

Subject: Today is January 24th





I am out of the office almost all day today; however, I wanted to let you 
know I
had a brief chat with Dave Plumb.  At this point, he does not think Enron is
offering us a good deal, mostly because the  -.30 is only on the half load and
not the total and originally in Deal One it was on the full load.  He did like
that the$4.25 had come down to $4.14.

I was set back a little by his next remark which was, ""There is no hurry 
because
I want to take this to the Utilities Committee of Council and they don't meet
until next week.""  I told him the numbers would change significantly if we
waited until February.  Again, he replied, ""Jan, I want to take this to the
Utilities Committee anyway!!""  He also indicated about working within a range.
So probably tomorrow, I will put the pencil to the paper and try to make
something presentable for him to take to the Utilities Committee.  It will 
have
to be in layman's terms and easy to follow numbers because these guys don't 
deal
in this every day.  I am a little miffed that he thinks and wants to go to the
Committee first.  We have never done that before.  Usually we just get a deal
worked up, present it in an affirmative manner to the City Manager and he buys
off on it.  So we will see.  He is the boss!!

I am telling you all of this because I will probably be asking for your help 
to
make this in a presentable manner.

Talk to you later today or tomorrow for sure.  I am in the office all day
Thursday.

Thanks Dave,

Jan

Monica,

Attached are some VERY rough prices for 1,2,3 and 5 years out at Malin and
City Gate.   I am still working on access to the programs for options as
well as more ACCURATE prices.  I know you are just trying to get a feel for
what the market looks like right now so this should be good for that.

Also, it looks like we don't have a master agreement in place with NCPA
which would govern gas transactions.  Those transactions would be done
under the General Terms & Conditions as well.  Did you get a copy of those?
I am following up on getting you a Master Agreement as well as an ISDA and
will keep you posted.

Call me if you have questions or need more info!!

Thanks,

Kim

Good morning.? I spoke with Jason yesterday  afternoon.? Summit had the 
Irvine plant's contract expiring at the end of  April 2001.? The RFP we sent 
out shows that the new contract start date is  May 1, 2001 for that site.? I 
will check the contract today to see what the  situation is because Jason had 
in his letter that the proposed deal would start  March 1, 2001.
This site has a month to month deal and must have had a  notification date, 
which I will look into.
Also, we have compiled information for  another Smurfit site that is on 
tariff.? Every month, we paid less for the  tariff customer, which has less 
usage, than for Irvine.
I can show you that information if you would like. I brought  up this issue 
with Jason, and he said we could look at switching to a fixed  rate.? This 
doesn't really solve the problem.? I had wanted to look  into the possibility 
of switching back to tariff for that customer. It seems  that for the smaller 
customers, tariff is the better option.? Certainly for  the month of December 
(I haven't even seen that bill), it would've been the  better choice.? 
I did want to review the pricing for the larger Smurfit  facilities also.? 
When you get a chance, please give me?a call.?  
Thanks Kim!

Friends and co-workers:

 I have accepted a job trading next-day power in the Entergy region effective 
January 2nd.      I will be reporting directly  to Rogers Herndon and,  
ultimately,   Kevin Presto.        This move gives me the chance to be closer 
to family and an opportunity to further develop my trading skills.      This 
would not have been possible without  the tremendous opportunities that were 
available to me during my three year stay in Portland.    

I would like to thank the entire floor for their help in making the Real Time 
& also the Services Desk a success this year.       The decision to leave was 
extremely hard,   given this level of support.     

 I am confident that next year will be a great one for each of you and I wish 
you luck in your careers at the Big E!       

Thanks,     

JMF                        "

Lynn,

Attached is a gas proposal that was submitted to  John Ewing at Smurfit
Stone Container Corporation on January 17, 2001 by  Chris Foster.? This is
an index proposal with the assumption that Enron  and Smurfit would
regularly enter into forward fixed price transactions to  hedge Smurfit's
cash flows.? Enron would be actively assisting Smurfit  Stone in making
forward price decisions by providing insight into market  fundamentals.

I can provide fixed price indicators if you need.?  Give me a call with your
questions.

Thanks,

Kim  Ward

Kim,

Mike McDonald and I are meeting with the President of Knauf next week.  The 
topic for discussion is energy supply to their facility currently under 
construction in Shasta Lake, CA.  We have previously bid power supplies to 
Shasta who, in turn, sell the power to Knauf.  Knauf wants to meet directly.  
They also want us to look at providing their gas needs - about 2.5 MMcfd.

Can I get your help in getting quotes for natural gas supplies to their 
facility.  I need PG&E city-gate prices for a 1, 4 and 9 year, 2.5 MMcfd 
baseload supply starting July 1, 2001.  I will ask Tracy Ngo about credit.

We are meeting with Knauf next Thursday in Indianapolis, so I need pricing by 
late Tuesday.  We need to leave at the crack of dawn on Wednesday to get to 
Indy.

Thanks,

Laird"

Can you handle this?  Put a deal in the system to deliver a total of 3000 
MMBtu plus fuel into the Citizens IT agreement and schedule it to the Nogales 
delivery point.  Do it some time before the end of the month Citizens will 
pay the transport bill. They will pay us for the gas.

John:

Space on EP to Nogales out of Permian Keystone or Waha is not available.  It 
might become available in early Feb. We can watch it and look for a good day 
to do this.  If it absolutely needs to happen in Jan we might be able to do a 
flow day diversion from the SoCal border but that will add a significant 
amount to the price as it would cost SoCAl Border plus.  Can we wait?

Chris,

Would you try to get the 3,000 scheduled under the IT agreement everyday.  If
the back fill price from California, can get done for $10.00 or less, Sean
has agreed that we can use the back fill option.

Thanks,

John

Hi, Kim.

Finally had a chance to look over the term sheet.  Unfortunately, I won't be
in on Friday.  Can we talk about this on Monday?  Looks mostly okay; just
want to discuss some of the terms.  I assume this is mostly in accordance
with our agreement.  Also, there may be a few errors with the numbers...
Offhand: because of the losses on the PG&E pipe, our KRS will be
3944MMBtu/day at KRS.

Monday is a completely unfettered (meetingwise) day for me.  I'll be in at
7:30 PST.

Have a nice weekend.

-Steve

Steve,

Attached is a term sheet detailing how we would like to handle your gas
supply  for February, 2001. Once I get through the Feb crunch, I hope to
provide you with a similar proposal for March through the balance of the
year.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to
discuss any of the items in the term sheet.

Thanks,

Kim

Please take a gift card from the tree in the lobby and help us give our 
adopted family a very happy holiday!   I noticed some of the cards did not 
say sizes.  The mother wears size 10 in clothes and 6 1/2 in shoes.  Kassi 
wears a size 10 in girls' clothes and size 2 1/2 in shoes.  Josh wears a size 
10 in boys' clothes and a size 2 1/2 in shoes.
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                              
Also - Please raid your kitchen for extra cans of food or other 
non-perishable items.  If we each bring in three items, our family will be 
well fed this holiday season!  

This is also a great way to teach your children about giving.  Let them help 
with the shopping, or even donate part of their allowance to the cause.  

Thanks for your help in making this holiday season bright for people who are 
less fortunate than ourselves.

If you have questions about gifts, let me know.  Thanks.  Teri Whitcomb X

You quoted $5.10 as the total spread you would pay.

So:  $6 + $5.1 = $11.10

Question:  What is the credit you will give Pasadena time their capactiy of 
3886 MMBtu/d?

Answer:
To figure out what you are paying for the capacity:

Assume SJ Index = 6.00

Then, 
Basin Price/(1 - Fuel %) + Variable Cost + Demand Charge (Kim's # for 
Pasadena) = Border Index

Demand Charge = Border Index - $.026 - (Basin Price/(1- .0388)) 

x = 11.10 - .026 - 6.00/(.9612)

11.10 - .0266 - 6.2422

$4.83 is the implied demand charge 

$4.83 * 3,886 * 29 = Total Credit

Kim Ward in Houston x3-0685 is taking over management of this account.  My 
understanding of the new deal is that the fixed price deal expires 12/31 and  
Kim has renegotiated the arrangment at index + .05/MMBtu.  Please contact her

Subject: akzo

Chris,
I am back to this issue.  I have been told that the way we can fix the a/r 
issues is to change the way the deal is entered in sitara.  I wanted to make 
sure you agree with the change.  The way the deal is entered now is 
1,125 daily  and the rest at the NGI index.
The days that Akzo takes less than the 1,125 the volumes allocation changes.  
Making the system want to charge them more since it adds more volumes to the 
NGI price.

I was wondering if we can change the deal to:
1,125 * #of days in month @ $2.6676
remaning volume  @ $NGI index.
This way it reflex the way ENA has invoice Akzo(since Akzo takes the require 
1,125 on a monthly basis.

Please e-mail me back letting me know if this change agrees with how you 
wanted Akzo to be invoice and that will reflex how Akzo has been invoice.
thanks

Subject: akzo

Good morning Chris,
I have a question on Akzo's invoicing.  Since we invoice Akzo manually I am 
trying to reconcile the system with what we have invoice Akzo.
The way we are invoicing them is that we assume that they take the 1125 mmbtu 
daily.  However, there is one or two days of each month(almost) that they 
take less than the 1125/day.  That changes the numbers.  As it looks I may 
have to go back and do PMA invoices to invoice them balance.  I wanted to 
speak with you on this before I actually do anything.  Here is an example:

August manual invoice:
34,875 @ 2.6676 =  $93,032.55
24,520 @ 4.4775 =  $109,790.09
Total        $202,822.64


System Invoice:
34,633  @  2.6676  = $92,386.99
24,762  @   4.4775=   $110,871.86
Total          $203,258.85

Difference         $436.21
The reason to the difference in volume is that on 8/8 only 883 mmtu flowed. 

The balance is not a big one but it is over my limit to overwrite. 
My questions is do you want me to go back and send Akzo PMA invoices???
Give me a call if you need to speak to me about this.
thanks
isabel

I agree with the way you wnat to change the deal in the system (i.e. making 
the 1125 MMBtu * # of days/month the first gas through the meter on a monthly 
basis rather than a daily basis) is the correct way to do it.  That is what 
the client expects and it will be difficult to get money out of them based on 
the other way.  Kim might want to contact the client if she wants to use the 
daily approach for future business.

Sean:  The attached spreadsheet indicates that for Feb., Citizens has 5 fixed 
price deals, 3 of which you have locked in NYMEX and basis, and 2 of which 
you locked in NYMEX but basis will go to the default which I think is IFGMR - 
NX1.

Chris,
I am sorry to keep bring this account up.  Thank you for the price change.  I 
have all the months corrected; however, Akzo got invoice incorrectly for 
February, March and April.  The coordinator who invoice them use the January 
NGI index price instead of the correct month index.  The amount they owe ENA 
is $17,561.05.  ENA owes them (7,922.93) for some volume allocation for 
December 2000.  So the net amount they owe ENA is $9,638.12.
I need to invoice them for the incorrect NGI index used and also to give them 
back the credit owed to them.   Let me know if this is ok with you.
isabel

It was a billing error. We didn't bill them for enough back in early 2000 and 
then too much in Dec.  I don't think you need to worry about it unless they 
mention it to you.  If so, try to blame me and have them call me to explain.

Chris, 

I am assuming this is ok.  Why would they be invoiced for Feb - April now?  
Was this an error?

Have they called you with any questions and should I get back with them?

This should probably be researched further.  If they can really build this 
many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis.  Obviously 
it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard 
to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.  Even if it is 
subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the 
El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.

Can you do this for Citizens?  Tom will be out of the office today, but back 
tomorrow, but please send the spreadsheet over to Tom today so we can be sure 
we understand each other on the arithmetic. 

Today's numbers will be indicative only.  He will call you tomorrow or later 
in the week at 713/853-0685 to see what the latest prices are and be in a 
position to give you a firm bid.  Tom's number is 520/226-2246.  Call me if 
you have any questions as to the format of the spreadsheet.

Thanks!

Kim
Talked to SSCC today regarding natural gas contracts for  CA.? 
Wanted a summary from Enron on pricing you could provide  for
1) Month to month deal for all facilities
2)? One year term deal for all facilities less LA Vernon  and month-month for 
LA Vernon.
3) One year for all facilities.
I know that the box plants are benefiting from LA Vernon on  the Index 
deal.?Too many variables still exist to lock into long term Index  deal for 
LA Vernon.? Can you price them separately?

Talked to Kim Ward at  Enron this afternoon to confirm pricing for rolling 
the contract forward.?  She expressed concern that there are specific 
tolerances that Enron has to abide  by or they will incur penalties.? She 
stated that Enron contacted the LA  Vernon site today to see if you were 
running.? They were told no, and she  said that later today that changed 
without notice to Enron.

This may have  been an oversight today, but a concern when trying to move 
forward with any  marketer.? 
To eliminate the baseload requirements and Gas Daily pricing  for swing 
volumes, the plant has to be proactive in notifying Enron of any  significant 
changes in usage.? Otherwise, Enron will force the penalties  back to SSCC.

Thank you,

I think it will have to sit with Smurfit in some way or  another.
I had just wanted to let you know what John had said.? I  would think you

Matt is the one who told me about this and he found out  about it from John.
Today, we were able to dodge Socal's penalties because  of some flexibility
that we have.? Matt is currently assessing the  situation with regards to
penalties tomarrow.? We can buy intra-day  gas but it will be at a big
premium - and a cost to us.? I think that  we will need to include language
in our March contract to the effect that  if Smurfit doesn't schedule with
us and use a volume that is within Socal's  imposed tolerance level, we will
be able to pass the associated costs back  to Smurfit.

HOw do you think this will sit with  Smurfit?

Kim

Group,

Just wanted to let you know that Anna will be handing out the December 
Coverage Metrics Sheets this afternoon.  She will also be collecting your 
November Coverage Metrics Sheets, which you should have filled out the 
""November Actual Column,"" representing how many times you talked with each 
counterparty during the month of November.

Thanks for your co-operation,

?
Wanted to follow up with yesterday's emails when you get in  this morning.
Let's address:
1)??? Pricing for rolling contract forward on a  month-to-month basis until 
changes are made to the way SoCal Edison purchases  power.
2)??? Pricing for contracting for all of the  other sites on an Index plus 
cost for a one year term and leaving the LA Vernon  site to roll 
month-to-month.
3)????What exactly are the penalties that  Enron is subject to should LA 
Vernon cause Enron to be out of balance for the  day?? What are the options 
we need to present to SSCC to address this issue  in a contract?
4) ??? The Irvine location.? When we first  spoke, Jason was involved with 
this location.? I had stated that I thought  they would be better off on 
tariff.? Due to the recent closing (December  2000) of the core program to 
customers with the exception of those whose  suppliers leave the market, this 
option is now not available.? Jason  mentioned doing a long term fixed deal.? 
This decision needs to be  addressed by SSCC corporate and the plant.? We 
will provide the costs to  SSCC corporate for this customer and decide on 
pricing from there.
5)??? Set up a conference call for the  beginning of next week with John 
Ewing at the LA Vernon site to discuss power  opportunities after August 2001.
?
Thanks, hope you had a great night anyway!
Lynn

Kim, 

Here is the summary.  The bottom line is that by unwinding balance of 
February (2/20-2/28) and the rest of the deal (Mar '01-Jul '02) from a $3.74 
price to a $4.18 price nets Mesa a $.24 discount of the new Index deal (Aug 
'01-Jan '02)

To get them to a $.30 discount on the new Index deal, Mesa would need to 
raise the fix price on the current deal to $4.26.

Eric

Kim-

Just to follow up on our nomination for March 2001:

The total nomination for month of MArch 2001 is 10,000MMBtu per day.  This
includes:
1. 4,135MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Kingsgate (3,993MMBtu/day @ Malin);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa @
$7.71/MMBtu;
4. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;

Losses on the PG & E line have decreased from February 2001 to 3.430%.  We
have not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day).

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thanks.

-Steve

Hi Kim

I'm OK with the March deal. After that, it's a little iffy.

I'm still not comfortable with the April-August El Paso arrangement,
especially since we really don't know how this line will work out after the
split. My preference would be to:
1) buy 1,456/day + loss gas at San Juan Index + 0.05 and flow it to So Cal
Topock(subject to true-up for curtailments); and,
2) sell other El Paso -> PG&E capacity at a future price, tbd.

I've attached my version of the term sheet.

Have a good weekend and trip. See you soon!

Eric,

Attached is an updated term sheet.  As you know, any fixed prices are
subject to change until we reach an agreement.  Also, in the Canadian
Supply section, I left that part up to further negotiations in the case
that you get rid of the engage supply.  I found out after our conversation
that Enron Canada would be selling and nominating the AECO gas as well as
acting as agent for any transport down to Kingsgate.  This can be done but
I will have to work such negotiations with them.  Are you comfortable with
this for now?

Also, Q3 socal basis is now offered at $2.10.  FYI.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will go ahead and put a deal in
the system for March since I will be gone next week.  Just let me know if
you agree with El Paso capacity bid for March.

Thanks for your help!

Kim

I have been told by Kim and Dan that the City is currently not authorized to 
trade in derivatives, but that the city council will vote on an authorizing 
resolution at an April meeting.

In terms of negotiation of the ISDA, we sent out a draft to them a few weeks

same form that we require other municipals to give for financial trading.

Grant,
 I have incorporated the language you provided to me in the attached 
document.  I have been informed by the Corporate Secretary's office that they 
will issue a Certificate of Incumbency showing that the person executing the 
contract for ENA is authorized to execute contracts for ENA.  No other party 
signs as to form or terms, however, the officer executing for ENA will 
require that the deal person and I initial on the line next to his 
signature.  I have reviewed the proposed draft resolution.  ENA will accept 
the enacted resolution and will not require that the City Attorney issue an 
opinion.  If the attached contract is acceptable, please print off 2 
originals, have them approved, signed and forward to me for ENA's approval 
and signature.  Once the contract is fully executed, I will return one fully 
executed original to you for the City's file. "

attending to get this done.  Thanks for your help.  Grant Kolling.

Chris:

I received a call from Mike Danielson today.  He works for the West Power 
Origination group under Chris Calger.  He was interested in learning more 
about what has been transpiring  with PD.  He recently met with Ariz. Elect. 
Power Coop, (AEPCO) who floated the idea of Enron selling them fixed price 
power at Palo Verde and AEPCO selling phyiscal to meet PD needs after the 
AEPCO contract with PD expires.  

We got Joe Robertson on the telephone who indicated you are meeting with PD 
perhaps today.

As we have discussed, our strategy is to not call PD and allow you guys to 
work your magic and let us know when you need assistance on gas or energy 
pricing or physical delivery.
 
Can you give us an update of your efforts so far?  Is there anything that we 
should be doing at this time?

Thanks!

Chris

Subject: Merced - Settlement of Natural Gas Swap


Stewart - what is industry standard for settling natural gas swaps based
upon ""first of month"" index prices?  From the confirmation letter, it looks
like we will settle 5 days after the index is known.  For example, March
we'd settle March by March 9th or 12th assuming the index is published on
March 5.  Is this right?  Just want to confirm since this is obviously
different than when we settle things in the electric utility industry.

 <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

Dan:

First, I've attached the proposed resolution which authorizes the City
Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior management has
reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to present additional
changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to raise questions
about certain of its terms and conditions.

Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the end of the
exhibits.

1.  There is the word ""DRAFT"" above the title of the Enfolio agreement which
should be deleted.

2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain the words ""1st of
January, 2001.""  It should be left blank, until the parties have signed the
contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the date it signs the
contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City to proffer the
to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer) wants Enron
(Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction, as defined.
Therefore, the City requests the word ""may"" should be changed to ""shall.""

4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:   Buyer's Requested
Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to Schedule the
Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's Deficiency Default.
How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a Seller's
Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does not include a
Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason for the omission?

5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers to ""reasonable
attorneys' fees"" yet line 15 refers to ""attorneys' fees.""  To be internally
consistent, line 15 should say ""reasonable attorneys' fees.""

6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement showing the
determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.  It's unclear
whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the determination
before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City should be entitled to
receive a copy of the determination and to question it before it is
obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify, or permit the
City to exercise these rights.

7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will exist if a
bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this (under
bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one may seek
dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11 USC section that
backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change ""30 days"" to ""5 days.""  The City
is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be permitted to fail to
Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by Enron Corp.
(ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in this regard?
Please explain.

10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is ""a Company"" supposed to refer to ""the Company""
?

11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force majeure provision
as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if a FM event
(earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from performing with the
60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation under California
law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last sentence?  We
don't understand it.

13.  Appendix ""1"":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is referred to?

14.  Appendix ""1"", Claims, line 4:  Please add ""reasonable"" before
""attorneys' fees.

 15.  Appendix ""1"", GAAP:  This should read: ""GAAP means generally accepted
accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to Company, and
governmental generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied,
with respect to Customer.""

16.  Appendix ""1"", Interest Rate:  Please delete ""two percent over"".  The
City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes the 2% over prime
should not apply to it.

17.  Appendix ""1"", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron believe the
City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is mentioned.  Also,
what is ENA's bond rating?  Is ""BBB-"" an investment grade rating?

18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed that the
opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and warranties are being
deleted.  But the ""Representations and Warranties"" is nevertheless included
in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the City has not
undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice whenever we issue an
opinion.  We would like to delete ""and (vii) it is not ... Party.""

19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add ""reasonable"" before
""attorneys' fees.""

20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by ""to the extent it has a
legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc.""

21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a matter of legal
policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.  Is Enron
amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less costly in my
opinion.

22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the Agreement to include
a list of employees for Company and Customer who are authorized to trade on
behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to this section to
this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an Exhibit C.

Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are others which I
hope to receive from staff next week and which I will forward to you for
response.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of town after today
until Wednesday, March 7.

Sincerely,

Grant Kolling

must have all registration documentation (including, for example, password
applications and access agreements) approved by the On-Line Trading Legal
Contact before such documentation is submitted or executed.  Any document
that requires acceptance by ""clicking"" should be treated like any other
legal document.  You are not authorized to accept any such click agreement
without written approval of the On-Line Trading Legal Contact.  In
addition, the On-Line Trading Legal Contact must review and approve all
product descriptions and other on-line terms and conditions applicable to a

Dan,

Per the request of Jay Williams, attached please find a credit worksheet for 
a draft Enfolio Master Firm Purchase and Sale Agreement between ENA and 
Sacramento Municipal Utility District.  Please note that there are tiered 
collateral threshold and third-party cross default matrices.  Additionally, 
the attachment contains a second sheet elaborating on the Enron Corp. 
guaranty amount as well as a Compliance Letter as an additional CP Event of 
Default.

Shari Stack is working on the draft EEI Master Power agreement as well as the 
ISDA Master Swap agreement.  Please contact Shari Stack should you need 
clarification to the legal terms in the contract in order to ensure 
consistency across all three trading agreements.

I am also available should you have any questions pertaining to credit.

Regards,
Tracy

You're welcome.  Actually, Jay's a great guy and asked me to work on it if I 
could because the terms were so ""squirrly""...by the time you explain it to 
someone else, you might as well do the cws yourself ya know what I mean?!!!!

I'll be in H-town from the 19th thru 23rd.  Hey, Elliot and his gang are in

Kim and Barry -

I had a couple of thoughts with respect to our meeting yesterday on 
municipals.  It appears to me that with the California municipals especially, 
accellerating the entire sales process will be critical.  I'm thinking about 
how we can get in place as much of the required paper as possible prior to 
negotiating deal terms.  Much of the required documentation (proof of 
authority to transact, outside legal opinion, etc.) will be difficult to push 
until you are actually negotiating with these counterparties, as there won't 
be any incentive on their part to drive these issues.  However, from our end, 
we can prepare all of the required contracts prior to any meetings with these 
counterparties so that we don't lose any time on that front.

With that in mind, do you have a list of target counterparties that you will 
be attacking in the near term?  If so, please forward to me and I will begin 
the process of reviewing from a credit standpoint and putting together draft 
Master contracts to put in front of the counterparties.  It will take me some 
time to get through reviews/contracts/etc., but if you have a list of 
targets, I can at least get started.

If you have any thoughts on how I can help you develop some of this business, 
please let me know.


Thanks,

Jay"

Kim-
This is true.  The master agreement would apply only in the event we would
be buying gas from Enron on a long-term basis.  Typically, Nova and ANG
would have your company assign the capacity to SMUD on their contracts.
Same with PGT on the capacity release mechanism.  Calvin

I was thinking last night, if we were to come to terms on the pgt capacity
sale to you guys and you were willing to prepay, it wouldn't matter if we
had that master firm gas agreement in place.  Basically, you guys would
have the capacity, we would get paid upfront and everything wuld be done.

I was thrilled to hear from you today.

I sure miss you and Robin.  Seems strange not to be driving to your house
on Thursdays now.  I have a little more free time now so I can quilt and
visit with my grandchildren.

Mel is back to work now and maybe things will be getting back to some
what of a normal life for us.  The past year and half has been hard on
us. I know we just have to be patient and things will get better.  You
just go along with life and then when you or your spouse has health
problems it creates a whole new ball game.  I have great faith in the
Lord to see us through any thing.  Mel said to say hi too. ( he just came
up to my office)

When you get an address please email me that so when I finish your quilt
I can mail it to you.

Hope you find a nice man and your life becomes so full that
maybe work will take a back seat.  Maybe a  big house you can fill with
kids?????

Take care of yourself and let me hear from you again.

Love, Kathy

Grant,
 I have reviewed your requested changes and have made the changes which do 
not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes are reflected in the 
above document.  Let me go over your list of items:
 1. I have deleted the word ""DRAFT"".
 2. I have left a blank for the date within the month of March 2001 when the 
contract would be executed by the City.
 3. I have changed the word ""may"" to ""shall"".
 4. Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit in a Deficiency 
Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can be handled by a party at a 
particular point.  I do not think their is an omission.
 5. I have added the word ""reasonable"".
 6. The procedue for how the Termination Payment is determined is provided, 
if the City disagrees with the method and values provided in the statement 
and is unable to convince the Company to revise, the statement, then the 
issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the point that a Termination 
Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn out period should not be 
necessary to attain closure.
 7. We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither party should be 
required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the other party's 
obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add language to extend 
the period if we had some documentation stating the steps that a party was 
pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the other party was 
otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
 8. I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too short a period.  During a 
holiday period, one scheduling error could cover the entire period.  Article 
3 has language which provides a remedy for a party if a scheduling default 
extends for more than 5 days during any month. 
 9. The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated entity and no separate 
rating applies to ENA.
 10. I have changed ""a"" to ""the""
 11. I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the duration of an event of 
Force Majeure.
 12. This merely addressed the possibility of a imbalance amount being due 
when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple points, and the language 
would allocated the payment based on the amount of the imbalance that a 
particular party may have caused.  I think the language is clear as written.
 13. The definition of Act was one of the items that I had requested that you 
review and complete as necessary so that all appropriate statutes were 
referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I started filling it in 
using language that had been provided by the City.
 14. I added the word ""reasonable"".
 15. I have made the requested change relating to GAAAP.
 16. This is a late payment provision and as such a believe that the 
provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I have kept the 2% 
over prime language.
 17. These amounts were determined by the credit group and any change needs 
to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered investment grade and I 
understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.  ENA is not a rated entity and 
that is why the language relates to Enron Corp.'s rating.
 18. The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not change the 
requirements relating to the representations that we expect the City to have 
made.  If the City cannot make these representations, then we need to know 
that before we execute the Contract.
 19. I have added the word ""reasonable"".
 20. The party that has the Transport Agreement with the Transporter should 
have the legal right to obtain the information based on its contract.  
 21. It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.  We can agree to 
meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the parties.  I am willing 
to discuss any changed language that you might care to offer.
 22. We have found that personnel of both our Company and that of our 
Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable and merely allows 
a party to back out of transactions it does not like on the basis that the 
person who agreed to such transaction was not on the list.  Therefore , we 
object to any listing of approved parties who can transact.  We believe that 
each party should be responsible for the actions of its employees and should 
stand behind any transactions that those parties may enter into pursuant to 
the terms and provisions of the Contract.  

 I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in all next week if you 
care to discuss any of these matters.

 <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

Dan:

First, I've attached the proposed resolution which authorizes the City
Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior management has
reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to present additional
changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to raise questions
about certain of its terms and conditions.

Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the end of the
exhibits.

1.  There is the word ""DRAFT"" above the title of the Enfolio agreement which
should be deleted.

2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain the words ""1st of
January, 2001.""  It should be left blank, until the parties have signed the
contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the date it signs the
contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City to proffer the
to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer) wants Enron
(Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction, as defined.
Therefore, the City requests the word ""may"" should be changed to ""shall.""

4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:   Buyer's Requested
Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to Schedule the
Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's Deficiency Default.
How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a Seller's
Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does not include a
Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason for the omission?

5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers to ""reasonable
attorneys' fees"" yet line 15 refers to ""attorneys' fees.""  To be internally
consistent, line 15 should say ""reasonable attorneys' fees.""

6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement showing the
determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.  It's unclear
whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the determination
before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City should be entitled to
receive a copy of the determination and to question it before it is
obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify, or permit the
City to exercise these rights.

7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will exist if a
bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this (under
bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one may seek
dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11 USC section that
backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change ""30 days"" to ""5 days.""  The City
is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be permitted to fail to
Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by Enron Corp.
(ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in this regard?
Please explain.

10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is ""a Company"" supposed to refer to ""the Company""
?

11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force majeure provision
as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if a FM event
(earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from performing with the
60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation under California
law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last sentence?  We
don't understand it.

13.  Appendix ""1"":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is referred to?

14.  Appendix ""1"", Claims, line 4:  Please add ""reasonable"" before
""attorneys' fees.

 15.  Appendix ""1"", GAAP:  This should read: ""GAAP means generally accepted
accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to Company, and
governmental generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied,
with respect to Customer.""

16.  Appendix ""1"", Interest Rate:  Please delete ""two percent over"".  The
City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes the 2% over prime
should not apply to it.

17.  Appendix ""1"", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron believe the
City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is mentioned.  Also,
what is ENA's bond rating?  Is ""BBB-"" an investment grade rating?

18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed that the
opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and warranties are being
deleted.  But the ""Representations and Warranties"" is nevertheless included
in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the City has not
undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice whenever we issue an
opinion.  We would like to delete ""and (vii) it is not ... Party.""

19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add ""reasonable"" before
""attorneys' fees.""

20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by ""to the extent it has a
legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc.""

21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a matter of legal
policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.  Is Enron
amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less costly in my
opinion.

22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the Agreement to include
a list of employees for Company and Customer who are authorized to trade on
behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to this section to
this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an Exhibit C.

Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are others which I
hope to receive from staff next week and which I will forward to you for
response.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of town after today
until Wednesday, March 7.

Sincerely,

Grant Kolling

Chris, Frank

Below the notes on the Phelps Dodge meeting of last week. Chris, I would like 
to discuss later today if possible. Frank, thanks for your input. You will be 
glad to hear that nothing much has changed there. If I didn't think PD was 
such a strong take-over candidate, I would be shorting their stock massively.

--CM


The meeting with Phelps Dodge to further discuss their energy/metals 
situation accomplished little. During the course of a 2 1/2 hour meeting with 
Bill Brack (Head of Engineering, and therefore of energy 
management/procurement) and Tim Summers plus Mike McElrath (two of his Energy 
Managers) the following points were covered:

PD will build two new power plants, one in cooperation with Duke and the 
other with BP Amoco. Both to be located in AZ, NM. Coal fired, ca 300 MW, gas 
fired ca 250 MW. They will enter long term contracts for power off-take from 
these power plants to meet their needs. Discussions with potential partners 
have been on-going since last summer. PD sees investment in power plants as 
the only answer to the power crunch. Gas has not yet been sourced. Enron not 
consulted back then due to our non-asset strategy. Details deliberately vague 
on their side.
PD's energy group is unable to discuss any transaction structures which 
involve copper plays. We have probed this to death, and Summers finally 
admitted that their board will not tolerate any suggestions that copper 
upside be ""sacrificed"" to secure lower/stable priced power. The clear problem 
they are experiencing--that energy price relative to copper price is killing 
them--is being addressed as an energy price problem only. There is interest 
but no mandate within PD's energy group to attempt to address the spread 
issue. 
Medium and long term energy risk management is limited to physical solutions. 
Financial and cross commodity solutions ""would never be approved by the 
board"".
PD continues to search for ""5's and low 6's"" on baseload power in a market 
showing 7's and 8's. They remain 100 MW short, which is driving their 
decision to curtail production. We put 5 year indicative low 6's on the table 
through a combination of clipped profiles and calls on copper (at 90 cts/lb) 
but the copper element in the structure sent them running.
After Brack left the room, Summers admitted that the energy group has done no 
deals directly with ENA since Enron almost won the beauty contest to be their 
energy partner two years ago, but included power procurement as an area of 
value add in our presentation to their board, against the wishes of their 
energy team. This clearly rubbed the energy guys the wrong way, and they 
haven't forgotten it--too close to home, clearly.  I can only conclude that 
PD's board would be in a much better position today had they taken Enron's 
advice then. 
A bit of insight (Frank, you'll enjoy this)--PD claims Enron offered ""their 
ideas, sold back to them"" and ""no upside"" in our final energy partner 
proposal to them two years ago. When I asked how their counter-proposal to 
Enron back then (identified projects first put to tender--if Enron is low 
bidder, Enron wins project) differed from free consulting, they had no answer.

Summary:
It is clear how PD got into their current energy fix. By admission of the 
energy group, nothing much has changed in the last few years there, either in 
terms of personnel or in terms of mandate. This, despite the fact that the 
viability of a number of PD facilities is in doubt due to energy 
mismanagement. Without top-down involvement, we will get no further with 
their energy team.

We are currently finalising the energy-copper structure we discussed during 
the meeting as I think it is the best option for them. I will also work 
further with Foster in Portland to give them the straight commodity offer. 
Perhaps this can serve as a focal point for future higher level discussions 
outside the sphere of PD's energy group. Joe/Michael-- I will make sure you 
get this, as Kalidas may yet have a role to play. It is unfortunate that the 
approach PD uses to manage their copper position seems much more 
sophisticated than their approach to energy. Results notwithstanding, the 
meeting was surprisingly open and candid on their part--no harm done to the 
metals part of the business.

Attached find quick-look results of our site analysis. Toured the Sierrita 
mine, no easy indication it will be closed end of this month. Personnel 
tight-lipped, though their head of environmental affairs lost little time in 
asking for a job. I have asked Bucky to keep you informed of developments in 
West Coast power, as I suspect their decision on facility closure (at least 
Sierrita) will be determined by power price developments between now and end 
March.

Kim, the attached e-mail is from John Gregg.  He is a lawyer from Washington 
DC.  His firm represents alot of the Muni's across the country.  He 
represents Mesa and others in the West.  It appears that Enron is having some 
problems with WIlcox.  Did we give that account to EES ?  Do you know this 
JAmie Bellamy ?  If possible we need to get this cleared up so that John does 
not take it out on us in the furture.

Good to talk with you Frank.  Funny you called when you did.

While you were ""gone,"" the mighty City of Wilcox, AZ signed up with Enron.  I 
got a call today from a frantic city clerk because Enron has fallen a few 
months behind in billing after many months of fine service.  This is bad for 
several reasons, not the least of which is that Enron is paying the pipeline 
for Wilcox.

The reps name is Jamie Bellamy.

Could you kick him in the butt for one of the smallest munis in the country?

Kim,
 Please review this draft.  I have not modified any language from the Enfolio 
to that contained in the draft of their form of contract which you forwarded 
to me last week.  I will read their long form and see if it makes sense to 
include their language.  Remember, in their short form, they had language for 
short breaks which was slightly diffent from ours but with a little torture, 
we could have incorporated their language once we got over the hurdle that we 
can't agree to let them audit our contracts,  which means we could never show 
them what we got for the default quantity.

Kim,
 What is meant by a ""new review of this agreement""?  Have they reviewed the 
master previously?  If so, I have been wasting my time inserting the credit 
requirements into the standard agreement?  
 I have reviewed the contract form that they provided and it is lacking in 
numerous areas.  I think it is a form they put together for use with a 
Canadian producer.  The remedy for a default is determined by the sales or 
purchase price that the other party can negotiate, as such ENA cannot comply 
because we do not allow anyone the ability to review our contracts with other 
parties.  The form also has no credit provisions, no limitation of liability 
provisions, no acceleration provisions in the event of default, etc.  
Additionally, a transaction can only be done by signing a confirm, and if not 
signed, no agreement.  
 Let's discuss where we go from here.

This was the reaction that I just got from SMUD.  I am assuming that we

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state. "

Kim,
 The gas portion of the RFP does not appear to be of concern assuming we are 
willing to handle the swing in their requirements.  The RFP does require that 
we attach our contract form, which I think should be the contract draft we 
are currently negotiating together with a completed form of Transaction 
Agreement for the RFP response.  Do you agree?  I am still waiting for a 
response from the City Attorney regarding his requested changes and our 
response as to each of his points.  I called Christian Yoder for a download 
of his conversation with the City Attorney last Friday but I have yet to hear 
from Christian.  At this point I think that we need to include language in 
the RFP response that our bid is based on them executing the contract as 
attached.

DAN,

DID YOU SEE ANYTHING IN THE PALO ALTO RFP THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OF CONCERN IN 
SUBMITTING A RESPONSE?  I WILL BE SUBMITTING MY PROPOSAL TOMARROW EVENING.

THANKS,

Ahoy again,
Because of all the positive response, I called the  Windjammer Barefoot 
Cruise ?group department and negotiated a 20% savings  for two different 
cruises. 
?
LEGACY: October  28-November 3?cruise
**?Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, Venezuela,  Aruba
??? Ensign Cabins  (bunks)??? Reg. $1000, our cruise, $800
??? Commodore (Double Bed)? Reg.  $1125, our cruise, $900??
????Port  charges,?????????????????  $90.00 
??? NO CHARGE FOR THE  STOWAWAY
??? Fare Share  will apply. It is $890 from PDX, will be less for those of 
you to the  East. Once you have made a deposit I can get the Fare Share rate 
from your  airport. ?
?
WJ is in the process of negotiating with hotels in Aruba. I  will not be 
doing group hotel arrangements; I will share info about  hotels, and those 
who want to stay over can do their own.
?
POLYNESIA: November 5-10  Repositioning Cruise (For those wanting to do a 
Back to Back)
**From St. Lucia to St. Maarten
Theme Cruise: Sea of Wellness,  
??? ??? with Massage  Therapists, Yoga, etc. 
?? ?Deck  Cabins,??????? Reg. $1100, our cruise,  $880
??? Standard Cabins,? Reg. $900,  our cruise:? $720
???  BQ,?????????????????????  Reg. $700, our cruise?? $560
??? Port  Charges?????? ?$65
?
THE CATCH: WJ group department will only  deal with one person, so all 
payments and questions have to?pass through  me. If we don't get 15 people, 
the rate reverts to the regular  rate. So, enlist your funnest?buddies to 
come along, too.  
?
HOW TO GET IN ON THE DEAL:
1). Decide which week(s) you want to sail
2). Send a $200 deposit for each cruise and $100 additional  if you plan to 
use Fare Share
??? Checks can be made out to WJ or to me,  and sent?to ??? me at: PO BOX 
1723, Newport, Oregon  97365
??? You can use your credit card.? Send  me the # and ??? expiration date, or 
you can give it to me on the  ??? ??? phone. My number is:  (541)765-4577. 
3). IF you want to use Fare Share, let me know which days  you want to arrive 
and depart, and from which airport.
?
Simple as 1-2-3.? 
?
Looking forward to seeing you!
Gail

C:

I spoke to Choi Lee today.  It is hard for me to remain professional with him 
as his arrogance and illogic is very frustrating, but our discussion was very 
cordial.  He indicated that Enron has not brought forth any proposal of 
substance.  This apprarently means we have not offered them energy at below 
market prices.  I indicated that should he find some of that energy in the 
""$50 - $60"" range to give me a call as we would be willing to buy in the ""70s 
and the 80s.""  I was not able to learn when he would be in the market to buy, 
but I encouraged him to give me a call if he wanted a price quote.  I don't 
have much confidence that he would call even if he was buying.  I will leave 
it up to him to call rather than make this a priority to chase as the 
opportunities with PD seem to be limited.  If they do need energy I expect 
they will keep the term short and shop it pretty hard.  There mining 
operation plans seem tenuous and they think prices are going to fall.  With 
APS and Salt River out there in the shorter duration markets we wouldn't make 
much money anyway.

Please do not hesitate to call if the situation changes and you need a 
electricy price quote for a structure you are working on.

Thanks!

Chris

Attached are the completed Exhibit A's that are required for the Kern Open 
Season.  The bid requires that a seperate Precedent Agreement (PA) be 
submitted with each Exhibit A, so that means your customers must sign two 
PA's and submit one Exhibit with each.  Also the credit worthiness and the 
affiliate statement must be submitted with each PA.  Instead of submitting 
all your affiliates you can instead submit the following statement:

 ""Shipper warrants and represents that no other affiliate is participating in 
the open season""

Kim,
 The response to III P. should be Not Applicable, unless you are having 
someone obtain a Certificate of Good Standing from the State of California.  
 The response to III Q. should be that the Final Contract and Transaction 
Agreement will be signed by a Vice President of Enron North America Corp. and 
as agreed with the City's counsel, a Certificate of Incumbency shall be 
provided to verify that the person signing is an officer of the Company.
 The remainder of the document appears okay.  I was curious as to how you 
were going to respond to their statement regarding their potential purchase 
of interstate transportation assets and their request that we manage these 
assets for them.  Repricing should work.

 Call me if you have any further questions.

Barb,

No problem for a July 01 start date on the gas supply we discussed this
morning.  The offer would remain the same whether June is included or not.
Also, we would make a reasonable best efforts to take and/or remarket your
gas when the Griffith plant is down.  Of course, if we couldn't do anything
with it, we would be held harmless.  Pricing would be based on a San Juan
Gas Daily Index minus $.02.  If we have to designate the plant as the
primary delivery point on the capacity, we wouldn't be able to flow the gas
to the border on a firm basis.  We may only be able to sell it back in the
basin.

Give me a call if you have any questions -

Thanks,

Kim Ward

This is an example of the type of things I continue to manage for Citizens.  
At this point my role is customer service, making sure their questions and 
concerns are being addressed.  I work extensively with Patti Sullivan and 
Darla Saucier to keep things on even keel.  I would like to stay involved as 
I think that is in the interest of the client and EPMI. but continue to ramp 
down.  This has been occurring  as you have already taken over the 
transaction side of the deal.  If you want to take over everything that is 
fine too, and no offense will be taken, but doing so will take a significant 
investment of time on your part to get up to spped on the deal structure and 
the nuances of transport on El Paso.

As I discussed they want to get together next week to discuss the ""new deal"" 
and the TW operator transaction.  These deals are somewhat hairy and will be 
hard to close, but there is a significant amount of money that we could 
make.  I would like to help close that deal.  With respect to the orig 
question, my thought is I am very comfortable having you determine how much 
orig (if any) you think I deserve after the fact based on the value you think 
I added to the transaction if it gets done.  If you want to handle it 
yourself and use me as a consultant that is OK too.

Let me know what you think on Monday

Enron's Portland office where I worked for Chris Foster, to Houston to 
re-initiate our gas marketing efforts in the west.  Chris has been turning 
over the gas responsibilities he retained after moving to Portland.  Could 
you change the Enron contact that you have in your system from Chris Foster

I would suggest that you get the middle market group together and tell them 
as a group.  Then write an e-mail to send out to the floor.  The e-mail can 
either come from me or from Kim.  I am fine however you want to handle it.

Just wanted to say Hi, I know  you are at work but had to share something.
About two weeks ago, we had to go to dinner at the Peabody with some business
people in town and Jeff introduced me to someone named Cam Smith.  Jeff had
told me he was from Cleveland, MS and his dad was Dr. Smith, OK I put it
together it was Bruce Orman's nephew,  Ok I feel really old NOW!!   He is
young starting out with this particular company that sells to Jeff.  Anyway,
he remembered you and said he always liked you so much.  He gave me scoop on
Bruce and Nancy about moving to Oxford, etc.  He was really nice and quite
country talking but he is married and lives somewhere north of Memphis in Tn.
    What a small world.   Just think you could be living in Oxford town with
that Postmaster!! H A! Just kidding, I would love to see you soon.  Maybe I
can visit you one day.   CT"

Lynn,

On Friday I spoke to Jan at operations, Chris  Foster and Accounting. Not one
of them was aware of the potential of us not  being supplied with natural gas
in April. Jan already had our volumes bid and  scheduled. It a good thing
this whole thing was cleared  up.

Just to let you know, sort of a ""heads up"", that I have also invited Dave 
Plumb
to the meeting this Friday.  I hope you can understand that I must follow
protocol here.  I suspect out past unsuccessful negotiations may be a topic of
discussion for him, however, I do not know this for a fact.

I told him you two were in the Valley making your Spring customer calls and 
Mesa
was slated for approximately 10:30 a.m. until noon+(?) with lunch included.  I
thought we would go up the street to Rigatony's.  Sound good??

Dave, this might be an opportunity for you to ask any questions regarding the
electric RFP.  I don't know the results or if they have even made a decision
yet.

Hopefully we can talk about where we have been, where we are now, and what the
future looks like.  Also the possibilities and potential for continued 
business.

Looking forward to seeing and visiting with both of you this Friday.

Jan

Kim,

Thanks for all your help today.  I apologize for my propensity to catch you
away from your desk.  We all have to be good at something, right?  Anyway,
here are the fixed-price volumes associated with a portion of the basis
transactions done in June and Q3.  I'm missing some deal numbers, but I'm
guessing you won't need those.

Deal Number  Month  Date  Volume Price

   June  12/28/2000 50,000 5.320
EU8529.X/67851 June  2/16/2001 50,000 5.530

   July  12/28/2000 50,000 5.340
EU8529.P/67851 July  1/19/2001 50,000 5.630

   August 12/28/2000 50,000 5.290

EU8529.G-L/67851 September 1/10/2001 60,000 6.020
QS5478.1/67851 September 2/16/2001 50,000 5.530


In other news, a few of us, including Art and I, are getting together for
drinks after work tomorrow if you or anyone else is interested.
Coincidentally, the State Bar is the location of choice, so I hope you
aren't State Bar-ed out.  Let us know.  I believe everyone will be swinging
by around 5 or so.

Thanks again,

Grant,  
 Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional inquiries.
 7. Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to read:  ""(b) file a petition 
or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in the commencement of a 
proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law of the protection of 
creditors, or have such petition filed against it and such proceeding remains 
undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a petition is filed against the Affected 
Party and the  Affected Party is actively pursuing all steps to have such 
proceeding dismissed and provides the other party with reasonable 
documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to be 
dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an additional 30 Days to 
effectuate such dismissal,""
 8.  Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) -  ""20 or more Gas Days"" is acceptable.
 13. I will change the definition of ""Act"" as you suggest.
 21. I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first attempt 
to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration by 
mon-binding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue to the 
satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall thereafter be resolved by the 
use of binding Arbitration.  Is this an acceptable resolution?
 22. We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to enter into 
transactions under the contract.  Our position is that whoever answers the 
trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the company.  
However, we will provide the City with an initial contact list of the people 
on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date the contract is 
signed; however, the persons who are authorized to enter into a transaction 
with the city will not be limited to the initial contact list.  Of course, 
the city could always attempt to contact someone on the initial contact 
list.  Will an initial contact list be acceptable?  

Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above.  
          Dan.

Dan, please accept my apologies for replying so late.  I was out of town
again, and am back at trying to complete 5+ days of work within 3 days.

Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests.  Let me follow up with a couple
of additional inquiries.

7.  Re 4.2(iv), please suggest language as you've indicated in sentence 2.
Anything along the lines you've proposed likely will be agreeable.

8.  Re 4.2(v) and (vi).  How about 20 days?

13. Definition of ""Act.""  I suggest you refer to Article 11, sections 5 and
9 of the California Constitution, to be more specific.  Section 3 is not
regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my knowledge, though
I can see how the language could lead  one to cite it.

21.  In California, the concept of binding mediation is not recognized, if I
have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in which I've
participated.  Mediation is non-binding.  As a practical matter, it can cost
almost as much in terms of time, money and effort to proceed to mediation,
but the ""rules of engagement"" are not as tight as are found in arbitration.
We avoid the rigid procedures.  I believe Enron should consider this
approach at times.  Having gone through a couple, I would not recommend to
my client that we would proceed any further once the mediator makes a
proposal that's acceptable to the parties.  The cost of arbitration is not
worth it.  That's why we in California tend to prefer mediation to
arbitration.

22.  I have to insist on behalf of my client that we assemble some list.
Surely, Enron can submit a list of people that will be initially approved to
engage in authorized transactions.  We can do the same.  We've had an
unfavorable experience with another Texas-based
energy company regarding the scope of its representative's authority.  We
don't want to litigate the issue of due authority.  That list would help
It's not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back out of the
contract, because someone arguably didn't have the authority.  There are a
ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make that claim.

Thanks.  Grant.

>>
  (See attached file: 2001-002ctr.doc)

  Grant,
       I have reviewed your requested changes and have made
the changes which
  do not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes
are reflected
  in the above document.  Let me go over your list of items:
       1.   I have deleted the word ""DRAFT"".
       2.   I have left a blank for the date within the month
of March 2001
  when the contract would be executed by the City.
       3.   I have changed the word ""may"" to ""shall"".
       4.   Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit
in a
  Deficiency Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can
be handled by
  a party at a particular point.  I do not think their is an
omission.
       5.   I have added the word ""reasonable"".
       6.   The procedue for how the Termination Payment is
determined is
  provided, if the City disagrees with the method and values
provided in the
  statement and is unable to convince the Company to revise,
the statement,
  then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the
point that a
  Termination Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn
out period
  should not be necessary to attain closure.
       7.   We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither
party should
  be required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the
other party's
  obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add
language to extend
  the period if we had some documentation stating the steps
that a party was
  pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the
other party was
  otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
       8.   I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too
short a period.
  During a holiday period, one scheduling error could cover
the entire
  period.  Article 3 has language which provides a remedy for
a party if a
  scheduling default extends for more than 5 days during any
month.
       9.   The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated
entity and no
  separate rating applies to ENA.
       10.  I have changed ""a"" to ""the""
       11.  I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the
duration of an
  event of Force Majeure.
       12.  This merely addressed the possibility of a
imbalance amount being
  due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple
points, and the
  language would allocated the payment based on the amount of
the imbalance
  that a particular party may have caused.  I think the
language is clear as
  written.
       13.  The definition of Act was one of the items that I
had requested
  that you review and complete as necessary so that all
appropriate statutes
  were referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I
started filling
  it in using language that had been provided by the City.
       14.  I added the word ""reasonable"".
       15.  I have made the requested change relating to
GAAAP.
       16.  This is a late payment provision and as such a
believe that the
  provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I
have kept the 2%
  over prime language.
       17.  These amounts were determined by the credit group
and any change
  needs to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered
investment
  grade and I understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.
ENA is not a
  rated entity and that is why the language relates to Enron
Corp.'s rating.
       18.  The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not
change the
  requirements relating to the representations that we expect
the City to
  have made.  If the City cannot make these representations,
then we need to
  know that before we execute the Contract.
       19.  I have added the word ""reasonable"".
       20.  The party that has the Transport Agreement with
the Transporter
  should have the legal right to obtain the information based
on its
  contract.
       21.  It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.
We can agree
  to meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the
parties.  I am
  willing to discuss any changed language that you might care
to offer.
       22.  We have found that personnel of both our Company
and that of our
  Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable
and merely
  allows a party to back out of transactions it does not like
on the basis
  that the person who agreed to such transaction was not on
the list.
  Therefore , we object to any listing of approved parties who
can transact.
  We believe that each party should be responsible for the
actions of its
  employees and should stand behind any transactions that
those parties may
  enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of the
Contract.

       I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in
all next week if
  you care to discuss any of these matters.

Subject:     RE: Enfolio Master Firm

Purchase/Sale Agreement






   <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

  Dan:

  First, I've attached the proposed resolution which
authorizes the City
  Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

  More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior
management has
  reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to
present additional
  changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to
raise questions
  about certain of its terms and conditions.

  Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the
end of the
  exhibits.

  1.  There is the word ""DRAFT"" above the title of the Enfolio
agreement
  which
  should be deleted.

  2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain
the words ""1st
  of
  January, 2001.""  It should be left blank, until the parties
have signed the
  contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the
date it signs
  the
  contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City
to proffer the
  to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

  3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer)
wants Enron
  (Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction,
as defined.
  Therefore, the City requests the word ""may"" should be
changed to ""shall.""

  4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:
Buyer's Requested
  Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to
Schedule the
  Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's
Deficiency Default.
  How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a
Seller's
  Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does
not include a
  Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason
for the
  omission?

  5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers
to ""reasonable
  attorneys' fees"" yet line 15 refers to ""attorneys' fees.""
To be internally
  consistent, line 15 should say ""reasonable attorneys' fees.""

  6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement
showing the
  determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.
It's unclear
  whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the
determination
  before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City
should be entitled
  to
  receive a copy of the determination and to question it
before it is
  obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify,
or permit the
  City to exercise these rights.

  7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will
exist if a
  bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this
(under
  bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one
may seek
  dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11
USC section
  that
  backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

  8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change ""30 days"" to ""5
days.""  The
  City
  is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be
permitted to fail to
  Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

  9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by
Enron Corp.
  (ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in
this regard?
  Please explain.

  10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is ""a Company"" supposed to refer
to ""the Company""
  ?

  11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force
majeure provision
  as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if
a FM event
  (earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from
performing with the
  60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation
under California
  law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

  12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last
sentence?  We
  don't understand it.

  13.  Appendix ""1"":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is
referred to?

  14.  Appendix ""1"", Claims, line 4:  Please add ""reasonable""
before
  ""attorneys' fees.

   15.  Appendix ""1"", GAAP:  This should read: ""GAAP means
generally accepted
  accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to
Company, and
  governmental generally accepted accounting principles,
consistently
  applied,
  with respect to Customer.""

  16.  Appendix ""1"", Interest Rate:  Please delete ""two
percent over"".  The
  City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes
the 2% over prime
  should not apply to it.

  17.  Appendix ""1"", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron
believe the
  City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is
mentioned.  Also,
  what is ENA's bond rating?  Is ""BBB-"" an investment grade
rating?

  18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed
that the
  opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and
warranties are being
  deleted.  But the ""Representations and Warranties"" is
nevertheless included
  in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the
City has not
  undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice
whenever we issue
  an
  opinion.  We would like to delete ""and (vii) it is not ...
Party.""

  19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add
""reasonable"" before
  ""attorneys' fees.""

  20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by ""to the
extent it has a
  legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc.""

  21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a
matter of
  legal
  policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.
Is Enron
  amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less
costly in my
  opinion.

  22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the
Agreement to include
  a list of employees for Company and Customer who are
authorized to trade on
  behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to
this section to
  this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an
Exhibit C.

  Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are
others which I
  hope to receive from staff next week and which I will
forward to you for
  response.

  Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of
town after today
  until Wednesday, March 7.

  Sincerely,

  Grant Kolling

                 I have incorporated the language you provided
to me in
  the attached
            document.  I have been informed by the Corporate
Secretary's
  office that
            they will issue a Certificate of Incumbency
showing that the
  person
            executing the contract for ENA is authorized to
execute
  contracts for ENA.
            No other party signs as to form or terms, however,
the
  officer executing
            for ENA will require that the deal person and I
initial on
  the line next to
            his signature.  I have reviewed the proposed draft
  resolution.  ENA will
            accept the enacted resolution and will not require
that the
  City Attorney
            issue an opinion.  If the attached contract is
acceptable,
  please print off
            2 originals, have them approved, signed and
forward to me
  for ENA's
            approval and signature.  Once the contract is
fully
  executed, I will return
            one fully executed original to you for the City's
file.

  Grant,
       Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional
inquiries.
       7.   Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to
read:  ""(b) file a
  petition or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in
the commencement
  of a proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law
of the
  protection of creditors, or have such petition filed against
it and such
  proceeding remains undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a
petition is filed
  against the Affected Party and the  Affected Party is
actively pursuing all
  steps to have such proceeding dismissed and provides the
other party with
  reasonable documentation supporting its actions to cause
such proceeding to
  be dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an
additional 30 Days to
  effectuate such dismissal,""
       8.   Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) -  ""20 or more Gas Days""
is acceptable.
       13.  I will change the definition of ""Act"" as you
suggest.
       21.  I propose that language be added whereby the
parties shall first
  attempt to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of
binding
  Arbitration by mon-binding mediation and if that does not
resolve the issue
  to the satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall
thereafter be
  resolved by the use of binding Arbitration.  Is this an
acceptable
  resolution?
       22.  We cannot agree to any list of parties who are
authorized to
  enter into transactions under the contract.  Our position is
that whoever
  answers the trading phone during trading hours is authorized
to bind the
  company.  However, we will provide the City with an initial
contact list of
  the people on the trading floor whom the city can contact as
of the date
  the contract is signed; however, the persons who are
authorized to enter
  into a transaction with the city will not be limited to the
initial contact
  list.  Of course, the city could always attempt to contact
someone on the
  initial contact list.  Will an initial contact list be
acceptable?

  Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above.
                                                     Dan.

Subject:     RE: Enfolio Master Firm

Purchase/Sale Agreement






  Dan, please accept my apologies for replying so late.  I was
out of town
  again, and am back at trying to complete 5+ days of work
within 3 days.

  Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests.  Let me follow
up with a couple
  of additional inquiries.

  7.  Re 4.2(iv), please suggest language as you've indicated
in sentence 2.
  Anything along the lines you've proposed likely will be
agreeable.

  8.  Re 4.2(v) and (vi).  How about 20 days?

  13. Definition of ""Act.""  I suggest you refer to Article 11,
sections 5 and
  9 of the California Constitution, to be more specific.
Section 3 is not
  regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my
knowledge,
  though
  I can see how the language could lead  one to cite it.

  21.  In California, the concept of binding mediation is not
recognized, if
  I
  have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in
which I've
  participated.  Mediation is non-binding.  As a practical
matter, it can
  cost
  almost as much in terms of time, money and effort to proceed
to mediation,
  but the ""rules of engagement"" are not as tight as are found
in arbitration.
  We avoid the rigid procedures.  I believe Enron should
consider this
  approach at times.  Having gone through a couple, I would
not recommend to
  my client that we would proceed any further once the
mediator makes a
  proposal that's acceptable to the parties.  The cost of
arbitration is not
  worth it.  That's why we in California tend to prefer
mediation to
  arbitration.

  22.  I have to insist on behalf of my client that we
assemble some list.
  Surely, Enron can submit a list of people that will be
initially approved
  to
  engage in authorized transactions.  We can do the same.
We've had an
  unfavorable experience with another Texas-based
  energy company regarding the scope of its representative's
authority.  We
  don't want to litigate the issue of due authority.  That
list would help
  It's not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back
out of the
  contract, because someone arguably didn't have the
authority.  There are a
  ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make
that claim.

  Thanks.  Grant.

            (See attached file: 2001-002ctr.doc)

            Grant,
                 I have reviewed your requested changes and
have made
  the changes which
            do not require explanation or clarification.
Those changes
  are reflected
            in the above document.  Let me go over your list
of items:
                 1.   I have deleted the word ""DRAFT"".
                 2.   I have left a blank for the date within
the month
  of March 2001
            when the contract would be executed by the City.
                 3.   I have changed the word ""may"" to
""shall"".
                 4.   Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity
does not fit
  in a
            Deficiency Default, it is just the maximum
quantity that can
  be handled by
            a party at a particular point.  I do not think
their is an
  omission.
                 5.   I have added the word ""reasonable"".
                 6.   The procedue for how the Termination
Payment is
  determined is
            provided, if the City disagrees with the method
and values
  provided in the
            statement and is unable to convince the Company to
revise,
  the statement,
            then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration.
At the
  point that a
            Termination Payment calculation is necessary, a
long drawn
  out period
            should not be necessary to attain closure.
                 7.   We need to limit the duration to 30
days,  neither
  party should
            be required to wait 60 days before it could
accelerate the
  other party's
            obligations under the Contract.  We might be able
to add
  language to extend
            the period if we had some documentation stating
the steps
  that a party was
            pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed
and the
  other party was
            otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
                 8.   I have kept the 30 days because 5 days
is too
  short a period.
            During a holiday period, one scheduling error
could cover
  the entire
            period.  Article 3 has language which provides a
remedy for
  a party if a
            scheduling default extends for more than 5 days
during any
  month.
                 9.   The reason is because Enron Corp. is the
rated
  entity and no
            separate rating applies to ENA.
                 10.  I have changed ""a"" to ""the""
                 11.  I have eliminated the  60 day limitation
on the
  duration of an
            event of Force Majeure.
                 12.  This merely addressed the possibility of
a
  imbalance amount being
            due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using
multiple
  points, and the
            language would allocated the payment based on the
amount of
  the imbalance
            that a particular party may have caused.  I think
the
  language is clear as
            written.
                 13.  The definition of Act was one of the
items that I
  had requested
            that you review and complete as necessary so that
all
  appropriate statutes
            were referenced.  I am still waiting for your
language.  I
  started filling
            it in using language that had been provided by the
City.
                 14.  I added the word ""reasonable"".
                 15.  I have made the requested change
relating to
  GAAAP.
                 16.  This is a late payment provision and as
such a
  believe that the
            provision should be more than a party's rating, as
such I
  have kept the 2%
            over prime language.
                 17.  These amounts were determined by the
credit group
  and any change
            needs to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is
considered
  investment
            grade and I understand that Enron Corp.'s rating
is BBB.
  ENA is not a
            rated entity and that is why the language relates
to Enron
  Corp.'s rating.
                 18.  The elimination of the opinion of
counsel did not
  change the
            requirements relating to the representations that
we expect
  the City to
            have made.  If the City cannot make these
representations,
  then we need to
            know that before we execute the Contract.
                 19.  I have added the word ""reasonable"".
                 20.  The party that has the Transport
Agreement with
  the Transporter
            should have the legal right to obtain the
information based
  on its
            contract.
                 21.  It is our position that any dispute be
arbitrated.
  We can agree
            to meditation if we can make the outcome binding
on the
  parties.  I am
            willing to discuss any changed language that you
might care
  to offer.
                 22.  We have found that personnel of both our
Company
  and that of our
            Customers change so rapidily that the list is not
workable
  and merely
            allows a party to back out of transactions it does
not like
  on the basis
            that the person who agreed to such transaction was
not on
  the list.
            Therefore , we object to any listing of approved
parties who
  can transact.
            We believe that each party should be responsible
for the
  actions of its
            employees and should stand behind any transactions
that
  those parties may
            enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of
the
  Contract.

                 I will be out of the office on Friday, but
will be in
  all next week if
            you care to discuss any of these matters.

  Subject:     RE: Enfolio Master Firm

  Purchase/Sale Agreement






             <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

            Dan:

            First, I've attached the proposed resolution which
  authorizes the City
            Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

            More importantly, I need to inform you that our
senior
  management has
            reviewed the referenced contract; I have been
asked to
  present additional
            changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration
and to
  raise questions
            about certain of its terms and conditions.

            Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and
proceed to the
  end of the
            exhibits.

            1.  There is the word ""DRAFT"" above the title of
the Enfolio
  agreement
            which
            should be deleted.

            2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not
contain
  the words ""1st
            of
            January, 2001.""  It should be left blank, until
the parties
  have signed the
            contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach
as of the
  date it signs
            the
            contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires
the City
  to proffer the
            to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

            3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City
(Customer)
  wants Enron
            (Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic
Transaction,
  as defined.
            Therefore, the City requests the word ""may"" should
be
  changed to ""shall.""

            4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first
sentence:
  Buyer's Requested
            Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's
failure to
  Schedule the
            Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a
Seller's
  Deficiency Default.
            How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity
fit into a
  Seller's
            Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested
Quantity does
  not include a
            Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is
the reason
  for the
            omission?

            5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line
23 refers
  to ""reasonable
            attorneys' fees"" yet line 15 refers to ""attorneys'
fees.""
  To be internally
            consistent, line 15 should say ""reasonable
attorneys' fees.""

            6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A
statement
  showing the
            determination of the Termination Payment will be
prepared.
  It's unclear
            whether the City is entitled to review and
challenge the
  determination
            before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The
City
  should be entitled
            to
            receive a copy of the determination and to
question it
  before it is
            obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please
clarify,
  or permit the
            City to exercise these rights.

            7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering
Event will
  exist if a
            bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.
Is this
  (under
            bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within
which one
  may seek
            dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer
to the 11
  USC section
            that
            backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

            8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change ""30
days"" to ""5
  days.""  The
            City
            is concerned with the number of days that Enron
may be
  permitted to fail to
            Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by
Enron.

            9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a
default by
  Enron Corp.
            (ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's
default in
  this regard?
            Please explain.

            10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is ""a Company"" supposed
to refer
  to ""the Company""
            ?

            11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the
force
  majeure provision
            as drafted.  It states that the parties must
perform even if
  a FM event
            (earthquake) would prevent either or both parties
from
  performing with the
            60-day period stated therein.  There is no such
limitation
  under California
            law in the absence of a contract provision to the
contrary.

            12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron
translate the last
  sentence?  We
            don't understand it.

            13.  Appendix ""1"":  Act:  Please explain why
Section 3 is
  referred to?

            14.  Appendix ""1"", Claims, line 4:  Please add
""reasonable""
  before
            ""attorneys' fees.

             15.  Appendix ""1"", GAAP:  This should read: ""GAAP
means
  generally accepted
            accounting principles, consistently applied, with
respect to
  Company, and
            governmental generally accepted accounting
principles,
  consistently
            applied,
            with respect to Customer.""

            16.  Appendix ""1"", Interest Rate:  Please delete
""two
  percent over"".  The
            City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City
believes
  the 2% over prime
            should not apply to it.

            17.  Appendix ""1"", Material Adverse Change:  What
does Enron
  believe the
            City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million
threshold is
  mentioned.  Also,
            what is ENA's bond rating?  Is ""BBB-"" an
investment grade
  rating?

            18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we
have agreed
  that the
            opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps
and
  warranties are being
            deleted.  But the ""Representations and Warranties""
is
  nevertheless included
            in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted,
because the
  City has not
            undertaken a court search as is our custom and
practice
  whenever we issue
            an
            opinion.  We would like to delete ""and (vii) it is
not ...
  Party.""

            19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add
  ""reasonable"" before
            ""attorneys' fees.""

            20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by
""to the
  extent it has a
            legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc.""

            21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We
do not as a
  matter of
            legal
            policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate
disputes.
  Is Enron
            amenable to mediation?  This process is less
formal and less
  costly in my
            opinion.

            22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like
the
  Agreement to include
            a list of employees for Company and Customer who
are
  authorized to trade on
            behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be
added to
  this section to
            this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as
an
  Exhibit C.

            Thank you so much for considering these issues.
There are
  others which I
            hope to receive from staff next week and which I
will
  forward to you for
            response.

            Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be
out of
  town after today
            until Wednesday, March 7.

            Sincerely,

Following our discussion of last Thur., we need to prepare the term sheet for 
Citizens. I want to focus on the TW deal first.  There are a number of things 
that I hope you can get from the desk by early afternoon my time, so we have 
time to do the term sheet.

I want to show them a structure that would give them right to call on gas 
each day.  What there be a demand charge?  What would be the Gas Daily 
adder?  High end of the range?  Mid point?  What would the demand charge be 
for mid-point of the range?  We would also compensate the desk to receive a 
demand charge equal to the full monthly cost of the lateral.  The desk should 
love that much of the structure.  Try to get some numbers from Janie.

 I have had numerous conversations with Citizens and TW.  TW will do the deal 
but want their liability limited to $140,000 year.  Citizens wants this 
liability increased to $1,000,000.  We could do this by buying insurance.  We 
might subcontract with TW to do this so the services deals is between ENA and 
Citizens. We would need to increase the demand charge to pay for this 
increase in laibility.

Once we know all our costs, we would bundle this together and then increase 
the demand charge for orig. 

Call me first thing on Monday

negotiating a contract with ENA for the operation of the Citizens assets as 
described in the contract I sent you Friday.   IF we can make it work it 
makes more sense this way and tells a good story in support of the ""One

Please let me know what your availability is for Wednesday so I can set up a

Thank both of you for stopping by to visit last Friday.  It was good to see 
you.
I hope Enron can get some of their ""creative juices"" going and figure out a 
way
that the City of Mesa can compliment their gas contract with their electric
needs.   I think there are some opportunities out there.

Kim, two things.  One regarding capacity releasing:  our billing determinant 
is
14,247 and we can release the difference of this number and what our load will
be.  Sorry, I just had to think about it after the meeting.  Also, regarding
this matter, one must consider the conditions of pre-arranged deals.  There 
are
some hurdles, but all ""doable"" once we get our thinking caps on.

Two, I did not realize that you were on the electric side for awhile.  I am in
somewhat of a ""learning mode"" regarding electric and was wondering if you 
could
just ""jam"" with me about the electric side.  I understand the concepts because
of my position on the gas side, but I want to learn the players and some
strategies.  Dave, I think you could teach me a thing or two also.

Let me know.

Jan

In that case, it's just the SoCalGas core procurement charge (including
brokerage fee -- e.g. their March price was $7.404/dth) that we need to be
comparable to or beat.  We have more control over the transmission rates so 
the
price from Enron we are looking for is just for the commodity at the border.
I'll provide you with our monthly WACOG that customers are charged as the
commodity portion of their bill versus SoCalGas' core procurement charge.  
I'll
be sending you the data today.

Sharen:

As we discussed, here is the Del. Pt. language for sales at NP and SP15.  For 
any sale beyond April 2002 (not purchases), we might want to use this 
language, but only if the trader requests it in a note on the deal entry.  If 
the trader does not request it, it is our understanding that you will try to 
catch it and notify us to make sure the new language is not desired by the 
trader (Use me as a contact and I will ask the trader).  It is understood, 
however, that if the trader does not request the language and you do not 
catch it the trader bears the risk.

Thanks

Ann,

Attached is a draft of Enron's response to your request for proposals for
gas supply to power generation plant in development by Calpeak Power, LLC.
As requested, Enron has provided indexed pricing with the option to convert
to various fixed priced products during the term of the agreement.

The  options  presented  are  not  intended to represent a complete list of
opportunities,  but  are representative of the different pricing structures
Enron  offers.   There  are several additional structures available  and we
look forward to discussing these options with you.

Tim,

Further to our discussion this morning, I have attached a draft of a term 
sheet regarding the development of generation at REU's Clear Creek site with 
the intent of marketing the output to DWR under a 3-6 year tolling agreement.


We think this summer will afford us a great opportunity to negotiate with DWR 
to obtain significant value substantially offsetting the installed cost of 
the unit.  To that end, we want to position ourselves so that we can move 
quickly should DWR make a strong bid for capacity and energy.  
Notwithstanding, we appreciate Redding's obligations regarding its load and 
think that there will be a lot of flexibility with DWR in structuring a 
transaction that meets everyone's needs.

If you are interested, we propose entering into an MOU that summarizes the 
general terms of the transaction and roles and responsibilities.  Let's talk 
after you have reviewed the attached term sheet.

Thanks for your time and interest regarding this opportunity.

Laird"

Term sheet looks fine.
As for gas pricing, it seems we'd be better off just settling per the
contract.
I'm OK with PG&E Topock, but I'm hopeful that either (i) it will prove to be
more valuable (closer to So Cal) in the future, or (ii) we can work with
PG&E to deliver it to So Cal somehow.

Guys,

Attached is the latest and greatest term sheet for April through August,
2001.  Please let me know if I have addressed all of the issues we
discussed.  If not, just let me know and I can fix it.

Also, for your KRS supply for April 1 -10, we are a Gas Daily minus $.50
bid.  For the 3500 fixed priced gas at the Border, we will pay Gas Daily
minus $.10.  Also, for the EPNG capacity delivered to PG&E Topock, our
fixed price bid is $2.10 plus variable.

Let me know what you think about these prices so I can get them in the
system if we agree.  Also, call me if you have any questions!

Thanks,

Kim

To give you an indication of the current value of your generation,  San Juan 
offers are running about NYMEX less $.20/MMBtu for most forward months.  That 
puts the fixed price about $5.50 - $5.75.  Peak Palo Verde Bids are

Q3 - $520
Q4 - $190
Q1 2001 - $125

It looks like you are in the money at least through the end of the year.

We have been looking at the transmission issue.  What substation would you be 
able to deliver to?  We can determine if transmission is available.  

Irrespective of availability, I still believe Salt River or APS will be the 
best physical bid for your energy as they can keep it in their system and 
avoid transmission.  

I would like to push forward to get ISDA swap contracts in place with BHP.  I 
remember losing a deal with Francis Mcalister a few years ago despite being a 
better offer because contracts were not in place.  Enron North America does 
not have an ISDA with BHP.  We could also push to get a physical electricity 
contract in place.  I think we have a physical gas contract.

Would you like to push ahead to get contracts in place?  Let me know.  It is 
not too early to start the process as it typically takes a month or so to 
make it happen.  What would be the name of the counterparty?  You are the US 
subsidiary of BHP correct?

I am a little confused on how the pricing indicated in your term sheet would 
work.  I think if we review the attached it will clarify things.  Please call 
me later to discuss.  I want to make sure we understand how the pricing would 
work for Griffith as well as Enron to Citizens.  

Also, I think the Commodity section of your proposal term sheet has some 
missing words.  You don't seem to be adding the spread value of interstate 
transport to the Commodity charge.  

I will be out for an hour.  Back at 1:00 Portland time.

Kim,
 The language is awkward but okay.  Question, for weekends, Sat, Sun & Mon 
you probably want to use the Gas Daily Midpoint Price published on Tuesday. 
Otherwise, the Tues price is published wednesday, etc  and the friday price 
is published on Monday.  Or do you want to use and average of the price 
applicable for Friday flow and the price applicable for Monday flow for the 
weekend period.  Just questions to consider.  Please call if you need to 
include any of the above concepts in the offer.

The total nomination for month of April 2001 is 10,506MMBtu per day.  This
includes:

1. 4,135MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Kingsgate (4,006MMBtu/day @ Malin);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa @
$7.71/MMBtu;
4. 2,000MMBtu/day under two separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
4. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;

Losses on the PG & E line have decreased from March 2001 to 3.12%.  We have
not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day)at this time.

To review the phone conversation between Jan and me, we are planning to shut
down our last steam plant for maintenance from midnight March 30, 2001
through 1800 or so April 11, 2001.  Kim and I have arranged for Enron to
purchase the non-APEA gas during that period.  At this time, we believe that
the power plant will burn enough gas during the last 20 days of the month to
use the APEA gas.  If anything changes, I will notify you.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thanks.

-Steve

Check Case 2, it seems like the gas cost to Enron could excced the floor 
price as we would be charging pipeline costs.  Isn't the floor San Juan plus 
$07 plus fixed plus variable pipeline cost plus fuel?

Ahoy, 
?
We already have 11 people confirmed for the Aruba cruise, and  lots who have 
expressed interest in going; the 20% group discount is a given.  So, if you 
want to join us on the Oct. 28-Nov 3 cruise on the Legacy be sure and  let me 
know while we still have group space. 
?
For those of you who have paid your deposit, they are already  turned in to 
Windjammer, and your cabins are secure. Those of you who have told  me that 
you won't be able to join us, I hope you don't mind that I included you  in 
this post. If you have any friends who might want to join us, you'll have 
the  information. 
?
CANCELLATION POLICY
You can get a full refund of all moneys paid up until July  1.? 
From July 1--Aug 1, if you cancel you pay a $45 penalty, and  are given 
cruise credit for the remaining to be used in the next two  years.
After Aug. 1, there is no refund. You can sell your space to  someone else, 
though. 
Total payment is due August 1. 
?
TO CONFIRM SPACE
1. E-Mail me at: gail@teleport.com? or
2. Phone me at: (541)765-4577 with your credit card  number? or
3. Send a check to PO Box 1723, Newport, Oregon,  97365.
The deposit for the cruise is $200. If you want Fare Share it  is an 
additional $100.
Let me know the following:
1. What type of cabin do you want? 
??? Commodore Doubles have full sized beds, and  are $900.?
????Standards have?bunks, and are  $800.
2. Do you want Fare Share? 
??? From which airport and which day do you  want to arrive in Aruba and 
depart ??? ??? from  Aruba?
??? Here are some samples of Fare Share Rates  round trip to Aruba:
??? ??? PDX?  $899
??? ??? GSO $649
??????? LEX?  $679
??? ??? SDF  ?$679
??? ??? PHL?  $679
??? ??? CVG?  $727
??? ??? SYR?  $679
??? If you arrive on Sunday and leave on  Saturday, or if Windjammer books 
two ??? ???  nights in a hotel for you, there is no deviation fee. But if you 
only stay one  night, ??? or deviate otherwise, there is a $35 deviation  fee.
3. Do you want trip insurance? It is $85.? 
??? We'll be way?south of the hurricane  belt, but you have to fly over it to 
get to ???  ??? ??? Aruba.? I highly recommend trip  insurance. 
4. Do you want me to make a hotel reservation for you with the  group? 
??? ??? ???  ??? ??? Windjammer's Hotel Dept. is still  negotiating with one 
hotel in Aruba, and it ???  ??? sounds like we'll get a much better rate as a 
group than  trying to book ??? ??? ???  ??? individually. So, in contrast to 
what I said earlier, if you  want a hotel room, let ??? ??? me know which 
night  to book for you. (Right now there is no need to send a ???  ??? 
deposit for the hotel.? If you choose to stay elsewhere  once you find out 
where ??? they put us, that is  fine.)
?
POLY REPO CRUISE
The Poly repo cruise is Nov. 4 through November 10, from St.  Lucia to St. 
Maarten. She will be coming out of dry dock with a whole new top  deck, and a 
reconfigured bar area. We only have 6 confirmed so far on the Poly,  but 
quite a few are interested, and we still have plenty of time yet to find 9  
more passengers. Deck cabins are $880, Standard Cabins are $720, and the BQ 
is  $560.? Fare Share rates are the same as to Aruba, but they have an  
additional $35 fee because you fly into St. Lucia and out of St. Maarten.  
?
The bad news for those who want to do both weeks, is that  there are no 
direct flights from Aruba to St. Lucia, and you have to go through  San Juan 
to get there. The fare for that leg is close to $400.?  
?
The good news for those who want to do both weeks and have  Aadvantage 
Frequent Flyer miles, is that you can fly from your home to Aruba,  then up 
to St. Lucia, and then home from St. Maarten, all for 30.000 miles, and  
$255. 
?
Hope to see a whole bunch of you next Fall!

Smurfit is a QF we serve, but as far as I know, they are current.  Kim W. is 
watching them very closely.

Do we hold any material past due receivables for gas supply against specific 
California QFs?   If so, what action are we planning to take?  With the 
prospect of getting 15 cents on the dollar for old receivables and a 
mechanism in place for future QF payments, this might be a time to consider 
forcing the QFs hand.  May be there is an origination opportunity with a 
contract restructuring or purchase of the plants.

Ken:

Please take a look at this deal summary sheet.  As we discussed, our goal is 
to come up with a structure that we can use for all of our ""pool"" sales 
behind SoCal and PG&E.  CAn you get with the key folks and see if they like 
the approach and to set the index premiums and discounts?

Hey you. I didn't know you were in Houston. You are over there on the gas
side?! WOW!! When did that happen?
You always did like Houston didn't you. I bet you are having a great time
doing gas. It is quite a market these days.

I didn't go to Phoenix because I just had a baby boy. Tyler is his name. He
was born March 6th. I have a couple of boys now  they will be just fine if
they take after their daddy.

Other than the new arrival things are pretty much steady in my life. Things
are going very well here at Mirant (quite the new name eh!).

Give me an update on your life - being in Houston and all now.

Scotty,

Didn't see you in Phoenix last week - I actually was in PHX for meetings
and crashed the power party!  How are things?  Houston is good and gas is
great right now.  Let me know how you are -

Barry,

Attached is a copy of the CPUC order changing the SRAC payment formula from 
SoCal to Malin.  Also attached is a diagram showing how we could structure a 
hedge for those QFs buying term gas at SoCal index (or simply sell SoCal 
priced at Malin).

Subject: PPL Proposal


Gentlemen,

I tried to reach both of you late in the evening, but was unsuccessful.  I
will be traveling starting at 7 am Las Vegas time back to NO.  I have a brief
layover in Phoenix and will try to contact you.

Initial reaction to our proposal during the day was that it looked pretty
good.  This I got from Terry Crupi.  At that time Terry had not seen the
proposal, but was relaying what he had gotten from Barbara Veety back in
Allentown. In the early evening I met with John Baileys, Terry Crupi, and Joe
Cammarano of PPL.  At that meeting they expressed concern for the reservation
charge and floor, especially since the Citizens' TW contract has no
alternative market.  I asked if a cap would help ease their concerns and they
said that they did not think so.  They are really struggling with the
reservation charge as we have currently proposed it.  They agree that we
should at a minimum recover all of our fixed pipeline fees in a reservation
charge.  We did not have a chance to get into discussions about other
potential cost that would be appropriately placed in the reservation charge.

They would prefer a pure index based deal and could agree to a load factor of
about 80%, but indicated that they could live with some monthly reservation
fee based upon the monthly index, but we did not get into much detail on
exactly how that would work.

Perhaps the biggest issue that came out of this meeting is that they do not
believe that the SoCal Border is the appropriate index.  They believe that
the PG&E City Gate is more reflective of what the market price is.  They
claim that the SoCal point reflects the El Paso cuts.

In a passing comment John Baileys indicated that they have gotten a number of
 proposals that are attractive on both El Paso and TW.

John Baileys wants to do something with Citizens and is interested in a term
that would go for a least 2 years.  I ask if going through September 03 had
appeal and he responded affirmatively.  He also said that a provision that
allowed for available capacity to move up or down would be acceptable.

PPL wants to keep this process on a fast track, as do we.

The next steps:

1) PPL will provide a counter proposal on Monday.

2) Chris, what insight can you provide on the index issue.  I do not have
much history on that point, but on Friday of last week PGE City Gate was
$9.08 while SoCal Border was $10.90.  What are the historical prices for PGE?
 What are the drivers for the price differences between PGE and SoCal?  Is
the PGE index mature?  I have not followed it.  Is it a more appropriate
index for TW?

Hopefully we can catch up in the morning from Phoenix.

John

Congrats Kim. Having heard the rumor on the street about the success you
folks have enjoyed this quarter, I'd say you couldn't have timed the move
any better. The next time I am in Houston (which will be the first time)I am
expecting to have you show me the town. I'll give you enough notice so you
can book the next day off sick.

Sound O.K.?

It was good to hear from you.

Talk to you sometime soon.

Cheers

Congratulations on a healthy new baby!  Tyler is sort of a southern name -
I like it!  As for me - I got a call last November to come back and market
gas in the west.  I didn't think there was much going on out there but
decided to go for it for personal reasons.  got here Jan. 2 and gas had
completely blown out in the west.  So far, it seems like it was a good move
for me.

My house in PDX sold in 4 days and I came to Houston between Christmas and
New years and found a place here.  Still trying to move in as I can't get
anything done during the week!  Just had new blinds put in yesterday.

Let me know if you are ever in town - keep in touch

Kim

Hey you. I didn't know you were in Houston. You are over there on the gas
side?! WOW!! When did that happen?
You always did like Houston didn't you. I bet you are having a great time
doing gas. It is quite a market these days.

I didn't go to Phoenix because I just had a baby boy. Tyler is his name. He
was born March 6th. I have a couple of boys now  they will be just fine if
they take after their daddy.

Other than the new arrival things are pretty much steady in my life. Things
are going very well here at Mirant (quite the new name eh!).

Give me an update on your life - being in Houston and all now.

Talk to you soon


Cheers

Let me know all about what materializes with your man hunt?????
Everyone needs a mate, I think.  It is nice to share with another person
who is kind and loving towards you and will be there through thick and
thin.
I know I wish I could see all of you in Houston, but that isn't in the
cards.  I just bet Robin and Katie will have a great time with the new
little girls.  I just love Molly and Liam and I now think I am a
grandmother by adoption.  Molly is growing so much.
I am still cleaning houses while Mel is back at work.  It is tough for
him as he still doesn't feel good.  I just handle one day at a time right
now.  Things have been better for us and I pray they will be that way
again.  One never knows what the good Lord has in store for us.
In June we are going to Sand Point, Idaho for a week with our daughter,
her husband and 8 year old grandson.  A working dude ranch.  Can you
believe that??  They have a lake with fish and nice golf course for Mel,
horses for those who want to ride all day, even a cattle drive, but for
me I just want to rest, read and not clean houses.
I am getting anxious for summer now.  Nice weather always brings out the
best in people.
Now that I have been so long wined and yakked your ear off I will go
clean my own house.
Love, Kathy
ps-  If you ever get back here on business or whatever and need a place
to lite my home is open to you.  I have 2 extra bedrooms that are ready
for visitors.  Guess I could open a Bed and Breaks fast!!!

I wonder if you can get the scoop here.  Why would Tucson sell to Phelps 
Dodge at a below market?  Are they doing it for jobs, etc.?  Let's discuss.

16:36 29Mar2001 TEP, Phelps Dodge Sign Long-Term Power Contract <UNS.N>

TEP, Phelps Dodge Sign Long-Term Power
Contract
   TUCSON, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 29, 2001--Tucson Electric
Power Co. (TEP) has signed a five-year wholesale contract to supply 60
megawatts of electricity to Phelps Dodge Energy Services.
   The contract calls for TEP, beginning in March of 2001, to supply
the power at all times except during the company's peak customer
energy demand periods from July through September of each year.
   TEP Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer James S.
Pignatelli said the contract is an important one for both companies.
""This agreement provides a comfort factor for Phelps Dodge as it plans
ahead for its energy needs,"" Pignatelli said. ""And for TEP, the
contract provides a stable, profitable margin for five years and a
solid boost to our financial outlook in a volatile energy market.""
   Pignatelli said the company expects the agreement to generate
revenues of about $30 million annually.
   The contract gives Phelps Dodge the option of receiving the power
at several of its operations outside TEP's service territory. Under
the contract, TEP also can interrupt delivery of power to Phelps Dodge
if the utility experiences significant loss of any electric generating
resources.
   Separate from this agreement, the Phelps Dodge Sierrita copper and
molybdenum mine south of Tucson is a TEP retail customer.
   TEP is the primary subsidiary of UniSource Energy Corp.
(NYSE: UNS), and Arizona's second-largest investor-owned electric
utility.

you are displacing gas that would have to be sold as indexed.  That said, we 
have never done it that way.  My thought is that you would simply do it at 
the swap offer and have no physical premium arguing that that approach still 
leaves the desk better off compared to a sale at minus .012.  You could book 
it as a physical sale with no phyisical premium.

Chris,

The deals I do with Tom Broderick, are these volumes priced at I-.012 as 
well, or when I fix the prices, do I need to add a new phys premium?

For April the indexes were as follows:

San Juan NGI - $4.51/MMBtu
SoCal:  $12.56
PG&E SoCal:  $7.71

So, PG&E is a  lot less valuable but still decent at $3.31 spread.  

Re: your question, the more I think about it the more I think PG&E is the 
relevant index.  A basket would be better for Citizens but less attractive to 
Griffith.  Can you sell them on the basket?

Thanks, Chris. 

What are your thoughts on using a basket approach to the index? ?As an  
alternative to just using either SoCal or PGE, we could use the average. ? 
Would any other index points be appropriate? 

See the attached file. ?I have provided for averaging the two indexes.

Kim,
 I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions.  
1.  Under Term, you have included the phrase ""with annual redetermination"" 
however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would 
suggest that the phrase be deleted.
2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to 
put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum 
such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap?
3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed 
Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern 
transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and 
if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?  
 Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay.  
      Dan

Dan,

Attached is a term sheet that has been sent to Eastern New Mexico gas company 
to extend a four year deal that ends on April 30, 2001.  Could you look into 
the confirmation for this transaction?  They will be going to the board for 
approval at the end of next week so you have some time.  Sorry to bombard 
you!!  This one should be easy.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim -

A couple of thoughts regarding Charles Hinckley's email and your pending trip 
to San Diego:

1.  I have scoured all of United Technologies' filings and even their 
website.  I found exactly ZERO references to CalPeak Power, LLC.  I'm not 
saying that CalPeak ISN'T a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Technologies, 
but I find it strange that I can't find anything on CalPeak in United's 
filings/online info.  

2.  If CalPeak is indeed a subsidiary and WILL guarantee CalPeak's 
obligations, then we are in great shape.  United Technologies is A+ rated, 
with lots of liquidity available in the form of unused lines of credit.

3.  If CalPeak will not benefit from a United Technologies guaranty, then we 
definitely need to see their financials/management notes.

Will they send you the financials/notes before you leave for San Diego?

J. -

What's your take on this?  They want to meet with me on friday in San Diego 
to discuss a potential deal as we were short listed on the RFP to supply gas 
to the Calpeak power plants.  If we can't get credit established and 
contracts in their hands, I don't know if we want to waste our time - or 
money.  Let me know what you think ASAP.

Thanks,

I just spoke with Kim and she updated me that her credit manager is very
satisfied with the creditworthiness of United Technologies (he thoroughly
reviewed the website and all available information).  He reports UT has an
A+ rating.  However, he can find no link to CalPeak Power, and could we
please provide that.  Kim would also like some additional specifics on the
mechanisms that are envisioned for credit support from UT to CalPeak.

CalPeak was formed as a project company, and is being funded by UTC.

CalPeak was formed less than two months ago, and has no financials.

We will provide a pro forma balance sheet should the bidder be selected.

Types of typical project support are things like a UT gurantee for one
month's fuel supply, etc.

My last communication with Monica's attorney was that he was satisfied with 
our responses to his request and that he was going to run the contract 
through other groups at the city and would get back to us.  I can insert the 
last wording change in the previous draft that I had provided to the parties 
if you think that will speed up their attorney's signoff.
Attached is the final version of the contract.  Please feel free to forward 
it to Monica.  If they are agreeable, please have them accept the red-line 
changes, print 2 originals, sign and forward to Enron for final execution.

Dan,

What is our status with the Palo Alto Agreement?  According to Monica, they 
are waiting on a final copy with the language that has been agreed to by both 
parties.  She is ready to sign.  I know that we have lost one transaction due 
to paper not being in place.  Can you send me the final document and I will 
forward to Monica?

Also, can we discuss El Paso on Tuesday?

Thanks,

Kim

John/Sean:

A few thoughts on the Griffith deal:

1.  Term:  PPL indicates they want to do the deal through 2003.  That is 
really 2003 - 2004 as it incldues Nov - Mar.  Extension until this time might 
require extension of our underlying deal.  This would be OK with us.
2.  Character of service:   The text indicates that PPL would have the right 
to request deliveries be made to an alternqate point on TW.  Why would they 
want this?  This could be a problem if we know the gas wouldn't flow as we 
would shut in puchases.  We would like to make this on a mutually acceptable 
basis.
3.  Pricing:  Does the reservation cahrge include variable transport?  I 
think that is what we proposed.  If not, then the Commodity rate flow needs 
to include the variable cost of  transport plus fuel.
4.  Conditions:  Noms must be in at 8:00 am.  This is very important and the 
a deal killer.  We need time to manage the position.  Also, the weekend issue 
needs to be addressed.  As we have discussed, weekends trade as the same 
quantity each day.  If they want to vary the daily amoount during the weekend 
and make Sunday higher than Sat or Monday, that is fairly ewaasy to deal 
with.  If they want to have lower takes on Sunday, this is more difficult ad 
increases costs.  We might be able to craft a solution to this however.

Kim,
 We currently have a Master with Eastern New Mexico Natural Gas Association, 
Inc. (Contract No. 96009607) therefor, the Confirm Desk can do the confirm 
once it is put in the system.  
 
Ellen,
 Do you agree?

Dan, 

Thanks for looking at this for me.  I did remove the phrase you mention in 
number 1 below.  As for a volume cap, I don't think that one is necessary in 
this case.  Their TW contract limits them to 1000 MMBtu/day.  Any prices that 
are fixed will not include TW transport charges.

Thanks again,

Kim

ps, once their board approves this term sheet, we will need to do a 
confirmation.  Will this be generated by you or when the deal is entered into 
the system?

Kim,
 I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions.  
1.  Under Term, you have included the phrase ""with annual redetermination"" 
however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would 
suggest that the phrase be deleted.
2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to 
put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum 
such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap?
3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed 
Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern 
transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and 
if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?  
 Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay.  
      Dan

Dan,

Attached is a term sheet that has been sent to Eastern New Mexico gas company 
to extend a four year deal that ends on April 30, 2001.  Could you look into 
the confirmation for this transaction?  They will be going to the board for 
approval at the end of next week so you have some time.  Sorry to bombard 
you!!  This one should be easy.

Thanks,

Hi There!

Here's the scoop on Friday night.  I have attached the ""e mail"" I received in 
case you are wondering what's going on.  I reserve the right to blow it all 
off and go to dinner or whatever we feel like, OK!  

It was great up at Lake Conroe this last weekend.  Weather was perfect.  It 
was even warm enough to go out on the wave runners.  This weekend should be 
even better!  

I might go to Las Vegas tonight .  A friend was served with divorce papers 
today and is not doing real well and wants to go for 24 hours.  We would have 
to be back Wednesday night since he has to be over in Louisiana Thursday.  If 
I go what number do you want me to bet for you on roulette?  I would have 
said 38 but that's to high a number, (JUST KIDDING)   Your laughing , right!  
Its not really a great time since I have such a large position, but Its 
something I need to do.  I would appreciate it if you did not say anything 
about Las Vegas here at work since Im not sure how much Im going to tell 
everyone.

Im looking forward to Friday night!
Don't forget your number for roulette.

 Jim

Can we resend this?  I knew that we had done this before but it has been lost 
in the shuffle.  They will be waiting for it ready to comment as soon as they 
get it.

Let me know if there is a problem.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim,

Please be advised, an draft ISDA was sent to Dave Hutchens of TEP by FED EX 
on 5/11/2000.  To date ENA has never received any comments from TEP.

Ed,

Please advise if TEP's financial terms per your worksheet of 4/28/2000 can 
remain the same. If so Legal can provide TEP with a redraft.

Sara,

We are in the process of trying to lock in a fixed price for gas for Tucson 
Electric for the summer.  We need to get a contract in place ASAP that allows 
a financial transaction with these guys.  Have you guys ever looked into 
financial contracts with them?  Let me know what information you need or if 
you have any questions.  They are ready to do something today.  

Thanks,

Kim Ward

I have set up a meeting to discuss invoicing for City of Pasadena for 
February production going forward. Tori Kuykendall is no longer
involved in that deal and will no longer be invoicing. Kim Ward will explain 
the structure of the deal to all of us and it is my goal that
the traders will not be involved in creating invoices. Let me know if you 
will be unable to attend. Thanks. "

The West Gas Desk built up a negative imbalance on Citizen's TA 
(Transportation Agreement) 97ZH.  Citizens purchased 23,175 MMBtu to apply to 
this imbalance.  For the May invoice, we need to subtract this amount from 
usage.  Enter the volume into the area where we show transportation by others 
to the citygate.  This is logical as we otherwise would have to transport 
this gas in ourselves.

After this trade, the TA imbalance on 97ZH will be 30,688 MMBtu.  ENA is 
responsible for this imbalance.  It is my understanding that future 
imbalances will go to the 97ZH OBA rather than the TA.  Therefore, this 
current TA imbalance will be there until it is eliminated.

Call me with any questions.

Chris

Dan, I offer my apologies once again for the delayed response.  It would be
nice if the California energy crisis would evaporate the away gas vaporizes
under normal atmospheric conditions, so that my work load could ease
dramatically.  But, no such luck.

With respect to your modifications to 4.2(iv)(b), 4.2(v), (4.2((vi), the
definition of ""Act"", the changes to ""Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated"",
they are acceptable.  However, at the risk of being a nitpicker, the word
""parties"" in the language added to the ""Arbitration Disputes to be
Arbitrated"" paragraph should read ""Parties.""

Also, on or before the Effective Date, it would be appreciated if the City
could receive a list of the initial contact staff members of Enron who are
located on the trade floor.

For your information, the certified copy of the resolution no. 8040, adopted
March 12, 2001 by the city council, authorizing the city manager to sign the
Enfolio contract, will be delivered in the very near future.  I could fax to
you as soon as I get a fax number.  Please omit the draft resolution and the
deleted opinion of counsel in the final dispatch to me.  If the red-line and
strike-out changes [introductory paragraph, 4.2(iv)(b), 4.2(v) and (vi),
Act, Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated] could be removed, that would be
great.

The City has another inquiry.  The OFO language on page 2 of Appendix ""1""
suggests that Enron is not responsible for OFO-related charges if it doesn't
receive properly or timely notice of an OFO condition.  Is this so?
Further, under what conditions would the City be required to give Enron
notice of an OFO?  Finally, EFOs are not addressed in this contract.  Do the
words ""or other order or notice from a Transporter"" in the Operational Flow
Orders paragraph contemplate EFOs?

I'm optimistic that we can wrap this up pretty soon.  Look forward to your
response to this e-mail.  Thanks, Grant.

Grant,
     Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional inquiries.
     7.   Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to read:  ""(b) file a
petition or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in the commencement
of a proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law of the
protection of creditors, or have such petition filed against it and such
proceeding remains undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a petition is filed
against the Affected Party and the  Affected Party is actively pursuing all
steps to have such proceeding dismissed and provides the other party with
reasonable documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to
be dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an additional 30 Days to
effectuate such dismissal,""
     8.   Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) -  ""20 or more Gas Days"" is acceptable.
     13.  I will change the definition of ""Act"" as you suggest.
     21.  I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first
attempt to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding
Arbitration by mon-binding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue
to the satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall thereafter be
resolved by the use of binding Arbitration.  Is this an acceptable
resolution?
     22.  We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to
enter into transactions under the contract.  Our position is that whoever
answers the trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the
company.  However, we will provide the City with an initial contact list of
the people on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date
the contract is signed; however, the persons who are authorized to enter
into a transaction with the city will not be limited to the initial contact
list.  Of course, the city could always attempt to contact someone on the
initial contact list.  Will an initial contact list be acceptable?

Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above.
                                                   Dan.

Agreement






Dan, please accept my apologies for replying so late.  I was out of town
again, and am back at trying to complete 5+ days of work within 3 days.

Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests.  Let me follow up with a couple
of additional inquiries.

7.  Re 4.2(iv), please suggest language as you've indicated in sentence 2.
Anything along the lines you've proposed likely will be agreeable.

8.  Re 4.2(v) and (vi).  How about 20 days?

13. Definition of ""Act.""  I suggest you refer to Article 11, sections 5 and
9 of the California Constitution, to be more specific.  Section 3 is not
regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my knowledge,
though
I can see how the language could lead  one to cite it.

21.  In California, the concept of binding mediation is not recognized, if
I
have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in which I've
participated.  Mediation is non-binding.  As a practical matter, it can
cost
almost as much in terms of time, money and effort to proceed to mediation,
but the ""rules of engagement"" are not as tight as are found in arbitration.
We avoid the rigid procedures.  I believe Enron should consider this
approach at times.  Having gone through a couple, I would not recommend to
my client that we would proceed any further once the mediator makes a
proposal that's acceptable to the parties.  The cost of arbitration is not
worth it.  That's why we in California tend to prefer mediation to
arbitration.

22.  I have to insist on behalf of my client that we assemble some list.
Surely, Enron can submit a list of people that will be initially approved
to
engage in authorized transactions.  We can do the same.  We've had an
unfavorable experience with another Texas-based
energy company regarding the scope of its representative's authority.  We
don't want to litigate the issue of due authority.  That list would help
It's not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back out of the
contract, because someone arguably didn't have the authority.  There are a
ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make that claim.

Thanks.  Grant.

>>
          (See attached file: 2001-002ctr.doc)

          Grant,
               I have reviewed your requested changes and have made
the changes which
          do not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes
are reflected
          in the above document.  Let me go over your list of items:
               1.   I have deleted the word ""DRAFT"".
               2.   I have left a blank for the date within the month
of March 2001
          when the contract would be executed by the City.
               3.   I have changed the word ""may"" to ""shall"".
               4.   Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit
in a
          Deficiency Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can
be handled by
          a party at a particular point.  I do not think their is an
omission.
               5.   I have added the word ""reasonable"".
               6.   The procedue for how the Termination Payment is
determined is
          provided, if the City disagrees with the method and values
provided in the
          statement and is unable to convince the Company to revise,
the statement,
          then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the
point that a
          Termination Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn
out period
          should not be necessary to attain closure.
               7.   We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither
party should
          be required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the
other party's
          obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add
language to extend
          the period if we had some documentation stating the steps
that a party was
          pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the
other party was
          otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
               8.   I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too
short a period.
          During a holiday period, one scheduling error could cover
the entire
          period.  Article 3 has language which provides a remedy for
a party if a
          scheduling default extends for more than 5 days during any
month.
               9.   The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated
entity and no
          separate rating applies to ENA.
               10.  I have changed ""a"" to ""the""
               11.  I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the
duration of an
          event of Force Majeure.
               12.  This merely addressed the possibility of a
imbalance amount being
          due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple
points, and the
          language would allocated the payment based on the amount of
the imbalance
          that a particular party may have caused.  I think the
language is clear as
          written.
               13.  The definition of Act was one of the items that I
had requested
          that you review and complete as necessary so that all
appropriate statutes
          were referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I
started filling
          it in using language that had been provided by the City.
               14.  I added the word ""reasonable"".
               15.  I have made the requested change relating to
GAAAP.
               16.  This is a late payment provision and as such a
believe that the
          provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I
have kept the 2%
          over prime language.
               17.  These amounts were determined by the credit group
and any change
          needs to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered
investment
          grade and I understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.
ENA is not a
          rated entity and that is why the language relates to Enron
Corp.'s rating.
               18.  The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not
change the
          requirements relating to the representations that we expect
the City to
          have made.  If the City cannot make these representations,
then we need to
          know that before we execute the Contract.
               19.  I have added the word ""reasonable"".
               20.  The party that has the Transport Agreement with
the Transporter
          should have the legal right to obtain the information based
on its
          contract.
               21.  It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.
We can agree
          to meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the
parties.  I am
          willing to discuss any changed language that you might care
to offer.
               22.  We have found that personnel of both our Company
and that of our
          Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable
and merely
          allows a party to back out of transactions it does not like
on the basis
          that the person who agreed to such transaction was not on
the list.
          Therefore , we object to any listing of approved parties who
can transact.
          We believe that each party should be responsible for the
actions of its
          employees and should stand behind any transactions that
those parties may
          enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of the
Contract.

               I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in
all next week if
          you care to discuss any of these matters.

Subject:     RE: Enfolio Master Firm

Purchase/Sale Agreement






           <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

          Dan:

          First, I've attached the proposed resolution which
authorizes the City
          Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

          More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior
management has
          reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to
present additional
          changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to
raise questions
          about certain of its terms and conditions.

          Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the
end of the
          exhibits.

          1.  There is the word ""DRAFT"" above the title of the Enfolio
agreement
          which
          should be deleted.

          2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain
the words ""1st
          of
          January, 2001.""  It should be left blank, until the parties
have signed the
          contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the
date it signs
          the
          contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City
to proffer the
          to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

          3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer)
wants Enron
          (Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction,
as defined.
          Therefore, the City requests the word ""may"" should be
changed to ""shall.""

          4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:
Buyer's Requested
          Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to
Schedule the
          Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's
Deficiency Default.
          How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a
Seller's
          Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does
not include a
          Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason
for the
          omission?

          5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers
to ""reasonable
          attorneys' fees"" yet line 15 refers to ""attorneys' fees.""
To be internally
          consistent, line 15 should say ""reasonable attorneys' fees.""

          6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement
showing the
          determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.
It's unclear
          whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the
determination
          before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City
should be entitled
          to
          receive a copy of the determination and to question it
before it is
          obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify,
or permit the
          City to exercise these rights.

          7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will
exist if a
          bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this
(under
          bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one
may seek
          dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11
USC section
          that
          backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

          8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change ""30 days"" to ""5
days.""  The
          City
          is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be
permitted to fail to
          Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

          9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by
Enron Corp.
          (ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in
this regard?
          Please explain.

          10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is ""a Company"" supposed to refer
to ""the Company""
          ?

          11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force
majeure provision
          as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if
a FM event
          (earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from
performing with the
          60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation
under California
          law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

          12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last
sentence?  We
          don't understand it.

          13.  Appendix ""1"":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is
referred to?

          14.  Appendix ""1"", Claims, line 4:  Please add ""reasonable""
before
          ""attorneys' fees.

           15.  Appendix ""1"", GAAP:  This should read: ""GAAP means
generally accepted
          accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to
Company, and
          governmental generally accepted accounting principles,
consistently
          applied,
          with respect to Customer.""

          16.  Appendix ""1"", Interest Rate:  Please delete ""two
percent over"".  The
          City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes
the 2% over prime
          should not apply to it.

          17.  Appendix ""1"", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron
believe the
          City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is
mentioned.  Also,
          what is ENA's bond rating?  Is ""BBB-"" an investment grade
rating?

          18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed
that the
          opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and
warranties are being
          deleted.  But the ""Representations and Warranties"" is
nevertheless included
          in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the
City has not
          undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice
whenever we issue
          an
          opinion.  We would like to delete ""and (vii) it is not ...
Party.""

          19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add
""reasonable"" before
          ""attorneys' fees.""

          20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by ""to the
extent it has a
          legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc.""

          21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a
matter of
          legal
          policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.
Is Enron
          amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less
costly in my
          opinion.

          22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the
Agreement to include
          a list of employees for Company and Customer who are
authorized to trade on
          behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to
this section to
          this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an
Exhibit C.

          Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are
others which I
          hope to receive from staff next week and which I will
forward to you for
          response.

          Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of
town after today
          until Wednesday, March 7.

          Sincerely,

          Grant Kolling

that the
          City Attorney

Dear Mr. Gore:

I am completely appalled at your behavior in all your ""on behalf of the
people""
efforts.  The people have spoken and been counted twice by a computerized
process.  Now you have fought to pick and select certain counties in which
to
hand count and ""further allow the people to have a voice"".  The voice you
want
to hear can be created through your legal manipulations, which by the way,
you
learned well through your boss over these past few years (great job on
copying
his character, sir).  But the genuine voice of the people has already been
heard.  And since it wasn't the voice YOU wanted to hear, now is being
overruled
by your political ploys.

I have always been so proud of America.  I've lived overseas for graduate
work
and travel frequently overseas for the work I do.  But now, sir, I am
ashamed.
You have shown complete lack of integrity and character.  You do not care,
sir,
about this country.  You clearly care much more about your obtaining this
office.  You do not care, sir, about the voice of the people, but rather
that
the right voices be heard and all others squelched.  I am ashamed of you
and
find this completely a disgrace to the office you are so bitterly and
petulantly
fighting for and a disgrace to the nation.  Our America was built on
integrity,
character and honor.  You sir, have gutted that foundation.

Do you recall the phrase ""God's Country"" -- it still is, sir.  And you
someday
will have to discuss this with Him directly.  He also favors truth and
justice.
And I'm not sure your attorney's will be available to help you rewrite His
definitions quite as well as you've rewritten America's.

Mr. Gore, you are NOT a man to lead this country.  And you've proven that
so
very clearly in your actions over this election.  Shame on you, sir.

And that's ""a voice of the people"" for you

Subject: smurfit stone

Tracy,

Smurfit is trying to do one of two things and maybe a combination of the 
two.  They want to buy Cal 01 & 02 (Mid-c) for $100 flat.  Right now, prices 
are about $144.  They are also considering shuting down their plant, similar 
to Kaiser, and selling us their power contract back for Cal 01- prices right 
now are about $170.  This would book out our previous sale to them for cal 
01.   I am not familiar with their contracts or credit.  If they do 
something, they might want to do it today.  What do I need to do to be 
prepared to transact. And how do I find out about their contracts?

Thanks for your help.

Kim

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

I wouldn't spend a bunch of time on them.  Originally, the guy calls me up 
and says...you know we are looking to put in a gas turbine cogen and would 
like to know if Enron is interested in working with us......the thing 
is....the oilfield can't really pay anything for the steam....are you 
interested?

Yea thanks for the heads up Kimbo,

Black Hills wanted to get on EOL to look at pricing but apparently they can't 
get read only access like we can (they need to put up credit).  Anyway they 
got access through Enserco.

Did that Texaco lead we talked about ever get anywhere?  Let me know.

This Information Applies ONLY to Organizations Supported by Houston-based=
=20
Accounts Payable Processing Centers=20

Earlier this week I was pleased to announce that Enron's new procurement an=
d=20
payment tool, iBuyit eProcurement, is now live for those who previously=20
requested IT hardware from IT Central.  But there is still more to come! On=
=20
May 1st the iBuyit Payables system will be activated for all organizations=
=20
supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable processing centers.  The new=20
iBuyit Payables system will increase the efficiency of the accounts payable=
=20
process by capturing invoices as scanned images at a central point of recei=
pt=20
and routing them electronically for coding, payment authorization, and issu=
e=20
resolution.=20

In preparation for this transition, there are some simple changes to the wa=
y=20
you currently order and pay for goods and services.  Following these change=
s=20
will ensure that your invoice is correctly processed through the iBuyit=20
Payables system.=20

Effective immediately, provide vendors with the following information when=
=20
placing an order and instruct them to reference this information:  =20
*  Company Number or Legal Entity Name
*  Contact Name=20
*  Personal External Identification Number (EID) or Approved Purchase Order=
=20
Number  =20
*  New P.O. Box  (See Below)

What is an EID?=20
An EID is your External Identification Number (EID). This EID number=20
identifies the purchaser and helps route non-purchase order invoices back t=
o=20
the purchaser electronically through iBuyit. =20

Do I need to use an EID for non-purchase orders?
Yes.  When ordering goods and services with a non-purchase order, the=20
purchaser should provide the vendor with the appropriate EID.  It is your=
=20
responsibility to communicate to vendors that an EID is now required for=20
non-purchase orders.

Do I need to use an EID for purchase orders?
No.  When ordering goods and services with an approved purchase order, you=
=20
should provide the vendor with a purchase order number as you currently do.=
 =20


What if I do not know my EID?
All Enron employees are assigned an EID number. If you purchase goods and=
=20
services on behalf of Enron, you need to know your personal EID number.  Yo=
u=20
can access your EID number in eHRonline.  Logon to eHRonline, choose=20
=01&Personal Information=018 to pull up your personal profile.  On the left=
 side of=20
the =01&Personal Information=018 screen select =01&Other=018 and you will s=
ee your:
*  PID (SAP ID)
*  GIS ID
*  EID

What is our new mailing address (PO Box)?
Effective immediately, instruct the vendor to mail the invoices to the=20
following address:
PO Box 4734 =20
Houston, TX  77210-4734

What do I do if an invoice comes directly to me?
HOUSTON LOCATIONS ONLY
If an invoice comes directly to you, mark the envelope =01&Attention Enron=
=20
Accounts Payable,=018 and place the envelope in an AP drop box at any Enron=
 mail=20
center.

FIELD LOCATIONS ONLY
If Houston currently processes your invoices, and an invoice comes directly=

to you, they will continue to be processed by the Accounts Payable departme=
nt=20
in Houston.  Please send invoices to the new PO Box above or the following=
=20
physical address: =20
3724 Dacoma
Houston, TX  77092
ATTENTION ENRON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE

Note:  ETS Field locations will continue to process non-purchase order=20
invoices locally.

How will vendors learn about these changes?
This information will be shared directly with vendors in a separate=20
communication.

Chris,
The refinery is potentially interested in a swap for Mid-C firm power, 20MW
block for:

1Q 2001

2001 full year

2001-2003 (3-year)

Can you provide an indicative quote for these periods?  Current price
levels
are forcing us to reevaluate our plans and targets for hedging.  'Not sure
how liquid the market is this week with all the news and price swings.  If
there isn't a market, that'd be useful information too....

Thanks,
-------Mark

Dear Fitness Center Members:

The Fitness Center staff is pleased that you have taken a positive step in 
improving your personal health and fitness.  The following information 
applies to those individuals who are beginning an exercise program for the 
first time or who are are renewing and exercise program after a lengthly 
layoff.

Many of us become overzealous when initiating an exercise program in 
anticipation of losing weight, toning up or getting fit.  We start out too 
aggresively only to lose our enthusiasm, or worse, create health problems 
and/or injuries that we are trying to avoid.

It is natural to expect results as quickly as possible. However, results will 
not occur overnight.  Attempting to counteract years of sedentary living in a 
couple of weeks is unrealistic and dangerous.  It takes time and continuous 
effort.

The most important concept to remember when starting a new exercise program 
is o begin safely, slowly and progressively.  Always go at your own pace- too 
much, too soon may be counterproductive.

Please take a moment to read the attached document to familiarize yourself 
with the guidelines for a safe and healthy exercise program.  If you have any 
questions or concerns, please contact either myself or any member of the 
fitness staff for assistance.

Joshua Wooten
Health and Fitness Specialist

Dan, thanks for your help on this. I've forwarded the latest to John Ulrich
for signature.  In case I forget, please remind me to send you a certified
copy of the resolution.  I know it's been signed by all, including the
mayor.  The PG&E bankruptcy has taken up a lot of my attention, and I may
not remember to ensure that staff gets a copy to send with the executed
contract.  Grant Kolling.

Kim,

Jeff Brown called me today asking for the following:

1.  A contract
2.  Updated pricing for 1 and 2 years out of Jan 1/02 @ PG&E City-gate.

I indicated that you were out until Monday and would get back with him then.

Hope that is okay.

Thanks,

Laird"

Arco has surfaced again.  They are looking at buying a fixed price for term. 
I will be out for a few days.  Kim Ward will be handling this transaction in 
my abscence.  Her extension is x3826.  I am assuming that we can use the 
short form of ISDA we used previously.  I am assuming we are OK on credit for 
up to 1 year.  If longer wie will double check with Tracy.  Please contact me 
and let me now if this is OK.

Kim: 

As we discussed, you will be sending in the response to the SDG&E RFP due on 
Thursday morning at 6:00 am.  You can send the prices at the end of the day 
Tuesday as I have conditioned the offer as ""subject to change for any reason 
by EPMI.""   In our response, send  via e-mail, 2 documents.  These are 
attached.  Shari Stack prepared the red lined version of the EEI  contract.  
We tried to get SDG&E to discuss these proposed changes with us, but they 
have not called us back.  Tracy put the credit terms together some time ago 
so please check to see if these need to be revised.  If so, get aSHari to put 
the revised terms into the red lined version.  Our changes are fairly 
significant.  It is highly unlikely that they would agree to these terms 
prior to our responding to their RFP.  I want to send them prices anyway.  
This would be done by completing the Attachment A2 below.  Get prices from 
Mike and Matt.  

Thanks

Chris

As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy=20

 a=20

ched=20
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which sour=

would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performan=

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=

Listed below are dates and actions required to finish the year-end PRC 
process.  Please make a note of these dates and perform any required 
actions.  If you have questions, please contact me.

December 15:  All PRC meetings and ratings will be finalized for Sr. Director 
and below positions.
January 25:  Performance reviews must be completed by this date.  All 
performance review information, including bonus payment and salary increase, 
must be communicated to employees.
February 5:  Bonus payment made to eligible employees.

Since we have many new employees, I thought I would provide the following 
information and philosophy about our performance review system.  Enron is 
very proud of its employees and is known for hiring the most talented people 
available in the marketplace.  I believe that is true in West Power Trading.  
The challenge for managers is to provide valuable feedback, and the most 
accurate rating, to employees so they can enhance their performance and 
progress in their current roles and within the company.

There are basically two objectives to our performance review system.

Career Development/Feedback on Performance:  This part of our performance 
review system includes the meetings and discussions surrounding the following 
four documents that are in each review package:  Goals, Expectations, 
Accomplishments, Feedback.  Employees prepare a listing of their Goals to 
accomplish by the next review period and a list of their Accomplishments 
since the previous review period.  Managers prepare Feedback and prepare a 
list of Expectations during the next review period.  These documents are the 
cornerstone for constructive two-way feedback during a performance review.

Performance Rating:  Enron uses a merit-based approach to determine 
promotions, raises, and bonuses.  This is accomplished in the PRC 
(Performance Review Committee) meetings.  In these meetings, the ENA 
management team assigns a performance rating to each employee.  We attempt to 
make this process as fair and objective as possible.  For West Power Trading 
employees, each person's performance is assessed relative to responsibilities 
defined in the ""Expectations"" document.  Performance is also gauged relative 
to your peers throughout ENA--Portland, Houston, and Calgary.  Each person's 
manager had tremendous input into this process.  I personally represented 
each person in our group in the final ENA PRC meeting in Houston.  I feel 
confident the process was fair and that the tremendous achievements of our 
office were acknowledged.

The following is a review of the various rating categories.

NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:  Does not meet most expectations.  Demonstrates some of 
the criteria.  Further development needed in most areas.

SATISFACTORY:  Meets many but not all expectations.  Demonstrates most of the 
criteria.  Further development needed in many areas.

STRONG:  Meets most and exceeds some expectations.  Role model for some of 
the criteria.  Further development needed in some areas.

EXCELLENT:  Exceeds most expectations.  Role model for most criteria.  
Further development needs are minimal.

SUPERIOR:  Consistently goes above and beyond expectations.  Role model for 
criteria.  Very little need for growth and change at current level.

My commitment to you is that by January 25, you will receive your 
career/development feedback and your performance rating.  Hopefully this 
information aids you in understanding the PRC review system.  If you have any 
questions about the process, please see your manager or me.  Also, Amy 
FitzPatrick would be happy to answer any questions you have or provide 
assistance with the PRC Process."

hey, thanks for the email.  I will try to help.  I really like doing things
like that, but enjoy it more when you know something about the people you are
helping.
 How was your thanks giving?  I tried to rsvp regrets for harriets baby
shower, but was never able to get anyone at that number. (?)  Did you have a
good time?  Did H have a good time?  what does she look like pregnant??  your
invitations were really cute.
so what is new with you?  Still like portland?   Any new men?   Did H tell
you that we finally have filed for divorce?  Should be done in about a month
since neither of us is contesting it, and all our property has been divided
for about 3 years now.   What are your plans for christmans?  staying in
portland?   you know, your adopted family sounds like someone i know that
moved up there and is now separated... you don't know names do you ??
anyway  write soon.   I'll send a check for your cause  i think its great.
               miss you     angie"

* Third World or Third Rate?  We compare California's regulatory
system to Argentina's and find the latter's to be far superior.  Despite the
fact that American consultants played a substantial role in designing superb
regulatory systems for many Latin American countries, the lessons were not
well-applied at home.

* Energy Technology News:  A very busy week, highlighted by events
surrounding the power ""crisis"" in California and the Pacific Northwest.  Our
news summary and analysis begins on page 10.

* Energy Technology Stock Performance Tables

Prometheus Unbound:  Navigating the Structural Revolution in Electric Power,
will be back from the printer on Monday.  To be sure you receive a copy,
email us to request one.  (While the report is information-packed, at 330

For your information--

Eric Thode, the Director of Public Relations for Enron, sent the email below 
to let us know that after a lot of discussion with the legal department, the 
decision was made to retain our company name of Enron North America, while 
the offices of Dave Delainey and John Lavorato will use Enron Americas.  Eric 
suggested that if we have ordered any business cards or stationery with Enron 
Americas that we re-order and use Enron North America.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Stop the presses....I just received new information regarding the name 
change.  We have decided to keep everyone as Enron NOrth America or Enron 
South America.  The only people who will use Enron Americas are Dave Delainey 
and John Lavorato.  Hope this does not cause a problem.  If it does, please 
call me to discuss.  I'm sorry for the incorrect information a week or so ago.

Good Morning,

Exciting News!!  We now have a new Portland Web based IT incident & tracking 
application to replace the existing Westdeskitissues.mde Access application.  
The new Web based solution adds several key enhancements that will hopefully 
improve IT response time and improve our communications back to you when 
problems are resolved.

Here are some of the key enhancments:
1.  Ability to query outstanding & resolved issues.
2.  IT problem/resolution knowledge base.
3.  Web page that displays important IT contact information.
4.  Automatic email notifications to resolution team members.
4.  And much, much, more.

For those of you who may be new to the office, or may have forgotten about 
the old Westitissues.mde application.  This application is continuously 
monitored by the production support team for infrastructure (PC's, Monitors, 
terminal-server, LAN, WAN, etc) and application (Enpower, Portcalc, CAPS, 
etc.) problems or enhancements requested by users.  This database is also 
summarized to capture metrics which are then used to evaluate the performance 
of the IT group.

Here are the steps to using the new West Desk Problem Tracking System:

New Login:

1. Go to http://westdesksupport/
2. Click the Login button towards the bottom of the page.
3. In the UserName Box, Enter:  ITWD.
4. For the Password type in: Password.
5. On the next Screen, fill out all the information. (Only certain fields are 
required, but filling out everything is preferable)
6. After Clicking the submit button, you are going to be asked to login with 
the new username and password you created in the New User Area.
7. Upon submitting, you will come to the main index page.

Adding a WorkOrder:

1. On the Main index page, click on the link add incident to log under the 
heading of West Desk Links.
2. Fill out as much information as possible. For IT Contact, please enter 
appropriate contact, or if you are not sure, select mtully.
3. Select Priority. (This may be changed by IT)
4. Submit form.

Note: For the description and response fields, you may use html tags for the 
formatting of text for display.

The rest is pretty self explanatory. If you hover your cursor over a link or 
picture or text box, a texttip will appear and tell you what that link or 
textbox is for.

Thanks,

Mike Tully
Trading Floor Support

P.S. When entering a incident, there are two different types of ""NEW 
Requests"". One is New Request (Problem). This is used for reporting an error 
or problem with an application. The other is New Request (Enhancement) which 
is used for requesting an enhancement to an application."

As you are aware, the Trading Floor adopted three families for the holiday 
season.  Thanks to your support all three families will have a better holiday 
than they would have without your help.  You have been more than generous!

We have one family (single mom with four children) who has a boy who's 
birthday is tomorrow.  We would like to make sure this 12 year old boy gets a 
birthday gift.  If you would like to help us with this, we are asking 
everyone to pitch-in a dollar or two.  Please forward your money to Theresa 
Villeggiante or Grace Rodriguez.

Thanks!

I just opened the holiday card with the group photo.  Great picture.  It
shows how beautiful the weather is in Portland!  When our group used to do
pictures, we usually ended up looking into the sun - just like you.  We end
up squinting, but otherwise it makes a good picture.  Thank you for thinking
of me.  Be sure to show this to Bob Badeer since I do not have his email
address.  May God bless you all with a wonderful holiday season; and may we
all be exempt from refunds!"

As everyone is surely aware after last night's going away party, John Forney 
is heading back to Houston to trade the Short Term Entergy market.  Bill 
Williams III will be assuming responsibility for the Real Time desk and will 
report to Greg Wolfe.  There are three major areas of responsibility that 
Greg and Bill will be focussing on in 2001.  The first is the management of 
EPMI's physical power flows.  This entails checking out with counterparties, 
handling cuts, and ensuring that all of our risk and settlement systems 
reflect the proper information.  The second area is trading done by the Real 
Time group.  Each day, our Real Time desk combs the market looking for 
attractive trading opportunities.  The third area is the Services Desk.  The 
Services Desk provides scheduling and settlements services to customers who 
don't have the staff or systems to do it themselves.  We have seen our 
Services business grow dramatically this year.

Greg Wolfe will be ultimately responsible for the efforts of the Real Time 
desk and our Services business.  Les Rawson will continue in his role on the 
Services desk and will report to Greg.  Bill Williams will be responsible for 
the day to day operations of the Real Time desk.  Greg will continue to work 
closely with the middle market group and will maintain some of his coverage 
responsibilities.  Chris Foster will continue to manage the Middle Market 
group."

bubbly or fine wine...

Got your Christmas e-mail. Could you tell us the address to send the check?

The continued growth of the Enron Europe office and related businesses has 
prompted a change in the management of Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) in 
London.  Effective in early January, 2001, Ted Murphy will transfer to the 
London office and manage the RAC activities which includes credit/market risk 
and underwriting. Ted will continue to manage the Enron Global Market Risk 
activities.  Steve Young, currently managing RAC in London, will begin a new 
assignment within  EBS, also in London.

The Houston Market Risk group will be managed by David Port.

As Enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses, it 
is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent 
and accurate manner across the company.  Hopefully this realignment will 
accomplish that goal.

Please join me in congratulating Ted, David and Steve on their new 
assignments."

For your information, the organizational change below will not bring about a 
change in administrative coverage for West Power Trading.  Anna Mehrer will 
continue to support Greg Wolfe as part of the Middle Market and Services 
group.  Kathy Sheppard will continue to support Bill Williams III and Real 
Time.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Organizational Update

As everyone is surely aware after last night's going away party, John Forney 
is heading back to Houston to trade the Short Term Entergy market.  Bill 
Williams III will be assuming responsibility for the Real Time desk and will 
report to Greg Wolfe.  There are three major areas of responsibility that 
Greg and Bill will be focussing on in 2001.  The first is the management of 
EPMI's physical power flows.  This entails checking out with counterparties, 
handling cuts, and ensuring that all of our risk and settlement systems 
reflect the proper information.  The second area is trading done by the Real 
Time group.  Each day, our Real Time desk combs the market looking for 
attractive trading opportunities.  The third area is the Services Desk.  The 
Services Desk provides scheduling and settlements services to customers who 
don't have the staff or systems to do it themselves.  We have seen our 
Services business grow dramatically this year.

Greg Wolfe will be ultimately responsible for the efforts of the Real Time 
desk and our Services business.  Les Rawson will continue in his role on the 
Services desk and will report to Greg.  Bill Williams will be responsible for 
the day to day operations of the Real Time desk.  Greg will continue to work 
closely with the middle market group and will maintain some of his coverage 
responsibilities.  Chris Foster will continue to manage the Middle Market 
group.

I have found numerous pictures of Frank Vickers along with some of you.  
Since he is leaving Portland I plan on making a scrapbook to hold his 
memories of Portland and you!  If you would like to write a personal note to 
Frank, please do so and send it to me via email, a hand-written note via 
inner-office mail, or drop it at my desk.  Also, I have some special paper at 
my desk if you prefer to use that.  The sooner the better as time is quickly 
running out.

Thanks.

Mollie

Your best bet for ""instantaneous"" credit answers would be to call the credit 
hotline.  You should probably ask for Russell Diamond to get domestic gas 
questions answered.  Then Jay Williams or Veronica Espinoza as back up.  
Russell Diamond was the one who worked on Sandia Resources from a WMBE gas 
perspective.

On the legal front, your physical gas paralegal is Debra Perlingiere.
The physical gas attorneys that come to mind are Dan Hyvl and Stacy Dickson.  
Their boss I believe is Jeff Hodge.

Hope this info helps you.  Take care.   Happy New Year's!  Did you party in 
Houston???  Where are you gonna live?  Found a place yet?  I'm looking into 
ski lessons at Meadows.

Take Care.  I'm pushing on Tuscon so will advise of an update shortlty.

Ed/Wendy,

In May, ENA sent a draft ISDA to Tuscon for review and comments.  However, 
the cp had misplace the draft and is requesting a new draft.  Can you scrub a 
quick review on Tuscon, review the physical power ITM position, and propose 
terms for a new draft ISDA?

Ed-please have Wendy work with you on the re-review if needed.  Please 
forward the cws to Sara in swaps legal.

The cp is looking for a power swap this summer.

I had a good ""clear the air"" talk with Art yesterday.  We came up with a 
couple things that will improve the process. 

1.  Citizens needs to subscribe to EOL so that Art can execute trades without 
calling me or anyone else at Enron.  This will improve execution.  Sean, 
please make this a priority.  Call the 800 number and make it happen.  Call 
me if you need help.

2.      Kim Ward will be the point person for gettting NYMEX and Basis 
quotes.  Kim's number is 713/853-0685.  I will be helping Kim, but she is in 
a better position to execute trades as she is on the desk.

3.  Citizens should consider getting swap contracts in place with 
counterparties other than Enron (and Enron as well) so that you can do fixed 
price deals with others in the event that you can obtain more attractive 
pricing than what Enron is offering at any point in time.

Please let me know if you want further follow-up re: your e-mail below.  
Also, please push forward on the 2 contracts (gas contract amendedment and 
power contract master).

Thanks

Sean,
?
As we discussed on  the telephone today, I have a concern surrounding the 
pricing Enron gave  us?while establishing NYMEX fixed pricing for the months 
of April 2001, May  2001, June 2001, July 2001 and August 2001.
?
Today, we first  contacted Enron to obtain market quotes at 10:58 am cst.? In 
every month we  requested a quote on NYMEX, Enron gave a quote that was no 
less than two cents  higher than the offer on the floor of the NYMEX.? Gelber 
questioned the  quotes as being outside the market.? Gelber chose to end the 
telephone call  after questioning the quotes.? At 11:08 am, Gelber called 
Enron  again.? The election was made to proceed with execution of the 
necessary  positions.? For the months of April, May, June, and August we 
received  prices that were at the offer side of the NYMEX bid/offer spread.? 
However,  on the month of July the price received was not only outside of the 
then current  NYMEX bid/offer range but was indeed higher than the NYMEX high 
for the day on  the July contract.? Specifically, the Citizen's Arizona Gas 
price received  for July 2001 from Enron is $5.340, the high for the day on 
NYMEX was  $5.290.
?
I do not currently  feel comfortable with Enron's pricing methods.? My 
assessment after today's  transactions is only partially favorable.? It is my 
understanding that  Citizen's compensates Enron in other parts of your 
business relationship and  their should be no need for them to mark prices up 
when executing either NYMEX,  basis, or a combination of the two.
?
Citizen's may want  to consider pursuing alternative mechanism's?for securing 
fixed pricing via  other accessible markets.
?
Sincerely,
?

How are you planning on keeping track of all the trades you do for Citizens 
and communicating that info to them?  We need to make sure that all the 
billing people have this info so the bills are correct.  My suggestion is 
that you maintain a spreadsheet that has all trades and send it to me and the

Chris,

Thank you for the conversation the other day.  Gelber's intent is to sit on
the side of AZ Gas and that does not necessarily mean in opposition to
Enron.  I personally hope to work constructively for their benefit, and to
the benefit of Enron, Gelber and others who may be involved.  Sometimes
however, our interests may be contrary and I apologize up front when that is
the case.

I have urged Sean to move ahead on EOL and he is doing so.  Moreover please
provide your fax number and I'll fax you audited financials.

Thanks.

Art Gelber

Darla,

I have completed reviewing your invoice revisions for October and November
1999 and January, February, June and July 2000.  I have found a couple of
discrepancies in the worksheets that you sent on December 22, 1999.  Those
discrepancies are as follows:

1) October 1999 - Transwestern - Commodity sale/purchase cost and pipeline
transportation cost do not equal the total Transwestern cost.  This is do to
not using the rounding option in the detail computations.  While this
difference is only $0.01, the spreadsheet should total correctly.

2) January 2000 - EPNG - Total transportation cost was not equal to sum of
details.  Use of rounding option corrects the discrepancy.

3) July 2000 - Transwestern - Transportation commodity charges were based
upon a volume of 153,272.  The net usage after deducting 3rd party deliveries
of 5,187 from measured city gate throughput of 160,650 is 155,463.  Net usage
should have used in calculating transportation commodity charges.

Attached are revised Enron worksheets for the above stated months that have
been modified to reflect these changes.

In an attempt to close the book on invoicing and payment issues, I have
extended Enron's ""Citizens Revisions"" worksheet to cover the period November
1998 through July 2000, file attached.  The data presented for the months
January through July 2000, were taken from Citizens' records.  I request that
you verify the accuracy of that data with Enron's records and advise me of
any discrepancies. It should be noted that all corrections that you made plus
the one stated above are reflected in the worksheet.

I will be in Houston next week and would like to meet with you to bring
closure to these invoicing issues.  I am scheduled to meet with Frank Vickers
and other Enron folks at 10 AM on Wednesday, January 10, 2001.  I have a
flight to return to New Orleans at 4:30 PM.  My morning meeting with Enron
should conclude by noon.  Please check your schedule and see if there is time
either before 10 AM or after noon, that you can meet with me.  I am willing
to meet before and after my morning meeting, if necessary.

Please advise on your availability to meet and should you have any questions,
please let me know.  Thanks for your assistance.

Patti Sullivan has cerated a new El Paso interruptible contract for 
delivering to Griffith.  It is an Enron contract.  This agreemnet is 9M52.  
For the gas we delivered yesterday, we will be invoicing Citizens based on 
deliveries as a special deal over and above our base deal.  You will have an 
imbalance at Griffith that will go to your OBA.  I will get you the price 
later today.

Nogales used some gas last month.  Citizens has an IT contract 989N that we 
can use to deliver to this point.  I am still a little uncertain as to how 
you want us to handle this.  Please advise if the following procedure is how 
you want it handled:

1.  EPMI will deliver gas to Nogales on 989N
2.  When gas is delivered, we will bill Citizens based on the price when gas 
is delivered rather then when used, as you want this account isolated.
3.  We should ""0-out"" any current imbalance position at Noglaes based on 1 
and 2 above.

Please call to discuss.

Chris

 This appears a little too iffy.  Please get with SCGC to find out the notice 
period. If it is greater than 10 days then we will change our language to the 
greater notice period.  If less, we will leave our notice period at 10 days 
prior to the month.  Please call if you would care to discuss.

Instead of saying that the customer has just 10 days written notice to get

Hey Guys

I'm considering some fixed or indexed gas and energy purchase transactions
with built-in price caps and/or floors as a hedge.
Given our sparse resources, I know I won't be able to ISDA agreements or get
a NYMEX account opened anytime soon.

Here are a couple of concepts that I'd like to float in hopes that your
organizations may feel comfortable executing under WSPP or existing gas
supply agreements:
1) Fixed price purchase that converts to monthly index below a specific
strike (implicit put);
2) Collared index (put/call) or capped index (call).

I'm thinking of border gas and SP15 energy products with fixed volumes,
prices (as applicable) and strikes by quarter.

Any comments?

This note is in reference to our phone conversation  earlier today.? As a 
result of that conversation the following actions will  be taken:

Gelber will add to its deal tracking spreadsheet  a?column for Enron's 
transaction number and make sure the field is  maintained for all Enron 
transactions;
A copy of the deal tracking spreadsheet for  January 2001 will be sent to 
Enron;
Linking of Basis transactions with NYMEX  transactions will be done as 
follows for any particular transaction  month:

??? If fixed Basis volumes are less  than fixed NYMEX??volumes, Gelber will 
link Basis volumes to  an?equivalent?volume of fixed NYMEX gas;
??? If fixed Basis volumes  are?greater than fixed NYMEX volumes, all NYMEX 
transactions will be  linked to one or more?Basis transactions and the 
balance of Basis volumes  will be assumed to be linked to Index gas?
??? If there are no fixed NYMEX  transactions, any Basis transactions will be 
assumed linked to Index  gas.

Please contact me if any of this is unclear or you  have?issues.? Thanks.?

The refinery is potentially interested in a swap for Mid-C firm power, 20MW
block for:

1Q 2001

2001 full year

2001-2003 (3-year)

Can you provide an indicative quote for these periods?  Current price
levels
are forcing us to reevaluate our plans and targets for hedging.  'Not sure
how liquid the market is this week with all the news and price swings.  If
there isn't a market, that'd be useful information too....

Thanks,

To give you an indication of the current value of your generation,  San Juan 
offers are running about NYMEX less $.20/MMBtu for most forward months.  That 
puts the fixed price about $5.50 - $5.75.  Peak Palo Verde Bids are

Q3 - $520
Q4 - $190
Q1 2001 - $125

It looks like you are in the money at least through the end of the year.

We have been looking at the transmission issue.  What substation would you be 
able to deliver to?  We can determine if transmission is available.  

Irrespective of availability, I still believe Salt River or APS will be the 
best physical bid for your energy as they can keep it in their system and 
avoid transmission.  

I would like to push forward to get ISDA swap contracts in place with BHP.  I 
remember losing a deal with Francis Mcalister a few years ago despite being a 
better offer because contracts were not in place.  Enron North America does 
not have an ISDA with BHP.  We could also push to get a physical electricity 
contract in place.  I think we have a physical gas contract.

Would you like to push ahead to get contracts in place?  Let me know.  It is 
not too early to start the process as it typically takes a month or so to 
make it happen.  What would be the name of the counterparty?  You are the US 
subsidiary of BHP correct?

Kim -

Just heard from Stacy Dickson on BHP Copper.  There is no special requirement for the guaranty just because the parent is Australian.  Attached is the required format.  Let's try to get a $2 MM guaranty to cover the $1 MM+ exposure.

PLEASE ASK YOUR BHP CONTACT TO VERIFY THAT BHP BILLITON LTD IS INDEED THE CORRECT NAME OF THE GUARANTOR.  THIS IS CRITICAL.  I went to the BHP website, but I couldn't tell if BHP Billiton Ltd. is a legal entity name or just a ""doing business as"" name.



Thanks,

Jay

Jason,

Fyi, I'm not in the office this week - Vacation.

We just hired a member of the BHP metals team in New York. His name is Bill Jaede.

He might be able to find the information (quietly) for you.

Please contact him directly . + 212 715 5600

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.

Regards,
S.Spirakis

Philip and Spiro -

I am trying to do some research from a credit standpoint on BHP Copper, Inc.  Kim Ward is an originator on the West Gas desk and has some potential deals pending, but I have no information on this entity with respect to creditworthiness, so I can not approve any deals at this point.

Kim contacted the BHP Billiton people and they recommended that we contact you, as you transact with BHP Copper, Inc. on metals deals.  Do you have any financials for BHP Copper, Inc. as a distinct entity?

I would appreciate any insights that you might offer.  Please call me at (713) 345-3923 if you have any questions.


Thanks,

Jay Williams"

Hi Chris: I really appreciate your input. You are correct that APS or SRP
would be best fit for physical bid. For last couple of weeks, I have spent
considerable time with APS.

BHP management is still considering the possibility and have not made any
final decision. Unfortunately, the summer is around the corner. We still
need to send an application to FERC for EWG. FERC has waived the market
based rate (section 205) filing through December 31, 2001 (It helps). I am
expecting that most of the key questions would be addressed next week and
decision made by BHP.

BHP generates power at 12.5 kV. This power would be transformed to 115 kV
through APS sub-station in San Manuel and then wheeled to Saguaro
Sub-station by Red Rock. I understand that the transmission capacity may not
be available beyond this point. APS has started the interconnection study
and expects to complete it by May 29.

I have presented your ideas to our President & VP and are being looked into.
I will let you know early next week what BHP decides. Thank you. ..........
Vito

Hi Chris: We are in the process of acquiring bids for Natural gas for one
year term on a fixed price basis. The estimated volume is 11,000 mmbtu/day
at better than 90% use factor.
We have contacted three bidders including Enron. If you are interested we
can  include you in the bidding process. The purpose is to prepare for the
Powerhouse start-up and possible start-up of the San Manuel Mine & Smelter
in the near future. This is possible but not sure yet. We may know in next 3
to 5 weeks.

I have spoken to Stacy Dickson about what needs to happen with the whole ""Australian parent/US subsidiary"" guaranty issue.  I haven't heard back yet.

Attached is the BHP Copper master physical.  It's in PDF format, so they'll need Adobe Acrobat to view.

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state. "

Kim,

As promised, here are all the files I have on California entities' gas 
assets/contracts.  I have summarized what they are below.  Some of the data 
is old; however, I think most of it largely reflects current usage, etc.....

What is status of our DWR discussions.  I am hearing conflicting stories as to whether or not ENA power has executed a Enabling agreement with DWR.  Stacey, any luck with Christian?

I will get an update with Louise on ENA's interests with DWR and advise.

I spoke to Christian on Friday.  He was not able to reach agreement on a power agreement so EPMI did not sign one with DWR.  He gave me the name and number of the outside counsel that he used.  I will call him this afternoon.

Jeff, further to our conversation... this is the list of companies that have entered into contractual agreements with the DWR. I don't know if this means they have transaction but perhaps between Kim Ward and yourself, you can advise.

What I need to know is the legal status/issues ( if any ) of any of the companies listed here today as it relates to the state of California. 
Pan Canadian Energy Services, Occidental Energy Marketing, Dynegy Marketing and Trading , Texaco Natural Gas, BP Amoco, and Coast Energy Group. 

Can you advise If any of these companies form part of ongoing legal action against the state?

Once I know this, then we can decide on a plan what we should discuss with Mark Baldwin.

Thanks in advance.

available to discuss this proposal with Citizens.

Thanks

Terry

Chris, attorneys have indicated there is no affiliate problem with EAMR 
negotiating a contract with ENA for the operation of the Citizens assets as 
described in the contract I sent you Friday.   IF we can make it work it 
makes more sense this way and tells a good story in support of the ""One 
Enron"" message. 

Please let me know what your availability is for Wednesday so I can set up a 
conference call with legal and marketing services to discuss the work to be 
done so we can flush out the liability issue.  You and I can continue our 
discussion on price one on one.

Thanks,

Don

Kim:

Following our discussion of last Thur., we need to prepare the term sheet for 
Citizens. I want to focus on the TW deal first.  There are a number of things 
that I hope you can get from the desk by early afternoon my time, so we have 
time to do the term sheet.

I want to show them a structure that would give them right to call on gas 
each day.  What there be a demand charge?  What would be the Gas Daily 
adder?  High end of the range?  Mid point?  What would the demand charge be 
for mid-point of the range?  We would also compensate the desk to receive a 
demand charge equal to the full monthly cost of the lateral.  The desk should 
love that much of the structure.  Try to get some numbers from Janie.

 I have had numerous conversations with Citizens and TW.  TW will do the deal 
but want their liability limited to $140,000 year.  Citizens wants this 
liability increased to $1,000,000.  We could do this by buying insurance.  We 
might subcontract with TW to do this so the services deals is between ENA and 
Citizens. We would need to increase the demand charge to pay for this 
increase in laibility.

Once we know all our costs, we would bundle this together and then increase 
the demand charge for orig. 

Call me first thing on Monday

Kim,

Thanks for all your help today.  I apologize for my propensity to catch you
away from your desk.  We all have to be good at something, right?  Anyway,
here are the fixed-price volumes associated with a portion of the basis
transactions done in June and Q3.  I'm missing some deal numbers, but I'm
guessing you won't need those.

Deal Number  Month  Date  Volume Price

   June  12/28/2000 50,000 5.320
EU8529.X/67851 June  2/16/2001 50,000 5.530

   July  12/28/2000 50,000 5.340
EU8529.P/67851 July  1/19/2001 50,000 5.630

   August 12/28/2000 50,000 5.290

EU8529.G-L/67851 September 1/10/2001 60,000 6.020
QS5478.1/67851 September 2/16/2001 50,000 5.530


In other news, a few of us, including Art and I, are getting together for
drinks after work tomorrow if you or anyone else is interested.
Coincidentally, the State Bar is the location of choice, so I hope you
aren't State Bar-ed out.  Let us know.  I believe everyone will be swinging
by around 5 or so.

Thanks again,


Charlie Sanchez

This is an example of the type of things I continue to manage for Citizens.  
At this point my role is customer service, making sure their questions and 
concerns are being addressed.  I work extensively with Patti Sullivan and 
Darla Saucier to keep things on even keel.  I would like to stay involved as 
I think that is in the interest of the client and EPMI. but continue to ramp 
down.  This has been occurring  as you have already taken over the 
transaction side of the deal.  If you want to take over everything that is 
fine too, and no offense will be taken, but doing so will take a significant 
investment of time on your part to get up to spped on the deal structure and 
the nuances of transport on El Paso.

As I discussed they want to get together next week to discuss the ""new deal"" 
and the TW operator transaction.  These deals are somewhat hairy and will be 
hard to close, but there is a significant amount of money that we could 
make.  I would like to help close that deal.  With respect to the orig 
question, my thought is I am very comfortable having you determine how much 
orig (if any) you think I deserve after the fact based on the value you think 
I added to the transaction if it gets done.  If you want to handle it 
yourself and use me as a consultant that is OK too.

Let me know what you think on Monday

For April the indexes were as follows:

San Juan NGI - $4.51/MMBtu
SoCal:  $12.56
PG&E SoCal:  $7.71

So, PG&E is a  lot less valuable but still decent at $3.31 spread.  

Re: your question, the more I think about it the more I think PG&E is the 
relevant index.  A basket would be better for Citizens but less attractive to 
Griffith.  Can you sell them on the basket?

Thanks, Chris. 

What are your thoughts on using a basket approach to the index? ?As an  
alternative to just using either SoCal or PGE, we could use the average. ? 
Would any other index points be appropriate? 

See the attached file. ?I have provided for averaging the two indexes.

Can you do this for Citizens?  Tom will be out of the office today, but back 
tomorrow, but please send the spreadsheet over to Tom today so we can be sure 
we understand each other on the arithmetic. 

Today's numbers will be indicative only.  He will call you tomorrow or later 
in the week at 713/853-0685 to see what the latest prices are and be in a 
position to give you a firm bid.  Tom's number is 520/226-2246.  Call me if 
you have any questions as to the format of the spreadsheet.

Thanks!

you locked in NYMEX but basis will go to the default which I think is IFGMR -

Chris,

Would you try to get the 3,000 scheduled under the IT agreement everyday.  If
the back fill price from California, can get done for $10.00 or less, Sean
has agreed that we can use the back fill option.

Space on EP to Nogales out of Permian Keystone or Waha is not available.  It 
might become available in early Feb. We can watch it and look for a good day 
to do this.  If it absolutely needs to happen in Jan we might be able to do a 
flow day diversion from the SoCal border but that will add a significant 
amount to the price as it would cost SoCAl Border plus.  Can we wait?

I would argue that the physical premium should actually be ($.012/MMBtu) as 
you are displacing gas that would have to be sold as indexed.  That said, we 
have never done it that way.  My thought is that you would simply do it at 
the swap offer and have no physical premium arguing that that approach still 
leaves the desk better off compared to a sale at minus .012.  You could book 
it as a physical sale with no phyisical premium.

The deals I do with Tom Broderick, are these volumes priced at I-.012 as

This note is in reference to our phone conversation  earlier today.? As a 
result of that conversation the following actions will  be taken:

Gelber will add to its deal tracking spreadsheet  a?column for Enron's 
transaction number and make sure the field is  maintained for all Enron 
transactions;
A copy of the deal tracking spreadsheet for  January 2001 will be sent to 
Enron;
Linking of Basis transactions with NYMEX  transactions will be done as 
follows for any particular transaction  month:

??? If fixed Basis volumes are less  than fixed NYMEX??volumes, Gelber will 
link Basis volumes to  an?equivalent?volume of fixed NYMEX gas;
??? If fixed Basis volumes  are?greater than fixed NYMEX volumes, all NYMEX 
transactions will be  linked to one or more?Basis transactions and the 
balance of Basis volumes  will be assumed to be linked to Index gas?
??? If there are no fixed NYMEX  transactions, any Basis transactions will be 
assumed linked to Index  gas.

Please contact me if any of this is unclear or you  have?issues.? Thanks.?

Patti Sullivan has cerated a new El Paso interruptible contract for 
delivering to Griffith.  It is an Enron contract.  This agreemnet is 9M52.  
For the gas we delivered yesterday, we will be invoicing Citizens based on 
deliveries as a special deal over and above our base deal.  You will have an 
imbalance at Griffith that will go to your OBA.  I will get you the price 
later today.

Nogales used some gas last month.  Citizens has an IT contract 989N that we 
can use to deliver to this point.  I am still a little uncertain as to how 
you want us to handle this.  Please advise if the following procedure is how 
you want it handled:

1.  EPMI will deliver gas to Nogales on 989N
2.  When gas is delivered, we will bill Citizens based on the price when gas 
is delivered rather then when used, as you want this account isolated.
3.  We should ""0-out"" any current imbalance position at Noglaes based on 1 
and 2 above.

Please call to discuss.

Darla,

I have completed reviewing your invoice revisions for October and November
1999 and January, February, June and July 2000.  I have found a couple of
discrepancies in the worksheets that you sent on December 22, 1999.  Those
discrepancies are as follows:

1) October 1999 - Transwestern - Commodity sale/purchase cost and pipeline
transportation cost do not equal the total Transwestern cost.  This is do to
not using the rounding option in the detail computations.  While this
difference is only $0.01, the spreadsheet should total correctly.

2) January 2000 - EPNG - Total transportation cost was not equal to sum of
details.  Use of rounding option corrects the discrepancy.

3) July 2000 - Transwestern - Transportation commodity charges were based
upon a volume of 153,272.  The net usage after deducting 3rd party deliveries
of 5,187 from measured city gate throughput of 160,650 is 155,463.  Net usage
should have used in calculating transportation commodity charges.

Attached are revised Enron worksheets for the above stated months that have
been modified to reflect these changes.

In an attempt to close the book on invoicing and payment issues, I have
extended Enron's ""Citizens Revisions"" worksheet to cover the period November
1998 through July 2000, file attached.  The data presented for the months
January through July 2000, were taken from Citizens' records.  I request that
you verify the accuracy of that data with Enron's records and advise me of
any discrepancies. It should be noted that all corrections that you made plus
the one stated above are reflected in the worksheet.

I will be in Houston next week and would like to meet with you to bring
closure to these invoicing issues.  I am scheduled to meet with Frank Vickers
and other Enron folks at 10 AM on Wednesday, January 10, 2001.  I have a
flight to return to New Orleans at 4:30 PM.  My morning meeting with Enron
should conclude by noon.  Please check your schedule and see if there is time
either before 10 AM or after noon, that you can meet with me.  I am willing
to meet before and after my morning meeting, if necessary.

Please advise on your availability to meet and should you have any questions,
please let me know.  Thanks for your assistance.

How are you planning on keeping track of all the trades you do for Citizens 
and communicating that info to them?  We need to make sure that all the 
billing people have this info so the bills are correct.  My suggestion is 
that you maintain a spreadsheet that has all trades and send it to me and the

agree.

Chris,

Thank you for the conversation the other day.  Gelber's intent is to sit on
the side of AZ Gas and that does not necessarily mean in opposition to
Enron.  I personally hope to work constructively for their benefit, and to
the benefit of Enron, Gelber and others who may be involved.  Sometimes
however, our interests may be contrary and I apologize up front when that is
the case.

I have urged Sean to move ahead on EOL and he is doing so.  Moreover please
provide your fax number and I'll fax you audited financials.

Thanks.

I had a good ""clear the air"" talk with Art yesterday.  We came up with a
couple things that will improve the process.

1.  Citizens needs to subscribe to EOL so that Art can execute trades
without calling me or anyone else at Enron.  This will improve execution.
Sean, please make this a priority.  Call the 800 number and make it happen.
Call me if you need help.

2.      Kim Ward will be the point person for gettting NYMEX and Basis
quotes.  Kim's number is 713/853-0685.  I will be helping Kim, but she is
in a better position to execute trades as she is on the desk.

3.  Citizens should consider getting swap contracts in place with
counterparties other than Enron (and Enron as well) so that you can do
fixed price deals with others in the event that you can obtain more
attractive pricing than what Enron is offering at any point in time.

Please let me know if you want further follow-up re: your e-mail below.
Also, please push forward on the 2 contracts (gas contract amendedment and

Subject: NYMEX fixed prices obtained from Enron

Sean,

As we discussed on  the telephone today, I have a concern surrounding the
pricing Enron gave  us?while establishing NYMEX fixed pricing for the
months of April 2001, May  2001, June 2001, July 2001 and August 2001.

Today, we first  contacted Enron to obtain market quotes at 10:58 am cst.
In every month we  requested a quote on NYMEX, Enron gave a quote that was
no less than two cents  higher than the offer on the floor of the NYMEX.
Gelber questioned the  quotes as being outside the market.? Gelber chose to
end the telephone call  after questioning the quotes.? At 11:08 am, Gelber
called Enron  again.? The election was made to proceed with execution of
the necessary  positions.? For the months of April, May, June, and August
we received  prices that were at the offer side of the NYMEX bid/offer
spread.? However,  on the month of July the price received was not only
outside of the then current  NYMEX bid/offer range but was indeed higher
than the NYMEX high for the day on  the July contract.? Specifically, the
Citizen's Arizona Gas price received  for July 2001 from Enron is $5.340,
the high for the day on NYMEX was  $5.290.

I do not currently  feel comfortable with Enron's pricing methods.? My
assessment after today's  transactions is only partially favorable.? It is
my understanding that  Citizen's compensates Enron in other parts of your
business relationship and  their should be no need for them to mark prices
up when executing either NYMEX,  basis, or a combination of the two.

Citizen's may want  to consider pursuing alternative mechanism's?for
securing fixed pricing via  other accessible markets.

Sincerely,

I had a good ""clear the air"" talk with Art yesterday.  We came up with a 
couple things that will improve the process. 

1.  Citizens needs to subscribe to EOL so that Art can execute trades without 
calling me or anyone else at Enron.  This will improve execution.  Sean, 
please make this a priority.  Call the 800 number and make it happen.  Call 
me if you need help.

2.      Kim Ward will be the point person for gettting NYMEX and Basis 
quotes.  Kim's number is 713/853-0685.  I will be helping Kim, but she is in

As we discussed, here is the Del. Pt. language for sales at NP and SP15.  For 
any sale beyond April 2002 (not purchases), we might want to use this 
language, but only if the trader requests it in a note on the deal entry.  If 
the trader does not request it, it is our understanding that you will try to 
catch it and notify us to make sure the new language is not desired by the 
trader (Use me as a contact and I will ask the trader).  It is understood, 
however, that if the trader does not request the language and you do not 
catch it the trader bears the risk.

Thanks

We'd like to thank you for puttting together this offer for bundled supply to
our Griffith facility.  We are very agreeable to the structure and general
framework that you have laid out.  We did make a few modifications however and
you can find them in the attached redlined version of your proposal.  We will

Kim:

I would argue that the physical premium should actually be ($.012/MMBtu) as you are displacing gas that would have to be sold as indexed.  That said, we have never done it that way.  My thought is that you would simply do it at the swap offer and have no physical premium arguing that that approach still leaves the desk better off compared to a sale at minus .012.  You could book it as a physical sale with no phyisical premium.

The deals I do with Tom Broderick, are these volumes priced at I-.012 as well, or when I fix the prices, do I need to add a new phys premium?

Subject:	PPL Proposal


Gentlemen,

I tried to reach both of you late in the evening, but was unsuccessful.  I
will be traveling starting at 7 am Las Vegas time back to NO.  I have a brief
layover in Phoenix and will try to contact you.

Initial reaction to our proposal during the day was that it looked pretty
good.  This I got from Terry Crupi.  At that time Terry had not seen the
proposal, but was relaying what he had gotten from Barbara Veety back in
Allentown. In the early evening I met with John Baileys, Terry Crupi, and Joe
Cammarano of PPL.  At that meeting they expressed concern for the reservation
charge and floor, especially since the Citizens' TW contract has no
alternative market.  I asked if a cap would help ease their concerns and they
said that they did not think so.  They are really struggling with the
reservation charge as we have currently proposed it.  They agree that we
should at a minimum recover all of our fixed pipeline fees in a reservation
charge.  We did not have a chance to get into discussions about other
potential cost that would be appropriately placed in the reservation charge.

They would prefer a pure index based deal and could agree to a load factor of
about 80%, but indicated that they could live with some monthly reservation
fee based upon the monthly index, but we did not get into much detail on
exactly how that would work.

Perhaps the biggest issue that came out of this meeting is that they do not
believe that the SoCal Border is the appropriate index.  They believe that
the PG&E City Gate is more reflective of what the market price is.  They
claim that the SoCal point reflects the El Paso cuts.

In a passing comment John Baileys indicated that they have gotten a number of
 proposals that are attractive on both El Paso and TW.

John Baileys wants to do something with Citizens and is interested in a term
that would go for a least 2 years.  I ask if going through September 03 had
appeal and he responded affirmatively.  He also said that a provision that
allowed for available capacity to move up or down would be acceptable.

PPL wants to keep this process on a fast track, as do we.

The next steps:

1) PPL will provide a counter proposal on Monday.

2) Chris, what insight can you provide on the index issue.  I do not have
much history on that point, but on Friday of last week PGE City Gate was
$9.08 while SoCal Border was $10.90.  What are the historical prices for PGE?
 What are the drivers for the price differences between PGE and SoCal?  Is
the PGE index mature?  I have not followed it.  Is it a more appropriate
index for TW?

Hopefully we can catch up in the morning from Phoenix.

John

John/Sean:

A few thoughts on the Griffith deal:

1.  Term:  PPL indicates they want to do the deal through 2003.  That is really 2003 - 2004 as it incldues Nov - Mar.  Extension until this time might require extension of our underlying deal.  This would be OK with us.
2.  Character of service:   The text indicates that PPL would have the right to request deliveries be made to an alternqate point on TW.  Why would they want this?  This could be a problem if we know the gas wouldn't flow as we would shut in puchases.  We would like to make this on a mutually acceptable basis.
3.  Pricing:  Does the reservation cahrge include variable transport?  I think that is what we proposed.  If not, then the Commodity rate flow needs to include the variable cost of  transport plus fuel.
4.  Conditions:  Noms must be in at 8:00 am.  This is very important and the a deal killer.  We need time to manage the position.  Also, the weekend issue needs to be addressed.  As we have discussed, weekends trade as the same quantity each day.  If they want to vary the daily amoount during the weekend and make Sunday higher than Sat or Monday, that is fairly ewaasy to deal with.  If they want to have lower takes on Sunday, this is more difficult ad increases costs.  We might be able to craft a solution to this however.

Sean/John,
We'd like to thank you for puttting together this offer for bundled supply to
our Griffith facility.  We are very agreeable to the structure and general
framework that you have laid out.  We did make a few modifications however and
you can find them in the attached redlined version of your proposal.  We will
available to discuss this proposal with Citizens.

Thanks

Terry

Chris,

this looks good to me.  Stephanie is checking with Transwestern to see what their parking/lending fees would be for weekends, just for an idea.  I am also talking to the desk.  I will keep you posted.

Kim:

Please review and add anything you want and return.

John/Sean:

A few thoughts on the Griffith deal:

1.  Term:  PPL indicates they want to do the deal through 2003.  That is really 2003 - 2004 as it incldues Nov - Mar.  Extension until this time might require extension of our underlying deal.  This would be OK with us.
2.  Character of service:   The text indicates that PPL would have the right to request deliveries be made to an alternqate point on TW.  Why would they want this?  This could be a problem if we know the gas wouldn't flow as we would shut in puchases.  We would like to make this on a mutually acceptable basis.
3.  Pricing:  Does the reservation cahrge include variable transport?  I think that is what we proposed.  If not, then the Commodity rate flow needs to include the variable cost of  transport plus fuel.
4.  Conditions:  Noms must be in at 8:00 am.  This is very important and the a deal killer.  We need time to manage the position.  Also, the weekend issue needs to be addressed.  As we have discussed, weekends trade as the same quantity each day.  If they want to vary the daily amoount during the weekend and make Sunday higher than Sat or Monday, that is fairly ewaasy to deal with.  If they want to have lower takes on Sunday, this is more difficult ad increases costs.  We might be able to craft a solution to this however.

The West Gas Desk built up a negative imbalance on Citizen's TA (Transportation Agreement) 97ZH.  Citizens purchased 23,175 MMBtu to apply to this imbalance.  For the May invoice, we need to subtract this amount from usage.  Enter the volume into the area where we show transportation by others to the citygate.  This is logical as we otherwise would have to transport this gas in ourselves.

After this trade, the TA imbalance on 97ZH will be 30,688 MMBtu.  ENA is responsible for this imbalance.  It is my understanding that future imbalances will go to the 97ZH OBA rather than the TA.  Therefore, this current TA imbalance will be there until it is eliminated.

Call me with any questions.

Jim:

As we have discussed, ENA is trying to close a gas supply transaction with Citizens Gas in Arizona to provide gas supply to Citizens for ultimate delivery to PP&L for the Griffith power plant.  As part of this transaction, Enron Asset Management Resources (EAMR) would provide services to operate a pipeline that interconnects El Paso and Transwestern to the pipeline header system that ultimately interconnects with the Griffith power plant. To date, it has been the reasonable position of EAMR that its liability for services provided to Citizens should be ""capped"" at the sum of its annual fee of $144,000.  Citizens wants a $1,000,000 limit.  Citizens and EAMR have agreed to all aspects of the services deal except this liability question.  Although it might be possible to close our gas deal without EAMR, this is far from certain.  I have been trying to come up with an approach that would bridge this gap so that the ENA gas deal can be closed. 

This e-mail is intended to indicate the value of this transaction to Enron and get your viewpoint as to the feasibility and cost of one of two deal structures:

1)  ENA buys insurance to cover the cost of our buying a policy to bridge th gap in liability from $144,000 to $1,000,000.
2)  EAMR decides to increase the laibiltiy to $1,000,000 in return for increasing their earnings on the deal by the amount ENA would pay fior the insurance product - about $120,000.

ENA's preference is clearly for approach 2.

The attached spreadsheet indicates the value of this transaction to Enron.  ENA will earn approximately $3 million on the deal.  Please keep this number in confidence.  In addition, we have budgeted about $120,000 for the insurance product to increase the liability of EAMR from $140,000 to $1,000,000.

Can you please advise me as to the feasibility of 1) or 2) above?  If there is no way we are going to get there, I need to know fairly quickly so I can explore other options.  If it is possible, which of the above 2 approaches is better from you perspective?

Citizens will be here today at 3:00 pm.  I would greatly appreciate some feedback from you by that time.

To contact me please call Kim Ward at 713/853-0685 and she will be able to find me.

Thanks very much for you time.

Chris

Subject: PPL Proposal


Gentlemen,

I tried to reach both of you late in the evening, but was unsuccessful.  I
will be traveling starting at 7 am Las Vegas time back to NO.  I have a brief
layover in Phoenix and will try to contact you.

Initial reaction to our proposal during the day was that it looked pretty
good.  This I got from Terry Crupi.  At that time Terry had not seen the
proposal, but was relaying what he had gotten from Barbara Veety back in
Allentown. In the early evening I met with John Baileys, Terry Crupi, and Joe
Cammarano of PPL.  At that meeting they expressed concern for the reservation
charge and floor, especially since the Citizens' TW contract has no
alternative market.  I asked if a cap would help ease their concerns and they
said that they did not think so.  They are really struggling with the
reservation charge as we have currently proposed it.  They agree that we
should at a minimum recover all of our fixed pipeline fees in a reservation
charge.  We did not have a chance to get into discussions about other
potential cost that would be appropriately placed in the reservation charge.

They would prefer a pure index based deal and could agree to a load factor of
about 80%, but indicated that they could live with some monthly reservation
fee based upon the monthly index, but we did not get into much detail on
exactly how that would work.

Perhaps the biggest issue that came out of this meeting is that they do not
believe that the SoCal Border is the appropriate index.  They believe that
the PG&E City Gate is more reflective of what the market price is.  They
claim that the SoCal point reflects the El Paso cuts.

In a passing comment John Baileys indicated that they have gotten a number of
 proposals that are attractive on both El Paso and TW.

John Baileys wants to do something with Citizens and is interested in a term
that would go for a least 2 years.  I ask if going through September 03 had
appeal and he responded affirmatively.  He also said that a provision that
allowed for available capacity to move up or down would be acceptable.

PPL wants to keep this process on a fast track, as do we.

The next steps:

1) PPL will provide a counter proposal on Monday.

2) Chris, what insight can you provide on the index issue.  I do not have
much history on that point, but on Friday of last week PGE City Gate was
$9.08 while SoCal Border was $10.90.  What are the historical prices for PGE?
 What are the drivers for the price differences between PGE and SoCal?  Is
the PGE index mature?  I have not followed it.  Is it a more appropriate
index for TW?

Hopefully we can catch up in the morning from Phoenix.

John

Good morning, 

Hope you had a great Easter weekend. 

Attached are two (2) word files for your review.  First, there is the latest  
draft of the Sales Proposal which reflects the best efforts and intra day  
provisions.  Second, there is the Alternate Nominations provisions.  I spoke  
with PPL this morning and said that I would try to get both of these  
documents to them today.  Your timely review and comments are greatly  
appreciated. 

The Alternate Nominations language is being separately provided at the  
request of PPL so that they can review it.  If they would like to have it  
incorporated, it can easily incorporated into the proposal and/or agreement. 

Chris, I used the working draft of the Enron/Citizens agreement from our  
meeting last Monday in Houston to draft the Alternate Nominations language.   
That draft did not provide for a price differentiation for nominations  
between 8:30 and 9:00 am CPT.  Should there be one? 

Best regard, 

John

Chris, 

I hope that your voice is improving and that you are feeling better. 

I have attached a revised Citizens/Enron Griffith supply proposal and a  
redlined version to show the changes from your draft.  I have eliminated the  
$0.07 commodity add-on for Excess Utilities Volumes as we discussed  
yesterday.  I have also eliminated the late nominations provision since it is  
not in the Griffith proposal.  And, last, I have noted some pricing  
considerations for the Firm Peaking Requirements. 

Sean and I have not discussed this proposal so everything is subject to his  
agreement.  I hope to talk with Sean this morning. 

All the best, 

John

Subject:	PPL/Griffith Test Gas Sales Agreement

Chris,

This is to confirm our conversation this morning:

1)  Citizens has entered into a letter agreement that allows for it to sell
gas to PPL during the plant operations testing phase.

2)  Sales will be determined daily with the price being set at some discount
to the border, but in no event to be less than Gas Daily Mid Point San Juan
plus $0.50/MMBtu.  The discount level will have to reflect the we cannot
accept a put of any case back to us.

3)  Enron participation in the deal would be as follows:

    a) Enron would recover the cost of:
        1. Gas cost in the basin priced at Gas Daily Mid Point San Juan
        2.  TW fuel cost, currently approximately 4.75%
        3. Daily demand cost of moving gas down the TW San Juan Lateral
currently           approximately $0.10/MMBtu.
        4. Variable transportation cost on both the TW San Juan Lateral and
        Mainline.
    b) Enron would participate in the gross margins of any sale at 8.5%.
Gross margins would be determined by subtracting        the Enron's cost from
the sales price.

Chris, I hope that this properly reflects our conversation this morning.  If
it does not, please let me know.

As a follow-up item, we really need to complete the gas supply agreement for
the commercial operations and to also cover this arrangement during the
testing phase.  Citizens would appreciate a push on getting this done.  I
know that there may still be the issue with the operations agreement, but we
should be able to get a draft out that would reflect the deal assuming
concurrence on the operating agreement.

Best regards,

John Cogan

Subject:	Citizens - Deal structure summary

As a follow up to yesterday's meeting, below is a summary of the course of action to be taken in response to Citizens comments on the service agreement with EAMR.

Enron will work with Citizens to put an insurance policy in place, which meets the insurance provisions requested by Citizens and which names both Citizens and EAMR as policy holders.  See attached file for proposed policy details.
The cost for this policy (not to be revealed to Citizens) will be between $5,000 and $7,500 and will be paid for by ENA.
ENA will enter into a side letter agreement with EAMR, which will provide for the insurance premium payment.
Upon agreement with Citizens on the insurance policy details, EAMR is agreeable to executing a services agreement with Citizens, however, Citizens must agree to EAMR's indemnity and liability contract language as written in its original draft (see attached below). 


Attached is a file containing Citizens' comments on its draft services agreement with EAMR.  Article 8 of the draft agreement details the insurance provisions requested by Citizens.
 
For reference, the original draft sent to Citizens dated effective January 15, 2001 is attached below:

Barry:

This is the insurance language that would appear in the contract between Enron Asset Management Resources (EAMR) and Citizens.  I will send you a second e-mail that summarizes the proposed deal between EAMR and ENA.  As we discussed I would like you to look at this insurance arrangement and see if ENA has any risk.  My view of it is that this creates no risk to ENA, but I have not structured a deal in this way before and would appreciate a second opinion. 

Thanks

Lou,
Based on Jim's comments below, the attached revised version of the compromise proposal contains a change on the last page. 
 4444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444
Please let us know if any other changes need to be made to the document before sending it to Citizens.
We hope to send the proposal to Citizens tomorrow morning after you have returned to the office and had an opportunity to review this e-mail.
Also, to let you kinow, Citizens Communications as of the end of 2000 held $7 Billion in assets and had adjusted EBITDA of $509 Million on revenues of $1.8 Billion.
Question:  What percentage chance is there that a court might set the indemnity aside as Jim mentioned below in the previous e-mail?

Chris,
Jim mentioned that ENA might want to consider being an additional insured under the insurance policy.  Any thoughts or comments?

Best regards,
Sarabeth

Our liability should be limited to recoveries from the insurances required in the contract and specifically purchased for work under this contract. If covered by the policy, we will respond.  Losses, costs and expenses not recovered from the insurance, shall remain the obligation of Citizens. 

Once again, if they agree to the limitation, the continued concerns would be:
1. The indemnity would be set aside by a court.
2. The indemnity from Citizens does not hold or they are financially unable to respond.

Please advise if there are further questions.

John:

Kim and I have been working on the spreadsheet to calculate the pricing under our new deal.  We have made some significant changes from the latest draft you prepared.  Here is.  The way we are thinking about this is a s follows:

1.  We will be selling the volume to Citizens at Thoreau.  The volume will be the Griffith City Gate volume, grossed up for fuel
2.  The price will be San Juan Gas Daily, divided by (1 - fuel), plus 100% of the lateral fixed and variable pipeline charges, plus $.075 times the ""Spread Value""
3.  ""Spread Value"" = a - b where

	a = PG&E Topock minus the discount and

	b = San Juan index divided by fuel, plus lateral charges, that divided by mainline fuel, plus all mainline charges

Let me know if you agree.  We need to resolve this by close of business Friday so we can properly do month end close.  I will be out all day today, but working Friday.  The attached spreadsheet shows the arithmetic but the volumes and actual indexes are not correct.  Please check the arithmetic and call me Friday.

Also, what should we assume for July 1st?

Thanks

C

Sara Beth called and said that she thinks EAMR and Citizens have resolved the insurance issue.  I am hopeful that is the case.  

Attached are drafts of the ENA/Citizens Confirmation Agreement and the ENA/Citizens/Cogan Agreement.  Please review them both for final changes.  Once you have given final approval we will forward original Confirmation Letters for your signature.  With respect to the Cogan Letter, we would like Citizens to send the letter to us.  Let me know if this is OK.

It looks like we are done on the new Citizens deal effective July 1.  I have sent original contracts for execution.  We now have to put the deal in the system.  This is a little complicated.  

The attached spreadsheet indicates how this deal will work, using June as an example.  The only differences between June and future months are:

1)  In the future, we will collect a $.09/MMBtu demand charge with $.02/MMBtu of this going to EAMR (ENA gets $.07/MMBtu)
2)  In the future, the PG&E discount is $.10, not $.25.

Some of the complicated booking issues are:

1.  We need to show the John Cogan commission as a separate deal and a cost to ENA
2.  We need to show the payment to EAMR as a separate deal and a cost to ENA
3.  We will continue to bill Citizens for the TW Mainline cost on our utility deal

1 and 2 above are pretty straight forward and should not create any deal entry difficulties other than someone will have to enter the deals.  Number 3 is more difficult.  The complexities relate to where we are making the sale and what costs should be included.  

Can you get with the folks who can help us here and have them come up with a recommendation on how this deal should be booked?  Let me know if you have questions.  I also believe I can add value in speaking with Darren Giron or others.  I guaranty their initial recommendation will not be 100% workable.

Thanks!

Chris

I understand the El Paso conference in Washington was interesting.  Janie told me there are 2 things that need to be done.

1.  Complete Pooler Request Forms
2.  Provide historical load data

I will be out the rest of the week.  Kim will be back tomorrow (Wed.).  

Are you going to be handling these El Paso-related informational requirements for Citizens?  Please call Kim and let her know if there is anything we needs to do to help.

Thanks for the update.  Let's hope Citizens sticks with you guys for the full term.  Jeff Hodge told me yesterday that he has requested some changes in the ENA/EAMR contract from Lou, but that Lou hasn't called back.  I will assume that you will follow up on that contract and make sure it gets done.  With respect to the monthly fee, I am assuming you will be sending ENA an invoice each month.  Kim Ward at 713/853-0685 will be your contact person if the invoice isn't paid and she will coordinate with our settlements group until we get into a monthly routine.

Let me know if there are any other issues.

Lou, Chris and Jeff,
The services agreement between EAMR and Citizens for gas control and transaction management services is now executed.  
Yesterday afternoon, Citizens faxed the execution pages back to us.  EAMR's original of the agreement is expected in the mail shortly.

Check Case 2, it seems like the gas cost to Enron could excced the floor 
price as we would be charging pipeline costs.  Isn't the floor San Juan plus 
$07 plus fixed plus variable pipeline cost plus fuel?

John/Sean:

I am a little confused on how the pricing indicated in your term sheet would 
work.  I think if we review the attached it will clarify things.  Please call 
me later to discuss.  I want to make sure we understand how the pricing would 
work for Griffith as well as Enron to Citizens.  

Also, I think the Commodity section of your proposal term sheet has some 
missing words.  You don't seem to be adding the spread value of interstate 
transport to the Commodity charge.  

I will be out for an hour.  Back at 1:00 Portland time.

Chris

Kim, 
Citizens needs confirmation from ENA on deliveries to the TW/Griffith interconnect for the following: 
July 17 -  PPL claims that they bought gas after 8:30 AM from Enron.  Citizens has billed them for the deliveries, but PPL has the deal as a purchase from Enron in there system and desire to have Enron bill them.  Is this acceptable to Enron? 
July 26 - PPL claims that they bought gas after 8:30 AM from a third party, Texaco, in the basin and had it transported under the Citizens/PPL deal.  Does Enron agree with this transaction? 
Thanks, 
John
