Mark,

Here is a draft for the Fee Agreement language for the margining.  this 
language should tie with the liquidated damages language that you have for 
the RTA.  I think that we will need to remove the words or settle from the 
liquidated damages paragraph.  Brokers do not have settlement risk.

Just to remind you I am on vacation Thurs and Fri.

GFI requested a quote for NA Gas and Power, Coal, Emmisions, UK Power, UK 
Gas, European Gas and European Power.  I have calls into George McClellan 
(coal) and Tim Belden (West Power) to let them know about the negotiations.  
I need to know who at Enron you have discussed this with in London to make 
sure I run it past other interested parties in London prior to making an 
offer to GFI.  I am now talking to one of the GFI Managing Directors in New 
York and hopefully this will move the process along faster.

Amerex: Unwound $500 K / 75 % brokerage deal.  Asked them for a proposal for 
zero brokerage.  Original offer we made was $400 k and zero brokerage.  
Meeting schedules for Tuesday afternoon. Still waiting for John Nowlan to 
reply on crude products and Marcello Romano to reply on European Bandwidth.  

PVM: European Crude broker presented by Chris Glass; Forwarding NDA

ED&F Man: Waiting on Mary.  I will call if OK with you.

Prebon: Mike made initial offer with brokerage in it.  Mike informed Prebon 
of new price structure. Prebon to call back on Monday.

Natsource: Jack is waiting on a draft of the Agreements to begin 
discussions.  I will forward the Agreements once we approve.  I suspect early 
next week.

Credit: Working with Debbie on security level versus headroom.  Modeling June 
2000 to get feel of exposure.

Legal: Second draft of BETA is attached.  Bullet points for Fee Agreement are 
also attached.  Liquidated damages and margining are covered in Section 3(f) 
and (g)

Andy, do we have any intention of doing any integration with Tradespark at 
this time?  If we do I will get more involved in this otherwise we will just 
let the infrastructure team continue to run with this.

I need to have another discussion about this with you . . . we need an 
application group to work on this, because there is quite a bit of 
application analysis that needs to be done.

I found out that from an infrastructure perspective, this is much more than 
just a remote connection.  It involves an application implemented in our 
environment, and applications deployed to the desktop.  Is this something the 
e-commerce team needs to be involved in (I don't think it is), but probably 
more like Beth Perlman's team.

Correction to previous e-mail:
 The equipment we would send to Enron would comprise of 2 Cisco 2600
Routers (1 for each circuit), 2 Cisco Hubs, 2 Sun Ultra 5s with 2 NIC cards
each. Each Sun would connect to its own hub and router for redundancy and
load balancing purposes.
Sorry for the confusion.

Andy,

Below are a number of the e-mail's that I've exchanged with TrueQuote.  I 
can't say that they make for interesting reading but if you note any 
potential issues please let me know.  Most of the notes relate to product 
mapping issues but you will notice highlighted in red a note regarding the 
ordering of a leased line which in my mind is ""acceptance of responsibility 
by action.""  I'll be crafting a note regarding testing soon and will 
coordinate this with Jay and yourself.  I'll also be forwarding e-mails with 
Houston Street.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to further 
clarify our status.

Hi David,

Thanks for sending the answers to our technical questions. After carefully
reviewing your answers, we have a few follow-up questions.  These appear in
""green"".  Please let me know if anything needs further clarification.

We are looking forward to meeting with you next week. Tentatively, we are
planning to have 5 or 6 people attend.  These include three really technical
people, a couple of leads (including myself), a user from the True Quote
business side who understands the products that are traded on True Quote,
and the new True Quote CIO (who's mainly interested in hearing what is said
more so than actively participating in the discussion).

By next Tuesday, I plan to send you our proposed agenda for the meeting.  If
you have a different agenda in mind for the meeting, let's discuss it over
the phone on Wednesday and jointly priortize the items for discussion. We
are very flexible in terms of the agenda.

Thanks in advance for any additional information you can send us.  It's nice
to have a contact to be able to correspond with.  Have a great day!

Maria,

It was good to hear from you this morning.  I have attached your document
with answers to your questions included.  In addition, I've provided the
finalized DTD and our schedule of release dates for specific functionality.

I raised your desire to meet to discuss the project and everyone agrees
that getting together is a good idea.  That said, we believe it would be
best to wait until we have a firm agenda to discuss.  For instance, we will
need to get together in the near term to discuss data mapping issues.  Feel
free to call or drop a note if you have any questions or concerns.

Regards,

David

The following are the dates that we will release functionality.

1 December 2000:  Login, Attempt Transaction, Post Price, Request Price and
Request Order Status.
15 December 2000: Request Transaction History, Request Credit Matrix, Post
Product Set Data and Post Credit Matrix.

Subject: RE: Enron-TrueQuote Integration Technical Questions


David,

I really appreciate your efforts in adding another hour to our meeting this
afternoon and in making Jay available for the discussion.  The following is
a list of technical questions that we would like to discuss in this
afternoon's meeting:

1) This one is probably going to be discussed in the first two hours - We
will need to have the data to populate our tables with in order to map PID,
CPID, RID, PSETID, CATGID, CTYID, CMDTYID.  The non-technical people know
all of the information about the products, deal types, etc.  However, do
they know that for example, PID ""123"" maps back to Product ""ABC""?  I would
think the technical people are the ones that know how this codes map back to
specific product information on your system.

2) Could you provide us a little background on why Credit term changed from
""Required"" to ""Implied"" during the last version of the DTD that we received
from you?

3) We sent this question a few days ago, but have not received a response:
There are several different parameter names specified for the XML that is
passed between systems.
The following is a list of those specified in the External Interface
Document:

Post Prices:  prices (Page 12, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Request Prices:  prices (Page 14, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Attempt Transaction: txn (Page 16, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Post Product Set Data: xml (Page 26, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Post Credit Matrix: xml (Page 28, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)

Should all of the parameter names be ""xml"" or should the parameter names for
Post Product Set Data and Post Credit Matrix be changed to reflect the
naming convention of the other use cases?

Using ""xml"" as the parameter name for all use cases will reduce the
redundancy of the code we'll need to write to route the data to our internal
interfaces.

4) We still have some concerns over having to maintain Enron's calendar on
our system since term is sent as part of the key.  We would like to discuss
alternatives for dealing with date interpretation.

5) We had asked a question earlier regarding business responses being sent
back within the same HTTP session.   We are going to assume that
confirmation comes back in the HTTP response since there has been no
interface defined for business responses.  We would like to confirm this
assumption in this meeting.

6) Is there going to be some capability of cancelling a transaction attempt
if for some reason we do not receive a response back from Enron on a
transaction attempt and a subsequent transaction search?

7) Would Enron consider posting all of their requests to a .asp file as
opposed to a file with no extension (ext_nrt.asp instead of ext_nrt)?  It is
a generally accepted practice to include file extensions when transporting
files.

Thanks again for everything David.  We will look forward to talking to you
later today!

Regards,
Maria

Maria,

I understand your concern and while I want to ensure we address product
mapping as the primary focus of the meetings, I asked if Jay Webb and/or
Mike Guadarrama could spend some time discussing your technical questions.
Jay and/or Mike will be available from 3-4 today to do just this.  I know
you've asked some technical questions already and are also interested in
credit mapping nevertheless, would you please provide a brief rundown of
the technical issues you want to discuss so that Jay/Mike can be prepared
in advance to make the best use of the hour?  Thanks.

The meetings will be attended by our Product Control Group who are
responsible for creating and maintaining all of Enron's product types and
products.  They are the experts when it comes knowing all the various ways
Enron represents and implements products on EnronOnline.  Other than
myself, the four attendees will be Sheri Thomas, who heads the Product
Control group, Jennifer deBoisblanc-Denny, who heads the products area of
the group and two experts in gas and power products.

Look forward to hearing from you soon so I can inform Jay and Mike.

Regards
-David

There will be people there that understand the products in non-technical
detail.

When were you thinking we could involve your ""technical"" people?  I agree
with the agenda and strongly agree that we need to understand each other
products before we can attempt an integration.  However, my team's
reponsibility is to figure out how to ""technically"" send/receive and map
information from your system.  If this is not going to be addressed the
first day, than perhaps some of them don't need to come.  I guess I'm now
concerned that the second two hour meeting isn't going to be long enough to
provide my team the information they need proceed with their technical
implementation.  I understand that the documents you've sent me should
address most of our questions, but each revision has left my team with more
questions and confusion about how this is all going to work.

Will Jay Webb be in either meeting?  Could you send us a list of the
attendees on your side and their roles/functions as well.   We want very
much to make these meetings as productive as possible, understanding that
your team as well as mine are very very busy.

I appreciate your help,

Maria

Thanks for the finalized list.  I assume that one or more of the people
below will be able to speak in detail about gas and power products outside
of the technical domain?  The people from Enron that will attend the
meeting are non-technical.  Their area of expertise lies in the arena of

people that will be speaking the same language.

Oh, I see, my misunderstanding.  We are in 3 Greenway Plaza.  Two 2-hour
meetings is fine with us. No problem in us driving downtown.  However,
could
we schedule from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 on the 8th, and from 10:00 to 12:00 on
the 9th?  I have a conflict on the 8th.

The agenda looks fine.  If there are any additional XML-type questions left
to answer by the time we have the meeting, we may want to allow some time
to
discuss them.

Thanks again David, looking forward to meeting in person.

Maria,

Actually, I was suggesting 2 hours on both the 8th and the 9th of November
for getting together to discuss mapping issues.  If November 8th and 9th
isn't good for you, we can try November 9th and 10th.  I would say let's
just get together for one, four hour meeting but it is difficult to get the
Product Control people together for that length of time since they are
integral to the day to day operations of EnronOnline.  (I am assuming you
are in downtown Houston.  If getting here is difficult then we can try to
arrange a one day meeting.) Any thoughts on the suggested dates/times?

As far as the number of meetings required, from our point of view we just
need to accomplish product and counterparty mappings.  The agenda below
addresses products and a follow-up would address counterparties.  Beyond
that, the External Interface Document and DTD should address all the
technical issues that enable you to design and construct your part of the
system.  I'll send you the most recent External Interface Document and DTD
shortly.

Please let me know you thoughts on the proposed agenda.  I'm sure we can
work out an agreeable schedule.

Regards,
David

Agenda
11/8/2000 10:00-12:00  Clarification of product representation and product
creation
process.

It is important to understand each other's methods for representing
products and the process by which we create new products prior to jumping
in to the mapping problem.

11/9/2000 10:00-12:00  Map schedule A products.

It is important to not only know which products of ours map to yours but
what process can be applied to make mapping easily repeatable.

Hi David,

Sorry for not getting back to you sooner.  I was out of the office
yesterday.  November 9th looks better for me.  I am concerned though, that
2
hours is not going to be enough. Do you expect this to be the first of
several meetings?

Maria,

I've passed along your questions to the development team, which is
currently looking at them.  I'll get back to you regarding these as soon as
I get their feedback.

Regarding a meeting next week, I think we're going to have to postpone
until the following week.  How does November 8 & 9 look for you?  I've
tentatively scheduled our product people for 10 AM till 12 PM for product
mapping discussions.  Let me know what you think.

Below is the agenda I think we should start with for our first meeting.

Hi David,

Thanks for sending the answers to our technical questions. After carefully
reviewing your answers, we have a few follow-up questions.  These appear in
""green"".  Please let me know if anything needs further clarification.

We are looking forward to meeting with you next week. Tentatively, we are
planning to have 5 or 6 people attend.  These include three really
technical
people, a couple of leads (including myself), a user from the True Quote
business side who understands the products that are traded on True Quote,
and the new True Quote CIO (who's mainly interested in hearing what is said
more so than actively participating in the discussion).

By next Tuesday, I plan to send you our proposed agenda for the meeting.
If
you have a different agenda in mind for the meeting, let's discuss it over
the phone on Wednesday and jointly priortize the items for discussion. We
are very flexible in terms of the agenda.

Thanks in advance for any additional information you can send us.  It's
nice
to have a contact to be able to correspond with.  Have a great day!

Maria,

It was good to hear from you this morning.  I have attached your document
with answers to your questions included.  In addition, I've provided the
finalized DTD and our schedule of release dates for specific functionality.

I raised your desire to meet to discuss the project and everyone agrees
that getting together is a good idea.  That said, we believe it would be
best to wait until we have a firm agenda to discuss.  For instance, we will
need to get together in the near term to discuss data mapping issues.  Feel
free to call or drop a note if you have any questions or concerns.

Regards,

David

The following are the dates that we will release functionality.

1 December 2000:  Login, Attempt Transaction, Post Price, Request Price and
Request Order Status.
15 December 2000: Request Transaction History, Request Credit Matrix, Post
Product Set Data and Post Credit Matrix.

Richard/Maria,

Attached please find the 'treatments' for the various Tokenized reference
periods currently in use for US Nat Gas and US Power.  I believe you will
find these spreadsheets easier to translate than the previous.  Let me know
what you think.  As you've pointed out it is critical that we are both on
the same page when it comes to our treatments of these reference periods;
however, I do believe this is an issue that we can work through together.
I would suggest that we get together again for another couple hours once
you've had the chance to review not only the info I've provided to date but
also the list of Schedule A products that I plan to provide on Wednesday.
As always, feel free to drop me a note or give me a call anytime.

Regards,
David

P.S.  Please keep in mind that the present structure of the TRP's do not
contemplate weekends that breach a calendar month, and holidays.  For
example, a US Nat Gas Day Ahead product (Number XXXX)  being offered after
11:00 a.m. on a Thursday the 27th will provide a TRP Product for Saturday
the 29th, Sunday the 30th, and Monday the 1st. Since our trading areas
would not want to breach the current calendar month, they would create two
date-specific products; Number YYYY for Saturday the 29th through Sunday
the 30th, and Product Number ZZZZ for Monday the 1st.

A question has come up that may have serious implications for our system.
Please forward to the right person, we would really appreciate it if we
could have a response as soon as possible.

The question is ""How many transaction attempts can be sent by Enron to True
Quote at one time(will Enron be sending more than transaction in a batch)?""
Your documentation seems to read that you may be sending more than one
transaction at a time.  If that is true, then we may have a problem if you
plan to send transaction searches that would force us to cancel all of the
previous transaction attempts that were sent over together, since our system
processes items in sequential order.

Please call me if the question seems confusing.

Subject: FW: Fill or Kill - Buy or Sell from Enron Traders


Good morning David,

Here's another clarifying question.  I have in my notes documentation that
says that Enron will do partial fills of transactions sent to EOL. The
question that being asked in the attached note has to do with transactions
sent by EOL to TrueQuote.  Does Enron want (or will Enron accept) partial
fills by the True Quote system? If so, how should we identify (if at all)
that this was a partial fill?

Thanks David.

Subject: Fill or Kill - Buy or Sell from Enron Traders


Maria,

Matt raised a question regarding transaction attempts made by Enron Traders
directly against the True Quote system (not going through EOL).  This is a
two scenario question:

1)  If an Enron trader is initiating a buy in the True Quote system against
a counterparty's position to sell at a specified price and volume (ie:
15,000 @ 2.40 - which is currently a valid market in True Quote), at the
point the transaction is being executed in the system, the volume drops to
10,000, would our Enron want to fill whatever quantity they can at the given
price.  Currently we are interpreting all transactions made directly from
Enron into the True Quote system will be entered as a Fill or Kill.
Will Enron allow partial fills of transaction attempts?
Also, should the successful transaction attempt consist of several parties,
will Enron accept this (3 parties of 5,000 each)?
Do we send back a response identifying a FILL for the partial volume and
FAIL for the remaining volume?

2)  Reverse the statement for an attempt of Enron to Sell a volume against a
counterparty's position to buy.  Is Enron willing to sell partial volumes
should the market not be there to fill Enron's order completely?

Chris,

Wayne and I have reviewed this transcript from the conversation with Enron.
During that conversation, several items were to be worked offline.  These
are detailed and are listed as ""To be worked offline"" in Exhibit B, C, D,
and E.

Would you like to have EnFORM participate in your discussion with Enron, or
do you feel that these items are strategically sensitive enough that you
should have this conversation without EnFORM's involvement?

These ""To be worked offline"" issues are very important, but we do have
additional technical questions that would best be addressed by a technical
Enron contact.  If we could begin the process of a establishing a technical
""relationship"" with an individual at Enron as soon as possible, it would
speed development and lower costs of this project.

P.S.  Wayne was next to me as I typed this note.

Regards,
Maria

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------


The following questions were discussed in the telephone conference call with
Enron on September 26th.  We have inserted Enron's answers in Blue and have
highlighted follow-ups and offline discussions in Red.


Questions for Enron to answer regarding True Quote's interface:

High Priority Questions (need to be addressed):
(From Exhibit A) Will the product ID that Enron is transmitting specifically
identify a product offering including commodity, deal type, region /
location, and tradable term (fully qualified begin and end dates)?

Product ID is a fully transactable item - Product, Location, Dates
Product ID is a fully qualified instrument - excluding price, volume and
counterparty
Product ID can be for next day and balance of month.  However, on next to
last day of month, the Product ID will offer either next day or BOM, not
both (there is no reason for redundancy)
Product ID that is for anything, except for the rolling Tokenized
products/dates (example: For a spot month, the Product ID will expire on the
first day of that spot month)
Currency and Unit of measure is implied as part of Product ID, but it is not
an attribute


(From Exhibit B) Can we confirm a transaction attempt against Enron for an
Enron product id is a ""Fill or Kill"" transaction, meaning, a transaction
attempt submitted to Enron would not stay in their system if it was not
immediately filled.  If the deal is not confirmed by Enron, the order will
be immediately removed from Enron's system and could not be filled later if
market conditions made the order viable.

A transaction attempt by TrueQuote will be ""Fill or Kill"" (It will not in
stay in EOL's system)

If the deal is not confirmed by Enron due to non-availability of volume,
these volumes need to be expired in the True Quote system

If a transaction attempt fails for ANY reason, Enron will immediately
rebroadcast that Product to the True Quote system

Does True Quote need to design functionality for partial fill of a deal
transaction for an outside entity?

Enron will do partial fills.  The True Quote system needs to design
functionality to accept partial fills from an outside entity.

What is the time threshold for waiting on an Enron response to a transaction
attempt?

Enron will accept whatever True Quote determines is an acceptable threshold
for waiting.

What is the estimated delivery date for Enron's DTDs?

The EnronOnline Exchanges External Interface Document was received on
Monday, October 2, 2000.

Exhibit A (Enron Price Interface-what Enron sends to TQ):

Concerning the Enron price interface, Enron has stated that EOL currently
handles prices/volume updates at the rate of 100 updates per second, growing
potentially to 500 per second (across all EOL product offerings).  Given
this level of update activity, how will the transmission of these updates be
accomplished?  Below are some questions which should clarify these concerns:

What is the expected rate of updates for the sub-set of EOL products that
will be transmitted to the True Quote platform?  Is it expected that these
products will also endure update activity at the rate of 100-500 updates per
second?

Although it was not communicated how often an XML document will be sent, it
was clarified that the XML documents will be sent at certain time
intervals.Each update will contain all information since last time polled
(includes all changes (only changes) since last transmission)
Need to clarify if True Quote will be polling EOL for Updates, or if EOL
will send them automatically at certain time intervals.

Will there be one XML document interface transmission for each Enron product
update, or will one XML document interface contain updates for multiple
Enron products?  The implications of this are as follows:  Will True Quote
need to handle 100-500 XML documents per second, or will True Quote receive
one XML document at a determined interval that has updates for all Enron
products?  If the XML document contains updates for all Enron products, how
often will Enron send us the document?   If it's one XML document per Enron
product, will True Quote be expected to handle 100-500 XML document
submissions per second?

The XML document will contain updates for multiple Product IDs.  If only one
Product ID has changed in EOL since the last transmission, then only one
Product ID will be sent to True Quote in the updates.

Can we confirm that Enron will only submit one price/volume offering per
Enron product id; meaning, Enron will never have multiple price and quantity
offerings for the same Enron product ID on the True Quote platform.

Enron will never send Market Depth for any Product ID.  What you see on EOL
is exactly what is transmitted to True Quote (one offering per Enron Product
ID).  However, each Product ID update will contain both the Bid and the
Offer.

The interface currently does not have a field to define the duration of the
order.  Given this, can we assume that when the price interface submits a
product price/volume update to the True Quote platform, the order will be
loaded with a duration of ""Good Until Canceled"".  True Quote will mark the
order as 'GTC' until Enron submits a new XML document for that Enron product
that changes the status to ""Suspended"".  In this case True Quote would
cancel the order on the True Quote system.

All orders will remain on the True Quote system until the EOL traders pull
the deals.  At this time, EOL would send ""Suspended Status"" for the Product
ID.

How are terms related to Enron Product IDs?  Example:  For a given Enron
commodity, deal type, and location that is traded in October, would a new
product id be created for that same product offering when the month rolls to
November?
 Yes

If product ids do not include a direct relationship to a specific tradable
term, when a Price Interface XML document is submitted to the True Quote
platform, how will True Quote know which trade term the product id is
associated with?
Product IDs do have a direct relationship to a specific tradable term

We are currently assuming that an Enron product id specifically identifies a
product offering including commodity, deal type, region/location, and
tradable term.
This assumption is correct

Can we confirm that all Enron orders transmitted to the True Quote platform
will be cancelled at the end of the day and that all products will be
re-loaded into the True Quote system the following morning?  If not,  will
the assumed 'Good Until Canceled' duration for each product id remain active
until the status has been changed to ""Suspended""?

All EOL orders should be removed by the traders at the end of the day.  For
those that are not removed, True Quote should run a nightly batch job that
removes all EOL orders left in the system.  Each morning, True Quote will
authenticate with EOL, and at this time, all orders on EOL will be
transmitted to True Quote.

Exhibit B (Transaction Interface with Enron):

For each field (across all interfaces), we will need clearly defined data
types (precision, range of length, space/bytes it takes).

This information still needs to be provided.

Can we assume the Bid/Ask flag is an integer? Perhaps a bit?  If it's a
character, what is the character indicator?  B/A?

This information still needs to be provided.

Can we confirm the data type for volume is integer?

This information still needs to be provided.

Across all interfaces, there is not a defined unit of measure for price and
volume by Enron product id.   Should part of the XML DTD specify the unit of
measure for both price and volume, or are we to assume that Enron product
ids for Power are in US dollars and megawatt/hr, and Enron product ids for
natural gas are US dollars and MMBTU?

Currency and Unit of measure is implied as part of Product ID, but it is not
an attribute

Price - how many decimal places? (precision of the number)

This information still needs to be provided.

Volume and Price - Does Enron have an min / max / default increment value
established for price and volume increment ranges by Enron product id?  (For
example, within True Quote the default volume increment for natural gas is
5000, and the price increment is $0.0025.  Both the price and volume
increments, min/max ranges can vary by region or location).

On EOL, the traders determine the minimal tradable increments and the
minimal tradable amounts (this minimums could be as low as 1).

To be worked Offline:
How to handle increments <> 5000 increment on the Enron side (will we only
display the 5000 increment below the volume submitted by Enron, if trader
has a minimum greater than entities are willing to participate, how do we
display this and how does the minimum increment come across in the order)


Can we confirm a transaction attempt against Enron for an Enron product id
is a ""Fill or Kill"" transaction, meaning, a transaction attempt submitted to
Enron would not stay in their system if it was not immediately filled.  If
the deal is not confirmed by Enron, the order will be immediately removed
from Enron's system and could not be filled later if market conditions made
the order viable.  If the deal is not confirmed by Enron due to
non-availability of volume, these volumes need to be expired in the True
Quote system.

Already answered above.

Will Enron allow partial fill of transactions?   For example, if the Enron
price interface submits an offer with 20,000 mmbtu available, can True Quote
submit a transaction bid attempt to take only 10,000 mmbtu of the Enron
offer?   If not, is it a valid assumption that we can only submit a
transaction attempt to lift the entire Enron offer of 20,000 mmbtu?

Enron will allow partial fills.

Exhibit C (True Quote Price Interface-what TQ sends to Enron):
Does Enron expect True Quote to submit a single price point offering for an
Enron product id that is the aggregate total volume of all orders available
for that product id on the True Quote platform at the best available price?
This would allow Enron to submit a transaction attempt against the True
Quote platform, submitting a volume request that would potentially sweep
multiple counter parties creating deals with all entities necessary to
satisfy transaction attempt.
Alternative 2:  Does Enron expect True Quote to submit only the best
individual order (the best price and volume for an Enron product id from
only one counterparty) identified by its True Quote order id (True Quote
would not transmit the counter party id; however, before sending the XML
interface to Enron, the counterparty would have to pass the credit rules
maintained in the counterparty credit matrix on the True Quote platform).
Alternative 3:  Would Enron expect True Quote to submit multiple price
offerings per Enron product id (a market depth of various price and volume
offerings).  In this scenario, the volume associated with each price point
should be an aggregate of multiple True Quote orders (as shown in the True
Quote market screen).  The XML interface could potentially transmit
individual True Quote orders and their associated volumes (not an aggregate
volume of multiple orders); however, giving Enron the ability to 'pick and
choose' individual orders could potentially violate True Quote customer
service agreements that require deals to be executed in the chronological
sequence that the order request was received by the True Quote platform.

Enron wants to see the granularity of each True Quote Product ID order.
Enron expects True Quote to submit multiple price offerings per Enron
Product ID.  (Example:  If  True Quote has an order in the system for
100,000 MMbtu's at $3.00, which is comprised of 10 individual orders of
10,000, Enron wants True Quote to send all of the individual orders).

To be worked Offline:
Fair and equitable treatment with prices sent to Enron (proper processing of
orders without bias)
Need to discuss in more detail how to handle EOL price interface
transactions and Enron Trader transactions
Need to clarify with Enron whether they want to receive the best price in
the market for a given Product ID, or if they want to see all of a given
Product ID's market depth.

Our concern is that if True Quote transmits individual True Quote orders and
their associated volumes (not an aggregate volume of multiple orders),
giving Enron the ability to 'pick and choose' individual orders, this could
potentially violate True Quote customer service agreements that require
deals to be executed in the chronological sequence that the order request
was received by the True Quote platform.


Exhibit D (Sponsor Transaction Interface):
Are we correct in assuming that transactions posted by Enron traders against
True Quote deals will be executed on the True Quote system?  Will the
duration of the order attempts being sent to True Quote be ""Fill or Kill"" or
some other duration?

To be worked Offline:
The traders will want to transact against True Quote directly without
adjusting the market position through EOL, but how this is accomplished will
be to be discussed.

Exhibit E (Counterparty Interface):
In general, we need more details about what Enron will be sending as part of
their daily counterparty credit / term interface, as well as the intra-day
counterparty credit/term interface:
Currently, exhibit E does not specific any fields or data types within an
XML DTD.
What are the ""terms"" under which participants can trade with Enron?  For
example, will the level of restriction include volumetric limits, financial
limits, tradable date range limits (number days or months into the future)
by Enron product id (assuming a product id specifically defines a commodity,
deal-type, region/location, and tradable term).  Will Enron send us a 'yes /
no' flag to turn off/on a counterparty's ability to trade with Enron by the
Enron product id?

To be worked Offline:
Credit terms and counterparty interface details were not addressed in the
teleconference.  The details of granularity will need to addressed to better
understand the responsibilities that True Quote will have in handling
Enron's credit structure.


Questions for True Quote to Answer:

Exhibit D:  Does the Sponsor Transaction interface (Enron proposing
transactions on the True Quote platform) still invoke the Enron Transaction
Interface?  There was some discussion that if internal Enron traders
proposed transactions against the True Quote platform, the point of
transaction would be the True Quote platform, and True Quote would not have
to invoke the transaction on the EOL platform.  True Quote would simply
confirm whether the Enron transaction attempt succeeded or failed.  If it
succeeded, True Quote would send a confirmation XML interface to confirm the
deal had been executed and transmit the True Quote Deal ID to Enron.
What is the time threshold for waiting on Enron's response to a transaction
attempt?  For example, after 'n' seconds the True Quote platform should
alert a system operator that an Enron transaction attempt has failed to
return either a confirmation or failure.

Please respond to the questions above.

Thank you.

* Product ID
* Product ID is a fully transactable item  and fully qualified instrument -
Includes: Product, Location, Dates; Excludes: Price, Volume and Couterparty
* Tokenized Dates:  Product ID for next day and balance of month are
tokenized dates which means that the product ID will remain the same for
designated date range (next day, next 2 days, BOM, etc).  The dates will
role, but the product ID will remain the same
* Product IDs for anything but the rolling Tokenized products/dates (i.e. -
spot month), expire after date has been reached.
* There will be no redundancy of product IDs that encompass the same date
ranges (i.e.:  there are usually two separate product IDs for next day and
balance of month, but when the next to the last day of the month is reached,
both will reference the same day.  At this point, Enron will only have one
product ID associated with the given date range)
* Enron has set up product IDs to adequately reflect Weekend trading on
Friday (deals entered for Saturday will encompass Sat - Mon (and include
extra days when Holidays are involved))
* Once a strip term has been reached, trades within the month then change to
the tokenized product IDs.
* Enron will Fill or Kill all transaction attempts - they will execute or
cancel the trade immediately
* Enron will Partial fills transaction attempts
* When True Quote sends a request for a transaction, the threshold for
waiting on a response from Enron will be defined by True Quote.
* Trade failure will re-broadcast product (failure for any reason)
* If for any reason there is a concern about a product, True Quote can
request (HTTP) validation of the product in question
* Frequency of updates:  Enron will send True Quote a document that contains
all information since last time polled (includes all changes (only changes)
since last transmission)
* Every product sent will have only one bid and offer price associated with
it at time of transmission.  What you see on EOL is what is sent to True
Quote.
* There will be no market depth transmitted to True Quote from Enron
* Duration of orders
* Orders will be displayed on True Quote until suspended by traders
* All orders will remain on system until traders pull deals
* True Quote session is finite (7 -7).  At the end of every day all deals
will be removed from True Quote (either by Enron traders removing them, or
TRUE QUOTE will run a batch job to clear Enron deals).  In the morning, TRUE
QUOTE will authenticate and all products will be loaded from Enron to TRUE
QUOTE.
* The Currency and Unit of measure are implied as part of Product ID, it's
not an attribute.
* Granularity of orders transmitted from True Quote to Enron will show each
order associated with each price and volume of a Product ID (i.e. 100,000
mmbtu @ $5 is made up of 10 separate orders of 10,000, Enron would like to
see all 10 orders of 10,000 - including counterparty information)
* Transaction attempts made from True Quote to EOL - Point of execution will
be on EOL
* Transaction attempts made by Enron Traders against True Quote price
postings will be executed on True Quote

Offline:
* Will we know if a transaction has failed due to volume not available,
credit failure, or Enron has not heard of the transaction
* How to handle increments <> 5000 increment on the Enron side (will we only
display the 5000 increment below the volume submitted by Enron; if trader
has a minimum tradable volume greater than entities are willing to
participate (i.e. Enron minimum tradable amount is 10,000 or 15,000) how do
we display this and how does the minimum increment come across in the order)
* If we transmit to Enron the granularity of all orders (including
counterparty information), how will True Quote / Enron ensure the fair and
equitable treatment with prices sent to Enron (proper processing of orders
without bias)
* Business question: how much do we want to send Enron (they are ok with
sending each order for all price points in an instrument), do we show top 1
or top 5?
* Need to discuss in more detail how to handle EOL price interface
transactions and Enron Trader transactions

Maria,

Please confirm with David that NO partial fills refers *only* to transaction
attempts.  We fully expect that Enron will send us (potentially) large
volumes via. the price posting interface; then, we may execute multiple
transaction attempts for that EOL product ID to Enron via. the transaction
attempt interface.  These individual transaction attempts could be much
smaller (in volume) than the volume posted via. the price posting interface.

Basically, the way we understand it is... the individual transaction
attempts will be 'all or nothing'; however, we can break the large price
post down and transmit multiple (smaller) transaction attempts against that
large price post volume.

I believe we are all in agreement on this, but it never hurts to be
absolutely sure concerning something of this magnitude and importance.

Thanks,

-Stewart

I've spoken the David Fisher at Enron this morning.  The conference call
will Andy Zipper and Jay Webb cannot be arranged until next Thursday (Dec.
14). David will send details later.

David has asked us to assume that there will be NO partial fills on either
side. He believes that even if they agree to do this it will likely be a
""day 2"" enhancement and not a functionality that is part of the January 5th
deliverables. He is also requesting that we focus on completing the
functionality that will allow Enron to post prices on True Quote and will
allow True Quote to execute transactions on EOL.  In addition, another
priority needs to be to have the credit functionality completed.  These are
going to be the requirements that need to be tested by December 18th and
need to be in production by January 5th.

True Quote's ability to send prices to Enron and accept transaction attempts
from EOL is secondary at this point and not likely to be a requirement that
needs to be met by January 5th.

Please let me know if there is any reason why the execution engine will not
be ready to accept price posts from EOL and send transaction requests
(assuming only full orders will be filled) by December 18th.  If there is
any concern about getting credit functioning within that timeframe, please
let me know this as soon as possible, as well.  Thanks for all of your help.
You all are key contributors to this project and without your awesome
knowledge and skills, we would never be able to complete this project in the
timeframe that we're being asked to complete it in.  I really appreciate
your efforts.

Stew & Richard,

I would be surprised if Enron was willing to store the minimum qty, but what
about sending it in the transaction request as an additional attribute?
Might they be talked into that?  This would be better for us since we should
not have to worry about maintaining our system information on the Enron
platform.

How about proposing that both platforms send the min & increment volume
requirements?  This would be more complex for us now, but might be better in
the long run for both platforms.  We would be more flexible and better able
to integrate with outside systems if we were able to accept this type of
information.  It get complicated because you could only fill where the two
requirements (our and the outside system) were compatible, but it is
do-able.  Thoughts?

Dennis &  Chris...

One other EOL scenario we forgot to talk about this evening was the scenario
where:

1)  EOL post 20,000 / day to our platform via. the price post interface...
2)  A True Quote customer submits a request to do 15,000 / day...
3) TQ submits a transaction attempt to EOL for 15,000 day...
4)  EOL only has 14,000 remaining, so they deny the entire transaction
attempt...

However, if Enron's system was aware that we would take partially filled Gas
orders in minimum increments of 5,000, EOL could have partially filled the
transaction request for 10,000.

Any news on that scenario?  I'll talk to Maria first thing in the morning...
perhaps this one is already resolved?   I would think it would be in EOL's
best business interest to store our minimum volumes, so EOL could always
fill us at least partially rather than deny the entire transaction.
However, it really doesn't matter to us (technically) we'll just cancel the
entire EOL transaction attempt and continue our sweep and fill the volume
with the next available counterparty.   Whereas if they partially filled us,
we would probably cancel the original transaction attempt, and rebuild a new
transaction deal ID for the 10,000 / day deal.... then continue the sweep
for the final 5,000 from the next available counterparty.

I haven't reviewed this scenario with the deal execution team yet, but if
EOL *did* partially fill us with *at least* our minimum, it would probably
be no more or less complex for us because even in a scenario where EOL
denies a transaction attempt, we ALREADY must have the logic to cancel the
EOL deal transaction attempt, and create a new order with the next available
counterparty (to fill the volume request).   So, if EOL did partially filled
us, we would simply cancel the original transaction request that was for the
full volume amount, and create a new deal with EOL for the partial volume
they confirmed, as opposed to creating a new deal with a different
counterparty.  Only one additional deal would have to be created with the
next available counterparty to fill the last 5,000 of the original request.
Seems simply enough... and it would be in EOL's best interest to fill our
transaction attempts partially so they would complete our transaction
attempts more often....   if they don't fill us partially, EOL will probably
end-up denying many of our transaction attempts if the exact volume is not
available.  hmm.... what do ya'll think?

Maria,

Stewart is correct in his understanding of no parital fills.  I will
reiterate his statements through the following examples:

If Enron posts a gas product with 50,000 MMBTU available and TrueQuote
attempts a transaction on 30,000 MMBTU, the attempt will be successfull if
the following 3 criteria are met:

1.  30,000 MMBTU is still available when the transaction hits EOL.
2.  30,000 MMBTU meets the minimum volume for the product as set by the
trader.
3.  30,000 MMBTU meets the increment volume for the product as set by the
trader.

Examples of how the 3 criteria above come into play:

1.  If when TrueQuote attempts to transact on 30,000 MMBTU, the volume
available for the product drops to below 30,000 MMBTU, the transaction will
fail.
2.  If TrueQuote attempts to transact on 30,000 MMBTU but the EOL trader
has set the minimum volume for the product to 40,000 MMBTU, the transaction
will fail.
3.  If TrueQuote attempts to transact on 32,500 MMBTU but the EOL trader
has set 5,000 MMBTU increments, the transaction will fail.

I set-up a meeting with Jay Webb and Andy Zipper for next Friday.  That is
the earliest we all could meet.  Once we talk, I'll coordinate a conference
call with you.  For the time being let's stay the course.

Regards,
David

Stew & Richard,

I would be surprised if Enron was willing to store the minimum qty, but
what
about sending it in the transaction request as an additional attribute?
Might they be talked into that?  This would be better for us since we
should
not have to worry about maintaining our system information on the Enron
platform.

How about proposing that both platforms send the min & increment volume
requirements?  This would be more complex for us now, but might be better
in
the long run for both platforms.  We would be more flexible and better able
to integrate with outside systems if we were able to accept this type of
information.  It get complicated because you could only fill where the two
requirements (our and the outside system) were compatible, but it is
do-able.  Thoughts?

Dennis &  Chris...

One other EOL scenario we forgot to talk about this evening was the
scenario
where:

1)  EOL post 20,000 / day to our platform via. the price post interface...
2)  A True Quote customer submits a request to do 15,000 / day...
3) TQ submits a transaction attempt to EOL for 15,000 day...
4)  EOL only has 14,000 remaining, so they deny the entire transaction
attempt...

However, if Enron's system was aware that we would take partially filled
Gas
orders in minimum increments of 5,000, EOL could have partially filled the
transaction request for 10,000.

Any news on that scenario?  I'll talk to Maria first thing in the
morning...
perhaps this one is already resolved?   I would think it would be in EOL's
best business interest to store our minimum volumes, so EOL could always
fill us at least partially rather than deny the entire transaction.
However, it really doesn't matter to us (technically) we'll just cancel the
entire EOL transaction attempt and continue our sweep and fill the volume
with the next available counterparty.   Whereas if they partially filled
us,
we would probably cancel the original transaction attempt, and rebuild a
new
transaction deal ID for the 10,000 / day deal.... then continue the sweep
for the final 5,000 from the next available counterparty.

I haven't reviewed this scenario with the deal execution team yet, but if
EOL *did* partially fill us with *at least* our minimum, it would probably
be no more or less complex for us because even in a scenario where EOL
denies a transaction attempt, we ALREADY must have the logic to cancel the
EOL deal transaction attempt, and create a new order with the next
available
counterparty (to fill the volume request).   So, if EOL did partially
filled
us, we would simply cancel the original transaction request that was for
the
full volume amount, and create a new deal with EOL for the partial volume
they confirmed, as opposed to creating a new deal with a different
counterparty.  Only one additional deal would have to be created with the
next available counterparty to fill the last 5,000 of the original request.
Seems simply enough... and it would be in EOL's best interest to fill our
transaction attempts partially so they would complete our transaction
attempts more often....   if they don't fill us partially, EOL will
probably
end-up denying many of our transaction attempts if the exact volume is not
available.  hmm.... what do ya'll think?

Would you like me to schedule a meeting to discuss real time data feeds to 
customers? If so who should attend?

I also would like to follow up with True Quote and Houston Street from a 
business perspective on the exchanges.  Is it ok for me to contact them to 
get a feel on progress on their side.  If so who are the commercial contacts 
at True Quotes and Houston Street?

Attached is a draft of the Broker Electronic Transaction Agreement which will 
be used to allow Brokers to transact on behalf of their customers.  Please 
review the document and give me any comments.  Please pay particuliar 
attention to Section 3 Transactions.  

Also please note that it will be imperative that broker confirmations are 
done each day on Broker Client Transactions to limit the exposure associated 
with online transaction broker breakage costs.  The confirmations group will 
be responsible for confirming each day and notifying credit immediately of 
any discrepancies between Enron and the Broker.   Notification by the 
confirmations group will be the only means by which credit will be informed 
to shut down broker activity in the case of a transaction that has not been 
confirmed and/or verified by the broker.

Bob, here you go.? Lets work up a more formal  term sheet and go from there.
?
In short, for  us to accept a licensing fee and no commission when our 
brokers hit/lift
over  the phones an EOL number with Enron traders, we're looking to receive
from  Enron:
??? - Access to EOL numbers in worldwide natural gas,  power, bandwidth, and
oil petroleum markets.? We feel strongly that  Amerex has built leadership or
solid intermediary positions in all these  markets, and that should greatly
benefit Enron and EOL, as well as benefit  Amx.
??? - Until Amx notifies EOL, we interact with EOL on a  view and phone call
basis, essentially in keeping with doing business with  Enron traders just
like we do now, accept we see the bid/ask on line as well  as in voice.? But
with notice from Amx, EOL will program the Amx  interaction to allow Amx
brokers to hit/lift on a keyboard  function
??? - That Amx pays the license fee of $250k for the  first year, on a
monthly basis.
??? - At the end of the one  year period, there will be no greater increase
in the license fee than 10%,  and the license fee can be reduced, subject to
both parties'  agreement.
??? - We are keeping this confidential, and would  request that EOL and Enron
does not even indicate that a broker or a Houston  broker, or some other
indirect reference of a deal with a brokerage or Amx is  made to the market.

Look forward to hearing from you.
All the best
Steve

All,

In my haste to begin the four day weekend last week, I failed to send the 
status update I promised in my earlier note.  Below is a slightly tardy but 
nonetheless riveting Exchange Linking Status Update.

1.  Exchange Linking Software Development - Functional development was 
completed on schedule and we are currently performing testing of the Beta 
release.  Initial testing has gone very well.  
     A final release is scheduled for January 15th.  I will be working with 
Victoria Storey from the Operations group in turning over external testing of 
the system.  A deployment plan has been submitted to
     Operations to assist them with the rollout.

2.  Exchange Linking GUI - Development is complete and testing is being 
conducted.

3.  Product Mapping -  Product Control Group continues their effort of 
coordinating with TrueQuote the products covered under Schedule A of the 
contract.  Points of contact have been arranged 
      between Enron (Rob Cass) and TrueQuote (Richard Toubia) to continue the 
coordination effort required to support ongoing product mapping.

4.  Hardware - All network and server hardware has been received and 
installed.  

5.  Leased Lines - Anchi Z. has been coordinating with each exchange's 
network POC and assisting in obtaining T-1 lines to support this project.  In 
the absence of T-1 lines, both TrueQuote and Houston
     Street will be using VPN connectivity to conduct testing.  We should be 
up and running with TrueQuote by 28 December so that testing can begin.  
Houston Street does not anticipate being ready to 
     test anything until the end of February. 

6.  Bridging - Downstream system bridging modifications have been made to 
accommodate the addition of an external exchange id and an external exchange 
deal number.

7.  TrueQuote has stated that they will not make the contract date with 
regard to some of the functionality of their system.  They hope to be able to 
fully act as a client exchange but are not prepared to
      take on the role of an external exchange (i.e. handle transaction 
attempts from Enron.)

8.  Houston Street is back in the picture.  Their stated contract date is 
December 4th + 120 calendar days.  This gives them some breathing room.  They 
have canned Sapient, built their own internal 
      IT team, purchased messaging software from Web Methods and changed 
hosting providers.  They will no longer use Genuity out of Boston but Data 
Return out of Dallas for their hosting needs.

Please advise if you have any questions or comments.

-David"

My apologies-- I have to admit that I dropped the ball on this one. WIth the
market going crazy, yearend and some stuff going on in London, I havent
totally formulated the response to you.  I will get a response to you early
next week.  Obviously, we have had alot of discussions internally with many
issues/questions.  However, I understand that you need an answer soon so we
will revert quickly.
Happy New Year.

Mary,

Just wondering what path you folks want to pursue. Give me a call if you
want to continue discussions, or let me know if you want to drop it.

Hope you had a good Holiday season,

After a week and a half of silence from Houston Street, I found out today 
that they have taken over responsibility for their exchange linking 
development from Sapient.  According to the Houston Street project manager, 
Sapient was being too cautious and thorough in their efforts to get to market 
and Houston Street wasn't impressed with their progress to date.  Sapient had 
as of last week finished the design work for the system and has provided the 
design to Houston Street.  Houston Street will use their own internal team to 
complete the project and feels confident they will finish by the 15 January 
deadline.  

This does not bode well for the exchange that appeared to be light years 
ahead of TrueQuote in their development efforts.

Andy,

Attached is a spreadsheet which runs through direct costs of adding Markets 
to EnronOnline, as discussed yesterday.

There is both art and science in this, along with some generalisations.

Perhaps we can discuss at 11:00?

Andy,

When we met a few weeks back you offered to put me in touch with someone
from your VC group to discuss potential investors in HoustonStreet.  This
round of financing seems to be firming up at a very attractive price for new
investors and I wanted to take you up on your offer.  I'd love to talk with
someone in your VC group about who they see in the market that is actually
taking positions at this time.  We may have room to fill in this round with
some new investors.  Someone's going to make a lot of money on
HoustonStreet.

I received a briefing Friday on our development efforts and things seem to
be on track.  We have brought in some unbelievable developers that are very
focused and enjoying this project immensely.  Please let me know if any
issues come up with development efforts from your end and I'll do the same.

Best regards,
Frank"

Andy,

As you might expect in this market environment, valuations are down
significantly from our last round.  I expect we'll be south of $50mm.  We've
slashed our expenses so we won't have to take as much $$ at such a low
valuation.  We only need $5mm to $10mm to get us through to the other side.
At these prices, I expect certain of our existing shareholders to step up.
Just as there was a disconnection between underlying fundamentals and
valuations in the first half of 2000, I feel like there is now a disconnect
on the downside.  Operationally, we're ahead of plan and looking at
profitablity in the third quarter, but most VCs are licking their wounds and
frozen.  They are a bunch of lemmings.  I won't have specific dilution
figures until we firm up the round.  Obviously, I want to sell as little of
the company as possible in this market.  I'll keep you posted.

I'm also working on a proposal on the global strategy I mentioned to you and
Louise in our meeting.  Will have something to share with you in early Feb.

Please keep all this confidential.  I'm headed to Europe later this
afternoon, but will be back on Wednesday if you want to talk.

Best regards,
Frank

Attached is a Price Schedule, which follows the approximate structure we 
discussed the other day. As previously mentioned, I aggregated some things 
where it seemed to make sense to do so.

I have highlighted the Bridge Setup sections. I boosted this level from what 
we discussed.

Also, I think our Auctions charges are too high. Suggest we drop the 
per-Auction charge down to $2,000 (cost is less than $1,000).

John,

As per our discussion of this afternoon, I am noting below the points that we 
have discussed and agreed with respect to IP transport products, which were 
originally set-up for video taping purpose for the analyst meeting on 24 
January 2001. 

As per your request, we will set-up the IP transport products in the product 
manager in such a manner so that they can be traded in the future, which will 
be some time next week, contingent upon 3 conditions to which you have 
already agreed.  

1.  The new GTCs and the product descriptions have to conform with  each 
other (we are in the process of checking this).

2.  For the foreseeable future, the products have to  be displayed on  
EnronOnline on daily basis (with the exception of holidays) with relevant 
prices and 
     must  be made available for trading with  approved counter-parties .

3.  As I mentioned to you over the phone, in essence this is a full scale 
launch. Therefore, the cost associated with the launch of IP transports 
products will    
     be similar to that for  any other standard launch ( about US$ 250,000).  
Further details on this will be provided to you shortly.  Obviously any cost 
that your      group has   already incurred for the analyst demo  will be 
netted off against the total cost of launch.

As I also explained to you that the normal operational  procedure for 
EnronOnline mandates that any changes with respect to system/database take 
place over the weekend. However, as you have indicated the necessity and the 
urgency of giving the reading rights to your counter-parties by Friday, we 
will endeavour to do so.  However, this will require substantial deployment 
of additional resources to ensure that we do not compromise the integrity of 
EnronOnline system while fulfilling your request.

If you have any questions, please let know.

Naveed

Please review the comments below.  As I stated in our meeting on Friday, I
have been pushing our team for the February 16th deadline.  Unfortunately,
there are some issues that have not been resolved and may be putting our
deadline in jeopardy.  I wanted you to review this summary of the current
state of affairs and compare it to your team's opinion on the situation.
Again, this is Maria's view of the situation, which might be totally
different from your team's perspective.  We do not want the situation to
become an ""us v. them"" mentality, so I am taking this opportunity to solicit
your feedback.  Dennis and I are hoping we can work diligently to make up
this time and resolve these issues in a joint effort.  We look forward to
your comments and completing this link once and for all.

Please let me know if I can provide any other input.

Best Regards,
Chris

Subject: Concerns with Status of Enron Integration Testing


Chris,

Dennis asked that I send you a note expressing our concern with the delays
that we have been experiencing with the Enron Integration testing.

We have essentially not made any progress since we began testing ""Enron
Posting Prices to True Quote"" on January 17th.  First, the test did not work
because there was a problem at Enron with price updates not posting
correctly to their integration server.  This problem was resolved and we
were asked to repeat the test a week later on January 24th.  This test was
also unsuccessful because the data we received did not contain any spaces
between words.  As of today, it has not been determined whether the problem
is on Enron's side or ours.  We have been continuing to research the problem
on our side and so far it looks to us like the data is arriving on our
server without the spaces. Enron's Operations group was planning to do a
test today to ""sniff"" the network to determine how the data is actually
leaving their firewall, but they have had other problems that have prevented
them from working with us today.  Last Friday they were not able to spend
any time working with us because they were getting ready for their
maintenance window.

Our concern is that each time we have encountered a problem, it has taken
several days to resolve the issue before we can move on to the next series
of tests.  Understanding that the due date is only 3 weeks away, the True
Quote team is concerned that Enron is not providing enough resources to work
the problems immediately and resolve them as quickly as possible.  Part of
the reason for some of the delay on Enron's side may be that the group that
is involved in the testing has had to go back to the developer group for
assistance each time they have encountered a problem (at least that's our
understanding).  We don't believe that there is anyone in the developer
group that is dedicated to resolve our problems as soon as one is reported.

The reality of this situation is that we have one project but many different
disconnected teams working on the project.  As we move forward we would like
to make the following recommendations to improve the speed of our testing
activities:

1) Rather than working as two disconnected teams (testing via conference
call), it would be helpful if we had an Enron person here in our office each
time we test and communicate back to Enron the results that we are getting.
That person should be someone that has a direct link back to the developers
group, the operations group, and the products group.

2) The Enron resource should have as their priority to work with the
necessary groups within Enron to resolve issues as quickly as possible.

3) The developers group needs to address problems that are reported by the
testers as quickly as possible.

We welcome any other suggestions that you or Andy have to improve the speed
of our testing and implementation process.  Please let me know once you've
had a chance to speak to Andy if there is anything that he can do to provide
us resources to proceed with our testing more expeditiously.

Chris,
I have asked our team to review the document you sent me and to ascertain
what the hold up is. One thing that has been made clear to me is that we
were ready to begin testing a month ago and had to idle a group of folks
while your development team caught up. This has created a bit of a manpower
crunch for us but we will fix it. I will respond to you when I know more. I
am out of the office next two days but available on Thursday and Friday.

We are in the process of preparing an invoice for the $250,000 charge for 
setting up your IP product.

This should be sent to your attention in the next few days. If you would 
prefer to have it sent elsewhere within EBS, please let us know.

Andy,

Per your request, I have outlined below the key terms of the most recent
equity transaction.

On September 8, 2000, PG&E invested $2 million in return for 7,500,000
shares ($.2667/share).
Enron's shares outstanding net of clawback equal 7,268,058 * .2667 = $1,
938,391.
Total shares outstanding as of 2/1/01 equal 31,440,896.

Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Andy,

As a follow-up to our phone conversation, True Quote is in the process of
obtaining an equity bridge in the range of $1 to $2 million.  True Quote's
current cash position is tight and we need to complete this process within
the next two/three weeks.    Due to the current state of the capital
markets, management feels it is prudent to solicit a small bridge amount.
Once ""traction"" (EOL link complete, TQTS deal complete, etc..) is obtained,
we will continue to solicit larger equity investments from strategic
partners and the investment community.

I would be glad to discuss the current state of affairs in more detail and
provide the appropriate information if you are interested in pursuing this
opportunity.

Regards,

Andy,

When you have some time, can we get together on the circumstances under which 
we should charge a business unit for the addition of a new Product Type?

I'm thinking specifically of the units which do receive a cost allocation, 
but are adding products which in our opinion are of questionable economic 
benefit.

These could be charged in accordance with our current price schedule. i.e. 
new Product Types added to existing businesses could be charged the 
incremental setup fees.  New Businesses would be the 250K.

If the Product Type is of clear benefit (e.g. Options for US Gas and for the 
guys we are training this week), then the costs would be part of next year's 
allocation.

What do you think?

Hi J

These are my initial comments and have not spoken to Andy about them.  Andy 
has sent his comments to you already.

Comments re Price Posting Agreement:

 Enron should retain for itself the ability to choose which counterparties 
can trade on its prices - the physical platform will be open to more than the 
LME  members.
 Schedule A - do the phys metals guys intend to post prices for all the 
metals in Schedule A?  Currently we only post phys aluminium and copper on   
EnronOnline.
 Clause 4 - need to decide now who is responsible for building the 
interface.  Would prefer them to build.
 Clause 4.1 - the mutually agreeable protocol to be developed and implemented 
prior to Interface Completion Date.
 Clause 5.1 - how does this work vis a vis our GTCs - especially for the 
physical platform?
 Clause 9.1.1 - date for physical platform to be 31 March 2001.
 Clause 10 - confidentiality for specified period?
 Clause 12, Line 5 - have some extra words ""...theory of liability ...""
 Clause 18 - need to refer to both eMetra platforms.

Comments re the Price Posting Agreement - Side Letter:

 What is eMetra's fee structure for both platforms?
 eMetra not to waive or change fee structure without notice to and consent of 
Enron.
 Itemised breakdown of fee income to include all participants.

Justin - we also need to deal with the indicative price feed that our 
technology guys are currently working on - can we include in this agreement?

Regards

A

As many of you are aware, over the last few weeks the Kiodex transaction has 
changed such that it no longer includes the sale of EnergyDesk.   The new 
transaction structure is limited to the Kiodex/EOL Strategic Relationship and 
performance warrants.  Attached is the final version of the non-binding 
Kiodex LOI which was signed November 21, 2000.  Our goal is to finalize the 
documents and close by year end.  If anyone has any questions or comments 
please feel free to give me a call at the numbers listed below.  Thank you.

Travis:

 Please find attached a clean and redline version of the revised
Exclusivity Agreement, with the changes that we discussed.  The redline
shows changes from the draft submitted to us by eSpeed.

 Per our earlier conversation, you said that Andy was still thinking
about one open point, namely: Whether the definition of the Enron Platform
should be modified to anticipate some changes that may occur.  Specifically
I suggested that the requirement that the Enron Platform be ""operated"" by an
Enron Party be deleted, and leaving only the limitation of ownership.

 I have given Anthony comments on the series designation.  He will be
making other changes to the designation and will forward it to you directly.

 Please let me know if you have any questions or comments, or if I
can be of any further assistance.

 Best regards,

 Ted

Ged, Peter,

Following further discussions, I attach a new draft of the document.  As 
before, this is subject to further internal Enron review, and has not been 
circulated to any other parties.

All new, as well as existing changes to the extent these still apply, are 
marked.

Thanks.

Andy,

Thanks for taking the time in reading the posting agreement and making 
comments.  

It is worth remembering that given a choice we would not be entering into 
this posting agreement.    The historical agreement with MG dictates many of 
the variances we will see from your other posting agreements.

Given the short time frame here, Justin is in the process of trying to set up 
a call with Travis and you for later today.  I have tried to address a couple 
of the points you raise below.

regards
bruce

Subject: eMetra posting agreement

I have read and reviewed the Posting Agreement. Let me preface my comments by 
saying that I'm sure there is stuff in the Posting Agreement that I am 
missing and I really want Travis McCullough to review it. I'm also curious as 
to why in certain sections it is faithful to the agreement I sent  and in 
other places seems to stray or omits things. Anyway here are my comments:

1). Whereas (A). How many eMetra platforms are there ? what does 
""collectively the Platforms"" mean ? The agreement should be specific as to 
which platforms eMetra can display prices on.  There are two platforms one 
physical and one financial.  The primary focus of this agreement is on 
financial platform.

2). Regulatory Event, This language should really mirror the Posting 
Agreements in place. The language should cover the situation that if any of 
the events mentioned subject Enron or any of its affiliates to regulation it 
is a Regulatory Event, even if it does not impact upon the way eMetra 
conducts its business as contemplated by the agreement.

3). Term 2.2, There is no time limit on the date that eMetra commences LME 
trading. Given that the language is worded as the later of"" this leaves them 
with all the leverage. It should be the earlier of. This is a big one as they 
could sit around forever trying to make it work and we are still bound by an 
agreement that runs 18 months from forever.  I agree with you on this one.  
Starting the clock now does not work but we should be able to set the clock 
at 18 months from Ap 30, 2001.

4). Establishment and Maintenance of Interfaces 4.1 We need to agree on who 
is responsible for what interfaces in this agreement, upfront. These were 
detailed in the agreement I sent to you. They are to responsible for 
maintaining the interfaces so we do not want to build them. In general we are 
responsible for specifying the interfaces and they are responsible for 
building and operating them. Once again, please refer to the posting 
agreement that was sent for the exhibits detailing this. 

5). Execution of Transactions 5.1 All parties agree to be bound by Enron's 
General Terms and Conditions.  We can discuss on the phone call.

6) Execution of Transactions 5.2.3 Please use the exact language from the 
Posting  Agreement sent. This wording is unclear. There is no time of 
transacting as there is no transaction unless price and volume are available 
at time of receipt of proposed transaction.

7). Execution of Transactions General comment: There is no language referring 
to eMetra taking responsibility for Mapping Errors. This is a big issue. We 
will not be responsible if they incorrectly display our prices, i.e. 3 mo. 
Aluminium displayed as 6 mo. Aluminium. Please refer to Posting Agreement for 
language.  I agree

8). Co-Operation 7.2 and 7.3 I would like to see both of these deleted. We 
have not given this to anyone else and it seems to be indirect conflict with 
13. This section pretty much rules out that we market EnronOnline to our 
customers and I don't see how we can live with it.  I think we would be 
willing to substitute some form of non-disparagement language in its place.  
We are balancing a couple of issues here.  Some of this is specific for 
Emetra.  John Sherriff has been involved in the business issues that have 
been agreed to.  Not withstanding the support of Emetra, we believe we have 
the freedom to market EOL and are released from the non-compete.

9). Default and Termination 9.1.1  How is the release from the non-compete 
tied to breach of this agreement ? There is no link between breach under this 
agreement and non-compete.

10). Default and Termination 9.1.1 Strike the term material from sentence. 
All parts of this agreement are material or they wouldn't be in it. Fine

11).  Default and Termination 9.1.4 and Enron Operational Failure. This is 
too broad. Only the failure of an aspect of the Enron platform that affects 
participants ability to conduct business with Enron through eMetra is 
relevant.  Fine 

12). Cost and Expenses. eMetra bears all costs relating to connectivity (i.e. 
T1's)  between eMetra to the Enron platform. Fine

13). Assignment should read ""eMetra's right to display Enron's prices...""  
Fine

As I said earlier I'm sure there are things I 've left out and strongly 
suggest that Travis review it before signing.


Thanks,
Andy

Subject: Re: Price Posting Agreement and Side Letter for Review - eMetra  

Hi J

These are my initial comments and have not spoken to Andy about them.  Andy 
has sent his comments to you already.

Comments re Price Posting Agreement:

 Enron should retain for itself the ability to choose which counterparties 
can trade on its prices - the physical platform will be open to more than the 
LME  members.
 Schedule A - do the phys metals guys intend to post prices for all the 
metals in Schedule A?  Currently we only post phys aluminium and copper on   
EnronOnline.
 Clause 4 - need to decide now who is responsible for building the 
interface.  Would prefer them to build.
 Clause 4.1 - the mutually agreeable protocol to be developed and implemented 
prior to Interface Completion Date.
 Clause 5.1 - how does this work vis a vis our GTCs - especially for the 
physical platform?
 Clause 9.1.1 - date for physical platform to be 31 March 2001.
 Clause 10 - confidentiality for specified period?
 Clause 12, Line 5 - have some extra words ""...theory of liability ...""
 Clause 18 - need to refer to both eMetra platforms.

Comments re the Price Posting Agreement - Side Letter:

 What is eMetra's fee structure for both platforms?
 eMetra not to waive or change fee structure without notice to and consent of 
Enron.
 Itemised breakdown of fee income to include all participants.

Justin - we also need to deal with the indicative price feed that our 
technology guys are currently working on - can we include in this agreement?

Regards

A

Andy, Travis

Following our call last night, I attach a re-draft of the Posting Agreement, 
marked to show the changes.

Look forward to your response, in particular relating to the identification 
of the relevant Interfaces and the respective responsibilities of the parties.

Thanks

Upon further reflection I think we need to revisit the issue of specifying 
the interfaces. Given that EnronOnline will be implementing and operating 
this agreement leaving the interface specifications up in the air is asking 
for a lot of work/trouble next year. They are fairly generic and 
straightfoward and should not create a delay. They really are an integral 
partof the posting agreement. If you would like to discuss I am available 
tomorrow, give me a ring

Tara,

Andy's books are as follows:

NG-X-OPT-NG (gas)
NG-X-OPT-WTI (crude)
NG-X-OPT-PWR (power)

Let's use the natural gas book as the one he logs in under.

Subject:	Serious proposal

You may think this sounds like an off the wall idea but Greg and I were talking about today's events and................  why don't we put our equity in eMetra on EnronOnline up for auction or even DealBench for that matter.  There is an irony with EOL though.

Think about it..................  I think its a good idea.    In fact in all honesty you could put an offer out there.  Start with say $3-5 million and reduce every week you don't get an offer.

The way we value this thing we could easily remove the problem in one move by just auctioning it off.  

There is no downside and it removes further issues you may have with future shareholders and eMetra's direction.

(I personally would love to offer a certain party a log on id and password to bid.)

Louise,

What am I missing here?  We are offering an excellent deal for eMetra which
will take the business forward and we believe management supports.  We are
offering to get you into 3 markets which you are active in where you can
earn shares of our stock without paying an entry price.  I have found a
structural way of getting the $10 million in cash to you.

I am surprised you do not want to discuss this further.

Jonathan

Travis:

 Please find attached a clean and redline version of the revised
Exclusivity Agreement, with the changes that we discussed.  The redline
shows changes from the draft submitted to us by eSpeed.

 Per our earlier conversation, you said that Andy was still thinking
about one open point, namely: Whether the definition of the Enron Platform
should be modified to anticipate some changes that may occur.  Specifically
I suggested that the requirement that the Enron Platform be ""operated"" by an
Enron Party be deleted, and leaving only the limitation of ownership.

 I have given Anthony comments on the series designation.  He will be
making other changes to the designation and will forward it to you directly.

 Please let me know if you have any questions or comments, or if I
can be of any further assistance.

 Best regards,

 Ted

obtain from eSpeed at the closing to enter into what we have referred to as 
the ""Project Raptor"" transactions.  Please let me know if you have any 
comments or questions regarding the attached.



Ted Stockbridge has forward to us a revised draft of the Exclusivity 
Agreement with our collective comments.  We should be able to send that to 
you tomorrow after Andy has reviewed that markup.  I believe Chris or Anthony 
have discussed our remaining comments to the equity documents with Richard.

Andy, do we have any intention of doing any integration with Tradespark at 
this time?  If we do I will get more involved in this otherwise we will just 
let the infrastructure team continue to run with this.

I need to have another discussion about this with you . . . we need an 
application group to work on this, because there is quite a bit of 
application analysis that needs to be done.

I found out that from an infrastructure perspective, this is much more than 
just a remote connection.  It involves an application implemented in our 
environment, and applications deployed to the desktop.  Is this something the 
e-commerce team needs to be involved in (I don't think it is), but probably 
more like Beth Perlman's team.

Correction to previous e-mail:
 The equipment we would send to Enron would comprise of 2 Cisco 2600
Routers (1 for each circuit), 2 Cisco Hubs, 2 Sun Ultra 5s with 2 NIC cards
each. Each Sun would connect to its own hub and router for redundancy and
load balancing purposes.
Sorry for the confusion.

Jonathan's response and my draft response for comment.  Notice he doesn't even mention the fact he included posting!!!

Jonathan,

As stated in my previous message.  The letter and your email confirm that Enron and eSpeed are not close to any agreement.  The time required to further pursue this negotiation clearly outweighs any upside potential for Enron.

Louise,

Please allow me to clarify a few points before you discount our proposal out
of hand.

In your proposal dated Feb 9, you proposed a transaction which equated to
$10 million in value for Enron.  I have proposed $10 million of value
delivered as $2.5 million in upfront cash, $5 million in ""floor-value cash""
structured through a free option to Enron locking the floor value of the
stock at $5 million and $2.5 million in eSpeed class A common stock.  The
$7.5 million of cash would be invested as you described in 3 vertical
markets.  As I stated to you over the past month, the remaining $2.5 million
in stock would be subject to a 1 yr lock up.

The only part of the side letter agreement we did not discuss was the
commitment by Enron not to make commitments to competing verticals for a 18
month period which we feel is justified given that we are financing your
entr?e.  There are no other obligations in the letters outside of what we
discussed - only structural elements required to get the transaction
executed.

I would like the opportunity to discuss this with you in greater detail.
Both Fred and Howard are also available.

Regards-

Jonathan

Jonathan,

Thank you for your fax dated March 13, 2001 which incorporated the letter
from Fred Varacchi.  I have read the letter and had several discussions
with my colleagues in London and we conclude that we have no further wish
to pursue any discussions with eSpeed. The letter does not seem to
correspond to any of the discussions we have had to date. I simply do not
see any upside in pursuing discussions, bearing in mind that you received
from us a draft proposal  which you previously indicated was satisfactory
and then followed up with a letter that does not relate at all to the
proposal.

Peter,

For your information, Enron has responded to Espeed's letter dated March 14th stating that we have ""no further wish to pursue any discussions with Espeed"".
I suggest that we all fully commit our energies over the remainder of this month in pursuit of the DB/Reuters opportunity, as it represents from our perspective the only viable alternative for Emetra at this time.

  Tom

Louise,

Congrats on the new baby!  Babies are truly a miracle.  Best of luck with
it.  I hope you saw all the movies that you wanted prior to delivery,
because it will be years before you see the inside of a movie theatre.

I know you are on maternity leave, but if you happen to get this email,
please give me a call.  Unfortunately, we are headed down a path right now
that could get very messy between HoustonStreet and Enron.  I want to avoid
that if at all possible.  There has been a level of frustration in the
communication and cooperation between our teams.  If we could both sides to
cooperate and focus for a couple of days, I am confident we can iron out any
issues and be prepared to go live within a week.

We have a number of big players that are eagerly awaiting the launch of our
link because they want to trade with Enron in a neutral, third party
environment.  I also know for a fact that there are back office integration
opportunities that we can pursue together that would be difficult for Enron
to pursue alone.

Congratulations again on your new child.

Best regards,
Frank

Bob,
We have some good news regarding our client and testing that we uncovered
yesterday.

On Tuesday , during our testing with Enron we were unable to duplicate or
see some of the issues that John Applegate et al were describing and seeing
which concerned me.  We have been working very hard to try to see why this
was happening.

We uncovered 2 things:
1)  When a client application leaves the blue window open that indicates
that the bid or offer is not available, the client stops processing messages
which will cause the client to fall behind.  If this window is left open for
10 seconds, goes away for 2 seconds and is displayed again for 10 seconds,
the client will have fallen behind 18 seconds and took 25 seconds to catch
up.  This is a cumulative issue in that the more times this window is
displayed, the client is consistently falling farther and farther behind
which would explain why after 45 minutes of testing it took 5 minutes to
catch up and display all of the bid or offer not available warning and
confirmations.  We have addressed this problem and are currently testing it
into the evening to ensure that when this window is presented to the user,
the client continues to process updates without causing any backlog.
Included with this correction the label has been changed from ERROR to
WARNING, since this really isn't an error condition.

2)  The second item is related to inconsistent performance and numbers not
updating on the screen, but when the number is selected it updated to the
correct number.  After trying to recreate this problem on numerous machines,
we finally saw the scenario.  It is the result of an older version of the
software running on that machine.  This was verified by running the older
version of the software on multiple machines which resulted in inconsistent
performance and behavior from the client application.    To resolve this
issue, we are in the process of building a new release of the client
application that updates all of the version numbers on the software so that
a new cab download will be triggered which will automatically update all of
the required files on the Client.  This process will ensure that all of the
clients that we are using for testing have the latest version of the
software.  In order for the client to download and install the latest .cab
file, the user will require Administrative Privileges on the computer
installing the new software.

In Summary :
A) It appears that we were testing with different versions of the client
software.
B) We found a problem that resulted in the client falling behind.
C) We have corrected this problem and have been testing for the last several
hours.
D) We changed the wording of the Error Window to indicate a Warning.

Given this information we would like to schedule another test with you later
today, ensuring that we all have the latest software, so that we can all
feel confident that we have evaluated the correct version.

In our testing we have been hitting the software simulating enron updates
and continuous transaction attempts for 45 minutes to and hour with 8
clients.  The performance times between the transaction request and the fill
or fail message remained consistent across all of the clients at 3-5
seconds.

Please feel free to call me @ 603-766-8730 or John Applegate 713-590-5123..

John,

As a follow up to our conversations this week and the testing that has been done, I wanted to outline our view of the current status:

Testing/Performance:  To date Houston Street has not met the minimum technical standards that were outlined in our discussion on Monday.  As we explained, Houston Street must be able to handle a continuous price update standard of 20 - 30 updates per second and a peak price update standard of 100 - 200 updates per second.  During our testing yesterday we experienced fatal errors on several occasions when sending continuous price updates.  It appears that we are not receiving responses to our updates in a timely manner and therefore are timing out the connection to maintain the operational integrity of our system.  We estimate that each bundle of messages (20 - 40 updates per bundle) sent to Houston Street was taking around 3 seconds to process.  Given the test performance to date is not acceptable we do not believe the interfaces are ready to go live at this point.

Legal:  Enron has requested that Houston Street incorporate the EnronOnline short descriptions as product identifiers on the Houston Street site.  Enron has requested that Houston Street have each customer wishing to transact with Enron acknowledge that they are transacting under the same terms and conditions as they would transact under on EnronOnline.  Houston Street will warrant that no customer will transact with Enron without acknowledging such.  Houston Street will determine whether acknowledgement will occur on the web site or in the trading agreement or both.  Enron has forwarded its comments on the Houston Street Trading Agreement for review by Houston Street.

I will contact you later today to discuss what the next course of action is.  Thanks."

Linda:

FYI, I spoke with Bob Shults this afternoon.  We set up a meeting for Monday
morning, 9:00 EST.  Our objectives are to finalize a testing schedule for
the week, discuss the business questions we emailed Bob on Thursday, and
develop specific metrics to define when we are ready for ""go live"" from
Enron's standpoint.

The attached reflects the changes to paragraph 2 to clarify the $250,000 payment (I have included a marked version to show the change as well as a clean version).  Upon receipt of HoustonStreet's signature pages, I will send by fax and fedex our signature pages to the letter agreement and the Investor Rights Agreement.

Per the conversation between Andy and Frank, the paragraphs regarding the
issuance of the 763,305 shares at the time of the Interface Completion Date
have been removed.  Therefore, we are reverting back to the last draft of
the Letter Agreement, sent by Travis, on 3/28 and hereby attached.

I have accepted the changes and have attached a clean version of the
document.  This will be executed by Frank after the Board meeting and we
will fax a copy to you immediately thereafter.  Please be prepared to sign
the letter agreement at that time so that we can proceed with the wire
transfer of Series C monies.

Best Regards,

Derek Gamble

Gentlemen:

Per my voicemail to Doug Dunn and Derek Gamble, I am attaching a revised
letter agreement addressing the issuance of the volume-based shares.  It
was our understanding that these would be issued to us as well as the
warrant shares, but we discovered that it was not covered by the agreement.

This draft is marked against the draft circulated last night.   Please call
if you have any questions.

I just talked to Houston Street and they say they are ready to begin testing gas.  Linda indicated that she had sent passwords for their gas test site.  She did request that we notify her prior to logging in so that they can make sure the test environment is stable.

Bob,
It appears that we may have had some confusion around the completed
transactions that were recorded on Houston Street during our demonstration
on Tuesday, May 22nd.  Since we have been unable to verify the timeframes
used, we have extracted from our database all of the transactions that
occurred after 2:45 Central Time through 5:30 Central Time.  We used our
DealCapture Product which enables customers to extract their deals done from
our database.  We are also providing a detailed log containing all of the
transaction responses that we received from Enron that resulting in a FILLED
transaction.  By expanding this timeframe we have the following Trade
Confirmation Details which is confirmed by the FILLED Transaction log and
the DealCapture XML that was generated.

Just got off a call with Linda Bradley.  She advised everything is going good, they are still working their interface and working out the bugs when receiving our data and feeding it into their database.  She advised everything is going well, they were out part of last week because of the snow storm up there but they are back at it.  I advised her to contact me if there are any problems with our connections.
 
Also, to my understanding there is a conference call this afternoon, approx 2pm cst with the business people.

Bob:

It was nice talking to you today.  I wanted to pass along Derek's contact
information and vice versa.  Derek will be sending you our trading agreement
shortly, per your request.  Please note that the version we are using does
not differ materially from the version Enron reviewed during 4Q 2000.  Derek
Gamble is thoroughly familiar with our trading agreements and will be able
to answer any questions you may have for HoustonStreet.  Please do not
hesitate to contact me directly though, if I can be of any assistance.  As I
mentioned during our call, Enron is my top priority.

Best Regards,
John

Andy,

Another point to note is that 50% of the funding occurs at closing and 50%
after our link with EOL is up and running for 30 days, so all the funding is
not required at closing.  I understand Enron will probably not invest, but I
wanted to make sure you had all the info.

Andy,

As I mentioned during our call on Friday, HoustonStreet is doing a $4mm
round of debt financing with warrants allowing the holders to convert the
debt into equity at $.15 per share.  An additional approximately $8mm of
outstanding indebtedness is also being converted into the same security.
The following is the information you requested to analyze Enron's postion:

1.  Enron currently owns 8.16% of HoustonStreet;
2.  Enron will be granted three additional blocks of 254,400 shares each
based upon achieving agreed upon volume targets;
3.  Enron will receive an additional 10% of HoustonStreet (on a fully
diluted basis) if the link with HoustonStreet is exclusive after one year
from going live;
4.  If Enron does not participate in this round of financing, it would own
approximatley 2%.  The shares awarded for volume targets and exclusivity
(points 2 and 3 above) remain unchanged;
5.  Enron's pro rata share of the $4mm of new capital is $343k.  If Enron
invested $343k, it would own 4% after the financing; and
6.  Enron's pro rata share of the $12mm financing ($4mm of new capital and
$8mm of debt conversion) is approximately $1mm.  If Enron invested $1mm, it
would own 8.6% after the financing.

I hope this provides you with the information you need.  Please feel free to
contact me if you have any questions.  The closing for this round of
financing is scheduled for March 12, 2001.

Andy,

As we discussed at our last meeting, I attach for your review a proposal to
expand the link between EnronOnline and HoustonStreet on a global basis.  I
think the proposal makes a lot of sense when entering new global markets.
If you have time, I would like to discuss this proposal and our current
round of financing at HoustonStreet tomorrow afternoon.  Are you available
tomorrow afternoon to talk?  Any time is good with me.

Best regards,
Frank

Andy, 

Testing process began approx Feb 7th after the link was in:
They are able to login, get an weblogic session id, Request Prices, I have yet to see a Post Price request or Attempt Transaction.
Basically they are testing on receiving data back from us from their browser or their scripted programs.


One issue on going is making a connection to their server, which would cause an issue on Posting prices to their server.   We just received their server connection info (IP address, ports etc..) yesterday, thus we should be able to post prices to them once we complete our setup today.

 The product control group was very responsive with regards to answering business questions from Linda Bradley@Houstonstreet. 

If you need more detail let me know.  Hope this helps.

Andy,

As you might expect in this market environment, valuations are down
significantly from our last round.  I expect we'll be south of $50mm.  We've
slashed our expenses so we won't have to take as much $$ at such a low
valuation.  We only need $5mm to $10mm to get us through to the other side.
At these prices, I expect certain of our existing shareholders to step up.
Just as there was a disconnection between underlying fundamentals and
valuations in the first half of 2000, I feel like there is now a disconnect
on the downside.  Operationally, we're ahead of plan and looking at
profitablity in the third quarter, but most VCs are licking their wounds and
frozen.  They are a bunch of lemmings.  I won't have specific dilution
figures until we firm up the round.  Obviously, I want to sell as little of
the company as possible in this market.  I'll keep you posted.

I'm also working on a proposal on the global strategy I mentioned to you and
Louise in our meeting.  Will have something to share with you in early Feb.

Please keep all this confidential.  I'm headed to Europe later this
afternoon, but will be back on Wednesday if you want to talk.

Best regards,
Frank

Andy,

When we met a few weeks back you offered to put me in touch with someone
from your VC group to discuss potential investors in HoustonStreet.  This
round of financing seems to be firming up at a very attractive price for new
investors and I wanted to take you up on your offer.  I'd love to talk with
someone in your VC group about who they see in the market that is actually
taking positions at this time.  We may have room to fill in this round with
some new investors.  Someone's going to make a lot of money on
HoustonStreet.

I received a briefing Friday on our development efforts and things seem to
be on track.  We have brought in some unbelievable developers that are very
focused and enjoying this project immensely.  Please let me know if any
issues come up with development efforts from your end and I'll do the same.

Best regards,
Frank"

On May 22, 2001 HoustonStreet representatives (Frank Getman, John Wyman and David Cuadros) came to Enron to give us a demonstration of the gas interfaces.  HoustonStreet was allowed to load the required .cab files on the demonstration computers prior to the demonstration.  HoustonStreet provided us with a script to follow relative to the demonstration as well as a list of test and production mappings.  During the demonstration we experienced the following:

1 - 8 second delays between a price update on EnronOnline and a price update on HoustonStreet.  With just five products active we experienced a delay of up to 5 seconds.  Due to the delay in price updates, transaction attempts on the HoustonStreet platform resulted in a high percentage of failed transactions with Enron.
When we activated Product ID 16612 (US Gas Basis PEPL Jun-Oct01) the product showed up on EnronOnline but did not show up on HoustonStreet.  HoustonStreet provided us with a list of products which had been mapped in the test environment and this product was included on the list.  HoustonStreet indicated that they had verified the mapping of all the products on this list.  We reviewed the mapping of this product by Enron and confirmed that it was active and mapped.  Incorrect mapping of products has the potential of allowing transactions to occur with mismatched product types.
When we attempted to transact on Product ID 16600 (US Gas Basis NGI Chicago Jun-Oct01) we were unable to complete a transaction even when the bid and offer prices were not changing.  These transaction attempts should have resulted in successful transactions.  We also experience instances where the bid and/or offer price would disappear after a failed transaction attempt and not reappear even thought the price was still present on EnronOnline.  In many cases the price would disappear for up to 30 seconds or more.  Although we did not witness any incorrect transactions, general functionality failure may or may not result in incorrect transactions.  At a minimum this type of behavior would result in frustration on the part of the counterparty when a transaction attempt results in a failure with no subsequent price move or a disappearing price.
A review of the transactions we recorded versus the transactions indicated by HoustonStreet reveals some discrepancies.  In an email from John Wyman dated 5/23 (forwarded seperately), John Wyman indicated that they had cleaned their database just prior to 3:00 PM and gave us just the trade count beginning at 14:58 on 5/22.  Although there has not been a deal by deal reconciliation of the trades, we compared our total trade count beginning at 14:58.  If the deal counts do not match this would result in substantial financial exposure.  Below I have highlighted the HoustonStreet transactions by counterparty versus the EnronOnline transaction count:

			HSE	EOL

	Arizona		 12	 14
	Avista		 03	 03
	Adams		 17	 19
	BP		 57	 58
	
	Total		 89	 94
	
Based upon my review of the demonstration, I continue to believe there significant potential exposure associated with the HoustonStreet interfaces.

Bob,
Here are the details for the fills.  We actually cleaned out the database
just prior to 3:00 PM CST yesterday in preperation for the testing.  If you
could reconcile based ont he first deal datetime and count from their
forward that would be great.

Here are the details.

user		Fills

arizona		12
avista		3
adams		17
bptrader		57
Total		89

First fill datetime stamp to start counting from : 5-22-2001 14:58:31.440
CST.

If you could count forward from that point we should be in sync.

Thanks,  Give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks again for taking the time yesterday to go over the latest version of
the application.  Flight back was a bit long - got into Boston at 1 AM and
didn't get home til 2:30 AM...

Bob,
I just wanted to follow-up on mapping from yesterday.

Test ID mapping - Sevita was highlighting the products that potentially were
not mapping correctly.  Could you fax this sheet with the hilighting so we
can investigate further.  Also, we have gotton several updates on the
Production ID's for mapping purposes, but have not had any updates for the
Test ID since Jan/Feb timeframe.  We noticed that some of the products get
new id's each month and this may be a contributing factor to the mapping
since we don't have a recent update for test id's.

I am hopeful in that we may be able to move forward and again appreciate you
and your team taking the time to work with us yesterday during the
demonstration.

Please give me a call when you get a chance either at 603-766-8730 or on my
cell 603-591-9004.

Thanks again,

John Wyman

Andy,

I understand the demonstration of the system is scheduled for tomorrow
(Tues) afternoon at 2pm Central in your offices.  If you have a few minutes
to stop by and bang on the system that would be great.  We would love to get
another trader's perspective.

Pursuant to the HoustonStreet Price Posting Agreement and subsequent amendment, the companies have conducted extensive Interface testing.  The testing has been an iterative process over several weeks and has included both stress testing and unit testing.  The testing was conducted to ensure interface functionality and load performance.

On May 7 - 8, 2001 we tested with HoustonStreet to determine whether the Sponsor Interface Acceptance Criteria had been met.  Based upon the following results I do not believe that all the criteria have been met and recommend against putting the Interfaces into production.

1.  Although the Sponsor was able to accept continuous price updates we experienced a 1 - 8 second time variance between price updates on EnronOnline and price updates on HoustonStreet.   Testing periods of up to 1.5 hours were included in the testing.  Price updates during the testing ranged from 20 - 40 updates per second with peaks of approximately 60 updates per second.  The 1 - 8 second delay on the HoustonStreet website will result in a high percentage of failed transactions with Enron.

2.  No testing was done at 100 -200 updates per second.  

3. HoustonStreet was unable to do a three day uninterrupted period to allow for testing.  As a result of incidents seen in the testing on May 8, 2001, HoustonStreet was still making adjustments to software as evidenced by the May 11, 2001 email from John Whyman of HoustonStreet.  Without a three day ""quiet"" period we are unable to finish testing the functionality of the interfaces.  Until such time as the software and hardware are locked down, we cannot be assured that changes that are being made are not impacting the results of previous testing.  Essentially without a lock down period we could not be sure that any functionality would work when we went live.

4. HoustonStreet did provide an excel matrix for displaying the Enron product descriptions.  Enron requested that the matrix be prominently displayed on the Sponsor Platform.  We were unable to view the matrix on the Sponsor Platform.   If the matrix was not prominently displayed on the HoustonStreet website, customers transacting on HoustonStreet may actually buy or sell a product that is different than they thought.  The matrix was required to ensure that anyone transacting with Enron would know exactly what product they were dealing with based upon the EnronOnline short description.

5. Functionality testing could not be completed due to the inability to do a three-day uninterrupted test as required in number 3 above.  As long as changes to the software and hardware continued Enron can not be assured that changes would not impact system functionality.  We had planned to do a test of all functionality during the three-day quiet period.  Testing of system functionality that was conducted on May 7 - 8 revealed the following critical issues:

We saw incidents of incorrect Enron price updates posting on the Sponsor Platform.  One specific examples included a crossed market display with a bid price of $6.00+ and an offer price <$1.00
We experienced instances of both successful and failed transaction messaging that were delayed anywhere from 10 seconds to several minutes.
We experienced successful transactions with Enron with no corresponding responses back to the Sponsor Platform.
We experienced instances where price updates were causing products to appear and disappear.  HoustonStreet indicated that the issue was the result of incorrect mapping.

Given the functionality problems we witnessed, a disconnect between Enron and the customer as to what transactions have been entered into would occur.  This disconnect would result in substantial price exposure during the period that the trade is not confirmed.  In addition, given the timing of the confirmations (positive and negative) a customer might be confused as to which confirmation was associated with which transaction attempt.  This situation once again would result in exposure from price movements in the markets.  "

Andy,

Below is an email with the current status of our project.  As I mentioned in
my voicemail, we were surprised by the performance of the system on Tuesday.
When we tried to replicate Tuesday's test results, we realized that Enron's
test environment had been using an older version of the software.  As you
will also note below, we have used this time to make performance
improvements and change the ""Error"" message per your suggestion.  If you
have a chance, please take a look at the current version.  I think it
addresses the concerns your team had on Tuesday.

Please give me a call when you have a chance.

Best regards,
Frank

I like this plan.  Clearly it has organizational implications that will need to be addressed.  Specifically, as I understand it, DealBench goes away.  Most of the marketing folks can be directly deployed on marketing of EOL auctions, but we will have to find a home for some of the support staff.  Also, we will have to redeploy some of the IT staff.  Hopefully, we can find a way to do some of the integration/engineering effort of creating the EOL auctions engine in parallel with our other initiatives.  I'll begin discussing that with Mike when you give me the go-ahead.

I agree.

This is consistent with the e-mail I sent recently and our conversation on the way to Zydako. I assume Webb is for it?  If he is, then it is a strategic decision.

I assume it is also a prelude to daily auctions on structured derivatives and shaped products.

Thanks.

Greg and Philippe

Having listened to the DealBench presentation at our offsite and after discussing with Jay, I would like to propose the following with respect to DealBench and EnronOnline:

1). The most valuable pieces of business functionality DealBench has are the data rooms and auctions. The first might have some going concern value, but probably not much, as IntraLinks, the king, only generates $10MM in revs per year. The second, auctions, while of value will probably be given away by competitors to get other business.

2). The technology as a whole is not severable right now, and probably not ready for prime time. Thus the chances of getting a bid for it as IPR that is above the costs of doing a deal is minimal. We have some knowledge of this from our Offline experiences.


Recommendation:

EnronOnline's auction functionality is very thin. DealBench's has a lot of good business logic built into it. While the code might not be up to our standards, it would be of value to integrate it into the EnronOnline platform. This way we take advantage of the superior EnronOnline brand and not reinvent the wheel as far as business logic is concerned. There will be some development needed to integrate and rewrite the DealBench auctions piece to accommodate the single EnronOnline login, as well as change the look and feel to an EnronOnline one, but this should be well worth it. It is my STRONG belief that there is an untapped market for energy and commodity based auctions that EnronOnline should OWN. As a part of this move we should re-deploy DealBench's auction marketing force to attack this space, which furthers the general commercial goals of ENE, as opposed to something that now is fringe at best.

Thanks,
AZ

They see it anyway, why worry.  Its a speed issue and I don't think they will keep up with him - I think he doesn't fully see his interaction with NYMEX sometimes.

Great news on TrueQuote and Brokerclient.

Good luck with Frank.

Subject:	RE: ICE

Batten down the hatch's and get ready for young Scott's first experience with Tropical Storms ! Here comes Allison !

On another note we went live with TQ yesterday. Unbelievable huh...We did one trade with Tuscon Elec. the first day and today we did three, all with PG&E, who happen to own 40% of TQ. Pretty lame.

On a good note, we hit a record today with BrokerClient, 53 trades. 46 power and 7 gas, which is nicely diversifying.

Other interesting note: We launched Reuters on Monday and the NYMEX wants to put it up on one of their huge wallboards. They would buy a block of desktops to cover it. Bad news is that, John Arnold, my new boss in approx 25 days, with some justification thinks this is a bad idea. He will lose the ability to arb the floor against the OTC. My view is that this will go away anyway as eNymex and ICEX do the same thing. What are your thoughts ?

Hope all is well 

Andy

Andy,
 
Attached is the contract draft for NGPL, which I have forwarded to Dave Devine.
 
The contract was originally drafted by Mark Taylor and has been revised by Travis. 
 
I have also reviewed it.
 
Please let me know if you wish to make any comments on it. I informed Dave that the draft I sent him was still subject to internal ""departmental approval"" - so we can still make changes, if any are necessary (and I can't imagine they will not have any comments!)
 
Dave

Philippe, John Andrus tells me he has had some general discussions with you
in recent weeks.  John and I will be in Houston next week,
Wednesday-Thursday, and we would very much like to meet with you at your
convenience one those days to discuss some ideas we have to make it more
attractive for Caminus users to trade on Enron OnLine.  (We're not trying to
sell you anything !!)

If you could make some time available I think it would be worthwhile; hope
to hear back from you.

I can be reached most days in Manhattan at 212 515 3691."

Kenny -

I picked up your voice mail. Apologies if this is not timely as I've been
out this week.  So, you may have already gotten this same info and update
from Mike, but here goes.

I understand that you are really wanting a push to get this deal done asap.

Mike and I feel the same way as we still are very supportive of the deal
and recognize the impact on momentum that extended contract negotiations
can have.

I would like to manage your expectations on the timing, though.  As you
know, we visited with Enron legal for the first time on Monday, May 21.  At
the end of the meeting, Enron took the to-do to cycle edits based on our
commercial and business principle discussions.

We received the revised contract on Monday, June 4.  Realistically
speaking, the contract has been rewritten. We are hopeful that the business
and commercial terms that have been agreed upon are still in tact, but
regardless, the new document will take us some time to digest, reflect, and
comment.

Mike, Mark, and Brian are reviewing the contract in detail today and
tomorrow.  You and I should expect to receive their summary comments and
feedback early next week.

When I have gotten them, I will call to schedule review time with you as
well.

Thanks,

Peggy"

Peggy,
I ran into Andy this morning at Enron.  He told that we had the contract
and I said I would expect to review/discuss the changes as soon as Mike and
team had assessed it.  I didn't get the sense that it was a rewrite, but if
that's the case, so be it.  I need you to give me a date as I am travelling
all next week.  I don't want this to drag on.  I feel like we are losing
steam here and I know Bibi wants to close the deal by end of quarter (which
I guess is June)......Andy, what are y'alls expectations for getting this
wrapped up?

Just keeping you apprised of our progress.  As I mentioned in today's staff meeting, we are primed to call BofA.  

As described below, our proposed BofA contact works with Gary Hickerson.  Not sure if that's a problem or not; unless I hear from you, I'll go ahead and initiate contact tomorrow.

Best regards,

Mike

Andy,

I see two ways to do cross-commodity trading that would add value:

The first one is to do proprietary trading, trying to find opportunities among markets. Prices in one market may not reflect the proper relationship with other market.
Develop products for our customers that manage their total risk. But, in real life, many times the risk of a client is a risk of combination of different commodities that have their prices depending on one another. The solution for this problem would be a desk within Enron to trade dynamically positions with the other desks, replicating this risk.

Note that the second will depend on the first.

In terms of weather, we have been developing products that address the volume risk of commodities. Normally people are exposed to the product volume*price. So, we have been thinking solutions for volume risk with variable prices (what we call quantos). The solution of this product requires dynamic trading of the commodity and the weather as well. These products are close to my second bullet point.

Your example is what we call the gas product with a second trigger in weather. They are possible and very important for the market at this point. The good thing about this one is that the easiest way to achieve it will be implementing the first bullet point, the second bullet point comes as consequence.

Feel free to ask us questions about the weather piece and its interaction with commodities. If we do not know, it will be very interesting to research the answers.

Thanks,

Claudio

Claudio,

I am still in the process of setting up what we are going to look at and how, but it will very definitely be options focused. I think the three major drivers we will care about will be Gas, Power, and weather. I am particularly interested in the relationship of how gas and power prices react with weather. One trade I am interested in is gas daily options that knock-in based on an observed temperature for the particular delivery point. What are your views and what would you focus on if you were me ?

Thanks
Andy

Dave:

As you and I discussed, Jake and I are focusing on quickly contacting the key U.S. banks in the FX space to assess their interest in posting foreign exchange products on EnronOnline, similar to your earlier recent work with several Canadian banks.  The attached list describes the key US-based FX prospects we'll be contacting during the next several days.

We also will be contacting other financial institutions regarding other products, such as interest rate swaps, corporate bond trading, and other ideas.  However, I wanted to quickly get the FX groups of these banks up to speed in order to parallel the progress on the Canadian banks.

Please let me know if you have comments or questions.

Thanks,

Mike

This is to give you and Dave an update on what I am working on.

In essence, I am focusing all my efforts at this point on FX and leveraging from the work that Dave and his team have done.

My methodology is to contact the ""Top FX Banks"" prepared by Dave which he has not already contacted.

So with that in mind the focus in now on the following:

Deutsche Bank
HSBC
Bank of America
Warburg Dillion Read, 
Credit Suisse First Bost
Merill Lynch

In school books we study exactly your example from the bank.

But in our case, we are studying the HDD contract that pays financially in MMBtu (gas). So the tick size of the transaction would be MMBtu/DD rather than $/DD.

Claudio,

I agree with you. The first bullet point will be easier to implement. Generally I have found that there is sufficient divergence of opinions amongst wholesale players that you can get positions on that you want. 

My goal would be to fulfill the function of both bullet points. I think there are pockets of risk management of complex relationships around the firm, but no group dedicated to it. Clearly we will need quantitative rigor to serve those functions.

questions: I am familiar with Quantos from my banking days, where a USD interest rate option pays off in a non USD currency at a fixed exchange rate. What is the specific structure of the options you are looking at.

Regards,
Andy

Hi Savita,

Jennifer and I have been looking through the ICE volumes on physical gas and it looks like nearly  all of their really huge Nat Gas volumes are being done on firm, physical, CUSTOM trades. It's probably a good bet that these ""custom"" products are some sort of structured or one-off deals that are not available to the general trading public on their website, but are instead closed, large-scale transactions done between the various ICE entities as a means of pumping up their volumes.

I've gone through the attached spreadsheet and highlighted several examples of these ""custom"" deals and have spoken with Bob Shults to see if he has any contacts at ICE that might be able to shed light on exactly what these things are. He hasn't called anyone yet, however, and I've asked him not to until you and Andy have had a chance to go over this. 

Could be something, could be nothing...

  Following up from this afternoon's meeting, attached is a Word document that describes the specific mechanics for the tax refund that all will be receiving this year (as well as a description of why it is being made - it's a consequence of the tax rate reduction).  Also attached is a pdf file that sets forth the tax rate reduction schedule for the next 7 years - for several taxes in addition to the Federal Income tax (such as the Estate tax and AMT).  You can call me at x30938 with any questions.  SHD."

Hi, Andy,

I am very interested in the position you advertised. I have a PhD. in X-ray Crystallography, and an MBA in Finance. I have extensive experience in options analysis, and quite familiar with TAGG/ERMS. 
I have a strong financial and quantitative background as you can see from the attached resume.
I'd like to have an opportunity to use my financial and quantitative analysis skills.


Thanks!

Market Forces - Problems in cyberspace.

06/08/2001

When the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) announced last May it was
building an electronic trading platform, it said its eNymex trading system
would be up and running by the autumn. The aim was to steal some of the
thunder from the launch of the Big Oil-backed IntercontinentalExchange (ICE),
which was set to start up around the same time.

In the event, ICE launched on time last October and has since built up trading
volumes and attracted new participants. It has also won support for its offer
to buy London's International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), giving it more
firepower in the e-trading sector.
Nymex, meanwhile, continues to struggle, and has repeatedly pushed back its
launch date. More recently, the exchange's problems have been legal. It has
filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit against one of the partners that was
helping build the eNymex trading system, prompting some observers to speculate
that the electronic trading platform will suffer more delays.

A big piece of eNymex was being developed by GlobalView Software. The
Chicago-based firm was picked to build the software connection between the
trading engine, designed by start-up technology company Kiodex, and the web
page layout, developed by Fry Multimedia. Nymex said in a filing with the US
Securities and Exchange Commission that it terminated the relationship with
GlobalView because of performance issues under the contract. Shortly after
kicking GlobalView off the project, Nymex filed the suit in the New York State
Supreme Court. GlobalView is now preparing a countersuit in New York.

Although GlobalView was announced as an eNymex partner in March, the company
had begun work back in December. GlobalView chief executive Jon Olson says
that ""almost immediately there were issues."" He adds: ""Our view is they were
financial issues."" With GlobalView gone, Nymex is reviewing its options, which
include choosing another software provider.

Nymex has also dismissed consulting firm Accenture (formerly Andersen
Consulting), which had helped manage the New York exchange's transition to an
electronic trading platform from the early days. A Nymex spokeswoman says that
Accenture's work was complete. One observer, however, characterizes Nymex's
recent actions as cost-cutting moves.

Despite the setbacks, Nymex continues to say that testing of the system will
be complete this summer, with a full-scale rollout planned soon after. With
eNymex, none of the exchange's existing futures contracts will be switched to
the new platform. Instead, eNymex will focus on derivatives, new territory for
the New York exchange. Some smaller oil futures contracts will also be put
online. Nymex has fired early shots at the ICE/IPE duo, recently announcing
plans to launch a Brent futures contract that will compete with the IPE's
flagship product (EC May 4, p3).

Although Nymex's electronic trading system has yet to launch, the platform has
already been picked by US technology consultants Forrester Research as one of
the few energy e-trade winners. But one executive at a rival exchange wonders
how Forrester can say that eNymex will succeed when the system has yet to be
tested in the market.

Andy,

I note that Carl and Leonardo have been put into the Specialized Tech category. 

Do you know if this was intentional? At the last PRC, they were both on the commercial track and I don't think they have been advised of anything to the contrary.

E-Trading 'Veteran' EnronOnline Calmly Faces NewcomersEntering Market
and United ICE-IPE.

06/07/2001
The Oil Daily
(c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved.

In the world of energy e-trade, Enron is one of the veteran players, having
launched its EnronOnline commodity trading platform in November 1999 - and
having completed its one-millionth transaction on the trading system late last
month.

Trading activity on EnronOnline is driven in large part by the Houston-based
company's strength in the North American natural gas and power markets. But
Enron wants the market to know the company is much more than a gas, power, and
now bandwidth trader.
Last week, Enron added crude oil and refined product options to EnronOnline,
to go alongside the existing 52 products the company currently lists in the US
oil market. Larry Gagliardi, director of US crude and products trading for
Enron, says that new contracts are constantly being considered, based mostly
on recommendations from users of its trading platform.

In the US, Enron lists several types of primarily financial crude contracts on
EnronOnline. These include swaps that replicate New York Mercantile Exchange
futures contracts, jet differential swaps, and gasoline crack spreads. Enron
also has a physical West Texas Intermediate contract that is traded
around-the-clock.

The company posts a bid price and offer price for all of those contracts,
which means 104 US crude and product contracts are available on EnronOnline.
In US markets, about 5 million-6 million barrels of firm oil quotes are posted
daily on EnronOnline. The company electronically lists oil contracts through
2002, but the system can accommodate longer-term deals.

Outside the US, Gagliardi says that EnronOnline has been most successful in
European crude markets. ""Asia has been a little harder, technologically,"" he
says, noting that computer technology and internet connections are less
reliable there.

Enron's offerings in Europe include a swap for the differential between dated
Brent quotes and the front-month Brent futures contract on London's
International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), and swaps that mimic the IPE's Brent
and gas oil futures contracts. A range of contracts are offered in Asia,
including straightforward swaps for the Dubai and Tapis crude benchmarks, as
well as for regional gas oil, high-sulfur fuel oil, and kerosene.

When EnronOnline first launched, Gagliardi says, many brokers thought Enron
was committing suicide by posting hundreds of commodity prices online. But the
gamble has paid off. Enron's North American gas and power trading volumes, for
example, have exploded to nearly twice the size of volumes handled by its
nearest competitor, thanks to EnronOnline. Last year, Enron traders used the
trading platform to complete more than 3,000 trades per person, up from 672
per trader in 1999.

In recent months, Enron's trading activities have been overshadowed by other
developments - most notably the oil company-backed IntercontinentalExchange's
planned acquisition of the IPE.

Intercontinental, or ICE, is also making a push in Asian oil markets, having
just opened an office in Singapore. Far East derivatives offered on ICE
include Singapore gas oil, fuel oil, kerosene, and naphtha oil product swaps.
ICE also offers Dubai and Tapis crude oil swaps.

Despite being faced with new competition, Enron's Gagliardi says the company's
strategy hasn't changed. He bets that the liquidity and prices on EnronOnline
will go unmatched by others.

Enron's online trading system is different from most of its rivals. ICE, gas
and power exchange TradeSpark, and others bring together buyers and sellers to
trade anonymously online. On EnronOnline, Enron is a counterparty to every
deal done on its site.

Some traders have criticized Enron's trading platform, saying they prefer
doing deals on exchanges with hundreds of participants - not on an online
platform that they say is a sales channel for Enron.

Gagliardi admits that the exchange model sounds appealing, but says that, so
far, those exchanges have been unable to offer the same trading opportunities
available on EnronOnline.

""The reality of the situation is that no one wants to put out a number and
leave it firm,"" he says of other online commodity exchanges.

This is an article that appeared yesterday in Oil Daily based on an interview with Larry Gagliardi and one of Enron's PR guys. There is one major error in that it says that our physical WTI contract is 24/7 as opposed to the NYMEX swap.

Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Andy, that's very helpful.  I hope that as technology improves and the notion of ""web services"" becomes more widely accepted as a substitute for ""behind the firewall"" applications, the opportunity exists for Kiodex to serve the broader universe of customers.  But I agree that there should be lots of low-hanging fruit among the many users of derivatives for whom trading is not a core activity.

dealt with would ask after completing a deal ""can you tell us where we can 
get a cheap off-the-shelf system that we can use to manage these things ? "" 
The problem KioDex has is exactly what you describe: with companies that 
where trading of derivative products is core to their mission, the third 
party ASP model is an extremely difficult one to sell. There are all the 
obvious reasons: security, reliability, continuity etc... What Kiodex needs 
to focus on, in my opinion, is the intersection of customers who need the 
product but don't view the function as critical to their operation. 
For what it is worth.

This is an article that appeared yesterday in Oil Daily based on an interview with Larry Gagliardi and one of Enron's PR guys. There is one major error in that it says that our physical WTI contract is 24/7 as opposed to the NYMEX swap.

Enron Establishes Future Market For Memory Chips 
By Bob Sechler 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

Jun. 7, 2001 
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

AUSTIN, Texas -(Dow Jones)- Dynamic random access memory chips, known as DRAM, have long been viewed as the pork bellies of the computer industry, commodities whose prices swing widely based on supply and demand. Enron Corp. (ENE) is taking the analogy a step further by enabling DRAM manufacturers and consumers, such as computer companies, to engage in the same price hedging strategies deployed in industries that depend on traditional commodities. 

The company has launched a lot program to buy and sell DRAM chips based on forward contracts, and it says an average of 25,000 standard 128-megabit DRAM chips a week were traded through its system during the first quarter, the initial quarter for active trading. That's a small amount relative to the overall worldwide DRAM market, estimated at $32 billion last year, but it is a start. 

""The (DRAM) chip market is a boom-or-bust cycle, with prices very high or very low,"" said Kenneth Wang, director of Enron's global semiconductor group. ""It's the perfect market. And Enron has the credibility."" 

Enron, Houston, is no stranger to making markets. The company, once a stodgy natural gas pipeline operator, has evolved into a major commodity marketer and trader, dealing in everything from energy products to chemicals and Internet bandwidth capacity. 

Chip industry players and observers are intrigued by the DRAM effort, although many remain skeptical. Most point out that the potential for a DRAM futures market has been discussed for years with little to show for it. 

""All of the PC companies I know of would love to have an effective hedge"" against DRAM price swings, Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst Dan Niles said. 

Every computer contains at least one of the chips, and many contain multiple chips, making DRAM chips among the top component expenses for computer makers. Other products, such as automobiles and digital cameras, use the memory chips as well. 

At present, DRAM chips are sold through direct contracts with manufacturers, such as Micron Technology Inc. (MU) and Samsung Electronics Co. (Q.SSE), and through a spot market, where the price fluctuates daily. There is no independent exchange for DRAM futures that would allow manufacturers of the chips or their consumers to hedge against unexpected price swings. 

Challenges to forward trading in DRAM have proved daunting. DRAM isn't quite uniform, although it's considered the closest thing to a commodity in the computer industry. Many different configurations of the same basic chip exist, depending on the needs of the customer. 

DRAM prices have fallen over time - about 30% a year over the last 25 years as manufacturing costs have declined - despite short-term fluctuations. 

Memory chip prices have fallen steeply this year because of weak computer demand. Standard 128-megabit chips have been selling recently for about $2.40 on the spot market, off almost 50% since February. 

Technical innovation always has the potential to render existing DRAM varieties obsolete, which would open the door to additional risk for the holder of a forward buy contract. 

Nonetheless, some major industry players are watching Enron's effort closely. 

Officials at Compaq Computer Corp. (CPQ), a leading consumer of DRAM chips, think the effort has merit and could work. Compaq hasn't made any DRAM purchases through Enron yet but remains receptive to the idea. 

The trend of falling DRAM prices ""happens on a macro level, but there have been years when the price has increased 50% or 100%, and it happens in a very quick period of time,"" said Jack Baikie, Compaq's vice president of corporate procurement. ""It's not a predictable cost curve"" in the short-term. 

This year's declining prices likely would reverse quickly upon some signal that PC demand was rebounding, he said. A forward trading market ""could provide us the ability to anticipate market trends and do some no-risk, or minimal-risk, hedging,"" Baikie said. 

Baikie dismisses the notion that DRAM isn't a commodity. ""A memory chip is a memory chip,"" he said, with the only difference being how an individual consumer elects to configure and use it. 

Micron, one of the top DRAM manufacturers, also is receptive to the idea of a forward trading market. But Micron spokesman Kipp Bedard cautioned that the technical variations of DRAM, combined with continuing innovation, aren't insignificant issues and have proved to be a problem in past efforts. 

Enron is confident it has the expertise to package and make standard its forward contracts for DRAM in a way that renders the technical differences surmountable. Company officials point to Enron's pioneering effort in Internet bandwidth trading as an example of a market that also faced technical hurdles. 

But Enron officials acknowledge they're still demonstrating that their effort is viable and valuable. 

""We want people to first get used to it,"" said Wang, of Enron. ""It's a process of education."" He said he expects trading volume to increase when big companies use the market. 

Enron executives said that DRAM is the first of their efforts to establish forward markets for all types of computer components. Eventually, Enron plans to trade forward contracts for components such as liquid-crystal displays. 

""We'd like to hedge maybe 60% of a computer, if possible, in the long-term,"" Wang said. ""That's our plan.""

Scott,

Enron appreciates the time Sun has devoted to us over the recent weeks.  We have enjoyed meeting with your personnel and yourself to share with you some of Enron's needs and concerns.

We embrace the notion of standards-based development.  It holds the promise to allow us to focus development resources on delivering business functionality and not on developing middleware and containers or dealing with enterprise integration.  However, due to what we believe to be inherent deficiencies in the J2EE specification, we have gradually reduced our use of these technologies.  In fact, EnronOnline's most critical systems were developed outside of J2EE.  

The problem areas are performance and enterprise integration.  Specifically, the specification does not allow for sufficient tuning.  The result is that many of the ""features"" cause significant performance penalties, even when those features are not relevant to the application at hand.  Additionally, as B2B markets evolve, there is a greater need for integration between multiple platforms.  This need is not addressed at all.

It is our perception that the J2EE specification is influenced too heavily by vendor input.  We believe that large end-user customers should have an equal voice in the evolution of the specification.  Such input would be particularly valuable since vendor competition issues would not taint it.  We would welcome an opportunity to participate in such a committee."

FYI. The ClickPaper group in Industrial Markets asked my permission to be able to say, ""ClickPaper will be upgraded to operate via the EnronOnline platform.""  I have asked them to delete the reference to EnronOnline and simply claim that this is a new version with many enhancements and new features. 

While it may seem like their message gives a plug to EnronOnline, I think it will confuse the audience on what exactly is the relationship between ClickPaper and EnronOnline.  Also, we have little control over how Industrial Markets will promote ClickPaper and I don't want the market to think that any issues with ClickPaper somehow are a poor reflection on EnronOnline.

ChemConnect and Envera Announce Merger; Leading Online Marketplace for Chemicals and Plastics and Major Industry Consortium Join Forces, Heralds New B2B Era  
06/07/2001  Business Wire  

Offering the only complete e-commerce solution for buyers and sellers of chemicals and plastics worldwide, ChemConnect Inc. and Envera today announced they have merged. The agreement between ChemConnect, operator of the World Chemical Exchange, a dynamic online marketplace supported by strategic e-commerce services, and Envera, a leading global electronic network for chemical and petrochemical industry B2B supply chain transactions and services, is effective immediately. Dedicated solely to creating value for buyers and sellers of chemicals and plastics, the merged company offers increased efficiency, cost optimization, and improved collaboration with existing and new business partners across the entire supply chain, from prospecting to fulfillment and settlement.  

""ChemConnect is the leading online marketplace for chemicals and plastics. Envera offers unparalleled supply chain integration. Together, we create the first online Marketplace Plus that offers a flexible, modular approach to accommodate different stages of adoption,"" said John Robinson, ChemConnect CEO, who will now serve as CEO of the merged entity. ""Combining our complementary strengths and shared vision, we will have an unbeatable solution: A seamless connection to the entire workflow, from identifying new business partners to fulfillment. It's what our Members told us they want, and with this merger, we are making it all available.""  

ChemConnect and Envera will offer their Members unmatched, online global buying and selling opportunities, supported by end-to-end connectivity and collaboration--including sales, logistics, and financial services--across entire supply chains. With each company's proven B2B expertise in creating new efficiencies and improved bottom-lines for their members, the two companies together represent the first fully-integrated, full-service e-commerce solution, where buyers and sellers of chemicals and plastics can meet in an open, independent marketplace to find new business partners, negotiate purchases and sales, and complete order fulfillment through automated back-office business processes and system-to-system integration. Because both companies' solutions are ""ready-now,"" with low entry costs, chemicals and plastics buyers and sellers can immediately, and profitably, benefit from procurement, sales, and supply chain efficiencies.  

The companies will also continue their commitment to the Chemical Industry Data Exchange (CIDX) and the development of Chem eStandards(TM), the standards for the transfer of XML documents between Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, which enable global collaboration among many partners. Transactional efficiencies and cost optimization results as companies connect to trading partners through the World Chemical Exchange or through the Envera Network.  

""We have the solutions, the dedication, the experience, and the expertise to help our Members--and all those who will become our Members--to increase their sales and procurement efficiencies, from the start of the online negotiating processes to final product delivery,"" said Bob Mooney, Envera CEO and newly appointed member of ChemConnect's Board of Directors. ""This is now the only virtual one-stop solution for all buyers and sellers of chemicals and plastics in companies of all sizes, around the world.""

I am working with IT on the look and feel for Kiodex Lite reports on EnronOnline.  I think the reports should be named ""Kiodex Reports"" and branded with the Kiodex logo.  While EnronOnline is delivering the reports, I want our users to easily understand that EnronOnline is not processing the reports and any errors/issues would be Kiodex's responsibility.  Pls. let me know if you agree.

Hi

I've attached a couple of files summarizing our progress and current status on modeling the bid-ask spread.  The first summarizes characterization of the EOL Crude data and the second describes a bid-ask spread model based on options theory developed by Zimin (The figure from the paper is included separately).  I am now setting up an Excel spreadsheet to test this model with the EOL data.

Let me know when you would like to meet to review this.

Thanks, Bob Lee

Let's discuss Monday morning.

I am not sure where we are with Reuters so we need to figure that out as well.

Subject:	Sungard Update

Greg --

I just spoke with Bill Popp.  Major points are:

Sungard is impressed and wants to continue to move on the Offline opportunity.

Jim Ashton, CEO of the Trading and Risk Systems Group, would like to meet us.  He is in London now where he must stay until after Sungard's quarter end.  We can either meet with him now in London or wait until July when he travels to the U.S.

Sungard wants to do the deal for all markets, but would consider, if necessary, a deal where they have rights only in the Energy and Capital Markets.

Sungard will need help defining the market opportunity.  As we move forward, if we would allow it, they would like to talk jointly with a couple prospects, under NDA, to help guage interest and understand the commercial spiel.

The question for us is how aggressively do we want to move with Sungard given their royalties-only deal requirement.  Any thoughts?  Thanks.

-- Rex

Bill --

Thanks to you and the Sungard team for your time in Houston last Friday.  The EnronOnline opportunity appears to be a good fit with a number of Sungard's strengths.  I have spent some time debriefing the people on the Enron side, and we believe that it makes sense to continue to pursue our discussions.

We discussed the need for Enron Net Works to get to know Sungard's executive team and to better understand your technical and marketing approach.  I believe the best next step would be a meeting between the appropriate Sungard and Enron executives.  We are a flexible on the location.  Just let me know what date and place works best for the Sungard team.

Your team also expressed interest in learning more about other Enron systems efforts, including DealBench and mid/back office systems.  Let me know if you would like to set up separate meetings to focus on those areas.  

Thanks again for your interest.  We look forward to further discussions.  Best regards.

-- Rex

 	  	 Dear Andrew,

With time running out before Congress finishes business for the year, ranking member on the Senate Energy Committee Frank Murkowski (R-AK) is making a new attempt to pass energy legislation. On Tuesday, the Washington bureau will cover a news conference on Murkowski's plans to announce his new approach to move an energy bill this year. 

Also from Washington on Tuesday, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham is the guest speaker at Energy Daily's newsmaker breakfast. Abraham is expected to talk about the status of energy legislation in Congress. The Washington bureau will bring us coverage of the Abraham speech tomorrow. 

The Houston bureau will speak with Raymond James & Associates E&P Energy Team Vice President John Gerdes. Earnings for some companies are down compared to the third quarter last year, but Gerdes says production volumes seem to be in line with expectations. He'll discuss the third quarter during the noon ET newscast on Tuesday. 

PG&E and the California Natural Gas Producers Association are 
co-hosting an informational workshop on Northern California natural gas issues. ENL's Kym McNicholas will bring us an update on the workshop on Tuesday. Kym says the meeting will cover a number of topics including discussion of new proposed well connection protocols, a review of the proposed gathering line auction process and a review and discussion on PG&E's proposed plan of reorganization. We'll have all the details on the workshop from the West Coast bureau on Tuesday. 

Goldman Sachs Chairman of the Global Power Group 
Doug Kimmelman will speak with Kelsey Hubbard on Tuesday from 
New York. Kimmelman will discuss the state of the merchant energy business and what the recent economic slowdown will mean for current power projects. Log on during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast to catch Kimmelman. 

Finally from Boulder on Tuesday, E Source Director of Strategic & Marketing Issues John Egan will join us during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast. He'll discuss the E Source teleconference titled, ""Creating a Vibrant Retail Electricity Market."" 

Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. 

Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001

Andy:
 
It was a pleasure speaking with you earlier this morning.  Like I said, I just wanted to introduce myself and see who you might know that would have an interest in ice fishing.  Please feel free to contact me personally or you may also pass my information along to anyone that may have an interest.
 
My client holds a strong position in the Northeast.  They are looking to fill a Senior Gas Trading position.  They are fairly new to the gas world and seeks a professional with a solid understanding of the technical side of natural gas trading.  Somebody that is not afraid of taking ""responsible"" risks.  
 
Further information includes:  35,000 megawatts of generation, VAR limit of 25 million
 
The role in general would consist of approximately 35% Strategic Gas Hedging in the Northeast with the remaining balance Spec Trading.  This is a Senior Level position so my client is looking for experience as head of a desk.
 
If you have any questions or would like to talk further, please feel free to contact me via phone or email.
 
Thanks,

How's it going?  Any thoughts on the AGA number?  We think it is a bunch of BS although all the entries I saw on the Fundamentals Message Board about people selling storage gas give one pause.  HOw are things going on the flying front?  I took my brother-in-law up last night and thankfully managed two good landings.  MJ"

Hi Andy,

The following spreadsheets represent net generated positions on bullets and strips through the date indicated on the name of the spreadsheet.  I only looked back 90 days, so it won't include any of the strip trading (not a lot) done prior to July 25.  If you want me to have these included, let me know.

Thanks!

Andy,
UBS has given us a list of open due diligence items made by UBS' Market Risk Group.  We would like to have due diligence completed by this evening so that we might sign soon thereafter.

Below are the items for which you were identified as NetCo contact.  Please let me know the status of this information and send it to me as soon as possible.  If you need any assistance from me, do not hesitate to call.


3) Detailed explanation of funding assumptions which would include what 
levels the traders expected to receive funding from Treasury and how Treasury 
derived both overnight and term internal lending rates. - Andy Zipper

4) A detailed description of how volatility curves are currently being built. 
 Description should include what inputs are used, are outputs consistent with 
inputs, and are these curves independently verified by a internal control 
group. - Andy Zipper

Hi Andy.  Here's my suggestion (actually it was yours):

Product 1	Fin Power Swap		
	Web Visible	
	Offered Qty: 50
	Qty Increment: 5
	Min Qty: 5 (or whatever you want to use as a minimum)
Product 2	Fin Power Swap 
	Ghost Product - not web visible
	Offered Qty: 200
	Qty Increment: 1
	Min Qty: 1
	Base Link to Product 1 with Bid = 0, Offer = 0, Offset to Last trade of 0 with reset qty of 200
	NOT Auto-hedged to Product 1
Product 3	Fin Power Option 
	Auto-hedged to Product 2.

Here's what will happen:

Suppose the option is traded and to hedge it requires a qty of 15.  The actual hedge will be against Product 2.  Product 2 offered qty will reduce to 185.  Since Product 2 is not auto-hedged to Product 1, there will be no impact on the main swap.  The prices for Product 2 will always be exactly those of Product 1 since the bid and offer are 0.  

Note: Eventually, the offered qty for Product 2 will reduce below the amount needed for hedging a particular trade (for instance, if every trade required a hedge qty of 15, then after 13 trades, your remaining qty would be 5).  This is not a problem.  The hedging model for options allows for not enough volume being available on the swap.  The next trade would simply get fully hedged and pop the qty back up to 200.  Since it has an offset to last trade of 0, the bid and offer prices would still be those of Product 1.

Also Note:  We will have to make sure the power IT guys are prepared to get essentially the same swap (Product 1 and Product 2) under two different product ids.

Does this make sense?

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

On Wednesday morning we will be commencing the Due Diligence process with another counterparty.  Andy Zipper has agreed to lead their team through the process.

The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows:

It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Andy.  

9:00		Introduction			John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen
9:45		Financial Overview		Wes Colwell
10:30		Risk Overview			Buy / Port
11:00		Credit				Bradford
11:30		Back Office			Beck/Hall

1pm		Mid/Back Office Systems	Jay Webb
1:30pm		Infrastructure			Jenny Rub

Please make yourselves available - the meetings will probably take place on 32.

Tammie - please organize lunch and refreshments etc.

Assume Big Pig will bring 8 people.


Thanks

On Wednesday morning we will be commencing the Due Diligence process with another counterparty.  Andy Zipper has agreed to lead their team through the process.

The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows:

It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Andy.  

9:00		Introduction			John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen
9:45		Financial Overview		Wes Colwell
10:30		Risk Overview			Buy / Port
11:00		Credit				Bradford
11:30		Back Office			Beck/Hall	
12:30		Systems (EnronOnline)		Jay Webb	
1pm		Mid/Back Office Systems	Jay Webb
1:30pm		Infrastructure			Jenny Rub
2:00pm		HR				Oxley
		
Please make yourselves available - the meetings will probably take place on 32.

Tammie - please organize lunch and refreshments etc.

Assume Big Pig will bring 8 people.


Thanks


Louise

Jay,

It was good to meet you today. As per our conversation in the hallway, Andy Zipper and I would like to get the ""Vega Limit"" for power options decimalized. Currently we can only take this value down to 1. We would like to have the ability to set this at .1 (point one). Thanks.

      <p>Dear Andrew,</p> 
<!-- This mail was sent to ""Andrew Zipper"" <andy.zipper@enron.com>, who belongs to list

<!-- CONTENT START -->

<p>I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts.
<p>In Washington, we'll continue to examine the major energy issues
expected to arise during the New Year.  We'll take a look at <b>what
Congress will do with comprehensive energy and electricity
legislation</b>.  Our Washington bureau will also follow the <b>FERC</b>
and its <b>push for regional transmission organizations and wholesale
competition</b>.   These are some of the issues we'll look at as 2002
begins.
<p>On Wednesday, energy consultant and <b>former Assistant Secretary of
Energy during the Clinton Administration Robert Gee</b> will join us in
the Washington bureau.  He'll give us his take on the <b>U.S.
relationship with OPEC</b> and we'll get his assessment on the <b>start
of retail competition in Texas</b>.  Gee will join us during the noon ET
newscast on Wednesday.
<p><b>The big switch is coming to Houston</b> - On Wednesday we'll bring
you a report on <b>deregulation starting in Texas on January 1</b>.  The
Houston bureau will have details on how the power grid reacted to the
switch, and get an update from retail electricity providers.  
<p>Also from Houston, <b>John S. Herold, Inc. CEO Arthur Smith</b> says
upcoming <b>earnings releases may hold some unwanted surprises</b>.
He'll join us from Houston on Wednesday to <b>discuss his company's
research report and what we can look forward to in 2002</b>.  Catch
these reports from the Houston bureau on Wednesday.

Hi Andy,

I'm not sure if Andy Lewis explained to you what we were working on with
Enron.  Basically, our team is responsible for creating a performance
simulation to replace Enron's Basic Risk Management course. Along with the
simulation, a Knowledge System (series of html pages) will be delivered to
each learner. This Knowledge System is a series of topics or ""chapters""
each consisting of content that will help the learner perform throughout
the simulation. Think of this as a encyclopedia, where the learner can go
to as a source of reference. Topics include, but are not limited to:
Hedging Basics, Risk Identification, Swaps, Options, Commodity
Fundamentals, and Accounting & Reporting.

I've attached the topic outline for Swaps and the practice exercises and
graphics section of the Knowledge System for you to review.
(See attached file: Framework Swaps_Final.doc)(See attached file: Swaps
Graphic ideas and practices_5.doc)

Sheri and I are responsible for this Knowledge System and would like your
help in the Swaps topic. Specifically, we would like you to help us with
practice exercises the learner will complete within the Swaps topic and
graphic ideas that will also support the content in this topic. In
addition, we are hoping you can provide us with some of the questions that
is outlined in the topic outline.(see above)

I will still like to meet with you this afternoon at 3:00pm, so let me know
what your schedule looks like.

Let me know if you have any questions, I can be reached at X5-6687.

Thanks,
Monica L. Brown

In anticipation of the imminent closing of the UBSW Energy transaction, please have all outstanding employee expenses in your possession filed through Enron's XMS system as soon as possible.   Note to approvers - please approve these expense reports quickly.   Enron will process and pay all pre-closing expenses.   After transaction closing,  payments  for expenses submitted before closing (and put into Enron's XMS system) will be sent to your last known address or direct deposited into your account.

Enron has committed to processing and paying any expenses incurred prior to transaction closing.   If not completed this week, pre-closing expenses should be submitted on a  hard copy expense report form which will be available at  www.enron.com. 
		
There will be a series of e-mails coming out over the next few days highlighting the Travel & Entertainment policies of UBSW Energy and the procedures for processing and payment.   

If you have any questions, please contact Hope Vargas (3-5280) or Georganne Hodges (3-0430).

      <p>Dear Andrew,</p> 
<!-- This mail was sent to ""Andrew Zipper"" <andy.zipper@enron.com>, who belongs to

<!-- CONTENT START -->
<p>We're going to make it through the winter - the <b>North American
Electric Reliability Council released its Winter Assessment</b> on
Tuesday, reporting that generating supply should <b>meet or exceed</b>
estimated energy consumption.  The Washington bureau will take a closer
look at the assessment on Wednesday.
<p>On Wednesday, <b>Interior Secretary Gale Norton</b> talks about the
upcoming <b>Lease Area 181 sale</b>.  Secretary Norton believes there's
still great interest in the sale despite the reduction in size of the
lease area.  The sale is scheduled to take place in New Orleans on
December 5.
<p>The <b>FERC announced sweeping changes on Tuesday</b> in how it looks
at the issue of market power.  The changes could have a big impact on
major power generators.  We'll have reaction from the Washington bureau
on Wednesday from <b><i>Megawatt Daily</i> Editor Michael Lustig and
Electric Power Supply Association President Lynne Church</b>.  Lustig
joins us during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast and Church is stopping by at
<br>10:00 a.m. ET.
<p>ENL's Kym McNicholas will also have reaction to Tuesday's <b>FERC
ruling</b>.  On Wednesday, she'll bring us comments from Mirant, the
California Department of Water Resources and the California ISO.  And
during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast, <b>Independent Energy Producers
Association State Policy Manager Katie Kaplan</b> will join us from the
West Coast bureau to give us her take on the FERC's actions.
<p><b>Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission Regional Manager
Leonard Spearman</b> is stopping by the Houston bureau on Wednesday.
He'll talk about the <b>TNRCC's role in strengthening homeland
security</b> at Texas petrochemical plants and refineries.  Catch the
Spearman interview during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow.
<p>The Houston bureau will also bring us a new twist in the search for
<b>alternatives to MTBE</b>.  <b>Chris Paschall of Industry Information
Resources</b> will talk about the possibility of making <b>ethanol out
of wine vines</b> - potential good news for California.  Join us from
Houston on Wednesday.
<p>Broadcasting Note: Reminder - since the markets are closed, we'll be
<b>dark on Thursday and Friday</b>.
<p>Wrap Note: We're <b>adding some of the day's commodity settles</b> to
the Wrap.  Here you go!
<p>Closing Prices for Nov. 20, 2001:
<p>Crude:		$19.15

Hi Andy,

Thank you for briefly meeting with me on November 15th to discuss the
questions we were looking for on the Swaps topic  for Crack Spread, BTU and
Spark Spread.

Per our conversation, you stated that you wanted to go away to work on
these practice questions for Crack Spread, BTU and Spark Spread.  As you
know, we were hoping to receive some of your questions this week.  Do you
have any idea when you will be able to send them to us or meet with us to
help drive these questions out.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Thanks,
Monica L. Brown

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter."

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, ""I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal.""

He added, ""My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."""

Rika,

 Davis-Besse will probably be using Framatome to perform the repair work on the head crack.  You will probably see wire reports that Framatome expects to be complete with the repair in about 60 days.  We, however, totally disagree with that assessment.  Framatome may be estimating based on total amount of work they have to do, but they are not incorporating any delays for regulatory review and approval.  I believe our July restart forecast is much more realistic.
 
 
Thanks,
Dan"

Andy,
     Here are some numbers.  For the options, we have used your vols, for swaps our system vols.  I was not able to work on the GD stuff because our system cannot get a VaR on those on-the-fly  (though it does calculate it).  We don't have access to UBS's models.  We will be using our model.  They use Historical Simulations which are not very appropriate for a lot of energy products.
In 1 and 2, these were ATM straddles (average price in 2 was 2.30).  

1) 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%.  VaR = $745
2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48% VaR = $16,356
3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46% Will provide later
4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap VaR = $73,863
5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap VaR = $409,559
6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap VaR = $135000
7). Same for Nov02/Mar03 Will provide later
8). Short 500,000mmbtu  Mar02 vs. long 80,000 mmbtu per month of Apr/Oct02 Will provide later

Lets discuss these when you have a look at it.
Naveen

Naveen,

I would like to see what VaR is thrown off by a series of trades. Can you run the following strategies throught he Var model and let me know what the results are.

1).  500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%

2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48%

3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46%

4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap

5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap

6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap

7). Same for Nov02/Mar03

8). Short 500,000mmbtu  Mar02 vs. long 80,000 mmbtu per month of Apr/Oct02

9). short 500,000 mmbtu of Feb Gas Daily swap and long 500,000 mmbtu Mar Nymex swap

10).short 500,000mmbtu of Feb gas daily straddle, and long 500,000 mmbtu of Mar NYMEX Straddle

If any of the foward prices or vols in the system differ from what I have given you use what is in the system. I would also be interested in what the UBS model spits out for these if available.

Any questions give me a call.

Thanks,
Andy

 	  	 Dear Andrew,

Some of the star witnesses in the Enron collapse will appear Thursday at a hearing on Capitol Hill. The question remains: Will they have anything to say? The witness list includes former Enron Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says Fastow is expected to invoke his constitutional privilege not to speak, but Skilling has indicated he'll talk. We'll have live reports covering the hearing from our Washington bureau on Thursday. 

Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge is expected to speak in front of the National Press Club on Thursday. We'll bring you all the details on Ridge's speech from the Washington bureau on Thursday. 

Tomorrow in Houston, the Ziff Energy Group is hosting the North American Gas Storage Conference. Plans for hundreds of new gas-fired power plants have been cancelled recently, resulting in record levels of gas in storage. The Houston bureau will bring us coverage of the Conference and we'll hear how company executives are dealing with too much gas in storage. 

Also from Houston on Thursday, Petrobras President Renato Bertani talks about problems his company is having with the development of offshore reserves in Brazil. He says Brazil doesn't have access to developing technologies that allow for deep-water exploration. 

Shell WindEnergy is acquiring the Llano Estacado Wind Ranch located near White Deer, Texas. During the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast, Industrial Information Resources Production Industry Power Manager Britt Burt will join us in Houston to discuss the acquisition of Shell's second wind farm. 

ENL's Kym McNicholas will have more from California Senator Joe Dunn, Chair of the Senate Committee investigating price manipulation in the state's wholesale energy market, regarding Enron's refusal to comply with a subpoena to attend a deposition Wednesday. Dunn will discuss the committee's next steps on Thursday. 

Also on Thursday, Raymond James & Associates Analyst Jon Cartwright will speak with Kym from St. Petersburg, Florida. At 3:00 p.m. ET, he'll discuss Calpine and the market reaction to news of an SEC request for information concerning selective disclosure. 

Closing Prices for Wednesday, Feb. 6, 2002	
 	 Crude:	 $19.78/bbl	 -$0.29	
 	 Unleaded:	 $0.5710/gallon	 -$0.0142

One of our Arkansas pilots died this week He had signed up in August of 2001 but had not flown a mission for us yet. Details on the memorial forthcoming. Below is correspondence regarding the crash. Be careful out there.

Beth, 

 According to news reports this morning Dr. Jim Arnold and his wife were
killed yesterday in the crash of their Cessna Conquest near Arkansas
City, KS, leaving two boys ages 5 and 7.
That will also effectively remove Stan Sence from the pilot list as he
flew Dr. Arnold's other airplane.

Don

Beth --
   Following is the FAA preliminary accident report on Dr. Arnold's 
crash. The report says he told air traffic control he had lost his 
autopilot. The loss of an autopilot alone surely would not have 
caused him a serious problem. It sounds to me like he experienced a 
failure of his attitude indicator and/or his directional gyro -- 
possibly his entire vacuum system, but that latter suspicion is just 
speculation on my part.
   The report suggests he had been assigned a block altitude between 
27,000 and 28,000 feet on an IFR flight plan enroute to Rifle, 
Colorado from Springdale. The weather at the nearest reporting 
station at 1:45 p.m. CST indicated freezing rain was falling beneath 
a 1300-foot overcast. Radar contact was lost 70 nautical miles 
southeast of Wichita at 2:10 p.m. CST.

I know flying into Aruba's airport, which is exposed to high winds,  the pilots sometimes line up like that and correct last minute. But this guy looked like a drunk driver. So happy I was not on that plane.

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be ""Double Deducted"" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

Andy,
     Here are some numbers.  For the options, we have used your vols, for swaps our system vols.  I was not able to work on the GD stuff because our system cannot get a VaR on those on-the-fly  (though it does calculate it).  We don't have access to UBS's models.  We will be using our model.  They use Historical Simulations which are not very appropriate for a lot of energy products.
In 1 and 2, these were ATM straddles (average price in 2 was 2.30).  

1) 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%.  VaR = $745
2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48% VaR = $16,356
3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46% Will provide later
4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap VaR = $73,863
5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap VaR = $409,559
6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap VaR = $135000
7). Same for Nov02/Mar03 Will provide later
8). Short 500,000mmbtu  Mar02 vs. long 80,000 mmbtu per month of Apr/Oct02 Will provide later

Lets discuss these when you have a look at it.
Naveen

Naveen,

I would like to see what VaR is thrown off by a series of trades. Can you run the following strategies throught he Var model and let me know what the results are.

1).  500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%

2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48%

3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46%

4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap

5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap

6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap

7). Same for Nov02/Mar03

8). Short 500,000mmbtu  Mar02 vs. long 80,000 mmbtu per month of Apr/Oct02

9). short 500,000 mmbtu of Feb Gas Daily swap and long 500,000 mmbtu Mar Nymex swap

10).short 500,000mmbtu of Feb gas daily straddle, and long 500,000 mmbtu of Mar NYMEX Straddle

If any of the foward prices or vols in the system differ from what I have given you use what is in the system. I would also be interested in what the UBS model spits out for these if available.

Any questions give me a call.

Thanks,
Andy

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge). "

Naveen,

I would like to see what VaR is thrown off by a series of trades. Can you run the following strategies throught he Var model and let me know what the results are.

1).  500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%

2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48%

3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46%

4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap

5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap

6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap

7). Same for Nov02/Mar03

8). Short 500,000mmbtu  Mar02 vs. long 80,000 mmbtu per month of Apr/Oct02

9). short 500,000 mmbtu of Feb Gas Daily swap and long 500,000 mmbtu Mar Nymex swap

10).short 500,000mmbtu of Feb gas daily straddle, and long 500,000 mmbtu of Mar NYMEX Straddle

If any of the foward prices or vols in the system differ from what I have given you use what is in the system. I would also be interested in what the UBS model spits out for these if available.

Any questions give me a call.

Thanks,
Andy

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Thanks for the note. This morning I signed my contract with UBS, so I am
here for another year. After that I will be wanting to move the family back
to the NYC area. If you hear of anyone interested in someone where my skills
would be a fit, let me know. Otherwise things are going okay and we hope to
start trading again by mid feb. Hope all is well with you and your family.
I'll let you know next time I am in NYC. Give me a call when you get a
chance and thanks again for the support. I hope you know I would do the same
for you.

Thanks for the note. This has been a very scary and tough time, but I'm
hoping something good can come from it. We are trying very hard to sell
the trading operation intact to several institutions. I'm sure you have
read about it. After the suffering you and all the other people who live
and work in the NYC financial district have gone through this year, this
pales in comparision. We're all hangin' tough.

Best wishes in this holiday season to and your family,

Joe Gold has kept you informed of our discussions with NYMEX.  Please see First Draft attached of our understanding of this meeting.  Joe Robertson of our New York office 001 212 715 5254 is fully aware of our ideas and has (as far as metals are concerned) good contacts at NYMEX.

We would suggest that you engage him as the metals futures specialist in your further discussions with NYMEX.

We have had some further telecon discussions with NYMEX and will modify this first draft and, of course, send you final copy we transmit to NYMEX.

Mike

I attach a letter of intent which I hope covers all the points we discussed this morning. On the basis that you asked for a memorandum of understanding the attached draft is fairly legalistic in tone. If you wanted something more informal let me know.

Paul - let me know if you have any comments.

Richard, Derrick and Alan:

I think we can all agree that Thursday's conference call was very constructive and promising.  In order to ensure that we work together in the most efficient and effective manner, let us make sure that our communication channels among the four groups (Enron Net Works, Enron Global Markets, GM IS&S and GM Worldwide Purchasing) is always inclusive.  I suggest the following contacts on all correspondence: 

ENW - John Allario (713-853-4587) 
EGM - Alan Engberg (713-853-5279)
IS&S - Mike Darrow  (313-665-5206)
WWP- Derrick Starosa (810-575-2221)

EGM and ENW have begun putting together the product and market description for each of the products specified at today's conference call.  John and Alan are coordinating that effort along with Enron's Fundamentals Group.  My understanding is WWP will likewise be ready to discuss its operational and product issues during the upcoming meeting in Detroit, tentatively scheduled for the week of June 11th.

The EGM/ ENW teams will provide a well researched product and market opinion of those petrochemicals initially deemed lacking sufficient market traction as well as those petrochemicals specified by WWP as potential Pilot Program participants.  Those potential Pilot Petchems were identified as: (1) Benzene, (2) Butadiene, (3) Cumene, (4) Ethylene, (5) Methanol, (6) PG Propylene, (7) Styrene, (8)Toluene.  Let's plan to determine the best day(s) to meet in Detroit by next Wednesday, June 6th.

Please advise me of any questions you may have or of any errors or omissions, which this email may contain.   I look forward to working together will all of you on this effort over the next two weeks.

Best regards,

-John

Hi Lydia,

Just to keep you in the loop, apparently Andy will not be in London for this meeting we spoke about yesterday.  We will however, be including him via video conference.  Due to the time difference we have moved the meeting till 5pm (London time) on the 8th June to accommodate Andy's participation.  Would you be able to book a VC room for him please, and advise which room he will be situated in.  The meeting will be 2 hours maximum in duration.

Many thanks
Suzanne"

Andy,

Just finished meeting with Nelson from gas fundies and Martin Lim from power fundies to discuss getting the Exotica libraries migrated ASAP. The best I can get from them is ""hopefully tomorrow"" as far as a date for migration. They are dealing with the validation of calculation routines between the UBS libraries and the Exotica libraries since Exotica will play a role in pnl calculation. I will follow up on this again tomorrow. I told them that ""hopefully tomorrow"" was not the answer I was looking for so I would help out in any way. They recognize that we need these libraries loaded on our machines regardless of their validation. Also, Nelson showed me a list of the products that are scheduled for 'day 1' and power options are not on that list. There are a lot of people working with that list to prioritize support so this is just a heads up for you. Later.

In short, the version of StackManagerServer you are using will no longer work after our next release.  The version you working with is about 9 months old.  There has been significant modifications to the interface, event model, and message types.  

Your version of SMServer cannot be used any longer.  We are still in the process of finishing development.  After we have completed it, we may be able to provide some assistance.  However, there will be little time for you to make modifications prior to our release.

Regards,
Michael

Well done on getting this far with ICE - uphill but worth it

Subject:	ICE

I met with Jeff Sprecher of the Intercontinental Exchange for almost an hour and a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on where they are heading.

1). We now have the complete API to them, but it is hooked up to their test environment. They will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect it to their production site. He assured me it will be the same contract that all the founders have to sign to get access to it. Esentially, if we trade or provide prices the API will be free; if we are voyeurs then we will have to pay for it.

2). He stated that charging commssion is not a denfensible business model. They will try to make their money through mid and back office services.

3). Their purchase of the IPE is directly related to implementing 2). his vision is to use the IPE infrastrucutre to make all derivative trades cleared and then use the FCM's to fulfill the back office movemment of funds tasks. In a nutshell he beleives the FCM's are all interconnected and used to moving money around for settlements and margins through the clearinghouse, so why not expand their role.

4). When I expressed some skepticism about 3). he asked if we would like to participate in a forum with other ICE members to discuss shared mid and back ofice services. I told him we would.

If anyone has any questions about this let me know.

According to the International Coal desk, the three brokers that have expressed interest are:

-	TFS
-	GFI
-	NatSource

Apparently the desk is not as enthusiastic about NatSource from their perspective, though they would be happy to see the other two getting access.

Let me know if I can further assist.

Andy,

This technically possible if we model this as a standard product.  To make it look like a realtime auction is also possible but will require some work.  It's something that would be interesting to have.

All,

Dale Neuner and Ross Mesquita referred me to you all.  I work with Global Strategic Sourcing and am looking to implement an ""online marketplace"" idea into Enron Online.  This would involve vendors and suppliers providing bids in a structured format - kind of like a reverse auction E-Bay.  Vendors would be able to see their competitors bids online, but not their names.  Any registered vendor would be able to update their numbers online, ""real time"".

First, we would like to know if anything like this is being done at Enron.  
Next, is it technologically possible to bring this concept into Enron Online?

Please advise.  We would like to do a test pilot as soon as possible with Crane Rentals.  Please give me a call so we can discuss this possibility,  
5-6528.

Thanks,
Shelley

I am talking to GFI for North America.  GFI originally called us concerning Europe but backed down and didnt want to pay. I will ask again if they want Europe. 

Natsource Europe is in contract discussions with us for Europe and UK Gas and Power.  They asked us to throw in coal and the coal group said no.  I have tried to get them to change their position as this will add liquidity.  Ask them why they do not want Natsource. They pay nothing for executions by Natsource. 

TFS has not been contacted concerning Europe.  Feel free to contact them and try to get a deal.  Call me to discuss.

According to the International Coal desk, the three brokers that have expressed interest are:

-	TFS
-	GFI
-	NatSource

Apparently the desk is not as enthusiastic about NatSource from their perspective, though they would be happy to see the other two getting access.

Let me know if I can further assist.

Thanks,

Savita

In our testing we have found the inability to manage our wing-strikes risk.  The way it works for power markets is that most traders would be unwillling to trade more than 250MW of a wing strike without widening out the bid offer.  Similarly the risk at some point can get high enough to suspend wing strikes. In the current option manager, the only possibility is to increase or decrease the ATM suite vol (which has little effect on the wing strikes anyway).


For that reason we need a volumetric control for each strike. The volumeteric control could be a toggle which could be turned on or off. If the volumetric control toggle si on, corresponding to each strike, there would be  a maximum volume.  If  the strike is hit or lifted by that volume, that strike is automatically suspended and the trader notified. This allows the individual strike risk to be limited.  This also allows us to put some less liquid markets out there - where the price discovery is evolving. In those products we can put the volume to be limited at 100 MW for each strike making the risk more manageable.

Pls give me a call, so that we can discuss this further.

In addition to the follow-up e-mail from the offsite, I want to explore the possibility that when you click the auction tab on EnronOnline you get DealBench functionality.  I know this was explored once before but I want to explore the possibility that we have a single backbone with EnronOnline and customers have a single login to Enron's services, including auctions, data rooms, and deal rooms.

Your thoughts?

John,

Thanks for the update. You're certainly hitting the pavement!

Let's get together regarding Koch and Tauber's confidentiality concerns. I think we should be able to give them some comfort in this regard.

Please advise Koch that they do not need to ""make markets"" on EnronOnline. Our proposal gives them the right, but not the obligation, to post prices and volumes on the bid and/or offer side of the products they choose within the list we agree on.

Dave

Andy & Dave

This is to update you on a few meetings I have had and update you on my activities.

Last week I met with:
Neste Petroelum - Their US Activities are not very applicable, but they are the Finnish National Oil Company and the trader I met with felt there may be some application with their physical European business.  They are a big producer of ""clean"" gasoline and diesel that goes into the EU.  He is going to supply an appropriate contact.

Martin Resources - This is a medium size private company and the result of this meeting beyond general market intelligence was a possible interest in showing one market for sulfuric acid, which is a market where they have a Gulf Coast franchise.  My contact who is one of the owners and he will revert after having interanl discussions

Enterprise - This meeting got postpones until this coming Friday due to a crisis they had.  I did spend a little time with Monty Wells (I think that was his names)  who is the SVP incharge of the NGL's.  I only presented the idea briefly for him tho think about.  My meeting on Friday is with Jim Teague, President & CEO of Enterprise NGL division.

Tauber - Tauber is a medium sized trading company with $1 Billion in Revenues.  they are active in Petrochemicals, NGL, Refined Products, and heavy oils.  There was an interest and Tauber is an active EOL user and fan.  My contact Scott Posednik runs the Petrochemical book and his biggest deal breaker was the security of the transaction information.  He indicated the 1% chance that one of the EOL people with access to their data could share that with the commercial groups is a concern.  He is going to discuss this with his colleagues and come back to us with their interest.  They do a lot of trading in physical Raffinates, Naphtha, etc.

Koch Hydrocarbons - This meeting was well timed as they are actively looking at their e-commerce startegy.  I met with Mark Dobbins SVP -Trading and Ron Baker who runs their Olephins and NGL books.  Their biggest hurdle is going to be getting comfortable making markets.  Another issue will how the credit matrix works.  It appears if they did something that they might need something a little more sophistacated than the basic offering.  One final issue will be the reps and warranties made by Enron contractually as to the sharing of information with our business groups and the security of the data.  They have apparently had an ordeal negotiating their master agreements to transact on EnronOnline and are warry of Enron's contracts.   They are going to have some internal discussions and revert next week.

Shell Us Trading (SUSCO) - I had a very good conversation with Steven Murray and he was supposed to get back with me early this week about setting up a meeting.  The boundries have been established that our interest would be in their making markets for Oil, Petrochemicals, NGLs and Chemicals only.  Gas and Power are currently out of bounds.  

This week
I am Vancouver today and tommorrow attending a Wood products conference and I will be in Las Vegas on Thursday.  After thoroughly reviewing the pulp and paper industry I think that the only sectors that would easily fit into this model will be the waste paper and lumber. I have had and will have discussion with other producers, but they are still hung up on branding and their products not being commodities ect.  I am Vancouver and have several meetings together with the Rob Scheuer with lumber producers about showing offers.  In Las Vegas, there is a conference where Ray Bowen is the keynote speaker and there are several potential counterparties attending , including Waste Management.  My intent is not to spend too much time on Pulp and Paper and these two trips will allow me to quickly determine who the possible prospects are.

Leave me a message at x36413 if you have any questions or comments"

Hi Andy -

Very good to hear from you --

As of the 1st of the month, I am now working for Allegheny in New York, with
Barry Kostiner and Jake Goldberg (not the fitness guru of the same name).  I
called you at home but got your answering machine - send me your work number
to this address and I'll call you sometime during the day tomorrow if that's
convenient.

Alex

Heard you had ended up at Allegheny. In NYC or Hagerstown MD ?

Drop me a line, I want to discuss something with you.

Hope all is well.

It is not mandatory to complete this form in addition to what is in PEP. This was mean't to be used as a guide for those individuals who might need additional assistance in assessing their non exempt staff.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Andy,

Unfortunately, the only stick we have in this game is increasing the total number of subscriptions to a price point whereby NYMEX passes.

We may as well capitalize on this because:
We can't not sell them terminals (Access will be available if the floor traders want it--  IF THEY WANT IT, THEY WILL GET IT.)
The large spread traders already know where ENE is at
Our competitors have been playing the EnronOnline/ floor arbitrage game since day one (it was part on our success)

REUTERS ABILITIES:

1.	Reuters has the right to limit ""wall board"" availability; NYMEX has the right to buy terminals from Reuters
2.	Reuters will request ""consistency""; in regards to pricing, re-distribution, etc
3.	Do not have the capability of breaking up the data set

OPINION:

Sell it.  25K per month.  Unlimited enterprise license.

Scott McNealy at Sun asked us to send in an e-mail to him our issues with JavaSoft.  Mike took a shot at it and a draft is below.  It has not gone to him yet but we should get him something soon.

My comments are that the draft below is very accurate but is too long and detailed for a CEO and the last paragraph, thought factual, will change.

Can you please give me your comments so I can get back with Mike and Jay and finish something and send it to Scott?

Thanks.

------------------
Scott,

Enron appreciates the time Sun has devoted to us over the recent weeks.  We have enjoyed meeting with your personnel and yourself to share with you some of Enron's needs and concerns.

EnronOnline and Enron E-Commerce are required to deliver a unique set of capabilities.  Our application and organization must support the high velocity (soft real-time) trading behavior of a commodities market, the ever increasing number and complexity of business requirements, the increasing degree of integration between Enron and its trading partners, and the need to do all this as quickly as possible without sacrificing software quality.  Each item in itself is not unique, but the combination is.

We firmly believe that our only hope for success is to base our application upon a solid technology stack and development methodology.  Our view of the technology stack starts at the bottom with networking, server hardware and storage, operating systems, language, language-level specifications, tools, APIs, and containers, language-independent middleware, and enterprise-level specifications and APIs.  Through out this stack, we need the ability to tune each level to optimize it for the particular effort at hand.  For instance, applications which do not sustain significant load may wish to take advantage of feature rich language-level and enterprise-level APIs; these applications can live with the performance overhead of these APIs.  On the other hand, some applications, such as soft-real-time delivery of quotes over the internet, require the highest performance possible and we are willing to sacrifice the convenience of more feature rich and slower APIs.

As an application development manager, I embrace the notion of standards-based development.  It holds the promise to allow me to focus my development resources on delivering business functionality and not on developing middleware and containers or dealing with enterprise integration.  Unfortunately, there are significant deficiencies in the existing set of specifications from JavaSoft, W3C, OMG, and IBM/Microsoft.  None of the specs or APIs have any concept of performance.  None of the specs or APIs allow for tunability of features to increase performance.  Lastly, there is a significant gulf between language-level and enterprise-level specifications.  For instance, the J2EE technology suite does not at all address enterprise-level integration.  To be fair, IBM/Microsoft Web Services does not at all address language-level development.  

The fact of the matter is that because of all these deficiencies I have had to continually reduce my use of J2EE technologies.  In fact, Enron's most critical systems were developed outside of J2EE.  Only our least critical systems use J2EE.  In addition, my group spends at least 40% of its development time addressing enterprise-level integration.  As the biggest B-to-B site in the world, one can imagine the level of integration we are expected to provide.

My primary criticism with Sun is that they approach customers from the bottom of the technology stack working your way up.  Customers need someone to start at the top of the technology stack and explain why it then leads to the bottom.  For Sun, it appears to be all about selling hardware and operating systems.  Enron has moved past those times.  We need top-down solutions.

Solutions:
Create a separate, distinct, and equally influential body in JavaSoft including ONLY large end-user customers (Power Users).  A good first list would include Enron, Charles Schwab, GE, and E-Bay.
Create an initiative to focus on enterprise-level specifications with input primarily from the Power Users.  This should not be influenced by vendors.
Ensure all past and future Java specifications and APIs are geared around tunability and performance.
Rethink EJBs.

If you want to stop Microsoft from conquering the world, you have to do more than shouting to the heavens.  Perhaps, you concede the B-to-C, C-to-C, and E-to-E (employee to employer) markets for now.  There's some money there but not as much as there is in the B-to-B market.  (Besides, if you really want to win in those markets you need to come out with a desktop which has some useful software on it.)  My recommendation is to end-run Microsoft in the B-to-B market by coming out with enterprise-level specification which work and ensure that the Java-based implementation of those specifications are the best.  Then market share will follow.

As per our discussion today, I think it will be concluded that Reuters and NYMEX can do what they want, terminals or wallboard.  I am not sure if you want to talk to Whally first before you talk to Reuters.

If possible, I would give Whalley a day or two to talk to John and Lavo.

In the mean time, Mike can see, on an enterprise license for a year, how high they are willing to go.

Your thoughts?

I will also tell Philippe about this if you haven't already.

Also, Webb called me and I will see him tomorrow about planning around your departure.

I agree.

This is consistent with the e-mail I sent recently and our conversation on the way to Zydako. I assume Webb is for it?  If he is, then it is a strategic decision.

I assume it is also a prelude to daily auctions on structured derivatives and shaped products.

Thanks.

Subject:	Deal Bench and EnronOnline


Greg and Philippe

Having listened to the DealBench presentation at our offsite and after discussing with Jay, I would like to propose the following with respect to DealBench and EnronOnline:

1). The most valuable pieces of business functionality DealBench has are the data rooms and auctions. The first might have some going concern value, but probably not much, as IntraLinks, the king, only generates $10MM in revs per year. The second, auctions, while of value will probably be given away by competitors to get other business.

2). The technology as a whole is not severable right now, and probably not ready for prime time. Thus the chances of getting a bid for it as IPR that is above the costs of doing a deal is minimal. We have some knowledge of this from our Offline experiences.


Recommendation:

EnronOnline's auction functionality is very thin. DealBench's has a lot of good business logic built into it. While the code might not be up to our standards, it would be of value to integrate it into the EnronOnline platform. This way we take advantage of the superior EnronOnline brand and not reinvent the wheel as far as business logic is concerned. There will be some development needed to integrate and rewrite the DealBench auctions piece to accommodate the single EnronOnline login, as well as change the look and feel to an EnronOnline one, but this should be well worth it. It is my STRONG belief that there is an untapped market for energy and commodity based auctions that EnronOnline should OWN. As a part of this move we should re-deploy DealBench's auction marketing force to attack this space, which furthers the general commercial goals of ENE, as opposed to something that now is fringe at best.

Thanks,
AZ

Scott,

Enron appreciates the time Sun has devoted to us over the recent weeks.  We have enjoyed meeting with your personnel and yourself to share with you some of Enron's needs and concerns.

EnronOnline and Enron E-Commerce are required to deliver a unique set of capabilities.  Our application and organization must support the high velocity (soft real-time) trading behavior of a commodities market, the ever increasing number and complexity of business requirements, the increasing degree of integration between Enron and its trading partners, and the need to do all this as quickly as possible without sacrificing software quality.  Each item in itself is not unique, but the combination is.

We firmly believe that our only hope for success is to base our application upon a solid technology stack and development methodology.  Our view of the technology stack starts at the bottom with networking, server hardware and storage, operating systems, language, language-level specifications, tools, APIs, and containers, language-independent middleware, and enterprise-level specifications and APIs.  Through out this stack, we need the ability to tune each level to optimize it for the particular effort at hand.  For instance, applications which do not sustain significant load may wish to take advantage of feature rich language-level and enterprise-level APIs; these applications can live with the performance overhead of these APIs.  On the other hand, some applications, such as soft-real-time delivery of quotes over the internet, require the highest performance possible and we are willing to sacrifice the convenience of more feature rich and slower APIs.

As an application development manager, I embrace the notion of standards-based development.  It holds the promise to allow me to focus my development resources on delivering business functionality and not on developing middleware and containers or dealing with enterprise integration.  Unfortunately, there are significant deficiencies in the existing set of specifications from JavaSoft, W3C, OMG, and IBM/Microsoft.  None of the specs or APIs have any concept of performance.  None of the specs or APIs allow for tunability of features to increase performance.  Lastly, there is a significant gulf between language-level and enterprise-level specifications.  For instance, the J2EE technology suite does not at all address enterprise-level integration.  To be fair, IBM/Microsoft Web Services does not at all address language-level development.  

The fact of the matter is that because of all these deficiencies I have had to continually reduce my use of J2EE technologies.  In fact, Enron's most critical systems were developed outside of J2EE.  Only our least critical systems use J2EE.  In addition, my group spends at least 40% of its development time addressing enterprise-level integration.  As the biggest B-to-B site in the world, one can imagine the level of integration we are expected to provide.

My primary criticism with Sun is that they approach customers from the bottom of the technology stack working your way up.  Customers need someone to start at the top of the technology stack and explain why it then leads to the bottom.  For Sun, it appears to be all about selling hardware and operating systems.  Enron has moved past those times.  We need top-down solutions.

Create an initiative to focus on enterprise-level specifications with input primarily from the Power Users.  This should not be influenced by vendors.
Ensure all past and future Java specifications and APIs are geared around tunability and performance.
Rethink EJBs.

If you want to stop Microsoft from conquering the world, you have to do more than shouting to the heavens.  Perhaps, you concede the B-to-C, C-to-C, and E-to-E (employee to employer) markets for now.  There's some money there but not as much as there is in the B-to-B market.  (Besides, if you really want to win in those markets you need to come out with a desktop which has some useful software on it.)  My recommendation is to end-run Microsoft in the B-to-B market by coming out with enterprise-level specification which work and ensure that the Java-based implementation of those specifications are the best.  Then market share will follow.

Philippe, John Andrus tells me he has had some general discussions with you
in recent weeks.  John and I will be in Houston next week,
Wednesday-Thursday, and we would very much like to meet with you at your
convenience one those days to discuss some ideas we have to make it more
attractive for Caminus users to trade on Enron OnLine.  (We're not trying to
sell you anything !!)

If you could make some time available I think it would be worthwhile; hope
to hear back from you.

I can be reached most days in Manhattan at 212 515 3691."

We would close into escrow in early March, but would have to close out of escrow by March 31 to get p/l in the 1st quarter.  In other words, the stock goes into escrow on March 7, but we have to deliver the consideration and have the shares delivered to us by March 31 to get p/l in the first quarter.

The most current drafts of the Stockholders' Agreement, Common Stock Purchase Agreement and Warrant Agreement are attached.

Drew, these are cumulative redlines against the versions that we last sent to Kiodex, so they reflect more than just the comments that you gave me earlier today.

We would like to get these out to Kiodex on Thursday.  Please let Drew or I know if you have any comments.

To summarize where we are on the accounting issues related to booking all of the income related to our 12.5% equity investment in Kiodex in Q1:

The 12.5% equity investment has to be a completely separate transaction from the co-marketing arrangement for which we are paid in warrants.

Kiodex cannot clawback or redeem any portion of the 12.5% if Enron walks the co-marketing agreement at any point in the five-year term.  It is ours to keep.

The 12.5% equity investment will be collapsed with the co-marketing deal (and therefore income can only be realized over the five-year term) if there isn't enough consideration for the 12.5% to make it look like a real deal.  Mike Patrick believes that we can get the desired accounting treatment for the 12.5% if we deliver promotional materials to our customers and EnronOnline ""statistics"" as consideration for the 12.5%.  We have not really spelled out exactly what this consideration is, but I have attached a draft stock purchase agreement in which we have attempted to do so in Section 5.11.

Kiodex wants to close this deal by March 7; we probably can't get the consideration in line by then, but we probably could by the end of the quarter.  Kiodex wasn't crazy about giving us the 12.5% for anything less than the 5-year marketing agreement, and wanted a clawback on the shares even then; they sure won't give us 12.5% for a promise to deliver the consideration by the end of March.  This means we will have to close the deal into escrow, and can get the shares when we deliver the consideration.

Here are the questions for the deal team:

1.	  What can we give to Kiodex before the end of Q1 that supports our 12.5% equity investment.  I can describe the promotional materials, but what ""statistics"" can we provide that will be valuable to Kiodex?  (Remember that Kiodex will have to feel like they are getting SOMETHING for the 12.5% equity they are giving us, because again, it will be ours to keep regardless of what happens to the co-marketing agreement).

2.	 Whatever we decide to give to Kiodex for the 12.5%, we will have to be able to deliver it IN FULL by the end of Q1; otherwise, we can't get our shares, and we can't book the income.

Here is the stock purchase agreement; I wam working on the language in Section 5.11, but it gives you an idea of what we think we might be able to do.

Andy:

I wanted to let you know where we were on incorporating your changes to the co-marketing agreement.  Drew, Ted and I have been through these, and they have all been addressed or incorporated except as set forth below.  Please give Drew or I a call if you have any questions; we will circulate a revised draft of the agreement when I receive it from Ted.

On your item #6, we deleted ""subdomains"" from the definition of Enron Web Site, but included successor sites if the successor site is Enron's primary electronic marketplace for the Specified Product.  We are making this agreement binding on Kiodex' successor, and Kiodex will certainly require that they have the benefit of this deal if Enron does something like changing it's name.  However, this definition wouldn't pick up any other Enron website unless it became the ""EnronOnline"" for the commodity that Kiodex was generating the report for.

On your item #7, the point that neither Enron nor Kiodex guarantees the accuracy or completeness of the data or reports will be addressed in a number of provisions, including limitations of liability provisions and agreements with Enron customers that will be entered into when they access the program (but that we have not yet drafted).

On your point #10 (regarding striking Kiodex right to use the Enron Market Data (the end of day mids) to generate indices, etc., we have deleted that, but we expect Kiodex to raise it again in negotiations. 

On your point #16, because of the other limits we have on the data we will provide and how Kiodex can use it, it really doesn't work against us to call it a worldwide license, so we left it alone for the time being.  Kiodex only has the right to run the Kiodex reports for Specified Products, which are NA gas and crude and refined products, and products that we subsequently agree to include.  A worldwide license gives Kiodex the right to run those reports from a server located anywhere in the world, but only on data from customers that trade those Specified Products -- it would not give Kiodex the right to data or to run reports for Enron customers worldwide, or for Enron products that are traded worldwide.  As a result, a German customer that trades NA gas could get a Kiodex report for NA gas, but a US customer couldn't get a report on SO2 allowances and a German customer couldn't get a report on a product traded out of London (unless we agreed to add those products).

On your second set of comments re: no ads for competing platforms, as we discussed, we have included a most favored nations clause that if Kiodex promotes Enron competitors on their site, they will give us comparable placement on their site.  This is what we gave to Kiodex if we promoted their competitors on our site -- comparable placement.

Re: non-payment by Kiodex customers, we are defining a Qualified Customer as one that accesses the Kiodex site through the Enron site, or one that finds out about the Kiodex site from Enron (and we have audit rights to determine if customers told Kiodex they heard about Kiodex from us), or Enron customers that send us the release form to allow us to electornically transmit data to Kiodex.  What level of revenue those customers generate for Kiodex or how long their relationship lasts does not affect whether or not they are a qualified customer.

On the term, this will be a big deal point that we should all discuss in some more detail.  We are leaving it as a five year deal for purposes of this draft for the following reasons.  First, it was always pitched to Kiodex as a five year deal, and just changing that in the document without some pretty substantial pre-discussion with Kiodex will really create some fireworks.  Second, since we are making such substantial changes in the deal anyway because of the accounting issue (trying to book all of the income on the equity investment in Q1) that we are probably going to have to go back to the table on a number of things, and might be able to work out a different term as part of the overall 
negotiations.  

As to our equity if Kiodex terminates the agreement, we are providing that we keep the entire 12.5% and the warrants vest 100% if we terminate the agreement because of what is effectively a Kiodex breach of the co-makreting agreement that would include Kiodex terminating the agreement without a specific right to do so, like an Enron breach).

Here is the revised co-marketing agreement (clean and redlined to reflect your comments as well as Drew's):

1). In recitals, should read EnronOnline will offer to its customers not Enron to its online customers. We have online customers for other systems i.e. DealBench, Commodity Logic, ClickPaper etc. etc.

2). Data format for Data feed will be XML. do not need to specify TCP.

3).""Enron Customer"" replace ""customer only"" with ""access the parts of the Enron Web site requiring a userid and password""

4).""Enron Data Feed""should read ""means the technology platform by and through ...."" . do not define platform.

5).""Enron Market Data"" shall mean the last recorded midpoint price, defined as the arithmetic average of the bid price and the offer price, at the time of transmission of the Enron Market Data. If the midpoint is not calculable due to either the bid price or the offer price not existing at the time of caluclation whatever price is available, either bid or offer, will be used

6)."" Enron Web Site"" no need for subdomains or sucessors.

7). ""Kodex Customer Agreement"" There needs to be some agreement or acknowledgement by customer when using Lite tool that neither Kiodex or Enron guarantees the accuracy or comlpletness of the data or reports.

8). ""Kiodex Oerational Failure"" for any period of 2 days

9). 2.1.(a) We will limit number of requests per unit of time, as deided at the sole discretion of Enron.

10). 2.2 (b) (iv) Strike this. This is the first I've heard of this.

11). We use language around security that Kiodex will use commercially reasonable efforts. Why isn't it that they guarantee security ? Or if that security is breached we can terminate the agreement. My concern revolves around the fact ""commerically reasonable for a struggling .com company might be less than what we consider acceptable.

12). 2.2 (c) Delete the second sentence.

13). 3.3 I would like the language to read that at a minimum they provision dual T1's, but that bandwidth but be sufficient to meet a level of service that Enron, in its reasonable judgement, finds acceptable.

14). 3.5 all subject to conforming with 3.1

15). 5.1 Real Time in this case means that as transactions happen on the Enron Platform they will be sent to the Kiodex platform. No guarantees on timeliness. It is our intent that this will happen consistent with transaction reporting on the Enron website.

16)5.1 (b). the license is not worldwide, just for us in North America.

This is as far as I have gotten. I will keep going and hopefully let you have rest of comments by Tuesday morning if not sooner.

On 4.2 (d) and 5.1 (d) I think the wording should go along the following lines:

"" Kiodex will guarantee that all Encrypted Enron Transaction Data will not be available to any party, including but not limited to the EnronOnline customer whose data has been encrypted, in any electronic or textual form. The only approved method for viewing of such Data is in its aggregate form as provided by Kiodex risk workbench products. The format of such reports requires the approval of Enron prior to their being made available to a Kiodex customer. The redistribution, retransmission etc etc of such data is expressly prohibited.""

The point here is that they can only use the data in Kiodex risk workbench products. while they can show a listing of transactions used for the aggregation of risk, the only way this data could get into someone other than Kiodex's system is by typing.

5.1 (e) Kiodex will guarantee security....

6.1 strike ""with familiarity with the Kiodex Lite Tool and the operation of""

6.2 No advertisements for competing platforms. We can furnish them with a list.

7.1 non-payment by a Kiodex customer post signing a Kiodex customer agreement does not alter status as qualified user and our warrant earn in.

8.1 5 years seems way too long. I was thinking more like 18 months ?? Jay, Drew ??

General point here: What are the consequences for our equity if Kiodex terminates ? We have been discussing this a lot but I have not heard where we are at on this. This, as Travis is well aware, effects our view of termination rights by them. 

8.3 (b) Shouldn't that be ""Kiodex shall have disabled.....""

8.3 (i) strike the word ""material"". In the words of Ted Stockbridge everything in this agreement is material or it wouldn't be in.

Andy -

We wanted to keep you in the loop on all of the Kiodex documents -- attached are copies of the Stockholders' Agreement, the Stock Purchase Agreement, and the Warrant Agreement that we are preparing to send out to Kiodex for their review (these incorporate our comments to Kiodex' drafts).  Our comments to these documents were consistent with the approach that we took in the HoustonStreet and TrueQuote deals.

This is actually the second round of comments that we are sending in -- this round of comments is to reflect the new structure that we needed to implement to get the desired accounting treatment, which we have already discussed with Kiodex.  Since it is just a follow up to comments we have already sent, we will probably go ahead and send them out to Kiodex, but there will be more than enough time to get any comments you may have in front of Kiodex as well.

Mike --

Per Drew's request, attached are the Stock Purchase Agreement, Warrant and Stockholder's Agreement for your review.  The final agreement, the Co-Marketing Agreement, will follow shortly.  As Drew may have mentioned, we would like to circulate these documents to Kiodex tonight, so it would be helpful to get your comments as soon as possible today.

Drew and I have spoken about his suggested changes to the co-marketing agre=
ement regarding the annual mail-out.  I understand the issue to be that ann=
ual mailout to the EnronOnline customer list that we are giving under the s=
tock purchase agreement needs to stand on its own as very valuable consider=
ation (and it is).  The annual mail-out previously referenced in the co-mar=
keting agreement is so similar to the initial mail-out in the stock purchas=
e agreement, that a conclusion could be reached that the annual PR campaign=
 is the real consideration for the 12.5% stock (i.e., that it really takes =
annual mailings by Enron before Kiodex gets any value out of Enron having d=
one the mailout to its customer list).   Drew indicated that other co-marke=
ting efforts would probably be OK, just not the same ones that we used to g=
et the 12.5%.  Based on this, I have prepared the following revision of Dre=
w's suggestion (since we don't know what that distribution will look like t=
oday, I believe we need the items in (i), (ii) and (iii) to limit our expos=
ure on this obligation.   =20




At least once during each twelve-month period during the term of this Agree=

Attached is a draft Co-Marketing Agreement for the Kiodex transaction for your review.  As the deal has changed a lot since Kiodex' first draft, the attached is a substantial rewrite prepared in a short amount of time.  We may not have caught everything, but we feel that this is a solid first draft that we are ready to send to Kiodex, subject to your review.

We would like to send this to Kiodex by the end of the day on Friday.  I know this is short notice, so I have prepared the following list of key issues that may speed your review of the draft.  Of course, we will advise Kiodex that any draft we send them remains subject to any additional comments that we may have.  Please contact me if you have any comments or questions regarding the attached.  

1).	Resources.  To what extent will EnronOnline be willing to commit personnel/time/resources to Kiodex to make this work?  Kiodex will probably ask for some commitment by Enron to assist it in addressing operational problems, etc.  Is our only obligation to build the data feed, or are we obligated to modify it/repair it/revise it for changes in the Kiodex or Enron websites?  See, for instance, Section 2.3 and Exhibit C that discuss our ""co-marketing"" obligations, and Section 3.2(a) is another provision under which Enron will be expected to devote some time and effort to the relationship.

2).	Noncompete/Maintaining EnronOnline Flexibility.  We assume that EnronOnline will want to maintain as much control over the EnronOnline website as possible and be subject to as few limitations as possible.   We assume that Kiodex will have virtually no say in what the Enron site looks like or contains as long as we continue to give the link to the Kiodex site the same level of ""prominence"" on the site.   See Section 2.4 (the ""non-compete""), 2.5, and 4.3, and Exhibit C.

3).	Control/influence over Kiodex site and Kiodex operations.  What degree of control does EnronOnline wish to have over the Kiodex website and the manner in which Kiodex operates?  For instance, do we want to ensure that Kiodex gives EnronOnline a comparable level of visibility on their site compared to that given to EnronOnline competitors?  Do we want to establish specified performance criteria or standards for the Kiodex website?  See Article 6 and Exhibit E.

4.)	Suspension/termination rights.  Under what circumstances should EnronOnline be permitted to suspend performance of or terminate the Marketing Agreement? Andy, we have incorporated a few provisions from the Posting Agreement that we thought had some application to this relationship, but there may be more.    See Article 8.

5).	Limitation of Liability/Indemnities.  We will have to be comfortable with the scope and extent of Enron's liability to Kiodex and to third parties (Enron customers); we are taking the position that Enron will have virtually no liability to its customers or Kiodex for mistakes in the Kiodex reports, etc., but this will also have to be covered in more detail in the agreements that we enter into with our customers that choose to use the Kiodex service.  See Section 11.   

You will note that Ted Stockbridge has also inserted notes and questions throughout the text of the document related to certain issues.  Please feel free to comment on any of these items as well.

Andy:

How are you?  I would like to thank you for hosting us in Houston a couple
of weeks ago.  The entire Kiodex team had a great time and felt very good
about what we accomplished on that trip.  On a personal note, I was very
excited about our conversation on all of the straight through processing
opportunities that we could pursue together, once this deal is closed.

I have since spoken to Jay, Drew and our counsel and understand that we are
in the homestretch of closing our deal.  This is great news.  I think there
is only one open issue (historical trade feed) and one other one that needs
further clarification (web site placement).  I would like to set up a brief
phone call with you so we can put these to bed.  I have some ideas to make
this a win-win for both of us.

Are you available in the next couple of days?

Cheers,

Raj

To all concerned:

Here is a revised EOL/Kiodex Co-Marketing Agreement updated to reflect the discussions that occurred with Kiodex last week and Andy Zipper's follow on comments.  I believe both EnronOnline and Kiodex have agreed to all of the key commercial and technical terms presented.  The Enron legal department expects to be able to use this document as a basis for the drafting of a formal Co-Marketing Agreement.

In addition, I intend to forward this document on to Kiodex this afternoon so please let me know if you have any final questions, comments, or additions.  Thank you.

Andy,

Thanks for the quick response to my Co-Marketing memo.  I do have two comments:

1) With regards to the historical data.  I understand that it is less work for Enron if Kiodex gets this data from their customers.  However, I think the rationale behind requesting it from EOL is the belief that many of our Tier II and III customers trade a significant percentage of their book on EOL.  Furthermore, Kiodex believes that these customers are likely to be less technologically sophisticated and may have difficulty transferring the data electronically themselves thereby necessitating cumbersome manual entry.  Finally, I don't understand how much work it would be for EOL given that it would be a one-time event for each customer to be done after hours.

2) I don't agree that the ""only relevant gauge [of customers] is number of executed contracts.""  I would argue that it is possible (maybe even probable if we don't facilitate the transfer of historical transaction data) for a customer to become exposed to Kiodex on EOL, become a paying customer of Kiodex, and decide not to have their trades forwarded on a real-time basis from EOL preferring to do this themselves.  If this were to occur, there would be no need for the customer to sign a contract with Enron and, as a result, we would not receive credit for that customer in our warrant calculations.

Neither of these points is particularly critical.  Furthermore, I do believe that Kiodex will agree to the terms outlined in the revised Co-Marketing document attached below, but I think there may be benefit to us to considering these points.  Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

Andy,

Here is my understanding of what was agreed to last Thursday and Friday with Kiodex.  You will notice that there a couple of Open Issues you are probably best able to respond to.  Before forwarding this document to Kiodex and using it as a basis for a formal legal Co-Marketing document, we may also want to consider one further review by Travis McCullough, Mark Taylor, Louise Kitchen, and Jay Webb.  Let me know your thoughts and comments.

Andy,

Here are the first drafts of the equity docs.  We (Enron) initially delayed providing comments to Kiodex until it became clear they were going to receive funding and that a commercial deal could be struck with EOL.  Since I believe we are well on our way to both of these things happening, I plan to meet with V&E and provide feedback to Kiodex shortly.

In addition to these documents, there will also have to be the following docs:
1) Co-Marketing Agreement
2) Warrant Agreement
3) Registration Rights Agreement
4) Employment Contract for Martin Chavez

Andy,

I will be sending a updated Co-Marketing Proposal reflecting some of the points discussed last week in a few minutes.  This document will be black-lined and include a few open issues I would like you to address.  If we need to have a conversation about this document or any other issues let me know and we can schedule some time with Jay Fitzgerald and anyone else you deem appropriate today.  I intend to forward this document to Kiodex and to Travis McCullough so we can generate a formal legal Co-Marketing Agreement this week.

In addition, I am meeting with Travis and our Accountants (Mike Patrick) this afternoon at 3:00pm to insure that we get the desired treatment for our investment.  Specifically, Louise is expecting us to be able to take approximately $4MM in earnings this quarter.  To accomplish this and not have the earnings occur over the next two quarters or longer, we will have to make sure the documents are very specific about what the consideration Enron is providing Kiodex in exchange for the 12.5% equity.

Furthermore, I will be meeting with Travis and V&E tomorrow to discuss the drafts of the equity documents (SPA and Stockholders' Agreement), prepared by Kiodex's lawyers (MoFo).  I expect to follow-up this conversation with a conference call with Kiodex and MoFo to discuss our comments on Wednesday at 11:30 CST.  I will send you copies of the first drafts of the equity docs today.  Please keep in mind these do not reflect any of our comments yet.

Let me know, if you would like to be part of any of these meetings.

Drew

To all concerned:

Here is the proposed EOL/Kiodex Co-Marketing agreement updated to reflect Louise Kitchen's, Mark Taylor's, and Jay Webb's comments from today.  I have made my best effort to represent the changes we discussed, as well as to add some additional detail and clarification.  I know we still need even greater detail in this document.  Specifically, I plan add diagrams of process flow as soon as possible.

My goal with this document all along was to use it as a basis for discussion with Kiodex so we could come to final agreement regarding the key commercial and technical issues surrounding the on-going EOL/Kiodex relationship.  This document was never intended to be a legal document or all-inclusive.  Specifically, I believe many of the legal disclaimers and rights of Enron to review and audit Kiodex's website and product will be significantly fleshed out in definitive agreements which continue to be drafted.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Thank you.

Please take a look at the attached agenda, I believe it represents what we discussed in our meeting today.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you have any question, additions, or deletions.  Furthermore, I am interested in opinions on the following points:

1) When should the EnronOnline commercial (?) and technical (Bob Hillier ?) contacts be identified and introduced?
2) What is appropriate and not appropriate for Dave Forster to cover in his EOL demo?
3) Who from EOL should/could attend dinner with Kiodex on Thursday night?

Thanks for your help.

As I mentioned to you last week, Kiodex is bringing a team to Houston this week to discuss a variety of commercial and technical issues.  They are available all day Thursday (2/1) and Friday (2/2).  Kiodex is hoping to make significant progress and come to an understanding regarding timing and next steps.  Please take a look at the attached agenda and let me know who should be involved in each discussion and when you think those meetings should be scheduled.  Thank you.

Gentlemen:

	Here is a revised draft of the Co-Marketing Agreement.  This is not
final and should not be released to Kiodex.  This is an internal draft for
our review.  We can send it along tomorrow, after Travis and I finish
addressing the open issues, which are:

	1.	How should we describe the Change of Control exception for
Warburg, in light of the term sheet that gives Warburg rights to future
financing.  Should we stick with the single transaction?

	2.	We need to confirm the response time in Section 6.6(d).
Kiodex wants to change 0.25 sec to 2 or 3 sec.

	3.	We need to confirm what information will be included in the
Enron Transaction Data, and which data Kiodex will have to extract or add.

	4.	I deleted the termination right in Section 8.3(k) on the
assumption that we are going to a concurrent closing.

	5.	I would like to confirm that the definition of the Kiodex
Application is okay.  I made that up, and no one has ever commented on it.

	There may be some other minor points, but I think that this is most
of it.

	Travis, I will call you tomorrow afternoon.

	Best regards,

	Ted

I would like to try to finalize this document today.  Please let me know if we need to meet to discuss, or if you just have some changes or additions you would like me to include.  Furthermore, Kiodex would like to come down this week to have some meetings to discuss various commercial and technical issues.  I hope to have a proposed agenda from Kiodex later today, but could you let me know your availability on Thursday and/or Friday, and who else may need to be involved from EOL.  Thanks.

I would be interested in any changes or additions prior to following up with Louise and ultimately Kiodex.  Maybe it would make sense to meet to discuss this afternoon, please let me know your availability.  Finally, Kiodex would like to send a team down next week (Thursday or Friday) to make introductions and begin a face-to-face dialogue on commercial and technical issues.  Please let me know who you think might need to be involved from the EOL side and their availability.  Thanks and sorry for the delay in preparing this document.

     Attached please find the revised draft of the Co-Marketing Agreement dated March  12th.  For your convenience, I have also attached two redlines:  one  showing the changes from our Feb. 22d draft; and the other showing changes from  the Kiodex draft dated March 6th.  I am not completely confident that the  latter redline is fully accurate and shows all of the changes from the  Kiodex draft, since we received only a comparite version of that document  and we had to remove the changes to prepare this  redline.
 
    I am sending these drafts to  Kiodex and its counsel at your request to expedite their review.  However,  please note that since Enron has not completed its review of these revised  documents, and therefore may have further changes or comments on the  drafts.
 
    If  anyone has any questions, please call me.

I want the termination provision to be included in this doc.  Let's put a date of April 13th in the draft we send to Kiodex.  I have a call in to learn about their expected close date, and in any case, we will learn from Warburg's where they are tomorrow.  I want to keep the heat on both of them to close so we can realize our value for this transaction.

Travis:

	Attached please find the revised Co-Marketing Agreement.  This
incorporates the changes that we discussed on Friday.  It does not, however,
include a provision whereby Enron could terminate the agreement if the
Warburg financing is not completed by April 30th.  You said that you wanted
to leave that out of this draft, but to reserve the issue in the transmittal
email.

The redline shows changes from my last draft (not the Kiodex redraft).  I
will try to prepare a redline showing changes from the Kiodex draft of March
6th, but I don't know if that will be possible given the state of Kiodex's
document.

	If you have any questions regarding the revised draft, please do not
hesitate to contact me.

Ted

Sorry for my late reply.  I have been travelling.

Not knowing the structure of your deal with ABB, I cannot tell you whether we might have an exclusivity issue or not.  What is the proposed structure of your deal, and what ties does it have with future Enron business or linkages?

A brief update and then a question.

We are still in discussion with ABB re. Energydesk but the timetable has slipped as a result of their major reorganization announcement in late January. I understand that you are anticipating an announcement  on Kiodex in early March. Are there any exclusivity provisions in your deal with Kiodex that would infringe on the proposed transaction with ABB?

Subject:	Re: EOL/Kiodex/energydesk.com(EDC)   

Thanks for the information.

You are aware that earlier discussions with ABB  were suspended when talks commenced with Kiodex re. energydesk.com( EDC).  We have recently resumed discussions with ABB and have had one meeting with them here earlier this month. There seems to be interest on their part in acquiring a majority stake in EDC for cash, and we anticipate due diligence to commence during the week of January 29th. If this happens and we can reach agreement on terms and conditions, including price, we might be able to close a transaction by the end of February. 

So far, we have made no commitments to ABB re. Enron's future use of EDC and do not anticipate doing so. My earlier query re. EOL and Kiodex came after I had a conversation with John Thompson, during which he mentioned your ongoing discussions with Kiodex. ABB knows that Enron had discussions with Kiodex re. EDC and I was concerned about ABB being spooked by an announcement of an association between EOL and Kiodex at a time when we are back courting ABB ( "" Is Enron saying that they consider the Kiodex system superior to EDC's while trying to sell EDC to ABB?"").

I will keep you advised about the ABB discussions here and would appreciate your doing likewise.

As many of you are aware, over the last few weeks the Kiodex transaction has 
changed such that it no longer includes the sale of EnergyDesk.   The new 
transaction structure is limited to the Kiodex/EOL Strategic Relationship and 
performance warrants.  Attached is the final version of the non-binding 
Kiodex LOI which was signed November 21, 2000.  Our goal is to finalize the 
documents and close by year end.  If anyone has any questions or comments 
please feel free to give me a call at the numbers listed below.  Thank you.

They are not active so far in our markets.  This will obviously give them a leg up.  The gas desk like the current deal with Prebon, so let's give this one a go too.

Has Simon / Andy Fairley updated you on our deal with Spectron?  If not please do so, chaps!

Richard,

Jack Cogen of Natsource is ready to buy BrokerClient from us for European Gas and Power for a $200,000 1yr license. We would really like to do this deal as they were the launch customer in the states and have done quite a bit of business on the system. Thor is already doing this with them for his products. Unless I hear back from you to the contrary I'm going to assume that this is alright with you. Let me know if there are issues.

Thanks,
Andy Zipper

Although the Master Service Agreement and the Project Services Agreement with Valtech do not expressly state that Valtech and its employees must keep the nature of their assignments confidential, the agreements do require Valtech to keep all ""information, data, documents and materials"" provided by Enron in absolute confidence and not to even disclose such information to its own employees except as necessary to perform Valtech's obligations under the agreements.    I think this language could be interpreted to cover the nature of the projects undertaken by Valtech, especially if we expressly tell the employees that the work they are performing for us is to be kept confidential and not to be disclosed to any Valtech employees except for those that have a need to know.  Call me if you would like to discuss.  Thanks.

Don't know if any of you can use this but under the theory that it is better to have too information rather than too little -- Here is list of companies in various industries sorted by SIC code.  This may help in generating prospect ideas for the various areas.

Many thanks to Marc Eichmann who put this worksheet together.

FYI...  here's the deck we reviewed with Cargill a few days ago.  As I mentioned, they had a lot of very good questions and expressions of interest during this hour-long call.  I believe these folks will be an excellent entree into Cargill's operating groups.

Best regards,

Here is a better list of the larger players in the NGL Markets.

Gentlemen

 

Attached is a fairly comprehensive list of companies in various sectors of the petroleum complex.  It is by no means comprehensive and I am sure there are several players that have been left out inadvertently.  I broke it down as follows:

Oil & Refined Products
Trading & Marketing Companies (Physical & Financial)
Financial Traders (Generally Financial only)
North American Refiners
Foreign Refiners w/ US Marketing Cos.
Asian Trading Houses
Convenience Store Operators (For rack marketing idea)
Crude Oil Producers (main business, not really into trading)
Oil Products Pipelines

Petchem, Chemical, and NGL
Gas Liquids Companies
Chemical & Petrochemical Companies
Industrial Gas Companies

Product List
List of products with perceived commodity products bolded

It is a bit difficult to put some companies into one bucket or another due to the cross over, but I tried.  I also should receive much better information tomorrow on the NGL companies that is more granular.  The list is intended to be a beginning and my intent was to begin eliminating companies to focus in on who are the dominant players in the major products in the various parts of the country.  Some players such as Global and Northville, for example are dominant in the Northeast, but not as much elsewhere.  Methanex, for example is the dominant Methanol producer/trader.  Enterprise is a big importer/storage owner in Mt. Belvieu so should be a good company to approach for the NGLs.  Once we refine the list a bit more, we will have a basis on who are the most likely candidates.

Let me know what you think, be forgiving of errors, and be mindful that this is a working document.  Before we start researching specific companies, let's whittle this list down considerably.

Could you guys please copy me on your lists as well?

Also, it would be helpful for the lists to show companies in order of priority - i.e. whom do you plan to be contacting first.

Thanks,

Dave

Per your request we have outlined our priority origination companies:

Pipelines: We have compiled a comprehensive list of pipelines and begun to develop a prioritization strategy.  Our original focus will be targeted at the most active capacity release and parking & loaning pipelines.  In addition we are targeting certain regional pipelines and low liquidity pipes looking for a boost to their transportation volumes. (We have included some pipelines in the list that have already been approached by D. Forster that we still consider good prospects; Dave will continue to work on these pipelines)

ANR (Forster talked to parent El Paso but not ANR directly)
CGT (Forster)
Columbia Gas Transmission
Dominion Transmission
Gulf South Pipeline (needs liquidity)
HPL (regional) - medium
Iroquois (regional) - medium
Kern River (Forster talked to Transco/Williams)
Lone Star (regional)
National Fuel (regional)
Northwest PL (Forster talked to Transco/Williams)
Oasis 
Oneok Transmission and Storage
Panhandle Easter (Forster)
Questar
Reliant - Arkla (needs liquidity)
Sabine Pipeline
SONAT (Forster talked to parent El Paso but ANR directly)
Trunkline (Forster)
Tennessee (Forster talked to parent El Paso but ANR directly)
Transco (Forster)
Vector (regional)
Valero
Viking (regional)

Gas Storage:  We have obtained a database of North American storage fields and are continuing define our priorities in the storage sector.  We should have this list in a couple of days.

Coal: A cursory review of the coal space and have identified a few opportunities.  We have listed below a few targets for the coal sector.  We will continue to look for additional opportunities in coal.  We have met with the coal group and they are open to allowing competing prices on EnronOnline.

Rail Cars: Burlington Northern, CSX, Union Pacific, Canadian National, Northfolk Southern
Pittsburgh Seam coal product - Allegany Energy Global Markets
International Coal - Billiton Marketing Ag - equity owner of Global Coal 
Petcoke product

Gas and Power:  Under review.

Bob,

As a first cut at the Storage facilities, you might want to list the companies which Paul recommended, adding according to size of facility as necessary to round out the list. You can always re-prioritize the list as you make calls and/or get more information.

I note the pipelines list is in alphabetical order. What does the order look like if you prioritize using the strategy you identified?

Will you guys be maintaining some kind of spreadsheet or other to track progress with each company?

How soon do you anticipate contacting the top 5 on each list?

Dave

Andy asked me to send you the missed launch dates for your conversation with Devin Wenig.

1st Launch Date Missed:		 April 30th

2nd Launch Date to be missed:		 May 14th

3rd proposed launch date:		 June 4th

Ultimately, I would like them to hit the May 14th target, however, if that is not possible, a May start date would be highly desired.

Also, please thank him for his assistance with Europe.  We are seeing a new responsiveness, however, an additional resource needs to be identified.

Thank you,

Mike Bridges"

We will only be able to get Kiodex the customers EOL trades as per the agreement. If the customer so desire they can ask us to send their non-EOl trades to Kiodex for processing, but that is outside the Kiodex/ENW agreement.

1). Hickerson does not have any products up yet. I need to find out from Bridges where we are with Cargill. He has been in meetings all morning, I will revert when I know.

2). To be honest I think we are nowhere with Dow, but I have left that to Berberian. I haven't heard a peep from anyone on this. I will find out.

3). I think it is 50/50 on GM. They clearly are interested, but are not very clear on what they are trying to accomplish. They do want to make markets. I think our best bet is an EOL product hosting deal, but their internal process will be excruciating. Next step is they will meet with alan Engberg to discuss listing 7 to 8 petchems on EOL.

4). I have not been moving forward on service level contract because I do not think it really adds any value at the present time.

5). I do think we should seriously consider the case for charging an access fee to EOL. This should not be viewed as a commission.

6). I spoke with Vin Viola of NYMEX and he is interested in pursuing this idea of clearer as credit sleeve for locals. He is tough to pin down and negotiate with but we will run this down by end of next week.

7). Re:kiodex, it is coming slowly as we have a lot of things on the development/testing schedule right now.

8). As you know we are in receipt of the ICE API. We have not been able to do much work on it given 7).

I did confirm that Dow is now an asset deal with no interest by Dow in ENW products.

I think we should look at what everyone else charges per commodity (i.e. ICE) and think about tsomething that is at least 50% of that. and it shuold be labelled an access or system maintenance fee.

A bit of good news: NGPL has confirmed that they would like to do a 2yr product hosting deal on EnronOnline.
$150K initial startup plus $100K per year and $25 per transaction. So total value not including per transaction is $350K. I think they get 5 products, but Forster knows the details. It's a start and the crew here is pretty pumped.

I'm trying to get a lieutenant of Viol'a to work with but it is hard. Patience.

Let's meet on Monday to talk about what we were going to do on Friday.

I am in the office picking up some Stro's tix. It sure is quiet for a Saturday...creepy.

Subject:	Conagra is our newest beta customer!

Last week, our sales team signed Conagra Foods, a Fortune 100 company, to a
beta license for the Risk Workbench.  Based in Omaha, ConAgra is North
America's largest foodservice supplier and the nation's second largest name
in retail foods (www.conagra.com).  In 2000, Conagra had revenues of over
$25 billion, making it 68th on the Fortune 1000 list.  Many of their
consumer brands are household names: Hunt's tomato products, Healthy Choice,
Louis Kemp, Libby's, Wesson, Country Pride, Blue Bonnet, Parkay, Reddi-wip,
Marie Callender's, Butterball, Chef Boyardee, Orville Redenbacher's, Peter
Pan, and Swiss Miss.
They currently have a large risk management and trading operation in Omaha
that hedges their exposure to energy and agricultural prices while engaging
in some speculative trading.  Kiodex will work directly with the principals
in this division as well as senior management as they adopt the Risk
Workbench for the purpose of conducting this mission critical function.
Conagra represents a tremendous opportunity for Kiodex to enroll a Fortune
100 company in becoming a high-profile reference account for us as we launch
on August 23rd.  Our focus, beginning on July 9th, will be on converting
this trophy client into a full paying customer (they are paying to
participate in the beta program) of the Risk Workbench.  I ask all of you to
help us realize this opportunity.
I would like to especially acknowledge Russ Chalom in our sales department
for his work on this account.  For the past 2 months, he has been
aggressively courting Conagra, performing demonstrations for senior
management, including the CEO.  His lucid delivery and cogent explanation of
the Risk Workbench value proposition created this opportunity for all of us.
Well done, Russ!

Regards,

Raj

Gentlemen:

	Here is a revised draft of the Co-Marketing Agreement.  This is not
final and should not be released to Kiodex.  This is an internal draft for
our review.  We can send it along tomorrow, after Travis and I finish
addressing the open issues, which are:

	1.	How should we describe the Change of Control exception for
Warburg, in light of the term sheet that gives Warburg rights to future
financing.  Should we stick with the single transaction?

	2.	We need to confirm the response time in Section 6.6(d).
Kiodex wants to change 0.25 sec to 2 or 3 sec.

Jorg,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, but you know how things are. I have tried to get someone in the NPC to talk to me but to no avail. I will keep trying but don't hold out much chance...

A big Mazel Tov on the engagement ! Married life is the way to go. 

I heard about Sonny. Oh well...i didn't really know him that well so i can't say if that was a loss or not.

I heard Alex is now with Allegheny Power, although I assume that is in NYC not Hagerstown, MD.

Take care and give me a call...(713) 853 6994

Gentlemen:

	Here is a revised draft of the Co-Marketing Agreement.  This is not
final and should not be released to Kiodex.  This is an internal draft for
our review.  We can send it along tomorrow, after Travis and I finish
addressing the open issues, which are:

	1.	How should we describe the Change of Control exception for
Warburg, in light of the term sheet that gives Warburg rights to future
financing.  Should we stick with the single transaction?

	2.	We need to confirm the response time in Section 6.6(d).
Kiodex wants to change 0.25 sec to 2 or 3 sec.

	3.	We need to confirm what information will be included in the
Enron Transaction Data, and which data Kiodex will have to extract or add.

	4.	I deleted the termination right in Section 8.3(k) on the
assumption that we are going to a concurrent closing.

	5.	I would like to confirm that the definition of the Kiodex
Application is okay.  I made that up, and no one has ever commented on it.

	There may be some other minor points, but I think that this is most
of it.

John,

We are sending our bid and offer prices to Reuters for most US Gas & Power products, as well as European Gas and Power, Crude and Refined products, Bandwidth, Coal, Emissions, Weather and Sea Freight.

We will receive 75% of all revenue Reuters collects from subscriptions to EnronOnline quotes. It is an evergreen 1 yr contract with mutual termination rights upon 90 days prior notice. We are under no obligations to provide levels of service.

Revenue expectations:

Reuters will charge, initially, $150/month/desktop. They have 5,000 Energy desktops worldwide.

thus with 100% penetration we would get 5,000 x 150 x 12 x .75= $6,750,000;

With a more realistic assumption of 50% penetration the yield to Enron would be $3,375,000 p.a.

This revenue does not include the incremental benefits, in our view, of branding and standardization of our product and liquidity in the marketplace. In the future I could see us adding a transactable API to the product through Reuters, which would enhance the ease of transaction by Reuters users.

If you have any more questions give me a call or drop me a line.

AZ

I met with Jeff Sprecher of the Intercontinental Exchange for almost an hour and a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on where they are heading.

1). We now have the complete API to them, but it is hooked up to their test environment. They will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect it to their production site. He assured me it will be the same contract that all the founders have to sign to get access to it. Esentially, if we trade or provide prices the API will be free; if we are voyeurs then we will have to pay for it.

2). He stated that charging commssion is not a denfensible business model. They will try to make their money through mid and back office services.

3). Their purchase of the IPE is directly related to implementing 2). his vision is to use the IPE infrastrucutre to make all derivative trades cleared and then use the FCM's to fulfill the back office movemment of funds tasks. In a nutshell he beleives the FCM's are all interconnected and used to moving money around for settlements and margins through the clearinghouse, so why not expand their role.

4). When I expressed some skepticism about 3). he asked if we would like to participate in a forum with other ICE members to discuss shared mid and back ofice services. I told him we would.

If anyone has any questions about this let me know.

Subject:	Value Proposition for Enron from TechSpan


Hi Andy

Hope you have had a chance to review our earlier details and hopefully it
would have given you further insights into our capabilities.

During the recent Board meeting with Goldman Sachs, our Enron strategy was
discussed and we indicated our correspondance with you. All of us are very
exited and working on ways of initiating the process. Moreover, due to the
strategic nature of partnership, our Management has also decided to invest
in developing this association.

I would discuss the proposition (from our Senior Management) during a
telecon and you could assess the feasibility.

Meanwhile, some areas that we are currently working with Goldman Sachs,
Nortel, Chevron, HP, etc are indicated below and we could replicate the same
with Enron:


1.	Module Development or enhancements to existing applications
      - Portal
      - Adaptor/Connector Development
      - Integrating online trading apps with Back End systems
      - Ariba customization/enhancements
      - Content Management
      - e-Procurement &  EBPP
      - other application specific integration

2.	Maintenance & enhancements (Could be done in India for cost saving
and round the clock operations)
3.	Re-engineering, Migration and porting for your existing applications

4.	QA

Andy, we are confident that this proposition of ours would be very
attractive and would go a long way in developing a strong association.

Could we discuss our business proposition this week ? I could call your
admin assistant tommorow (6/5) and fix up a suitable time for the call (10 -
15 Minutes Max.) We could follow this up with a technical meeting to
identify specific areas, should you feel comfortable with our proposition.

Looking forward to our discussions.

Thks, Arvind

Company)


Dear Andy

Thanks for your Mail. I sincerely hope you were able to get a high level
overview of our company. Further to my earlier mail, i am enclosing the
information which could provide further insight into our company. Pls
include them in your assessment process and give me a feedback if you
require any further clarification. We look forward to meeting you and your
team for an  presentation and the value we could bring to Enron. In the
presentation, we would cover our Methodology, Processes, Competencies,
Clients , Case Study & our economical/cost effective deployment processes.

Some synergies i perceive; Enron's initiative in ClickPaper could map well
based on our experience in Forest Express , EnronOnline could map into our
experience with RMX/Chevron or American Petroleum Exchange, Dealbench.com
maps well with our experience with eBreviate on the hosted ASP model for
eRFP,Auctions,Supplier Search. Moreoever, our development labs in India
could add great value for your module development, ongoing support,
maintenance, QA, Porting work; deploying a very low cost structure.

1.	TechSpan Details: I have enclosed the following -

	1.1 Company Overview (Management, Revenues, Growth, Locations,
Services, Competencies,  etc)
	1.2 TechSpan B2B Markets Expertise Brochure
	1.3 Case Study - e2Open , Traiana
	1.4 Projects with Ariba & MOAI

2.	Other Details which could be of interest

	2.1 TechSpan has been featured on IDC's analysis (Report No. 23918)

	"" IDC believes that TechSpan has done a good job of melding its
evolution as a services business to that of its 	partnerhips""

	2.2.  BEA's Partner brochure on its competency (attachment), wherein
TechSpan has been evaluated at par with KPMG & 	CSC. All our clients have
also realized the value in TechSpan and all have positioned us equivalent
(and higher in many 	cases)to any Big 5 Consulting firm.

	2.3.  INDIAN E-BIZ CONSULTING MARKET WORTH $136 M.: V&D

	TechSpan tops the Big Six list of e-biz consultants in India with
total business worth $67 million, followed by 	Planetasia and MindTree. The
study has identified pricing as the one big advantage enjoyed by Indian pure
play 	Internet Professional Services companies.

     	http://ciol.com/content/news/repts/101020511.asp?nl=ctd-mar5

	2.4  Inc. Magazine and Cisco Systems Name TechSpan, Inc., Finalist
at Growing with Technology Awards Ceremony

      http://www.techspan.com/news/prcisco.html

	2.5.  TechSpan Ranked on Sm@rtReseller's Smart 100 Companies List

      http://www.techspan.com/news/prsmartreseller.html


In summary, we are a young company (two years in operations) with high
ambitions and clearly articulated vision of being a leader in the e-commerce
consulting space. We have achieved major milestones in being a $ 67.0
Million company within 2 years, largely due to the confidence exhibited by
our customers and partners. Though the above are some achievements in the
past (giving you a base comfort factor on our long term stability), we are
keen in discussing what value we could bring to Enron, now and in the
future.

Thks,

Arvind

Stewart,

It is my strong belief that Kiodex will be most successful in marketing to Fortune 500 corporations. These companies have extremely large portfolios of derivative products to hedge various financial risks but do not view running a risk management system internally as core. I am interested in your thoughts, and how, if you agree, we can influence the company in this direction.

Batten down the hatch's and get ready for young Scott's first experience with Tropical Storms ! Here comes Allison !

On another note we went live with TQ yesterday. Unbelievable huh...We did one trade with Tuscon Elec. the first day and today we did three, all with PG&E, who happen to own 40% of TQ. Pretty lame.

On a good note, we hit a record today with BrokerClient, 53 trades. 46 power and 7 gas, which is nicely diversifying.

Other interesting note: We launched Reuters on Monday and the NYMEX wants to put it up on one of their huge wallboards. They would buy a block of desktops to cover it. Bad news is that, John Arnold, my new boss in approx 25 days, with some justification thinks this is a bad idea. He will lose the ability to arb the floor against the OTC. My view is that this will go away anyway as eNymex and ICEX do the same thing. What are your thoughts ?

Hope all is well 

Andy

Naveen,

I would like to see what VaR is thrown off by a series of trades. Can you run the following strategies throught he Var model and let me know what the results are.

1).  500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%

2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48%

3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46%

4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap

5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap

6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap

7). Same for Nov02/Mar03

8). Short 500,000mmbtu  Mar02 vs. long 80,000 mmbtu per month of Apr/Oct02

9). short 500,000 mmbtu of Feb Gas Daily swap and long 500,000 mmbtu Mar Nymex swap

10).short 500,000mmbtu of Feb gas daily straddle, and long 500,000 mmbtu of Mar NYMEX Straddle

If any of the foward prices or vols in the system differ from what I have given you use what is in the system. I would also be interested in what the UBS model spits out for these if available.

Any questions give me a call.

Thanks,

Claudio,

I am still in the process of setting up what we are going to look at and how, but it will very definitely be options focused. I think the three major drivers we will care about will be Gas, Power, and weather. I am particularly interested in the relationship of how gas and power prices react with weather. One trade I am interested in is gas daily options that knock-in based on an observed temperature for the particular delivery point. What are your views and what would you focus on if you were me ?

Thanks
Andy

John,
On the first note: OK, thanks.

On the second, I would like the senior person on each team (and they know who they are) to figure how to divvy up the tasks based upon their teams relative skills. You guys need to figure it out, with my help. Right now we are a little heavily staffed for what we are doing and I am trying to find ways to cope with that. This is one. Your cooperation is appreciated.

Thanks,
AZ

Andy,

Unfortunately, the only stick we have in this game is increasing the total number of subscriptions to a price point whereby NYMEX passes.

We may as well capitalize on this because:
We can't not sell them terminals (Access will be available if the floor traders want it--  IF THEY WANT IT, THEY WILL GET IT.)
The large spread traders already know where ENE is at
Our competitors have been playing the EnronOnline/ floor arbitrage game since day one (it was part on our success)

REUTERS ABILITIES:

1.	Reuters has the right to limit ""wall board"" availability; NYMEX has the right to buy terminals from Reuters
2.	Reuters will request ""consistency""; in regards to pricing, re-distribution, etc
3.	Do not have the capability of breaking up the data set

OPINION:

Sell it.  25K per month.  Unlimited enterprise license.

What is, exactly, the state of play here ? I nothing else happens, on Monday does the product go up on the wallboard ? Has Eddie quoted on px to the Merc ? I need to have my facts straight when this becomes a pissing match between Whalley ,Arnold and Lavorato.

Harry's comments. He has a valid point on the volumetric suspension issue....i think he will launch the product but ask us to put this in the development queue.

Savita

In our testing we have found the inability to manage our wing-strikes risk.  The way it works for power markets is that most traders would be unwillling to trade more than 250MW of a wing strike without widening out the bid offer.  Similarly the risk at some point can get high enough to suspend wing strikes. In the current option manager, the only possibility is to increase or decrease the ATM suite vol (which has little effect on the wing strikes anyway).


For that reason we need a volumetric control for each strike. The volumeteric control could be a toggle which could be turned on or off. If the volumetric control toggle si on, corresponding to each strike, there would be  a maximum volume.  If  the strike is hit or lifted by that volume, that strike is automatically suspended and the trader notified. This allows the individual strike risk to be limited.  This also allows us to put some less liquid markets out there - where the price discovery is evolving. In those products we can put the volume to be limited at 100 MW for each strike making the risk more manageable.

Pls give me a call, so that we can discuss this further.

Greg and Philippe

Having listened to the DealBench presentation at our offsite and after discussing with Jay, I would like to propose the following with respect to DealBench and EnronOnline:

1). The most valuable pieces of business functionality DealBench has are the data rooms and auctions. The first might have some going concern value, but probably not much, as IntraLinks, the king, only generates $10MM in revs per year. The second, auctions, while of value will probably be given away by competitors to get other business.

2). The technology as a whole is not severable right now, and probably not ready for prime time. Thus the chances of getting a bid for it as IPR that is above the costs of doing a deal is minimal. We have some knowledge of this from our Offline experiences.


Recommendation:

EnronOnline's auction functionality is very thin. DealBench's has a lot of good business logic built into it. While the code might not be up to our standards, it would be of value to integrate it into the EnronOnline platform. This way we take advantage of the superior EnronOnline brand and not reinvent the wheel as far as business logic is concerned. There will be some development needed to integrate and rewrite the DealBench auctions piece to accommodate the single EnronOnline login, as well as change the look and feel to an EnronOnline one, but this should be well worth it. It is my STRONG belief that there is an untapped market for energy and commodity based auctions that EnronOnline should OWN. As a part of this move we should re-deploy DealBench's auction marketing force to attack this space, which furthers the general commercial goals of ENE, as opposed to something that now is fringe at best.

Thanks,
AZ

Yes, but the other shoe is that we should shut down the rest of DealBench. If not, we will need to make large costly changes to the infrastructure to keep it going.

I agree.

This is consistent with the e-mail I sent recently and our conversation on the way to Zydako. I assume Webb is for it?  If he is, then it is a strategic decision.

I assume it is also a prelude to daily auctions on structured derivatives and shaped products.

Thanks.

Kenny, Peggy, Mike,

We would definitely like to get this finished by end of June. We can move as fast as you need us to. Ideally I would like both sides to get together early next to hash out any differences. How does this work for you guys ?

Thanks

Claudio,

I agree with you. The first bullet point will be easier to implement. Generally I have found that there is sufficient divergence of opinions amongst wholesale players that you can get positions on that you want. 

My goal would be to fulfill the function of both bullet points. I think there are pockets of risk management of complex relationships around the firm, but no group dedicated to it. Clearly we will need quantitative rigor to serve those functions.

questions: I am familiar with Quantos from my banking days, where a USD interest rate option pays off in a non USD currency at a fixed exchange rate. What is the specific structure of the options you are looking at.

Regards,
Andy

Hi Savita,

Jennifer and I have been looking through the ICE volumes on physical gas and it looks like nearly  all of their really huge Nat Gas volumes are being done on firm, physical, CUSTOM trades. It's probably a good bet that these ""custom"" products are some sort of structured or one-off deals that are not available to the general trading public on their website, but are instead closed, large-scale transactions done between the various ICE entities as a means of pumping up their volumes.

I've gone through the attached spreadsheet and highlighted several examples of these ""custom"" deals and have spoken with Bob Shults to see if he has any contacts at ICE that might be able to shed light on exactly what these things are. He hasn't called anyone yet, however, and I've asked him not to until you and Andy have had a chance to go over this. 

Could be something, could be nothing...

Torrey

""Enron Activity - ICE""

 

Note: Total activity for Dynegy Direct is not available, therefore Enron's Percentage can not be calculated.

Eddie,

Thanks for the note. This morning I signed my contract with UBS, so I am here for another year. After that I will be wanting to move the family back to the NYC area. If you hear of anyone interested in someone where my skills would be a fit, let me know. Otherwise things are going okay and we hope to start trading again by mid feb. Hope all is well with you and your family. I'll let you know next time I am in NYC. Give me a call when you get a chance and thanks again for the support. I hope you know I would do the same for you.

Stewart,

I base my opinion on 15 years trading and marketing risk management products to corporations. When I was at Bankers Trust, every corporation we dealt with would ask after completing a deal ""can you tell us where we can get a cheap off-the-shelf system that we can use to manage these things ? ""

The problem KioDex has is exactly what you describe: with companies that where trading of derivative products is core to their mission, the third party ASP model is an extremely difficult one to sell. There are all the obvious reasons: security, reliability, continuity etc... What Kiodex needs to focus on, in my opinion, is the intersection of customers who need the product but don't view the function as critical to their operation.

For what it is worth.


Andy

It was a pleasure speaking with you earlier this morning.  Like I said, I just wanted to introduce myself and see who you might know that would have an interest in ice fishing.  Please feel free to contact me personally or you may also pass my information along to anyone that may have an interest.
 
My client holds a strong position in the Northeast.  They are looking to fill a Senior Gas Trading position.  They are fairly new to the gas world and seeks a professional with a solid understanding of the technical side of natural gas trading.  Somebody that is not afraid of taking ""responsible"" risks.  
 
Further information includes:  35,000 megawatts of generation, VAR limit of 25 million
 
The role in general would consist of approximately 35% Strategic Gas Hedging in the Northeast with the remaining balance Spec Trading.  This is a Senior Level position so my client is looking for experience as head of a desk.
 
If you have any questions or would like to talk further, please feel free to contact me via phone or email.

I get a smattering of actual, I tool the family down to corpus to the beach two weekends ago, and half the flight was in and out of the clouds. Having a good auto-pilot and stormscope makes a diference, but stormscopes can be tricky to use unless you have a lot of exprience. The trick is never to put them on a setting of less than their maximum range or they never show you anything until it is too late. I have the stormscope feeding through the Garmin 530. Keep flying.

Jay that makes sense and is the right solution, however I floated it by Rob Benson and Dana Davis and they felt that having to have another product up on the ir screen would but just TOO much. Go figure. So they agreed to let me auto hedge to the base product and 5 min qty 5 increment works for me so we will run with that for the meantime. The non web visible route is my back up.

I'll let you know how it goes.

Thanks
Andy

Don't know about the AGA....Seems to be that we are having harder and harder tme as an industry getting it right.

I flew to little rock last weekend for a BPPP bonanza school and had a really cool instructor who was a retired colonel in USAF and F4 pilot. Lots of good stories. Beautiful weeknd for flying.
Saw Jack Hirsch but didn't ask him about his club's bonanza...

How is yor flying going ?

After some preliminary analysis, it does not look like our big counterparties i.e. Dynegy, Rliant, Duke, El Paso etc., are closing down their positions. On the contrary their net positions seem to be rising. This is only for NYMEX related financial instruments, I haven't looked at phys or power yet.

Just thought you would like to know.

Hi Andy,

The following spreadsheets represent net generated positions on bullets and strips through the date indicated on the name of the spreadsheet.  I only looked back 90 days, so it won't include any of the strip trading (not a lot) done prior to July 25.  If you want me to have these included, let me know.

Thanks!

I am attending the Bonanza Pilot Proficiency Program (BPPP) clinic at Adams Field in Little Rock. This is the big airport in Little Rock. The clinic will be run at Central Flying Service, phone number there is 800-888-5387. If you need to speak with someone from the clinic ask for Kathy Tatalovich who is the administrator. I will be staying at the Embassy Suites by the airport. I don't have the nuber now but I will call you with it. 

I'll call you from the road.

Love you and the kids mucho,

The Astro's are just plain awful in the post season. They hit hit hit in the regular tand then crawl into their holes in Sept. Look for Larry Dirker to be canned pretty quickly. Those Lion's look pretty sharp too.....

Take care,

Small issue but annoying:

If try to modify a plo by going to the line and getting the +/- box in the row with the order there is no way to change your mind and not modify without two error messages getting generated. i.e. if you decide to leave the price unchanged and hit ""set"" it generates the error messages, there is no other way to get out of the window though, no x box to close it.

Hope all is well otherwise,

Andy

Screaming Japanese Schoolgirls Overturn Greenspan's Bus
TOKYO- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan described himself as ""shaken but all right"" Monday following an incident in which several thousand excited young Japanese fans mobbed and tipped over his tour bus after a speech at the Tokyo Dome. ""Mr. Greenspan is at the height of his popularity in Japan right now,"" said Martine Engers, a publicist for the chairman, who is currently in the midst of a 41-city world tour. ""And I guess we simply weren't prepared for this level of fan hysteria."" Before military police restored order, thousands of frantically speculating youths drove the Nikkei average past 16,000.

Does Carol have a sister named Mimi, who is married to a guy named Steve Houston ? There is a guy I work with here who is this guy's (Houston) best friend, and the woman he is married to sounded like Carol's sister. I know it sounds complicated.....

The mechanics of the swap are as follows:  It is a normal swap at the reset swap price unless a particular reference month settles at or above the reset trigger. In that case that month and only that month's reference price resets to the new price as specified in ""resets to."" all other months remain unaffected until they settle and we go through the same process all over again.

Dave,

Mike mentioned that he was going to speaking to you in regards to the estate. Just wanted to let you know that I have a very high opinion of him. He is extremely sharp and is one of the more capable traders I've dealt with in non-trading commercial situations. When he worked for me at EnronOnline I always viewed him one of my best folks. Do what you will with this unsolicited opinion, but I thought it best if I let you know. 

Regards,
Andy "

I think it relates to Paul not getting the top job in their soon to be spun off unregulated unit. That job went to some guy named Shockley who Eric Vanderwald will report to. Their press release makes for fun reading.

In Germany, Berlin's minister for culture Adrienne Goehler called the World Trade Center twin 110-story towers destroyed by the hijackers ``phallic symbols.'' The comment brought calls for her resignation, but also an explanation from Goehler. 
``In the context of my statement that the 'attacks were aimed symbolically at the heart of America,' I also made the comment that the towers are ``phallic symbols,''' she said. ``It was an answer to the question 'What sort of symbolic images did it remind me of?'''"

Who did it?     Foreign Report presents an alternative view 

Israel's military intelligence service, Aman, suspects that Iraq is the 
state that sponsored the suicide attacks on the New York Trade Center and 
the Pentagon in Washington. Directing the mission, Aman officers believe, 
were two of the world's foremost terrorist masterminds: the Lebanese Imad 
Mughniyeh, head of the special overseas operations for Hizbullah, and the 
Egyptian Dr Ayman Al Zawahiri, senior member of Al-Qaeda and possible 
successor of the ailing Osama Bin Laden. 

The two men have not been seen for some time. Mughniyeh is probably the 
world's most wanted outlaw. Unconfirmed reports in Beirut say he has 
undergone plastic surgery and is unrecognisable. Zawahiri is thought to be 
based in Egypt. He could be Bin Laden's chief representative outside 
Afghanistan. 

The Iraqis, who for several years paid smaller groups to do their dirty 
work, were quick to discover the advantages of Al-Qaeda. The Israeli sources

claim that for the past two years Iraqi intelligence officers were shuttling

between Baghdad and Afghanistan, meeting with Ayman Al Zawahiri. According 
to the sources, one of the Iraqi intelligence officers, Salah Suleiman, was 
captured last October by the Pakistanis near the border with Afghanistan. 
The Iraqis are also reported to have established strong ties with Imad 
Mughniyeh. 

""We've only got scraps of information, not the full picture,"" admits one 
intelligence source, ""but it was good enough for us to send a warning six 
weeks ago to our allies that an unprecedented massive terror attack was 
expected. One of our indications suggested that Imad Mughniyeh met with some

of his dormant agents on secret trips to Germany. We believe that the 
operational brains behind the New-York attack were Mughniyeh and Zawahiri, 
who were probably financed and got some logistical support from the Iraqi 
Intelligence Service (SSO)."" 

Mughniyeh was the only one believed to have tried it before. On April 12th 
1997, he was reported to be only two hours away from achieving the highest 
goal of any terrorist organisation (until last week): blowing up an Israeli 
El-Al airliner above Tel Aviv. A man carrying a forged British passport with

the name Andrew Jonathan Neumann was in a Jerusalem hotel preparing a bomb 
he was supposed to take on board an El-Al flight leaving Israel, when it 
accidentally went off. Andrew Jonathan Neumann was very badly injured but 
strong enough to reveal later to the Israelis that he was not British but 
Lebanese, and that his operation was supposed to be a special ""gift"" to 
Israel from Imad Mughniyeh. 

'A psychopath' 

""Bin Laden is a schoolboy in comparison with Mughniyeh,"" says an Israeli who

knows Mughniyeh . ""The guy is a genius, someone who refined the art of 
terrorism to its utmost level. We studied him and reached the conclusion 
that he is a clinical psychopath motivated by uncontrollable psychological 
reasons, which we have given up trying to understand. The killing of his two

brothers by the Americans only inflamed his strong motivation."" 

Experts on Iraq and Saddam Hussein also believe that Iraq was the state 
behind the two terror masterminds. ""In recent months, there was a change, 
and Iraq decided to get into the terror business. On July 7th, they tried 
for the first time to send a suicide bomber, trained in Baghdad, to blow up 
Tel Aviv airport (Foreign Report No. 2651)."" 

Our sources believe that it will be very difficult to get to the bottom of 
this unprecedented terror operation. However, they believe the chief of the 
Iraqi SSO is Qusai Hussein, the dictator's son, and his organisation is the 
most likely to have been involved. 

Mughniyeh, 48, is a ""sick man"", says an intelligence officer who was in 
charge of his file. He is considered by Western intelligence agencies as the

most dangerous active terrorist today. He is wanted by several governments 
and the Americans have put a $2m reward on his head. 

[Detailed list of Mughniyeh operations removed for Non-Subscriber Extract] 

It was the assassination of one man in March 1984 that is said to have made 
Mughniyeh the CIA's most wanted terrorist. Mughniyeh allegedly kidnapped the

head of the CIA station in Beirut, William Buckley. The kidnapping triggered

what later became known as 'Irangate', when the Americans tried to exchange 
Buckley (and others) with arms for Iran. However, the attempt ended in a 
fiasco. By one unconfirmed account, Mughniyeh tortured and killed Buckley 
with his own hands. 

A year later, in a combined CIA/Mossad operation, a powerful car bomb went 
off at the entrance to the house of Hizbullah's spiritual leader, Sheikh 
Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah. Seventy-five people were killed. One of them was

his brother. Hunted by the CIA and the Mossad, Mughniyeh hid in Iran. 

In February 1992, Israeli helicopter gunships attacked the convoy of the 
then head of Hizbullah, Sheikh Abas Musawi, in South Lebanon. Musawi, his 
wife and children were killed and the revenge attack followed a month later.

According to press reports, Mughniyeh was called back into action and, in a 
well-planned and devastating attack, his people blew up the Israeli embassy 
in Argentina. The building was demolished and 92 were killed. Only last 
year, after a long investigation, did Argentina issue a warrant for 
Mughniyeh's arrest. 

The reprisal for the attack in Argentina came in December 1994, when a car 
bomb went off in a southern Shi'ite suburb of Beirut. Four people were 
killed. One of them was called Mughniyeh, but to the deep disappointment of 
those Israelis who planted the bomb it was the wrong one. Mughniyeh's life 
was saved, but his other brother Fuad was killed. Mughniyeh waited for his 
opportunity for revenge. 

Our Israeli sources claim to see Mughniyeh's signature on the wreckage in 
New York and Washington. How to counter this kind of terrorism? ""To fight 
these bastards you don't need a military attack,"" said an experienced 
Israeli commando officer. ""You only need to adopt Israel's assassination 
policy.""

Subject: What's the Plan -- Patterns of Global 
Terrorism 2000 


Hello friends, 

For those of you who I have not spoken to I hope with 
all my heart family and friends are safe.  The victims 
will not be forgotten.  

I would like to engage all of you in a discussion of 
what is to come.  Or perhaps I'm ranting you decide... 

My first reactions like many others were decimation, 
selected occupation, no more standing military, slowly 
over the course of 30-50 years we bring these nations 
into the fold of economic prosperity.  This has worked 
before, but will it now?  On terrorism and 
intelligence, I think terrorism is not to be treated 
as criminal law; we cannot follow the diplomatic code 
when dealing with terrorist organizations (i.e., our 
intelligence should be permitted to assassinate these 
people, or have moles on the payroll). 

After a few days of kill 'em all mentality, I decided 
to begin my education in this matter.  I would like to 
share with you my first research and some impressions. 
 I do feel more informed.  My resolve is no different; 
but my initial general blood thirst is evolving into 
something far more calculated. 

Domestic and international terrorism has been a 
horrible problem for as long as most nations can 
remember.  There is on average more than one terrorist 
event a day in the world.  In the late 1980's it was 
as high as 2 events a day. 
This is terrorism.  From Colin Powell himself.  I 
found myself numb before I event got through the first 
months of 2000.

List of major terrorist organizations - they will all 
need to be eliminated but I have highlighted the first 
targets. 
http://web.nps.navy.mil/~library/tgp/tgpndx.htm#2000
<http://web.nps.navy.mil/~library/tgp/tgpndx.htm#2000>  
Start with Al Quida a focal point or umbrella 
organization for a worldwide network that includes 
many Sunni Islamic extremist groups such as Egyptian 
Islamic Jihad, some members of al-Gama'at 
al-Islamiyya, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and 
the Harakat ul-Mujahidin. 

Al-Qaida - an terrorist organization almost run by bin 
Laden, financially his network is like a holding 
company.  Al Quida exerts heavy influence over the 
four organizations listed below.  Each of the other 
organizations in turn exerts influence over other 
terrorist groups.  Most of these are fundamental 
Islamic extremist organizations.  A fear is that a 
general cohesive theme is to overthrow the 
middle-eastern governments, establish fundamentalist 
Islamic states which would persecute other religious 
observers within their borders, wage war on western 
influence internally,  and potentially engage in 
military actions against the United States and other 
western nations. 
http://web.nps.navy.mil/~library/tgp/qaida.htm
<http://web.nps.navy.mil/~library/tgp/qaida.htm>  

These organizations have signed a fatwa issued by bin 
Laden in 1998 calling for the death of Americans.

Geography - very good idea to look at maps of the 
region. 
http://www.randmcnally.com <http://www.randmcnally.com>  
I found the geography interesting to study in detail. 
Afghanistan is horribly difficult to access.  The 
ocean-to-land access is through Pakistan's Arabian Sea 
coast; then head North 800 miles, to Peshawar and then 
into Kabul (the mountainous route the British used in 
1946).  The Pakistan army is 50% Taliban sympathetic. 
Already 42 political parties have issued statements of 
opposition to their own government for offering to 
help America.  They will descend into civil war most 
surely.  The HUM will likely be a significant part of 
that problem.  It will do us no good to partner with a 
cooperative government and an uncooperative military. 
Could American planes be shot down over Pakistan by 
renegades within their own army?  

Things we should know: 
In Pakistan, many Afghan refugees were initially 
trained by the US and Pakistan Intelligence (ISI) in 
the 1980's to fight the Soviets.  They were called the 
Mujahideen.  Many were children living in refugee 
camps when recruited, having known nothing else in 
this world.  Left to their own devices for 10 years, 
these camps and training centers have given root to 
terrorist organizations (HUM) and violently 
anti-humanitarian fundamentalist movements (the 
Taliban).  The Taliban gained control of Afghanistan 
in 1996 overthrowing the then Shiite-Communist regime, 
killing and hanging the president in downtown Kabul 
for several days.  The Taliban are Sunni Muslim 
fundamentalists and conduct a religious proletariat; 
they terrorize other Muslim communities, the Hazaras 
and Hindu Kush people within their borders.    The 
Taliban recently issued an edict requiring Afghan 
Hindus to wear identifications tags.  Sound familiar? 
The Taliban is hosting Al Qaida, bin Laden's 
organization.   bin Laden also influences the 
fundamentalist (IMU) in Uzbekistan.  The IMU is 
another Sunni fundamentalist terrorist group - they 
are mostly involved in terrorizing Uzbekistan, 
Kyrgyzistan, and Tajikistan, north of Afghanistan. 
The Taliban constituents are predominantly from the 
Pushtun region.  Pushtun covers parts of Afghanistan 
and Pakistan.; There have been movements to create a 
separate Pushtunistan.  This map indicates the ethnic 
breakdown in the region. 
http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/pakistan_ethnic_80.jpg
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/pakistan_ethnic_80.jpg>
. 
 And the HUM focuses their attacks on India. 

The Shi'ite Muslims, many other Sunni Muslims, and in 
general the world muslim community do not agree with 
the Taliban's interpretation of Islamic law.  The 
Taliban is not accepted by most of the Islamic world 
because of their extreme harshness and treatment of 
women, total eliminations of all modern culture, and 
being the worlds largest heroin production.  The 
elimination of western influence is not considered a 
problem within some other fundamentalist groups. 

Afghanistan is not friendly with neighbor Iran to it's 
West.  Iran is an Shi'a or Shi'ite Muslim nation. 
Because Iran is predominantly Shi'a; they are 
unfriendly with the more radical Sunni dominated 
Afghanistan.  Iran backs the ousted government and is 
angered by Taliban terrorism and slaughtering of 
thousands of Shi'a Muslims, including Iranian 
diplomats in Afghanistan.  Iran also has border 
disputes with Iraq further to the West even after a 
devastating 8 year war.  Afghanistan and Iraq are both 
25 million people; Iran is closer to 65 million.  
An exchange from 1998 regarding Iran and Afghanistan.

<http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/ops/war/1998/09/980910-afghan2.htm>  

Also during the war with Soviet over 10 MILLION land 
mines were dropped in Afghanistan with no maps left 
behind.  
http://www.afghan-network.net/Landmines/
<http://www.afghan-network.net/Landmines/>  

The only opposition to the Taliban is the Northern 
Military Alliance.  These people are also Sunni Muslim 
and ethnically are the Tajiks.  Their leader Massoud 
was killed last week, assassinated by men posing as 
the press.  The sliver of Afghanistan they still 
control is the finger squeezed between northern 
Pakistan and Southern Tajikistan and touching China. 
The Tajik presence cannot be eliminated by the Taliban 
without initiating conflict with Tajikistan.  The NMA 
is a political authority that may be put in place. 
They have offered 15000 soldiers, and 15000 more on 
reserve.  Their leader was killed last week, most 
likely in some coordinated effort - along with the new 
requirement that all organization in Afghanistan need 
to put monies in to the Afghan bank.  Many acts were 
clearly coordinated in this event. 

I have also been seeking out information on the 
Taliban in particular.  These link contain some very 
powerful information.  Quite frankly it is shameful 
that the Western world turned their back when this 
hellish situation was brought on upon Afghanistan many 
years ago. 

First a super high level overview - it is interesting 
to note how many times this land has been ravaged by 
invaders.

Try to digest this information - it is very important 
that initiate an informed dialogue.  But the Taliban 
must go. 

This section is organized geographically based on the 
waterways. 
The nations in question will need to eradicate, expel 
extremists from within their own borders.  This means 
partnering with a United States led coalition and 
contributing emphatically. 

Look at the Mediterranean coast. 
The South - Morocco, Algeria, Libya and Egypt are all 
plagued by terrorism. 
The East - Israel, Lebanon, Syria  all plagued by 
terrorist groups.  There is a dreadful rooting of 
terrorist organization.  Beirut was once a beautiful 
city I am told; For 20 years it has replaced Warsaw as 
the pop-culture reference to a war torn city. 
Terrorism surrounding Israel ties into several other 
organizations including Hizbollah and HAMAS. 

Look at the Red Sea. 
Egypt,Sudan and Saudi Arabia.  The Sudan is terribly 
infiltrated; this may be the terrorist plan hatching 
ground and safe haven.  And while the Saudi's are 
economically partnered with the western world, many 
extremists operating out of Saudi do fund these 
organizations.  Sudan is also suspected of being a 
meeting ground for the terrorist network.  

Look at the Gulf of Aden - entrance to the Red Sea 
Yemen - has allowed bin Laden to broadcast, site of 
the USS Cole bombing.  After the attack, the 
perpetrators fled from Yemen to Afghanistan. 

Rounding the corner into the Persian Gulf. 
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - both 
acknowledge the Taliban government.  They have 
provided radical nationals to the Afghans, throughout 
the years, many support the Taliban; some trained with 
bin Laden.  We hope these governments have a change of 
heart with regard to recognition of the Taliban. 
Iran, Persia until 1935, has coastal territory along 
the gulf and the Caspian sea to the north.  We have 
had problems with Iran in the past; in the current 
situation, they may be helpful maybe not.  There is 
information pointing to an Islamic conference in 
Tehran which is another possible ""hatching"" ground for 
these operations.  Iran still may be a very serious 
issue in the future.  It is a religious government - 
something we all implicitly abhor in this nation. 
They exiled the Shah and began systematically 
eliminating western influence from their society after 
the event in 1979 
Iraq - Part of the Ottoman empire through 1932. 
Kurdish territory in the North bordering on Turkey. 
Hussein has used Sarin nerve gas against his own 
nationals, the Kurds in the North near the Turkish 
border.  As we know, he has invaded Kuwait.  An 8 year 
war with Iran over borders was going on at the same 
time the soviets were in Afghanistan.  This is a 
military regime.  Though the economic sanctions we 
have used for the last 10 years have kept Iraq down as 
military force; they have created a new generation of 
hatred. 

East from the Gulf into the Arabian Sea, part of the 
Indian Ocean, the Arabian basin is separated from the 
Indian Ocean by underwater land structure but there is 
nothing to prevent sea travel. 
Pakistan - a country on the verge of civil war.  A 
military regime. Probably half of the people in the 
army are Taliban sympathizers.  Pakistan may be in 
civil war shortly. 
India - the largest democracy in the world.  Still 
disassembling the 3500 yr old Caste System.  The 
British occupation left India with an intact system of 
representative government.  They are plagued by 
internal strife from the Sikh, who are separatists. 
Their brand of terrorism has been significantly 
reduced in the past 8 years.  They are also plagued by 
the HUM another extremist fundamental Islamic movement 
- very closely connected to the Taliban and bin Laden 
as described earlier. 

China actually shares a thin strip of border with 
Afghanistan near Tajikistan.  Pakistan also borders on 
China.  Though the Himalayas separate the bulk of this 
geographically from the 1 billion people of China. 
Having China on board is critical. 

I would like the US to investigate TSI, Telephone 
Services International, a New Jersey Corporation and 
Unocal, a California Oil Company.  Both of these 
companies have had business dealings with the Taliban 
government.  I believe that corporate greed with total 
disregard for the human condition in any country is 
unacceptable and should be uncovered and dealt with 
accordingly.  And I think the investment community 
needs to demonstrate in the markets to corporations 
who dabble in business with terror linked 
organizations.  The investment community was hit 
particularly hard; i hope going forward there will be 
a clear message to stop support for companies who may 
potentially aggravate terrorists to attack Americans. 
We may need to legally restrict what our corporations 
can do abroad and who they are allowed to strike deals 
with based on the opportunity cost of potential 
terrorist activity.  By all means, no corporation 
should have had any business dealings with the 
Taliban; perhaps this should be enforced by law. 

Some rants about waking the sleeping giant MIND! 
I firmly believe that the deadened state of 
intellectual discussion concerning these issues in 
America is part of the problem. 
We have been funneling our best minds into Technology, 
Banking, Law and Medicine for a very long time.  The 
general lack of information and interest in world 
political and human conditions, and the evolution of 
human governments is dangerous.  The average American 
simply need to be more informed and have an opinion to 
express to our government on what we can do to ensure 
the survival of our way of life and the spread of 
goodwill.  

Most likely we are all in agreement that a forceful 
military strike will initiate this new campaign;  I 
think there is quite a bit of confusion over what we 
really are about to embark on.  Our army may well 
include the corporate army and the casualties will be 
civilian.  We need to get every American to study this 
condition, it's roots, causes, directions and what we 
can do to end it.  Americans need to start an 
intelligent dialogue, around the country publicly so 
that we can demonstrate to ourselves and the rest of 
the world that we are educated and serious about 
achieving a solution.  Our military domination is 
already known throughout the world. 

Perhaps our long-term goal may involve bolstering the 
middle-class communities in these nations assuming 
they are moderate, tolerant and peace-loving; they 
need something to lose, and conversely, something to 
protect.  To get there we will need to eradicate any 
fundamentalist governments like the Taliban, under no 
circumstances can they be trusted going forward ever. 
We will need to partner with each nation and hunt the 
terrorist organizations down within their borders.  We 
need to seize assets, disable communications, engage 
in an unprecedented Intelligence campaign.   

Let's focus our efforts on thinking and providing our 
leadership with a collective strategy and wisdom, an 
opinion from within.  While I trust the powers that be 
to handle these affairs,  I never believed any day in 
my life that we were so vulnerable. 

Know the enemy. The threat of bio-chemical weapons - a 
simple overview of what the most likely agents are. 
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/deadlygas0210.html
<http://abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/deadlygas0210.html>  

There is one company in America that is contracted by 
the DOD to produce the Anthrax vaccine, the BioPort 
Corporation, formerly known as the Michigan Biologic 
Products Institute (MBPI).  I hope the defense around 
that company is solid. 

Hopefully, this will generate some interest in 
developing a public discussion regarding strategies 
for the eradication of terrorism and governments that 
support them actively, tacitly or otherwise.  bin 
Laden  Imad Mughniyeh, head of the special overseas  

operations for Hizbullah, and the Egyptian Dr Ayman 

  Al Zawahiri, senior member of Al-Qaeda and possible

and the Taliban should go first, then perhaps 
the other organizations mentioned above.  Then what 
Hussein, Qaddafi?  Will Egypt be on board when the Al 
Jihad unleash terror in Egypt?  Do these nations host 
silently in exchange for less or no terrorism within 
their borders, completely bending to the will of 
terrorists for fear of their people being injured?  Is 
that support or a successful campaign of terror? Where 
do we draw the line?  I suppose where you stand after 
Tuesday is a good start?  Who's next?  How do we 
prioritize? Will they are be lined up behind the US in 
1 year? 

Be strong,  Be prepared, Be smart, Be heard, God Bless 
America

GLENDALE, CA- Rock guitarist Steve Vai wowed a group of neighborhood children with his spectacular guitar pyrotechnics Monday. ""His behind-the-head guitar solo was so wicked,"" said Jimmy Hetzel, 11, one of six children blown away by Vai's fretboard wizardry. ""He also did this thing where he held the guitar between his legs and played it with a bow."" The impromptu performance is believed to be the most impressive display of its kind since September 2000, when Joe Satriani ""showed off a few licks"" at a Southfield, MI, bar mitzvah.

   Robert, Here are the two messages from ""Jeff Lawson"" and the response I got from Jeff Sprecher at the ICE regarding my complaint. I appreciate your handling this matter.

Eddie,

Thanks for the note. This has been a very scary and tough time, but I'm hoping something good can come from it. We are trying very hard to sell the trading operation intact to several institutions. I'm sure you have read about it. After the suffering you and all the other people who live and work in the NYC financial district have gone through this year, this pales in comparision. We're all hangin' tough.

Best wishes in this holiday season to and your family,
your friend
Andy"

Dave,
This is the interest rate curve we used to value our book as of Close of business Oct. 15, 2001. Our Treasury guys are either not available now or are not working anymore. So for getting the term structure of Enron's funding costs for 10/15/01 I probably can't deliver that today. I still think your money desks and corporate traders could give you a pretty realistic picture of that. I will keep trying though.

I am being told that the books and records of Enron's trading units are on aggregate marked off of a cost of funds curve. I should have that curve to you first thing Monday morning. Sorry about the delay but it is hard to get certain things done in a timely fashion around here right now.

Rick,

I've been thinking about this. I think 18 mos. for the average tenor of a trade is way too high. For John Arnold's book it would on a prospective basis be  more in line with 4 months. We would probably not make markets online on anything past 24 months for NYMEX gas and the vast majority of our trades are in the first three months. I think the same would probably be true for power, but I haven't spoken to those guys about it. 

For the NYMEX book gas I made the following assumptions:

Average tenor: 5 months

Average trades per day: 400

average volume per trade: 500,000 mmbtu

average px: $2.7/mmbtu

With 252 trading days you and up with a gross unadjusted notional of $136bn. This is simply 400*252*500,000*$2.7

You then have to adjust down for the expiration of trades during the year. If the average life was 6 months you could halve the number above, which would be conservative given our 4 month assumption.

That takes you down to $68.04bn ($136bn/2).

The next adjustment would be to factor in netting for counterparties. You are trying to estimate the net open interest per countperparty. I am working on those numbers as I write this. It stands to reason that the net number for NYMEX Gas deals would be less than $70bn. When you factor in other gas trades and power the number would rise and I will look at that.

As a basic method, does this start to get you to where you need to be ?

Andy

His number is (732) 505-2919.  He is located in Toms River NJ. I will call him if you would like and tell him you are coming his way.

Subject: Independent Kiodex analysis of EnronOnline risk?


Greg, we've been able to load thousands of EnronOnline trades into our Risk
Workbench, and we've correctly run risk reports on them.  Might we be of
service to Enron by loading ALL the EnronOnline trades into the Risk
Workbench, and running our risk reports on the aggregate?  I'm thinking that
such an independent analysis of at least part of Enron's risk position might
answer the requests, expressed among analysts and pundits in the FT, the
WSJ, and elsewhere, for greater disclosure.

Everyone is excessively worried about mysterious packages these days.  Just
as Enron pioneered transparency in the energy markets, Enron can set the
gold standard for disclosure of aggregate risk.  (I know the other dealers
will want to squirm their way out of following suit.)  I have supreme
confidence in Enron's risk controls, and I'm thinking that an independent
measurement of this kind could dispel the market's overblown and baseless
fears.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Kind regards
Marty

John,
Thanks for the note. Yeah things look pretty lousy here at the big E. From first to worst in 4 easy weeks. The untold story is how much money the gas and power trading folks have made that some weenies in three piece in suits in Corp pissed away. Looks like we are going to be bought by Dynegy. Hang in there with ONE. I am agitating for a Christmas visit to Mich by us, so hope to see you then.

Keep on it,
Andy"

Greg,

I know this has been a tough couple of weeks for you but I thought I would drop you a line and share my impressions:

1). This deal is an ideal opportunity to merge back and mid office support platforms. We have discussed this many times and EnronNetworks was practically set up for this (CommodityLogic et al...)
 
2). I don't know what you folks have in mind but I could see leaving ENE's market making and trading structure intact and having DYN's asset-based trading be just another business unit like EES was. but the key is the tremendous cost savings of the common support platform.

I don't mean to be presumptuous but I hadn't talked to you in a while and wanted to get it off my chest.

Good luck,
Andy"

Interesting.....Is Lay going to retire????


-- DJ Enron CEO -2: Also To Get Reimbursed For Tax Penalties --

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could
receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s
(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,
2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full
calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he
terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. 
  In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the
resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that
time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. 
  In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any
related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an ""excess
parachute payment,"" according to the filing. 
  Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. 
  The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is
entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment
within the 60 days. 
  Houston-based Enron is a utilities and communications company. -Dan Lowrey;

Mooney's are great planes and are very fast. I almost bought an MSE a few years ago, which subsequently was called the Allegro, then the Eagle. They are really well built with no incidents of inflight airframe failure ever. Drawbacks are they are quite small and there is a cloud over he comapny as it is in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy isue is around whether the supply of parts will be available going foward. They are probably being discounted which makes it a good buy. Idon't think the parts issue is a real one as someone will step in to take over the manufacturing.

  <http://www.intcx.com/weather/images/header7.gif>
IntercontinentalExchange is pleased to announce that weather swaps trading will be included in its new version 8 release. These fixed-for-floating financial products will be cash settled on a five-day average temperature, Monday - Friday, for the current week and for the forward week. Temperatures used for the settlement of these products will be those reported by EarthSat, a widely recognized and independent source of weather data. Settlement temperatures provided by EarthSat will be available via the IntercontinentalExchange website. The hub locations for weather trades will be the primary airport weather stations at Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York-La Guardia, Philadelphia-International and Sacramento-Executive. The standard contract size for all locations will be $10,000 per degree Fahrenheit, with a tic increment of 0.1 degree Fahrenheit or $1,000. There are no payout limits on the contracts. 
The design and development of these new weather products was done under the guidance of Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., a recognized leader in weather product concepts. In addition, IntercontinentalExchange has worked with Aquila and other major weather market participants, including Reliant Energy, Mirant Americas, and El Paso Merchant Energy, to build consensus and support for these new products.
To trade weather swaps you must have our new version 8 release installed on your system. An advisory with details about this new release is being sent to you by separate email.

Jay,

Have received comments that when multi day limit orders are placed, they are not alive after a friday night. I think this might have to do with orders getting wiped out duirng maintenance but I wanted to alert you to this.

Hi Andy and happy new year...

I chose one in NJ for my own use.

I did get some recommendations from some other people that were NY lawyers:

Jerry Solomon at Gallet, Dryer & Berkey 212-935-3131.

I have another somewhere, and I'll try to send it along.

Hi Andy,

When it was decided that we would accept multi-day orders, we pointed out to Lavo and John that we do system maintenance for an hour every Friday night.  Their position was anytime we take the system down for any reason, planned or un-planned, we should kill all orders to prevent someone from being unable to cancel an order while the system was down and then having it fill before he can get to it.

We actually have a plan in place to make this much better.  Effectively, we will have dual sites.  The second site will be used both for disaster recovery, as well as a convenient way to manage code releases without an outage.  Unfortunately, purchasing the hardware for this has been put on hold given the present circumstances.

Sorry to see the absorption of TQ by APB. I suppose it is all for the best.  Hope that you guys come out of it allright. The irony is that TQ outlived Enron ! Haven't spoken to you in a awhile and hope that all is well with you and your family. Call me when you get a chance to catch up.

Hope all is going well for you and your bride. I know I owe you a phone call, and I will pay the debt soon.

Best,
Andy

Hi John,
I hope things are going well for you. Sorry I could not contact you earlier
- had been really busy wrapping up things. Thanks for stopping the other day
and inquiring about me. I have an H-1 visa and have 6 weeks to find a job
after which I will be required to leave the country.

I am attaching a copy of my resume for you to review. I would appreciate
greatly if you could go over it and offer any suggestions on how I can
improve my chances of finding a job.

Thanks,
Bilal

I think the note I sent to Steve plus the fact that he came to see me and I told him he was out of line are enough. We will not support the app. It seems kind of draconian to shut off the flow of information. As far as wireless in general it has never been a high priority for me because we never had a commercial basis for proceeding other than ""gee, wouldn't this be cool"" I think it is time to reassess the wireless angle, in terms of what it would cost to build, who would build it for us, and what we would get from the project. I'm going to ask Dave Forster to do that.

Comments ?

Mike

I attach a letter of intent which I hope covers all the points we discussed this morning. On the basis that you asked for a memorandum of understanding the attached draft is fairly legalistic in tone. If you wanted something more informal let me know.

Paul - let me know if you have any comments.

Subject:	HoustonStreet Demonstration

On May 22, 2001 HoustonStreet representatives (Frank Getman, John Wyman and David Cuadros) came to Enron to give us a demonstration of the gas interfaces.  HoustonStreet was allowed to load the required .cab files on the demonstration computers prior to the demonstration.  HoustonStreet provided us with a script to follow relative to the demonstration as well as a list of test and production mappings.  During the demonstration we experienced the following:

1 - 8 second delays between a price update on EnronOnline and a price update on HoustonStreet.  With just five products active we experienced a delay of up to 5 seconds.  Due to the delay in price updates, transaction attempts on the HoustonStreet platform resulted in a high percentage of failed transactions with Enron.
When we activated Product ID 16612 (US Gas Basis PEPL Jun-Oct01) the product showed up on EnronOnline but did not show up on HoustonStreet.  HoustonStreet provided us with a list of products which had been mapped in the test environment and this product was included on the list.  HoustonStreet indicated that they had verified the mapping of all the products on this list.  We reviewed the mapping of this product by Enron and confirmed that it was active and mapped.  Incorrect mapping of products has the potential of allowing transactions to occur with mismatched product types.
When we attempted to transact on Product ID 16600 (US Gas Basis NGI Chicago Jun-Oct01) we were unable to complete a transaction even when the bid and offer prices were not changing.  These transaction attempts should have resulted in successful transactions.  We also experience instances where the bid and/or offer price would disappear after a failed transaction attempt and not reappear even thought the price was still present on EnronOnline.  In many cases the price would disappear for up to 30 seconds or more.  Although we did not witness any incorrect transactions, general functionality failure may or may not result in incorrect transactions.  At a minimum this type of behavior would result in frustration on the part of the counterparty when a transaction attempt results in a failure with no subsequent price move or a disappearing price.
A review of the transactions we recorded versus the transactions indicated by HoustonStreet reveals some discrepancies.  In an email from John Wyman dated 5/23 (forwarded seperately), John Wyman indicated that they had cleaned their database just prior to 3:00 PM and gave us just the trade count beginning at 14:58 on 5/22.  Although there has not been a deal by deal reconciliation of the trades, we compared our total trade count beginning at 14:58.  If the deal counts do not match this would result in substantial financial exposure.  Below I have highlighted the HoustonStreet transactions by counterparty versus the EnronOnline transaction count:

			HSE	EOL

	Arizona		 12	 14
	Avista		 03	 03
	Adams		 17	 19
	BP		 57	 58
	
	Total		 89	 94
	
Based upon my review of the demonstration, I continue to believe there significant potential exposure associated with the HoustonStreet interfaces.

Vin,

Glad we could hook up yesterday. 

The gist of what we are interested in is providing EnronOnline's liquidity to local NYMEX traders. I would like to explore the concept of NYMEX's clearing corp or another clearer standing in the middle between Enron and these locals. EnronOnline's architecture provides for a Master user, such as a Clearing Corp, to set up as many sub-users (local traders) as it wants. Each sub-user has trading rights as designated and controlled by the master. We would envision the Clearing Corp. handling it credit arrangements with the locals, and negotiating its relationship with Enron. I know this is pretty simple stuff, but every long journey starts with a small step. Please let me your interest in pursuing this sort of arrangement or a variant thereof.

Thanks,
Andy Zipper
Vice President
Enron Corp."

Justin,
The traders are free to use any platform they like. I do not approve or disapprove; they are in the best position to make that decision. It is EWS policy however that someone from Amita/Lara's group be the master user to montor activity and control what access agreements we accept.

Thanks,
Andy

Guys,
Let's get together today to dicuss demo. I would like to demo full capability, including option manager. I think it is very important to also set up an interest rate product, perhaps a swap that is quoted in rate only. No need to convert to dollar ox just yet. Given that the guy who is building their commercial paper platform will be there and seems to be one of the main judges of the merit of EOL I think it behooves us to slant presentation that way.

I'm good from 11:00 to 1:00

OpenLink is one of the leaders in risk management systems. We used at Coral, and it was then called Abacus. It is strongest in front office risk management. I would view their competition as KioDex. The deal with Duke has been around for awhile."

Frank,

Thank you for bringing your team down to Houston to demonstrate the new version of the system. We appreciate the effort that HoustonStreet has made to upgrade its system, however in our view insufficient progress has been made to change our decision to terminate the Posting Agreement. Once again, thank you the effort your team put in and let's stay touch.

That's fine, but no LOI is to be agreed without EnronOnline's concurrence. If you want to do something without us, go right ahead but if we are to be involved then we need to approve and be involved in the deal from the get go. Bob Shults is contacting Joe in NY as we speak.

Thanks,
Andy Zipper

Vin,

Glad we could hook up yesterday. 

The gist of what we are interested in is providing EnronOnline's liquidity to local NYMEX traders. I would like to explore the concept of NYMEX's clearing corp or another clearer standing in the middle between Enron and these locals. EnronOnline's architecture provides for a Master user, such as a Clearing Corp, to set up as many sub-users (local traders) as it wants. Each sub-user has trading rights as designated and controlled by the master. We would envision the Clearing Corp. handling it credit arrangements with the locals, and negotiating its relationship with Enron. I know this is pretty simple stuff, but every long journey starts with a small step. Please let me your interest in pursuing this sort of arrangement or a variant thereof.

Thanks,
Andy Zipper

Linda sent someone on your team a detailed testing schedule last week.   We
are snowed out of our office today, so we may have to wait until tomorrow to
take futher action on anything.  Feel free to call me on my cell phone at
any time you feel there is a delay on our end.

Pursuant to Section 3(c) of the Truequote Price Posting Agreement, Truequote is required to ""provide accurate matching (""mapping"") through the ID interface"".  I am working with product control and legal to conduct due diligence on the Truequote mapping as well as reviewing other aspects of the Truequote site that may create legally binding contracts.  Sign off by the legal group is a requirement for operating on third party transaction platforms and will be necessary prior to going live on Truequote.

In short the due diligence will focus on three primary areas:

Assuring that the product description language on the Truequote site accurately reflects Enron's products provisions
Physical testing to ensure that the mapping of products is accurate (ie when I select product A on Truequote I get product                       A on from Enron). 
Assuring Enron is comfortable with all legal ramifications which may arise as a result of language posted on the Truquote site.

Below are Mark Greenberg comments on the legal process for third party transaction sites

Bob -

Thanks for the information and access id's. 

As I indicated in my voice mail earlier today, the standard process is to run these deals through one central point and to ensure that a review of all descriptions and information related to each respective product to be traded is undertaken by a Legal Dept. member.   As you will note from the list of cc's, I have included legal dept. members involved in the physical power, physical gas and financial products areas.  These people will need to review the product definitions/descriptions - if any - on the Truequote site, as well as any other items associated with these products.  Accordingly, each of these individuals also needs a password/user id for due diligence purposes.


Each member of the legal and product control groups that are involved have an user id to Truequote and can begin the process."

Andy,

Back on December 15, 2000 you received a letter from True Quote confirming
the redemption and forfeiture of 7,731,942 Common Units of Participation
owned by Enron Net Works LLC in True Quote LLC.  Part of that letter
contained the updated capital structure of True Quote LLC subsequent to the
redemption.  However, the equity owned by APB Energy, Inc. was inadvertently
left off that summary.  The current capital structure is, and should have
been described in that letter, as follows

	B2B Internet Capital Corp.	7,440,000	Series A Preferred Units
	EnFORM Technology LLC	   560,000	Series A Preferred Units
	APB Energy, Inc.		1,172,838	Common Units
	PG&E Energy Trading -
	  Gas Corporation	           15,000,000	Common Units
	Enron Net Works LLC		 7,268,058	Common Units

Andy,

As a follow-up to our phone conversation, True Quote is in the process of
obtaining an equity bridge in the range of $1 to $2 million.  True Quote's
current cash position is tight and we need to complete this process within
the next two/three weeks.    Due to the current state of the capital
markets, management feels it is prudent to solicit a small bridge amount.
Once ""traction"" (EOL link complete, TQTS deal complete, etc..) is obtained,
we will continue to solicit larger equity investments from strategic
partners and the investment community.

I would be glad to discuss the current state of affairs in more detail and
provide the appropriate information if you are interested in pursuing this
opportunity.

Regards,

Andy,

Per your request, I have outlined below the key terms of the most recent
equity transaction.

On September 8, 2000, PG&E invested $2 million in return for 7,500,000
shares ($.2667/share).
Enron's shares outstanding net of clawback equal 7,268,058 * .2667 = $1,
938,391.
Total shares outstanding as of 2/1/01 equal 31,440,896.

Please call if you have any questions.

Chris,
I have asked our team to review the document you sent me and to ascertain
what the hold up is. One thing that has been made clear to me is that we
were ready to begin testing a month ago and had to idle a group of folks
while your development team caught up. This has created a bit of a manpower
crunch for us but we will fix it. I will respond to you when I know more. I
am out of the office next two days but available on Thursday and Friday.

Subject: Concerns with Status of Enron Integration Testing


Chris,

Dennis asked that I send you a note expressing our concern with the delays
that we have been experiencing with the Enron Integration testing.

We have essentially not made any progress since we began testing ""Enron
Posting Prices to True Quote"" on January 17th.  First, the test did not work
because there was a problem at Enron with price updates not posting
correctly to their integration server.  This problem was resolved and we
were asked to repeat the test a week later on January 24th.  This test was
also unsuccessful because the data we received did not contain any spaces
between words.  As of today, it has not been determined whether the problem
is on Enron's side or ours.  We have been continuing to research the problem
on our side and so far it looks to us like the data is arriving on our
server without the spaces. Enron's Operations group was planning to do a
test today to ""sniff"" the network to determine how the data is actually
leaving their firewall, but they have had other problems that have prevented
them from working with us today.  Last Friday they were not able to spend
any time working with us because they were getting ready for their
maintenance window.

Our concern is that each time we have encountered a problem, it has taken
several days to resolve the issue before we can move on to the next series
of tests.  Understanding that the due date is only 3 weeks away, the True
Quote team is concerned that Enron is not providing enough resources to work
the problems immediately and resolve them as quickly as possible.  Part of
the reason for some of the delay on Enron's side may be that the group that
is involved in the testing has had to go back to the developer group for
assistance each time they have encountered a problem (at least that's our
understanding).  We don't believe that there is anyone in the developer
group that is dedicated to resolve our problems as soon as one is reported.

The reality of this situation is that we have one project but many different
disconnected teams working on the project.  As we move forward we would like
to make the following recommendations to improve the speed of our testing
activities:

1) Rather than working as two disconnected teams (testing via conference
call), it would be helpful if we had an Enron person here in our office each
time we test and communicate back to Enron the results that we are getting.
That person should be someone that has a direct link back to the developers
group, the operations group, and the products group.

2) The Enron resource should have as their priority to work with the
necessary groups within Enron to resolve issues as quickly as possible.

3) The developers group needs to address problems that are reported by the
testers as quickly as possible.

We welcome any other suggestions that you or Andy have to improve the speed
of our testing and implementation process.  Please let me know once you've
had a chance to speak to Andy if there is anything that he can do to provide
us resources to proceed with our testing more expeditiously.

Andy,

 After discussing the performance of True Quote with Mike Guadarrama I am increasingly concerned that they have problems which may take some time to overcome.  Mike believes that the speed issue is a result of the way they have designed their architecture.  If this is the case we will not see improved performance for some time.  

I've asked Mike to have a conversation with the True Quote developer to give us a better idea of what he believes the root problems are.  Based upon Mike's assessment we can get a feel of the time it may take to correct the problems.

We continue to spend a great deal of time testing with True Quote and this is consuming a fair amount of time for the testing team.   "

Chris,

Here is our status as of yesterday and answers to Richard's comments:

Primary issue:  4 to 5 second latency between Enron Stack/EnronOnline TEST changes to TrueQuote browser update. Updates from the Enron Stack to the True Quote interface bridge are instantaneous. 

Other issues:
1.  Products hit/lifted on Truequote do not show price/volume updates from EnronOnline after transaction is complete on EnronOnline.
2.  Multiple product activation results in a ""stepped"" display of products on Truequote browser as opposed to all at once on EnronOnline.
3.  EnronOnline sends a bundle of information (e.g. products activated, prices changed, etc.) to the Truequote server.  Truequote server takes longer to process the incoming data than the EnronOnline server will stay connected.  Truequote has possibly resolved this issue by sending an immediate response for all incoming data in order to prevent the EnronOnline server from cutting the connection.

Oracle error:	Kevin Meredith  forwarded the email containing the text for the Oracle error to Kenneth Lim at 7:21AM.  Kenneth responded with an answer as to why we were receiving the error for transaction attempts by 7:36AM.  I informed Stewart Clark as to the status of the issue surrounding the Oracle error in our first conversation at approximately 9:00AM.  Kenneth's response: Approximately 6:20pm Wed night, there was an update to the TEST database which caused this error, we resolved this error along with our internal EnronOnlineTEST site with the resynching of our servers.

Price Update on any transaction attempt: This has always been the case with EnronOnline to ensure the correct price is showing

Bob:

Here is my latest update from my team.  How does it compare to your current
status?  In a conversation this morning with Stew, he brought up an
interesting point regarding the proposed performance of the connection.
Since we are using the public internet VPN tunnel, we are encrypting the
data to /from EOL during this test.  The encryption process is overhead on
the transfer between the systems.  When we begin using the dedicated T1s,
the plan is not to use the encryption between the sites.  This will
eliminate the associated overhead and increase performance.

I will also call you to follow-up.

Best regards,
Chris

Per your request, here are the testing status and issues:

Attempting Transactions:  EOL is sending an ORACLE Error which is failing
any transaction attempt.  A Bridge Server error is suspected.  A copy of the
Error was emailed to Kevin Meredith and Jason Althaus yesterday.  No
response yet.
EOL is sending a price update for any transaction attempt, Filled or Killed.
This was not expected by our team. (I think the stack manager is set up to
automatically regenerate a price, a different price if a transaction takes
place or same price if transaction is failed)
The price update triggers our Deal Execution Engine which attempts another
transaction, and we have a loop.
Performance issues:  We are looking into improving performance on our side
(such as better Data Base sweeping and STOR procedures).  In addition, EOL
is testing their speed on a LAN, we are testing over the internet with a
moderate-performance Server.
In addition, the first two issues have to be resolved before appropriate
performance evaluation can be meaningful.
During testing we came across some issues:
Bad TRP for BOM + 1 in Gas.  This was fixed
EOL tried sending wrong Prices, wrong volumes or wrong products to test how
our system will handle them.  These wrong products/ prices/volumes were
disregarded and not posted at all (which is what we are looking for)
Enform team are writing some code and changing other to accommodate some of
the issues that transpired during testing.

Regards,

Richard

Richard Tobia called to ask me to take a look at their screen as they felt they were gettign updates and a commercial manager should see the progress.  We were able to update prices at a speed of about 4 seconds.  We then attempted to send multiple updates at a speed of about 1 second per update.  True Quote was unable to accept the updates and the link was automatically diconnected by EnronOnline after multiple failures."

After a week and a half of silence from Houston Street, I found out today 
that they have taken over responsibility for their exchange linking 
development from Sapient.  According to the Houston Street project manager, 
Sapient was being too cautious and thorough in their efforts to get to market 
and Houston Street wasn't impressed with their progress to date.  Sapient had 
as of last week finished the design work for the system and has provided the 
design to Houston Street.  Houston Street will use their own internal team to 
complete the project and feels confident they will finish by the 15 January 
deadline.  

This does not bode well for the exchange that appeared to be light years 
ahead of TrueQuote in their development efforts.

I talked to Chris Edmonds this morning to check the status on there system.  Tom Engel was available this weekend to test with them however they never were able to use him.  The True Quote test site is still not available this morning.  Chris indicated they should have a much faster site by lunch time.  

I mentioned to Chris that we were very concerned about there ability to move things forward.  I also indicated that you may be giving Dennis a call to discuss."

Andy,

Below are a number of the e-mail's that I've exchanged with TrueQuote.  I 
can't say that they make for interesting reading but if you note any 
potential issues please let me know.  Most of the notes relate to product 
mapping issues but you will notice highlighted in red a note regarding the 
ordering of a leased line which in my mind is ""acceptance of responsibility 
by action.""  I'll be crafting a note regarding testing soon and will 
coordinate this with Jay and yourself.  I'll also be forwarding e-mails with 
Houston Street.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to further 
clarify our status.

Hi David,

Thanks for sending the answers to our technical questions. After carefully
reviewing your answers, we have a few follow-up questions.  These appear in
""green"".  Please let me know if anything needs further clarification.

We are looking forward to meeting with you next week. Tentatively, we are
planning to have 5 or 6 people attend.  These include three really technical
people, a couple of leads (including myself), a user from the True Quote
business side who understands the products that are traded on True Quote,
and the new True Quote CIO (who's mainly interested in hearing what is said
more so than actively participating in the discussion).

By next Tuesday, I plan to send you our proposed agenda for the meeting.  If
you have a different agenda in mind for the meeting, let's discuss it over
the phone on Wednesday and jointly priortize the items for discussion. We
are very flexible in terms of the agenda.

Thanks in advance for any additional information you can send us.  It's nice
to have a contact to be able to correspond with.  Have a great day!

Maria,

It was good to hear from you this morning.  I have attached your document
with answers to your questions included.  In addition, I've provided the
finalized DTD and our schedule of release dates for specific functionality.

I raised your desire to meet to discuss the project and everyone agrees
that getting together is a good idea.  That said, we believe it would be
best to wait until we have a firm agenda to discuss.  For instance, we will
need to get together in the near term to discuss data mapping issues.  Feel
free to call or drop a note if you have any questions or concerns.

Regards,

David

The following are the dates that we will release functionality.

1 December 2000:  Login, Attempt Transaction, Post Price, Request Price and
Request Order Status.
15 December 2000: Request Transaction History, Request Credit Matrix, Post
Product Set Data and Post Credit Matrix.

David,

I really appreciate your efforts in adding another hour to our meeting this
afternoon and in making Jay available for the discussion.  The following is
a list of technical questions that we would like to discuss in this
afternoon's meeting:

1) This one is probably going to be discussed in the first two hours - We
will need to have the data to populate our tables with in order to map PID,
CPID, RID, PSETID, CATGID, CTYID, CMDTYID.  The non-technical people know
all of the information about the products, deal types, etc.  However, do
they know that for example, PID ""123"" maps back to Product ""ABC""?  I would
think the technical people are the ones that know how this codes map back to
specific product information on your system.

2) Could you provide us a little background on why Credit term changed from
""Required"" to ""Implied"" during the last version of the DTD that we received
from you?

3) We sent this question a few days ago, but have not received a response:
There are several different parameter names specified for the XML that is
passed between systems.
The following is a list of those specified in the External Interface
Document:

Post Prices:  prices (Page 12, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Request Prices:  prices (Page 14, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Attempt Transaction: txn (Page 16, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Post Product Set Data: xml (Page 26, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Post Credit Matrix: xml (Page 28, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)

Should all of the parameter names be ""xml"" or should the parameter names for
Post Product Set Data and Post Credit Matrix be changed to reflect the
naming convention of the other use cases?

Using ""xml"" as the parameter name for all use cases will reduce the
redundancy of the code we'll need to write to route the data to our internal
interfaces.

4) We still have some concerns over having to maintain Enron's calendar on
our system since term is sent as part of the key.  We would like to discuss
alternatives for dealing with date interpretation.

5) We had asked a question earlier regarding business responses being sent
back within the same HTTP session.   We are going to assume that
confirmation comes back in the HTTP response since there has been no
interface defined for business responses.  We would like to confirm this
assumption in this meeting.

6) Is there going to be some capability of cancelling a transaction attempt
if for some reason we do not receive a response back from Enron on a
transaction attempt and a subsequent transaction search?

7) Would Enron consider posting all of their requests to a .asp file as
opposed to a file with no extension (ext_nrt.asp instead of ext_nrt)?  It is
a generally accepted practice to include file extensions when transporting
files.

Thanks again for everything David.  We will look forward to talking to you
later today!

Regards,
Maria

Maria,

I understand your concern and while I want to ensure we address product
mapping as the primary focus of the meetings, I asked if Jay Webb and/or
Mike Guadarrama could spend some time discussing your technical questions.
Jay and/or Mike will be available from 3-4 today to do just this.  I know
you've asked some technical questions already and are also interested in
credit mapping nevertheless, would you please provide a brief rundown of
the technical issues you want to discuss so that Jay/Mike can be prepared
in advance to make the best use of the hour?  Thanks.

The meetings will be attended by our Product Control Group who are
responsible for creating and maintaining all of Enron's product types and
products.  They are the experts when it comes knowing all the various ways
Enron represents and implements products on EnronOnline.  Other than
myself, the four attendees will be Sheri Thomas, who heads the Product
Control group, Jennifer deBoisblanc-Denny, who heads the products area of
the group and two experts in gas and power products.

Look forward to hearing from you soon so I can inform Jay and Mike.

Regards
-David

There will be people there that understand the products in non-technical
detail.

When were you thinking we could involve your ""technical"" people?  I agree
with the agenda and strongly agree that we need to understand each other
products before we can attempt an integration.  However, my team's
reponsibility is to figure out how to ""technically"" send/receive and map
information from your system.  If this is not going to be addressed the
first day, than perhaps some of them don't need to come.  I guess I'm now
concerned that the second two hour meeting isn't going to be long enough to
provide my team the information they need proceed with their technical
implementation.  I understand that the documents you've sent me should
address most of our questions, but each revision has left my team with more
questions and confusion about how this is all going to work.

Will Jay Webb be in either meeting?  Could you send us a list of the
attendees on your side and their roles/functions as well.   We want very
much to make these meetings as productive as possible, understanding that
your team as well as mine are very very busy.

I appreciate your help,

Maria

Thanks for the finalized list.  I assume that one or more of the people
below will be able to speak in detail about gas and power products outside
of the technical domain?  The people from Enron that will attend the
meeting are non-technical.  Their area of expertise lies in the arena of
products and their management.  I just want to make sure that we have
people that will be speaking the same language.

Oh, I see, my misunderstanding.  We are in 3 Greenway Plaza.  Two 2-hour
meetings is fine with us. No problem in us driving downtown.  However,
could
we schedule from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 on the 8th, and from 10:00 to 12:00 on
the 9th?  I have a conflict on the 8th.

The agenda looks fine.  If there are any additional XML-type questions left
to answer by the time we have the meeting, we may want to allow some time
to
discuss them.

Thanks again David, looking forward to meeting in person.

Maria,

Actually, I was suggesting 2 hours on both the 8th and the 9th of November
for getting together to discuss mapping issues.  If November 8th and 9th
isn't good for you, we can try November 9th and 10th.  I would say let's
just get together for one, four hour meeting but it is difficult to get the
Product Control people together for that length of time since they are
integral to the day to day operations of EnronOnline.  (I am assuming you
are in downtown Houston.  If getting here is difficult then we can try to
arrange a one day meeting.) Any thoughts on the suggested dates/times?

As far as the number of meetings required, from our point of view we just
need to accomplish product and counterparty mappings.  The agenda below
addresses products and a follow-up would address counterparties.  Beyond
that, the External Interface Document and DTD should address all the
technical issues that enable you to design and construct your part of the
system.  I'll send you the most recent External Interface Document and DTD
shortly.

Please let me know you thoughts on the proposed agenda.  I'm sure we can
work out an agreeable schedule.

Regards,
David

Agenda
11/8/2000 10:00-12:00  Clarification of product representation and product
creation
process.

It is important to understand each other's methods for representing
products and the process by which we create new products prior to jumping
in to the mapping problem.

11/9/2000 10:00-12:00  Map schedule A products.

It is important to not only know which products of ours map to yours but
what process can be applied to make mapping easily repeatable.

Hi David,

Sorry for not getting back to you sooner.  I was out of the office

2
hours is not going to be enough. Do you expect this to be the first of

Regarding a meeting next week, I think we're going to have to postpone
until the following week.  How does November 8 & 9 look for you?  I've

Richard/Maria,

Attached please find the 'treatments' for the various Tokenized reference
periods currently in use for US Nat Gas and US Power.  I believe you will
find these spreadsheets easier to translate than the previous.  Let me know
what you think.  As you've pointed out it is critical that we are both on
the same page when it comes to our treatments of these reference periods;
however, I do believe this is an issue that we can work through together.
I would suggest that we get together again for another couple hours once
you've had the chance to review not only the info I've provided to date but
also the list of Schedule A products that I plan to provide on Wednesday.
As always, feel free to drop me a note or give me a call anytime.

Regards,
David

P.S.  Please keep in mind that the present structure of the TRP's do not
contemplate weekends that breach a calendar month, and holidays.  For
example, a US Nat Gas Day Ahead product (Number XXXX)  being offered after
11:00 a.m. on a Thursday the 27th will provide a TRP Product for Saturday
the 29th, Sunday the 30th, and Monday the 1st. Since our trading areas
would not want to breach the current calendar month, they would create two
date-specific products; Number YYYY for Saturday the 29th through Sunday
the 30th, and Product Number ZZZZ for Monday the 1st.

Power TRP Treatment.xls)(See attached file: West Power TRP Treatment.xls)

A question has come up that may have serious implications for our system.
Please forward to the right person, we would really appreciate it if we
could have a response as soon as possible.

The question is ""How many transaction attempts can be sent by Enron to True
Quote at one time(will Enron be sending more than transaction in a batch)?""
Your documentation seems to read that you may be sending more than one
transaction at a time.  If that is true, then we may have a problem if you
plan to send transaction searches that would force us to cancel all of the
previous transaction attempts that were sent over together, since our system
processes items in sequential order.

Please call me if the question seems confusing.

Subject: FW: Fill or Kill - Buy or Sell from Enron Traders


Good morning David,

Here's another clarifying question.  I have in my notes documentation that
says that Enron will do partial fills of transactions sent to EOL. The
question that being asked in the attached note has to do with transactions
sent by EOL to TrueQuote.  Does Enron want (or will Enron accept) partial
fills by the True Quote system? If so, how should we identify (if at all)
that this was a partial fill?

Thanks David.

Subject: Fill or Kill - Buy or Sell from Enron Traders


Maria,

Matt raised a question regarding transaction attempts made by Enron Traders
directly against the True Quote system (not going through EOL).  This is a
two scenario question:

1)  If an Enron trader is initiating a buy in the True Quote system against
a counterparty's position to sell at a specified price and volume (ie:
15,000 @ 2.40 - which is currently a valid market in True Quote), at the
point the transaction is being executed in the system, the volume drops to
10,000, would our Enron want to fill whatever quantity they can at the given
price.  Currently we are interpreting all transactions made directly from
Enron into the True Quote system will be entered as a Fill or Kill.
Will Enron allow partial fills of transaction attempts?
Also, should the successful transaction attempt consist of several parties,
will Enron accept this (3 parties of 5,000 each)?
Do we send back a response identifying a FILL for the partial volume and
FAIL for the remaining volume?

2)  Reverse the statement for an attempt of Enron to Sell a volume against a
counterparty's position to buy.  Is Enron willing to sell partial volumes
should the market not be there to fill Enron's order completely?

Chris,

Wayne and I have reviewed this transcript from the conversation with Enron.
During that conversation, several items were to be worked offline.  These
are detailed and are listed as ""To be worked offline"" in Exhibit B, C, D,
and E.

Would you like to have EnFORM participate in your discussion with Enron, or
do you feel that these items are strategically sensitive enough that you
should have this conversation without EnFORM's involvement?

These ""To be worked offline"" issues are very important, but we do have
additional technical questions that would best be addressed by a technical
Enron contact.  If we could begin the process of a establishing a technical
""relationship"" with an individual at Enron as soon as possible, it would
speed development and lower costs of this project.

P.S.  Wayne was next to me as I typed this note.

Regards,
Maria

The following questions were discussed in the telephone conference call with
Enron on September 26th.  We have inserted Enron's answers in Blue and have
highlighted follow-ups and offline discussions in Red.


Questions for Enron to answer regarding True Quote's interface:

High Priority Questions (need to be addressed):
(From Exhibit A) Will the product ID that Enron is transmitting specifically
identify a product offering including commodity, deal type, region /
location, and tradable term (fully qualified begin and end dates)?

Product ID is a fully transactable item - Product, Location, Dates
Product ID is a fully qualified instrument - excluding price, volume and
counterparty
Product ID can be for next day and balance of month.  However, on next to
last day of month, the Product ID will offer either next day or BOM, not
both (there is no reason for redundancy)
Product ID that is for anything, except for the rolling Tokenized
products/dates (example: For a spot month, the Product ID will expire on the
first day of that spot month)
Currency and Unit of measure is implied as part of Product ID, but it is not
an attribute


(From Exhibit B) Can we confirm a transaction attempt against Enron for an
Enron product id is a ""Fill or Kill"" transaction, meaning, a transaction
attempt submitted to Enron would not stay in their system if it was not
immediately filled.  If the deal is not confirmed by Enron, the order will
be immediately removed from Enron's system and could not be filled later if
market conditions made the order viable.

A transaction attempt by TrueQuote will be ""Fill or Kill"" (It will not in
stay in EOL's system)

If the deal is not confirmed by Enron due to non-availability of volume,
these volumes need to be expired in the True Quote system

If a transaction attempt fails for ANY reason, Enron will immediately
rebroadcast that Product to the True Quote system

Does True Quote need to design functionality for partial fill of a deal
transaction for an outside entity?

Enron will do partial fills.  The True Quote system needs to design
functionality to accept partial fills from an outside entity.

What is the time threshold for waiting on an Enron response to a transaction
attempt?

Enron will accept whatever True Quote determines is an acceptable threshold
for waiting.

What is the estimated delivery date for Enron's DTDs?

The EnronOnline Exchanges External Interface Document was received on
Monday, October 2, 2000.

Exhibit A (Enron Price Interface-what Enron sends to TQ):

Concerning the Enron price interface, Enron has stated that EOL currently
handles prices/volume updates at the rate of 100 updates per second, growing
potentially to 500 per second (across all EOL product offerings).  Given
this level of update activity, how will the transmission of these updates be
accomplished?  Below are some questions which should clarify these concerns:

What is the expected rate of updates for the sub-set of EOL products that
will be transmitted to the True Quote platform?  Is it expected that these
products will also endure update activity at the rate of 100-500 updates per
second?

Although it was not communicated how often an XML document will be sent, it
was clarified that the XML documents will be sent at certain time
intervals.Each update will contain all information since last time polled
(includes all changes (only changes) since last transmission)
Need to clarify if True Quote will be polling EOL for Updates, or if EOL
will send them automatically at certain time intervals.

Will there be one XML document interface transmission for each Enron product
update, or will one XML document interface contain updates for multiple
Enron products?  The implications of this are as follows:  Will True Quote
need to handle 100-500 XML documents per second, or will True Quote receive
one XML document at a determined interval that has updates for all Enron
products?  If the XML document contains updates for all Enron products, how
often will Enron send us the document?   If it's one XML document per Enron
product, will True Quote be expected to handle 100-500 XML document
submissions per second?

The XML document will contain updates for multiple Product IDs.  If only one
Product ID has changed in EOL since the last transmission, then only one
Product ID will be sent to True Quote in the updates.

Can we confirm that Enron will only submit one price/volume offering per
Enron product id; meaning, Enron will never have multiple price and quantity
offerings for the same Enron product ID on the True Quote platform.

Enron will never send Market Depth for any Product ID.  What you see on EOL
is exactly what is transmitted to True Quote (one offering per Enron Product
ID).  However, each Product ID update will contain both the Bid and the
Offer.

The interface currently does not have a field to define the duration of the
order.  Given this, can we assume that when the price interface submits a
product price/volume update to the True Quote platform, the order will be
loaded with a duration of ""Good Until Canceled"".  True Quote will mark the
order as 'GTC' until Enron submits a new XML document for that Enron product
that changes the status to ""Suspended"".  In this case True Quote would
cancel the order on the True Quote system.

All orders will remain on the True Quote system until the EOL traders pull
the deals.  At this time, EOL would send ""Suspended Status"" for the Product
ID.

How are terms related to Enron Product IDs?  Example:  For a given Enron
commodity, deal type, and location that is traded in October, would a new
product id be created for that same product offering when the month rolls to
November?
 Yes

If product ids do not include a direct relationship to a specific tradable
term, when a Price Interface XML document is submitted to the True Quote
platform, how will True Quote know which trade term the product id is
associated with?
Product IDs do have a direct relationship to a specific tradable term

We are currently assuming that an Enron product id specifically identifies a
product offering including commodity, deal type, region/location, and
tradable term.
This assumption is correct

Can we confirm that all Enron orders transmitted to the True Quote platform
will be cancelled at the end of the day and that all products will be
re-loaded into the True Quote system the following morning?  If not,  will
the assumed 'Good Until Canceled' duration for each product id remain active
until the status has been changed to ""Suspended""?

All EOL orders should be removed by the traders at the end of the day.  For
those that are not removed, True Quote should run a nightly batch job that
removes all EOL orders left in the system.  Each morning, True Quote will
authenticate with EOL, and at this time, all orders on EOL will be
transmitted to True Quote.

Exhibit B (Transaction Interface with Enron):

For each field (across all interfaces), we will need clearly defined data
types (precision, range of length, space/bytes it takes).

This information still needs to be provided.

Can we assume the Bid/Ask flag is an integer? Perhaps a bit?  If it's a
character, what is the character indicator?  B/A?

This information still needs to be provided.

Can we confirm the data type for volume is integer?

This information still needs to be provided.

Across all interfaces, there is not a defined unit of measure for price and
volume by Enron product id.   Should part of the XML DTD specify the unit of
measure for both price and volume, or are we to assume that Enron product
ids for Power are in US dollars and megawatt/hr, and Enron product ids for
natural gas are US dollars and MMBTU?

Currency and Unit of measure is implied as part of Product ID, but it is not
an attribute

Price - how many decimal places? (precision of the number)

This information still needs to be provided.

Volume and Price - Does Enron have an min / max / default increment value
established for price and volume increment ranges by Enron product id?  (For
example, within True Quote the default volume increment for natural gas is
5000, and the price increment is $0.0025.  Both the price and volume
increments, min/max ranges can vary by region or location).

On EOL, the traders determine the minimal tradable increments and the
minimal tradable amounts (this minimums could be as low as 1).

To be worked Offline:
How to handle increments <> 5000 increment on the Enron side (will we only
display the 5000 increment below the volume submitted by Enron, if trader
has a minimum greater than entities are willing to participate, how do we
display this and how does the minimum increment come across in the order)


Can we confirm a transaction attempt against Enron for an Enron product id
is a ""Fill or Kill"" transaction, meaning, a transaction attempt submitted to
Enron would not stay in their system if it was not immediately filled.  If
the deal is not confirmed by Enron, the order will be immediately removed
from Enron's system and could not be filled later if market conditions made
the order viable.  If the deal is not confirmed by Enron due to
non-availability of volume, these volumes need to be expired in the True
Quote system.

Already answered above.

Will Enron allow partial fill of transactions?   For example, if the Enron
price interface submits an offer with 20,000 mmbtu available, can True Quote
submit a transaction bid attempt to take only 10,000 mmbtu of the Enron
offer?   If not, is it a valid assumption that we can only submit a
transaction attempt to lift the entire Enron offer of 20,000 mmbtu?

Enron will allow partial fills.

Exhibit C (True Quote Price Interface-what TQ sends to Enron):
Does Enron expect True Quote to submit a single price point offering for an
Enron product id that is the aggregate total volume of all orders available
for that product id on the True Quote platform at the best available price?
This would allow Enron to submit a transaction attempt against the True
Quote platform, submitting a volume request that would potentially sweep
multiple counter parties creating deals with all entities necessary to
satisfy transaction attempt.
Alternative 2:  Does Enron expect True Quote to submit only the best
individual order (the best price and volume for an Enron product id from
only one counterparty) identified by its True Quote order id (True Quote
would not transmit the counter party id; however, before sending the XML
interface to Enron, the counterparty would have to pass the credit rules
maintained in the counterparty credit matrix on the True Quote platform).
Alternative 3:  Would Enron expect True Quote to submit multiple price
offerings per Enron product id (a market depth of various price and volume
offerings).  In this scenario, the volume associated with each price point
should be an aggregate of multiple True Quote orders (as shown in the True
Quote market screen).  The XML interface could potentially transmit
individual True Quote orders and their associated volumes (not an aggregate
volume of multiple orders); however, giving Enron the ability to 'pick and
choose' individual orders could potentially violate True Quote customer
service agreements that require deals to be executed in the chronological
sequence that the order request was received by the True Quote platform.

Enron wants to see the granularity of each True Quote Product ID order.
Enron expects True Quote to submit multiple price offerings per Enron
Product ID.  (Example:  If  True Quote has an order in the system for
100,000 MMbtu's at $3.00, which is comprised of 10 individual orders of
10,000, Enron wants True Quote to send all of the individual orders).

To be worked Offline:
Fair and equitable treatment with prices sent to Enron (proper processing of
orders without bias)
Need to discuss in more detail how to handle EOL price interface
transactions and Enron Trader transactions
Need to clarify with Enron whether they want to receive the best price in
the market for a given Product ID, or if they want to see all of a given
Product ID's market depth.

Our concern is that if True Quote transmits individual True Quote orders and
their associated volumes (not an aggregate volume of multiple orders),
giving Enron the ability to 'pick and choose' individual orders, this could
potentially violate True Quote customer service agreements that require
deals to be executed in the chronological sequence that the order request
was received by the True Quote platform.


Exhibit D (Sponsor Transaction Interface):
Are we correct in assuming that transactions posted by Enron traders against
True Quote deals will be executed on the True Quote system?  Will the
duration of the order attempts being sent to True Quote be ""Fill or Kill"" or
some other duration?

To be worked Offline:
The traders will want to transact against True Quote directly without
adjusting the market position through EOL, but how this is accomplished will
be to be discussed.

Exhibit E (Counterparty Interface):
In general, we need more details about what Enron will be sending as part of
their daily counterparty credit / term interface, as well as the intra-day
counterparty credit/term interface:
Currently, exhibit E does not specific any fields or data types within an
XML DTD.
What are the ""terms"" under which participants can trade with Enron?  For
example, will the level of restriction include volumetric limits, financial
limits, tradable date range limits (number days or months into the future)
by Enron product id (assuming a product id specifically defines a commodity,
deal-type, region/location, and tradable term).  Will Enron send us a 'yes /
no' flag to turn off/on a counterparty's ability to trade with Enron by the
Enron product id?

To be worked Offline:
Credit terms and counterparty interface details were not addressed in the
teleconference.  The details of granularity will need to addressed to better
understand the responsibilities that True Quote will have in handling
Enron's credit structure.


Questions for True Quote to Answer:

Exhibit D:  Does the Sponsor Transaction interface (Enron proposing
transactions on the True Quote platform) still invoke the Enron Transaction
Interface?  There was some discussion that if internal Enron traders
proposed transactions against the True Quote platform, the point of
transaction would be the True Quote platform, and True Quote would not have
to invoke the transaction on the EOL platform.  True Quote would simply
confirm whether the Enron transaction attempt succeeded or failed.  If it
succeeded, True Quote would send a confirmation XML interface to confirm the
deal had been executed and transmit the True Quote Deal ID to Enron.
What is the time threshold for waiting on Enron's response to a transaction
attempt?  For example, after 'n' seconds the True Quote platform should
alert a system operator that an Enron transaction attempt has failed to
return either a confirmation or failure.

Please respond to the questions above.

Thank you.

* Product ID
* Product ID is a fully transactable item  and fully qualified instrument -
Includes: Product, Location, Dates; Excludes: Price, Volume and Couterparty
* Tokenized Dates:  Product ID for next day and balance of month are
tokenized dates which means that the product ID will remain the same for
designated date range (next day, next 2 days, BOM, etc).  The dates will
role, but the product ID will remain the same
* Product IDs for anything but the rolling Tokenized products/dates (i.e. -
spot month), expire after date has been reached.
* There will be no redundancy of product IDs that encompass the same date
ranges (i.e.:  there are usually two separate product IDs for next day and
balance of month, but when the next to the last day of the month is reached,
both will reference the same day.  At this point, Enron will only have one
product ID associated with the given date range)
* Enron has set up product IDs to adequately reflect Weekend trading on
Friday (deals entered for Saturday will encompass Sat - Mon (and include
extra days when Holidays are involved))
* Once a strip term has been reached, trades within the month then change to
the tokenized product IDs.
* Enron will Fill or Kill all transaction attempts - they will execute or
cancel the trade immediately
* Enron will Partial fills transaction attempts
* When True Quote sends a request for a transaction, the threshold for
waiting on a response from Enron will be defined by True Quote.
* Trade failure will re-broadcast product (failure for any reason)
* If for any reason there is a concern about a product, True Quote can
request (HTTP) validation of the product in question
* Frequency of updates:  Enron will send True Quote a document that contains
all information since last time polled (includes all changes (only changes)
since last transmission)
* Every product sent will have only one bid and offer price associated with
it at time of transmission.  What you see on EOL is what is sent to True
Quote.
* There will be no market depth transmitted to True Quote from Enron
* Duration of orders
* Orders will be displayed on True Quote until suspended by traders
* All orders will remain on system until traders pull deals
* True Quote session is finite (7 -7).  At the end of every day all deals
will be removed from True Quote (either by Enron traders removing them, or
TRUE QUOTE will run a batch job to clear Enron deals).  In the morning, TRUE
QUOTE will authenticate and all products will be loaded from Enron to TRUE
QUOTE.
* The Currency and Unit of measure are implied as part of Product ID, it's
not an attribute.
* Granularity of orders transmitted from True Quote to Enron will show each
order associated with each price and volume of a Product ID (i.e. 100,000
mmbtu @ $5 is made up of 10 separate orders of 10,000, Enron would like to
see all 10 orders of 10,000 - including counterparty information)
* Transaction attempts made from True Quote to EOL - Point of execution will
be on EOL
* Transaction attempts made by Enron Traders against True Quote price
postings will be executed on True Quote

Offline:
* Will we know if a transaction has failed due to volume not available,
credit failure, or Enron has not heard of the transaction
* How to handle increments <> 5000 increment on the Enron side (will we only
display the 5000 increment below the volume submitted by Enron; if trader
has a minimum tradable volume greater than entities are willing to
participate (i.e. Enron minimum tradable amount is 10,000 or 15,000) how do
we display this and how does the minimum increment come across in the order)
* If we transmit to Enron the granularity of all orders (including
counterparty information), how will True Quote / Enron ensure the fair and
equitable treatment with prices sent to Enron (proper processing of orders
without bias)
* Business question: how much do we want to send Enron (they are ok with
sending each order for all price points in an instrument), do we show top 1
or top 5?
* Need to discuss in more detail how to handle EOL price interface
transactions and Enron Trader transactions

David,

Can you confirm the answer to Stewart's question.  We just want to make
absolutely sure we know what you mean when you say ""fill or kill"".  Thanks!

Maria,

Please confirm with David that NO partial fills refers *only* to transaction
attempts.  We fully expect that Enron will send us (potentially) large
volumes via. the price posting interface; then, we may execute multiple
transaction attempts for that EOL product ID to Enron via. the transaction
attempt interface.  These individual transaction attempts could be much
smaller (in volume) than the volume posted via. the price posting interface.

Basically, the way we understand it is... the individual transaction
attempts will be 'all or nothing'; however, we can break the large price
post down and transmit multiple (smaller) transaction attempts against that
large price post volume.

I believe we are all in agreement on this, but it never hurts to be
absolutely sure concerning something of this magnitude and importance.

Thanks,

-Stewart

I've spoken the David Fisher at Enron this morning.  The conference call
will Andy Zipper and Jay Webb cannot be arranged until next Thursday (Dec.
14). David will send details later.

David has asked us to assume that there will be NO partial fills on either
side. He believes that even if they agree to do this it will likely be a
""day 2"" enhancement and not a functionality that is part of the January 5th
deliverables. He is also requesting that we focus on completing the
functionality that will allow Enron to post prices on True Quote and will
allow True Quote to execute transactions on EOL.  In addition, another
priority needs to be to have the credit functionality completed.  These are
going to be the requirements that need to be tested by December 18th and
need to be in production by January 5th.

True Quote's ability to send prices to Enron and accept transaction attempts
from EOL is secondary at this point and not likely to be a requirement that
needs to be met by January 5th.

Please let me know if there is any reason why the execution engine will not
be ready to accept price posts from EOL and send transaction requests
(assuming only full orders will be filled) by December 18th.  If there is
any concern about getting credit functioning within that timeframe, please
let me know this as soon as possible, as well.  Thanks for all of your help.
You all are key contributors to this project and without your awesome
knowledge and skills, we would never be able to complete this project in the
timeframe that we're being asked to complete it in.  I really appreciate
your efforts.

Stew & Richard,

I would be surprised if Enron was willing to store the minimum qty, but what
about sending it in the transaction request as an additional attribute?
Might they be talked into that?  This would be better for us since we should
not have to worry about maintaining our system information on the Enron
platform.

How about proposing that both platforms send the min & increment volume
requirements?  This would be more complex for us now, but might be better in
the long run for both platforms.  We would be more flexible and better able
to integrate with outside systems if we were able to accept this type of
information.  It get complicated because you could only fill where the two
requirements (our and the outside system) were compatible, but it is
do-able.  Thoughts?

Dennis &  Chris...

One other EOL scenario we forgot to talk about this evening was the scenario
where:

1)  EOL post 20,000 / day to our platform via. the price post interface...
2)  A True Quote customer submits a request to do 15,000 / day...
3) TQ submits a transaction attempt to EOL for 15,000 day...
4)  EOL only has 14,000 remaining, so they deny the entire transaction
attempt...

However, if Enron's system was aware that we would take partially filled Gas
orders in minimum increments of 5,000, EOL could have partially filled the
transaction request for 10,000.

Any news on that scenario?  I'll talk to Maria first thing in the morning...
perhaps this one is already resolved?   I would think it would be in EOL's
best business interest to store our minimum volumes, so EOL could always
fill us at least partially rather than deny the entire transaction.
However, it really doesn't matter to us (technically) we'll just cancel the
entire EOL transaction attempt and continue our sweep and fill the volume
with the next available counterparty.   Whereas if they partially filled us,
we would probably cancel the original transaction attempt, and rebuild a new
transaction deal ID for the 10,000 / day deal.... then continue the sweep
for the final 5,000 from the next available counterparty.

I haven't reviewed this scenario with the deal execution team yet, but if
EOL *did* partially fill us with *at least* our minimum, it would probably
be no more or less complex for us because even in a scenario where EOL
denies a transaction attempt, we ALREADY must have the logic to cancel the
EOL deal transaction attempt, and create a new order with the next available
counterparty (to fill the volume request).   So, if EOL did partially filled
us, we would simply cancel the original transaction request that was for the
full volume amount, and create a new deal with EOL for the partial volume
they confirmed, as opposed to creating a new deal with a different
counterparty.  Only one additional deal would have to be created with the
next available counterparty to fill the last 5,000 of the original request.
Seems simply enough... and it would be in EOL's best interest to fill our
transaction attempts partially so they would complete our transaction
attempts more often....   if they don't fill us partially, EOL will probably
end-up denying many of our transaction attempts if the exact volume is not
available.  hmm.... what do ya'll think?

Maria,

Stewart is correct in his understanding of no parital fills.  I will
reiterate his statements through the following examples:

If Enron posts a gas product with 50,000 MMBTU available and TrueQuote
attempts a transaction on 30,000 MMBTU, the attempt will be successfull if
the following 3 criteria are met:

1.  30,000 MMBTU is still available when the transaction hits EOL.
2.  30,000 MMBTU meets the minimum volume for the product as set by the
trader.
3.  30,000 MMBTU meets the increment volume for the product as set by the
trader.

Examples of how the 3 criteria above come into play:

1.  If when TrueQuote attempts to transact on 30,000 MMBTU, the volume
available for the product drops to below 30,000 MMBTU, the transaction will
fail.
2.  If TrueQuote attempts to transact on 30,000 MMBTU but the EOL trader
has set the minimum volume for the product to 40,000 MMBTU, the transaction
will fail.
3.  If TrueQuote attempts to transact on 32,500 MMBTU but the EOL trader
has set 5,000 MMBTU increments, the transaction will fail.

I set-up a meeting with Jay Webb and Andy Zipper for next Friday.  That is
the earliest we all could meet.  Once we talk, I'll coordinate a conference
call with you.  For the time being let's stay the course.

Regards,
David

All,

In my haste to begin the four day weekend last week, I failed to send the 
status update I promised in my earlier note.  Below is a slightly tardy but 
nonetheless riveting Exchange Linking Status Update.

1.  Exchange Linking Software Development - Functional development was 
completed on schedule and we are currently performing testing of the Beta 
release.  Initial testing has gone very well.  
     A final release is scheduled for January 15th.  I will be working with 
Victoria Storey from the Operations group in turning over external testing of 
the system.  A deployment plan has been submitted to
     Operations to assist them with the rollout.

2.  Exchange Linking GUI - Development is complete and testing is being 
conducted.

3.  Product Mapping -  Product Control Group continues their effort of 
coordinating with TrueQuote the products covered under Schedule A of the 
contract.  Points of contact have been arranged 
      between Enron (Rob Cass) and TrueQuote (Richard Toubia) to continue the 
coordination effort required to support ongoing product mapping.

4.  Hardware - All network and server hardware has been received and 
installed.  

5.  Leased Lines - Anchi Z. has been coordinating with each exchange's 
network POC and assisting in obtaining T-1 lines to support this project.  In 
the absence of T-1 lines, both TrueQuote and Houston
     Street will be using VPN connectivity to conduct testing.  We should be 
up and running with TrueQuote by 28 December so that testing can begin.  
Houston Street does not anticipate being ready to 
     test anything until the end of February. 

6.  Bridging - Downstream system bridging modifications have been made to 
accommodate the addition of an external exchange id and an external exchange 
deal number.

7.  TrueQuote has stated that they will not make the contract date with 
regard to some of the functionality of their system.  They hope to be able to 
fully act as a client exchange but are not prepared to
      take on the role of an external exchange (i.e. handle transaction 
attempts from Enron.)

8.  Houston Street is back in the picture.  Their stated contract date is 
December 4th + 120 calendar days.  This gives them some breathing room.  They 
have canned Sapient, built their own internal 
      IT team, purchased messaging software from Web Methods and changed 
hosting providers.  They will no longer use Genuity out of Boston but Data 
Return out of Dallas for their hosting needs.

Please advise if you have any questions or comments.

Chris,

The System Test environment has not been available this morning for a couple
of reasons.  During the code migration code last evening which resolved the
problem of Power Prices not displaying correctly, an unrelated problem arose
with one of the application controls that handles some of the grid display
features.  During one of the comipiles the .dll was corrupted.  This has
required us to rebuild the control and update the entire application to
reference the newly rebuilt contol's class id.  Although the Power products
have been active since last night, we have been unable to bring the system
test environment on-line for testing because of the corrupted application
control.  We anticipate that the system will be back up within the next
hour, by 2pm (barring any other unforeseen problems).  We apologize for any
inconvenience that we've caused for the Enron testing effort this morning.

To address Enron's concerns expressed to you during this morning's
conference call, here is what we are currently doing in each of these areas:

Performance of the system - We believe we know exactly what is causing the
performance problem.  However, the person that is best qualified to resolve
that problem has been extremely busy addressing other issues, such as
verifying that the integrity of the data and messages that are sent back and
forth are accurate.  This person will spend the majority of today and
tomorrow fine-tuning performance.  We have a very high degree of confidence
that we can improve performance in short order to the level that is
acceptable to Enron.

Power Prices - We observed some problems with the Power filters and took
these products offline yesterday so that we could work on the problem.  We
believe the problem has been resolved and have migrated the code to System
Test.  Although Power Prices are available right now, the System Test
environment is offline right now due to code migrations unrelated to the
power issue.

Notification of Failed Transactions - The concern is that when a user's
order results in an attempted transaction against EOL and a Failure message
is received from Enron, the True Quote system does not display a message to
the user explaining that Counterparty was not available to fill the order.
We have analysts working on the notification messages right now.  If a
user's order is submitted with a duration of 'Fill or Kill' and the order is
not filled at least partially, we plan to push a message notification to the
user stating the following:  ""Your order was received by the system;
however, no counterparties were available to fill your request"".  We may
also display a 'small print' disclaimer at the bottom of the message that
says:  *Orders may not be filled due to unavailable volume, credit
limitations, or another platform particpant acquiring the volume slightly
ahead of your order request.""  The wording of this message is pending
approval by True Quote executive management.    These changes will be
migrated to System Test this weekend.

Stress Testing - We are also concerned with the lack of stress testing that
we have been able to perform and have been concerned with amount of
realistic functionality testing that can be accomplished given the
compressed testing timeframe.  True Quote is dedicated to completing as much
functional testing and performance tuning as possible and will have our
entire team here all weekend to press forward with these efforts.  It was
our understanding that Enron and True Quote management had decided to forego
stress testing in order to take this system into production by March 12.  We
have assumed and planned for more rigorous stress testing using the System
Test environment AFTER March 12 to improve performance over the coming
weeks.  If management has now decided that a thorough and complete system
wide stress test is a pre-production requirement, then we agree that March
12 is not a realistic Go-Live date.

Yesterday, we received several errors from EOL when we attempted to login
and when we attempted to execute transactions.  The following is a list of
errors that we received throughout the day:

9:07 a.m. to 9:10 a.m.	Received three ""Internal Server Error - Unable to
process request"" messages
12:10 a.m.		Received three ""Internal Server Error - Unable to process
request"" messages
12:13 a.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with ""Failure: Broker user's session
invalid"" message
12:14 a.m.		Receved ""A connection with the server could not be established""
message
12:15 a.m.		Received ""Failure msg = User not found in session"" Code = ""Bus""
message
12:25 a.m. 		Received ""Internal Server Error - Unable to process request""
message
2:43 p.m.		Received two Attempt Transactions failed with ""Failure: Broker
user's session invalid"" messages
2:51 p.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with ""Failure: Broker user's session
invalid"" message
3:06 p.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with ""Failure: Broker user's session
invalid"" message
4:47 p.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with ""Counterparty has no offer access
to product"" message

We are concerned about the stability of the Enron servers.  Could you please
ask Bob in investigate why we are getting these types of errors throughout
the day?  We are also concerned that the process for verifying the status of
a transaction that has not completed in a reasonable amount of time is not
yet in place at Enron.  We see this as a critical process that must be in
place and working before we go live.  In addition, we have experienced
things like receiving messages that we had not anticipated, receiving random
credit updates that we thought we had agree that we would not receive, and
changes in XML attributes and content that we had not seen in previous
testing.

We are working very hard to address issues as quickly as we can and
appreciate very much having Matt Mottsinger addressing issues on Enron's
side as quickly as possible.  We will take their offer on using Matt to a
higher degree.  If it makes sense for him to be here at our site this
weekend, than we are happy to find him place to work in our environment, but
if it makes more sense to have him available from Enron's location, we can
stay in contact with him via telephone.

Chris:

As I explained in our phone conversation today, we will not go live on Monday as the performance on True Quote to date is not satisfactory.   In a joint meeting with True Quote on February 20, 2001 we discussed a testing plan that would target a go live date of March 12, 2001.  Due to consistent delays in delivery of the True Quote test sight and GUI, we have not been able to complete many aspects of the plan.  The limited testing we have done since getting a functional GUI on Wednesday has identified the following issues:

1. Unable to view and verify the test products for EnronOnline  Power.
2. Unable to verify failed transaction errors on the TrueQuote test site. No error messages are being sent when transactions fail. (only able to verify failures reasons that reach EOL).
3. Unable to stress test the system.
4. Prices and volume updates are being processed serially and are updating EXTREMELY slow.
5. Order History link on TQ test site does not appear to be functioning.  

In order to move this process along we would like to see significant progress by Monday March 12th.  In particular we would like to see the following:

1. At least 80% of the continuous price update standard of 20 - 25 updates per second
2. At least 80% of the peak price update standard of 100 - 200 updates per second
3. Ability to view and verify EnronOnline Power products
4. Ability to verify failed transactions on the True Quote

If we are able to see the progress on Monday we will need to begin stress testing immediately.  Throughout next week we will monitor progress on the stress testing and determine the next course of action.  The delays thus far have caused us to reschedule our testing teams calendar impacting other EnronOnline testing and roll-out.  Further delays will continue to impact our development and testing schedule.

As I mentioned I think it would be beneficial to have one of our testers working at your sight to make sure that we all are seeing the same issues and progress as True Quote.  We are agreeable to have one of our employees to your location to accomplish this.

I would also like to finalize discussions around the Access Agreement.  I will have Mark Greenberg send our comments.  Lets plan on talking on Monday to discuss the next step on this.

 Thanks

Bob:

Per our conversation this evening, I have requested an earlier update from
the team.  While it may be cutting it close, we are still confident the
system will be ready by Monday.  Stew is extremely confident the performance
issue will improve by fine tuning the stored procedures in the database.  We
are migrating the system tomorrow to our production environment.  This will
allow us the opportunity to flip the ""live"" switch the moment you and your
team gives the green light.  It will also allow us the flexibility of
working with the environment via a ""back door"" in our production facility.
This will actually expedite the process.  I suggest we chat in the morning
at your earliest convenience or 9AM CST, which ever comes first.  One issue
I need you to check on is your teams ability to quickly research the current
status of specific DEAL IDs.  I have heard from our team an issue during
today's testing whereby a DEAL ID was missing, and could not be readily
located by the EOL team.  I need to know from your side what was improper
about our request.  I am sure there is a simple explanation.

We are close to making this a reality.  I look forward to speaking with you
in the morning regarding the appropriate next steps.

Best regards,
Chris

I will be faxing our waiver shortly and will send two original execution counterparts by FedEx.  

I don't recall if you returned to us fully executed copies of the Amendment to the Subscription Agreement and the Amendment to the Posting Agreement.  If you have, great (did you send them to me?)  If not, please send executed copies as soon as you can.  Thanks.

I have formatted the volume numbers in the past to show the commas, but I forgot to do that yesterday. Thanks for pointing that out to me. I will make sure to format them in the future and I will send it out to the usual mailing list starting tonight.

Justin, can we get the comma separator for the total qty column ? Looks good though. If we can do that I would like to put this into production for usual mailing list.

Andy & Mike -

Attached are our revisions to the licensing agreement.  Based on our
business principle discussion, Peggy and I are comfortable that this round
of edits represents our mutual business intent.  In an effort to get this
to you as quickly as possible, though, we are sending this on for your
review in parallel with the review we are performing with Kenny.

Additionally, we have specifically left out the treatment for streaming
data to Enron affiliates as we wanted the opportunity to discuss your
suggested language with you further.  Lastly, we recognize that the
structure and content surrounding the indemnities and limitation of
liabilities cannot be truly finalized until the contractual business points
are fully agreed to.

Regards,
 Mark

Travis:
 
    Here  are my general comments on the May 1st draft of the TSH License Agreement  between Enron and Accenture.  I have not tried to provide detailed drafting  comments, but there are many, many problems with the draft.  I have limited  my comments to what I consider the bigger issues.  Some of my comments may  have already been addressed by Andy, but since I am starting fresh on this, I thought  that I would just comment on everything.  I look forward to talking with  you further about this.  
 
     1.    Which is the correct Enron entity?  I assume that this  should be an agreement with Enron Networks.  Does Accenture expect a parent  guaranty?  Does Accenture expect a broader exclusivity that binds Enron  Corp. and its affiliates?  I assume that we want to limit the scope of the  exclusivity to Enron Networks.
 
     2.    The description of EnronOnline is much too broad ""various  goods and raw materials"".  This needs to be limited to certain  products.
 
     3.    I don't understand why Accenture is licensing aggregate  data.  I thought the service to be established was to provide re-formatted  data to individual Enron customers.  That would require only  customer-specific data.
 
     4.    Will Enron be receive ""real time"" data transfers?   Will this be true in the sense that it will be the same time as Enron transmits  information to the customer?  I assume that there may be a lag in time  between the completion of a transaction and the transmission of the transaction  data.
 
     5.    In Section 2.1(a), the scope of the ""exclusive"" license  needs to be carefully thought through and narrowed as much as possible.   What is ""post-transaction data"", and why does Accenture need/want an exclusive  license on aggregate data?  Also regarding the exclusive license, we need  to consider all necessary exceptions to the exclusivity, such as Enron's  internal use, transmission to the customer, etc.  Also, all transmissions  of customer-specific data require the customer's prior consent; the exclusivity  should apply only if that consent is  obtained by Accenture, and only for  as long as that consent is valid.
 
     6.    One key aspect of an exclusive license is how it is  terminated.  Normally there are increasing minimum royalties associated  with the licensee's continued exclusive rights.  Often the licensee has the  right not to pay the minimum royalties, in which case the license can convert to  a non-exclusive or the license can terminate.
 
     7.    In Section 2.1(a), there is a reference to Accenture's  right to sublicense.  This right needs to be carefully narrowed and clearly  stated.  Can Accenture remarket the data to anyone other than the  customer?
 
     8.    The term ""Customer"" is confusing.  In Section 2.1(b),  it would seem to relate only to EnronOnline customers, but later in that section  it speaks of ""its [Accenture's] customers.  In the definition schedule, the  term is not limited to EnronOnline's customers.
 
     9.    In Section 2.2, the same comments in points 5 apply to the  exclusive license of the software.
 
     10.    There is a reference in Section 2.2 to ""updates and  revisions.""  Will Enron be responsible for these?  What continuing  services will Enron be obligated to offer for the software?  Will Enron be  entitled to receive and use any improvements or updates that Accenture may make  to the software?
 
     11.    Should the scope of the license be limited  geographically?  Why is it worldwide?  If it is worldwide, what  happens if Accenture does not market in some countries?  Is Enron excluded  from using or licensing the data in those countries?
 
     12.    In Section 2.3, I assume that Enron will dictate the  format of the data to be received, and that Enron may revised that format from  time to time.
 
     13.    Section 2.3(a) has some language that says that Enron will  provide... the interface between Accenture and Enron?... and ""any other software  developed by or on behalf of Enron necessary for Accenture to perform its  obligations to its Customers?  That is ridiculously broad.  What  obligations to Accenture's customers?  I can't imagine that Enron would  give Accenture additional software for ""free"", especially if Enron spent  considerable amounts developing it.  Additional software may require  additional license fees, etc.
 
     14.    The concept of service levels and service level  credits (in Section 2.3) is typical in service agreements.  I wonder what  Accenture has in mind.  They certainly resist any meaningful service levels  or credits when they are providing service.
 
     15.    Section 2.4 is truly amazing.  It is so broad that  Accenture could argue that anything Enron does adversely affects Accenture and  that Enron has to pay Accenture...  If Enron is willing to provide  Accenture with a non-compete in addition to the exclusive license, then these  provisions need to be harmonized and carefully limited.  Perhaps Accenture  thought that this provision was for the benefit of Enron, in that it enables  Enron to complete potentially competitive transactions without violating the  exclusivity license (although in my view the language of the license doesn't  really reach this point).  We need to discuss the business points that  Accenture is trying to address in this section and start again with the  drafting.  
 
     16.    Section 2.5 is yet another twist  on exclusivity.  This also needs to be tied into the scope of the  exclusivity provisions.  If an Enron Customer hates Accenture and refuses  to do business with them, then what happens?  Can Enron provide the service  to that customer?  If so, what is the effect of the exclusive right in  Section 2.5?
 
     17.    Section 2.5 also contains a reference to ""co-branding  marketing"" activities, and requires Enron to support and assist Accenture.   This is much too broad.  Enron may or may not wish to engage in  ""co-branding marketing"" activities, and if so they need to be narrowly defined  at the time.
 
     18.    The exception in Section 2.5 to Enron's provision of the  data services is very troubling, as it would appear that Accenture is trying to  limit Enron's discretion in establishing its own pricing.  If Accenture  really wants this type of protection, we need to review it with antitrust  counsel.
 
     19.    The payment terms seem extraordinarily generous for  Accenture.  It would be highly unusual in my experience to have license  fees paid only once per year.
 
     20.    Not that I would know, but the minimum payments seem very  low to me.  The minimum payments is the best way to establish whether  Accenture has met its obligations to market, etc., so that it can keep its  exclusive rights.  I would think that the minimum fees would be  significantly higher.  They could be indexed to the number of transactions,  customers or transaction value of EnronOnline, so that if EnronOnline grew  faster than expected, Accenture would have to keep pace or loose its  exclusivity.
 
     21.    The use of ""Gross TSH Revenues"" as part of the formula for  royalties is typical, but it presents a very significant challenge because  Accenture will have other relationships with its customers and may under price  this service (e.g., as a loss leader), and try to make their money on consulting  services.    It would be better for Enron if we could come up  with a transaction fee, that Accenture would have to pay Enron for each  transaction/transmission of data to a customer (indexed appropriately), and then  let Accenture worry about how it makes money.
 
     22.    We need to consider the tax issues further.  I think  that the fees paid to Enron for data transmission/resale and for the software  may be subject to state sales tax.  Accenture should be responsible for at  least the taxes related to the data transmission/resale.  If it is  reselling these services to its customers, it can provide Enron with a resale  exemption certificate.  The license of software is probably not subject to  the same exemption and may be taxable in any event.  That would require us  to split the revenue stream between the two types of services (data and  software), or run the risk that the whole stream is taxable regardless of the  resale certificate.  We need to consider these issues further with tax  counsel.
 
     23.    [I'll skip commenting on the IP provisions of Article IV  for now.  Suffice it to say that they need work.  But we need to work  out the business deal before worrying too much about these provisions.  But  they will be critical to our agreement with Accenture.]
 
     24.    The Term is another amazing provision.  First, five  years is a very long time in my view to have an exclusive license for this type  of new/evolving business.  Second, Accenture's proposal for a  unilateral option to extend it for five more years is a bold move.  But it  seems ridiculous to me that the minimum annual payments for those additional  years (of exclusive rights, I assume), would be fixed at $1 million.   Surely they jest.
 
     25.    Enron needs a way to terminate this license early, either  through a buy-out right or a termination for convenience with a payment.   Also, if Accenture is violating the terms of the license or otherwise violating  ""material"" terms of this Agreement (which we may have to identify), Enron should  have the right to terminate.  I have often used the approach that the  licensor should not be permitted to terminate except in the event of a payment  default, but we should seek much more.  Especially if Enron only gets paid  once a year.
 
     26.    I noticed that Accenture did not offer any  representations.  Some would be appropriate.
 
     27.    The liability/indemnity section is interesting in that it  lacks any indemnity by Accenture to Enron's benefit.  I would think that  Accenture would indemnify Enron for all claims by customers relating to  Accenture's service (e.g., mapping errors, translation errors, etc.), except if  directly related to Enron's error.  We need to discuss this risk  model.  We have to assume that EnronOnline's customers would come after  both Accenture and EnronOnline, and we need to consider how these claims should  be handled.
 
     28.    The limits of liability are interesting.  I wonder  what the story is behind the $25 million limit for us, and the $5 million limit  for them.
 
     29.    We would not accept the exclusions to the consequential  damages as drafted; and we would want to exclude claims related to Accenture's  breach of Enron's IP rights from any consequential damage limitation.   [That will get their attention.]
 
     30.    The ""worldwide license"" provisions of Section 9.1 require  some discussion.  I doubt that Enron intends to get consents for and make  all filings in countries where Accenture wants to sell these  services.
 
    See  you on Monday at 9:30am.  Feel free to call me earlier on Monday or at home  tonight (713 661-3279).

Andy and Mike -

Here is the second version of the draft contract. You will see that the
legal language reflects the proposed term sheet that we turned over on
Monday. After Mike debriefed with me and Kenny yesterday, we feel that
further business clarification is needed before we can translate this into
legal language.

Thanks,

Peggy

Mike -

Attached are our latest decks.....the service overview deck and then the
beginnings of the technical discussion deck.....they are coming along
nicely.

Also, on Cinergy and Conoco, I would consider those verbal commits. They
indicated strong enough interest, however, that we are engaging in trying
to get the commit via an LOI.

Joe, your spreadsheet needs to accurately reflect the status of each of
these clients so that we are not misrepresenting anything.

Thanks,

Peggy

Andy and Dave -

Attached below is the working deal sheet with Enron and Accenture's most
recent iterations and comments.

If you all could review our feedback and let us know your thoughts, that
would be great. Also, Dave, please let me know if you want to move forward
with the counsel discussion on Monday.

Informally and respectfully, I would like to comment on Enron's sentiment
that we have had six weeks to think about some of these things and as a
result, the ambiguity should already be gone. I appreciate this
point-of-view, but also want to share my perspective with you all:
     This is a nonstandard deal in terms of the traditional 'buyer seeks
     seller with needed asset'.  This traditional approach likely has the
     buyer in the market for that asset already.  All of the analysis to
     determine the value of that asset has most likely been completed.  As
     a result, the buyer probably has a strong sense of the value of that
     asset to their business and is ready to pull the trigger if the price
     is right.  Since Enron approached us with the service concept and the
     asset to be sold, this typical preexisting condition was not present.
     This is a big investment. It is not just the $5M, but an additional
     $15M in marketing, selling, designing, building, maintaining, and
     operating costs. Further, any delta between the $5M and the 30% TSH
     take due to Enron is additional investment for Accenture.  So, we are
     really evaluating a $20+M investment, not a $5M investment.
     There is not good historical evidence that transaction based
     businesses, on a stand alone basis, are sustainable over any long term
     horizon (just look at the dot.bomb bust).
     Pricing determination for a transaction based business is difficult
     and highly volatile. Our market review has proven this yet again.

I highlight these dynamics to explain, not excuse, our need to approach
things the way that we have. That being said, I will reiterate that we
would not even be performing this analysis (itself costly) if we did not
have the highest regards for Enron, our collective ability to do well in
the marketplace together, and a general bullishness for the value of this
offering.

I look forward to hearing from you all on Monday. Thanks,

Peggy

                    12:34 PM






     Kenny and Peggy,

     I have the following comments on the proposed deal sheet dated
4/17/01:

     -The keep whole commitment must be developed, but we are okay
with the concept of contributing the revenue of any direct distribute
deals minus our costs to the TSH.

     -We will provide Accenture with as much information as is
commercially reasonable that describes the nature of the EnronOnline
deal flow as it is occurring, for the purpose of aiding in marketing of
the service. We cannot send the entire transaction stream containing
non-subscribing entities for obvious privacy reasons.

     -The EnronOnline technology asset piece I have revised as
follows:

          o    EnronOnline technology asset is a part of the
deal
                    *    EnronOnline retains Intellectual
Property Rights (IPR) to 'Transaction Data Feed' software
                    *    Enron grants Accenture a fully
paid-up, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide,
non-assignable license to 'Smart Client' software.  Accenture is free to
develop the 'Smart Client' code and reuse it for any purpose related to
the operation of an Energy Transaction Support Hub, but Enron retains
IPR to all code provided by Enron within the context of this
arrangement.
                    *    EnronOnline provides interface
descriptions, design documentation and the actual code for the 'Smart
Client' software.

     I think this gets us to where we all need to be.

     -The ""Validate we are not off base...""  dependency is
irrelevant. Accenture has had six weeks to validate that. The 3 customer
hurdle presumably does that. Our firm understanding of Accenture's
position, stated by Kenny, is that if Accenture gets 3 customers to
verbally commit, then we are done. We would strongly prefer that
Accenture scrap the 3 customer litmus test, and move forward with the
transaction based on the recognized value of the offering and the many
other value factors for Accenture that have been previously discussed.

     Having said all this, we are friendly to the whole idea if it
actually gets to the stage where it is a firm proposal.

     Regards,
     Andy Zipper

Dave -

Attached are our comments and suggested changes. Please call to review.

On the time line for completion, we have four critical steps to complete:
     Finalize market analysis to refine business case, specifically
     projected revenue stream
     Complete counterparty surveying, including targeting 3 CPs for letters
     of intent
     Review Enron asset base for potential reuse/ licensing
     Contract negotiations

Joe will come back to us with an updated time line, but it is my
expectation that we are still on the same schedule (we just begun week
three) with possibly a week or so slippage.....contract negotiations will
probably be the critical path.

We will send our cut at the actual time line here shortly. Thanks,

Peggy

Andy, Dave, and Mike -

Appreciate the time this morning. I hope you all found it as productive as
we did.

Attached is the ""scrubbed"" version of the deck we reviewed this morning.  A
couple of key points:
     The dates are notional..  We hope to spend some time with you in the
     short term validating them.
     As Kenny mentioned today, we will need to perform a third workstream
     called 'Accenture Socialization and Buy-in' during the initial 6 week
     period.  This is in addition to the 'Market Analysis' workstream and
     'Target 5 Counterparties for Sign-up' workstream that we discussed
     earlier.
     Most of the business case and financial information has been removed
     with the exception of the projected base case revenue stream for
     Enron.   Although we removed this information from this document, we
     wanted to make sure that you know that we consider this to be the
     basis for our analysis to date and that it is available for all future
     discussions and worksessions that we have.

Again, thanks for this morning and we look forward to hearing from you all
soon.

Peggy

Andy & Mike -

Attached are our revisions to the licensing agreement.  Based on our
business principle discussion, Peggy and I are comfortable that this round
of edits represents our mutual business intent.  In an effort to get this
to you as quickly as possible, though, we are sending this on for your
review in parallel with the review we are performing with Kenny.

Additionally, we have specifically left out the treatment for streaming
data to Enron affiliates as we wanted the opportunity to discuss your
suggested language with you further.  Lastly, we recognize that the
structure and content surrounding the indemnities and limitation of
liabilities cannot be truly finalized until the contractual business points
are fully agreed to.

Regards,
 Mark

Here is an initial stab both a conservative and a pitch valuation of the opportunity. I view the assumptions in the conservative model as our worst case scenario, and, the assumptions in our pitch scenario as sellable to a counterparty but, optimistic. Feedback on the assumptions is welcome.

Greg,
Enclosed is the presentation that Jean-Louis presented yesterday. EDS is
very interested in the opportunities that were discussed.  A suggestion for
a go-forward strategy would be to have a team of EDS experts sit with Enron
Net Works to map the development of the Transaction Hub.  EDS would provide
individuals with both capital markets (with experience setting up
transaction utilities) and energy experience to identify an initial business
plan to build and bring the Hub to market.  The outcome will be a
fifty-thousand foot strategy that can then be driven down to
operationalizing the Hub.

EDS is also determining how EOL can be leveraged through our current
relationships with more discussion to follow.

Please let me know your review of the meeting and if we are in sync going
forward.

Thanks again for traveling to EDS and offerring the opportunity to work with
ENW in this venture.

Cheers,
Jim

Attached is the document that will serve as the basis for our discussion
tomorrow.

The document summarizes key business principles, our understanding of the
business principle agreement for each point, and our interpretation of the
current version of the contract for each point.

There are several other points that I did not include in this document as
we feel they are contractual negotiation points versus deal principle
points.

Our goal is to gain clarity on these high level points tomorrow, to get
these back to Brian for contract redlining and turnaround by Saturday, and
then to reconvene for a detailed contract review session on Monday.

Also, as we would like to focus on these key principles, we are planning to
have myself, Kenny, and Mark present for the meeting.  Brian will be on
call in case we need him.

Thanks and we look forward to our visit tomorrow at 1 p.m.

Peggy

Attached for your review is a revised draft of the Licensing  Agreement with Accenture.  Ted has  reviewed the draft and his comments are reflected.  We look forward to finalizing and making  the distribution to Accenture on Monday.   
Following are some thoughts for your consideration:
1.             Definition of Enron Platform.  Andy's definition of ""Enron Platform""  excluded products substantially dissimilar to those listed on the platform, to  which we added the qualification of listed on the platform as of the  Effective Date.  Is this  correct?  In addition, is there a  possibility that Enron might split up the platform (i.e., by product type), and  then sell off certain segments?  If  so, we may need to further modify the definition.
2.          License Grants.   Though the license grant with respect to Customer-Specific Transaction  Data in Section 3.1 is limited to Accenture's right to re-format the data, we  advise adding some restrictions to specifically negate their right to manipulate  the data in certain ways, as per your previous business discussions.  In addition, with respect to the  SmartClient Software license in Section 3.3, Accenture will be permitted to  freely modify the software for their own purposes, except to the extent the  software is being used for receiving data through the Enron Data Feed.  We need to confirm that the appropriate  restrictions have been imposed.   
3.             Minimum Annual Payments.   Section 5.1(b) provides that the Minimum Annual Payment is due at the end  of each Contract Year.  Is this  satisfactory from the accounting perspective, or do we want more flexibility for  purposes of booking these payments?
4.          Audit Rights.  In  Section 5.4(b), we have added a limited right to do an operational audit, i.e.,  the audit can be initiated only on claim of breach, and can be performed only by  a third party.  We would like to  discuss expanding this right.
5.             Acceleration Rights on Termination.  Section 7.6(b) permits us to accelerate  the Minimum Annual Payments on Accenture's default for breach of contract.  Is this the appropriate trigger?
6.             Accenture Warranties.   Should we add any warranties to Section 8.2?
7.             Accenture Indemnity.   We have expanded Accenture's indemnity obligation in Section 9.2(a), to  cover any claims arising out the TSH Services or their modifications to the  SmartClient Software.  The only  exception we have permitted is for data errors verified as Enron errors.  
8.             ""Readable"" Data.  We  have used the term ""readable"" in referring to the data in various places in the  Agreement, including Section 4.1(a)(ii).   In using this term, we intend to differentiate between the static data  received by an Enron Customer, and the data to be received, ""read"" and then  re-formatted by Accenture.  We may  need to select a more precise term with Jay's  assistance.

Attached for your review is a revised draft of the Licensing Agreement
between Accenture and Enron Net Works.  Following is a list of some of the
key issues raised by the draft.  In addition, we have inserted various
questions and comments into the draft in bold type.  I look forward to
resolving these questions with you and providing an updated draft over the
next few days.  I plan to speak with Jay Webb to resolve some of the
technical issues as soon as possible.  Thanks, and please feel free to
contact me at 713-758-2109.
Key Issues:
1.	Qualification of Customers.  In Section 2.3, we have adopted the
construct (same as in Kiodex) that Enron must receive a Consent and Release
from the relevant customer as a condition precedent to releasing that
customer's transaction data.  This will help manage Enron's liability.
2.	Data Storage.  Section 2.4 relates to Accenture's obligation to
store transaction data.  Should Accenture be obligated to purge the data
after a period of time, or may it keep the data indefinitely?  Should the
data be purged at the end of the Agreement?
3.	Service Levels.  We have retained the reference to Service Levels in
Section 2.5, but have deleted the concept of a Service Credit (i.e., amounts
owed by Enron to Accenture for failure to achieve Service Levels).
4.	License Rights/Exclusivity.  Article III provides non-exclusive
license rights to Accenture to use the Customer-Specific Transaction Data
and SmartClient Software, for a narrow field of use.  This is followed by
Section 4.1, which sets forth certain Enron covenants regarding exclusivity.
We prefer this construct due to the numerous exceptions to the exclusivity.

For example, Enron's right to market to customers that do not want to sign
up with Accenture is set forth as an exception to the exclusivity covenant
in Section 4.1(a)(i).  As originally drafted by Accenture, this provision
had the effect of increasing the ""TSH Gross Revenues,"" and thereby
offsetting any minimum royalty obligations of Accenture.  We redrafted this
provision to simply obligate Enron to remit 70% of the net revenues it
raises from non-Qualified Customers, and exclude that amount from TSH
Revenues.  That way, if Accenture never gets going, it would have to pay the
full minimum royalty, without reduction for sales by Enron.
5.	Marketing.  Section 4.2 sets forth Accenture's obligation to use
commercially reasonable efforts to market the TSH Services to Enron
Customers.  What standards does Enron want to impose regarding Accenture's
use of Enron's name?  Enron should not agree to let Accenture use the EOL
trademark except under the agreement and procedures established by Enron
from time to time.
6.	Strategic Transactions.  Section 4.5(a) sets forth a three-month
blackout on transactions with multilateral trading platforms, relating to
the transmission of transaction data; has this been agreed?  With respect to
Section 4.5(b), we are concerned about the confusion that may occur if Enron
has an obligation to seek restrictions on another trading platform's use of
transaction data.  Enron's ability to proceed with any transaction will be
substantially hampered if it needs to be able to prove to Accenture that it
is using commercially reasonable efforts in the context of a negotiation;
this is very difficult to prove.  Our recommendation is a more
straightforward approach, focusing on economic alternatives.
7.	Transaction Fees.  In Section 5.1, we have introduced the concept of
a ""Standard Transaction Fee,"" being a mutually agreed posted fee that will
serve as the minimum amount payable to Enron in respect of TSH Services.
The purpose is to address our concern that Accenture may price its services
very low in order to attract high consulting fees, thereby resulting in low
Gross TSH Revenue.  We need to discuss how to calculate and apply the
Standard Transaction Fee.  In addition, we should discuss the definition of
Gross TSH Revenues - the additions made to that definition in Accenture's
May 16 draft were far too broad, and would exclude platforms like
HoustonStreet, and even platforms which agreed contractually not to
distribute the data.
8.	Term/Termination.  Section 7.1 provides for a five year term,
commencing on the Enron Data Feed Launch Date.  Accenture had provided that
it start when Accenture began to offer TSH Services, which could be
indefinitely in the future.
We have added Enron termination rights to Section 7.2, and provided for an
acceleration of all Minimum Annual Payments as liquidated damages if Enron
terminates for an Accenture breach (Section 7.6(b)).
9.	Accenture Operations Failure.  We have added several features to
guard against operational failure by Accenture's TSH Services.  These
include termination rights on operational failure (see definition of
""Accenture Operational Failure"") and indemnities.  One additional safeguard
may be to add rights for operational audits.  We need to assess these
provisions and determine if they are sufficient.
10.	Successors.  How should be address EOL's successors?  Do we need to
come up with a way to exclude new industries and products that may be
offered in the future on Enron's Website.

Sorry for the delay in responding.  I needed the quiet time during the
weekend to think through all of the changes and get the draft in order.
Rasmani is going to go through the revised draft on Monday and will send it
out later on Monday.  She will be available to meet with you during the
week.  I will be out of town and generally unavailable, but I would be happy
to set up a call if that would help.  I made many, many changes to the
Accenture draft.  The more I listened and learned about the deal, the more I
felt that the Accenture draft was just the wrong starting point.  I have
tried to incorporate many of the approaches that we have used in earlier EOL
deals, but there my draft will require extensive review and perhaps revision
before it is ready to share with Accenture.  As we go through the new draft,
we should probably start a dialogue with Accenture and its attorney to
prepare it for some rather fundamental changes (like, instead of an
""exclusive"" license, I have added an exclusivity provision that sets forth
exactly what Enron agrees not to do...).

Please feel free to call Rasmani at 713 758-2109 to coordinate while I am
out of the office.

Thanks for the note below. Curious how you all are coming and what our
expectations should be on turnaround.

I am a bit concerned that Travis and his team are making changes based on
'the changes that we have all discussed over the last two weeks'.  I am not
totally confident that we reached agreement on each of the discussion
points.

But, we will obviously review your suggested changes and come back with
feedback.

As a restatement that may be obvious, however, the essence that the
transaction stream is exclusive with the only exception being price posting
agreements (and only then if you all choose to break the exclusivity) is
fundamental to our valuation of the deal and our ability to ultimately sell
this internally.

So, please let me and Mike know asap when the document has been turned
around.

Thanks,

Peggy

I want to update you on the status to the Transaction Support Hub
Agreement.  Travis McCullough and his team will be making the changes
that we have all discussed over the past two weeks.  As well, we will
also suggest, via the revision, some structural changes to the contract.
More importantly, any change that we make will have an explanation.  The
explanation will serve to show intent and why specific changes were
made.

We have all dedicated huge amounts of time to this project already,  now
we want to spend a little extra time putting the right language around
all of our conversations.  I will update you on the progress of this
effort tomorrow.  As soon as the document is ready, I will get it to
you.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Title: Energy Technology Investing: The Bubble Bursts
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2978;


***********************************************************************

DISTRIBUTED ENERGY INVESTMENT CHALLENGE--EXPECTATIONS MEET NEW REALITIES

Between 1998 and 2001, investors poured some US$4.36 billion into companies
developing distributed energy (DE) technologies. This investment boom and the
subsequent capital market correction were created by overly optimistic
expectations regarding the size of the opportunity and speed of the market's
development.

*  DE's failure to capture a substantial portion of the California market
during the power crisis in early 2001 and the collapse of the
telecommunications and information technology sectors undermined investors'
confidence. Shifting power market fundamentals and growing uncertainty over the
pace and direction of regulatory change also contributed.

*  Although the short-term market for DE technologies has suffered, in the long
run the revised expectations are part of a healthy trend toward greater
maturity among companies and their backers.

*  Restricted access to capital will slow commercialization of new technologies
and drive consolidation among energy technology companies. Public policy will
become an increasingly important source of funds and other support in the
future.

John:

I have not found anyone who was trying to renew these contracts.  I am meeting with IHS on Thursday so I will make sure we add Accumap.  How many user of Accumap will you need?  I will forward the cost to you prior to sending the contracts to UBS.  

Do you know who managed the contracts with NOVA, Power Pool of Alberta, OASIS or ESBI so that I can gather contact information and begin the contract management of these applications.

Thanks,

Danielle

To continue getting familiar with Ontario, please review the document OEFC_demandSupp_UBS.ppt on your I:/common/OEFC directory.  It is a presentation we gave to OEFC in the fall.

Here is a spreadsheet with additional information.
 
Some intertie information may vary from source to source.  This is due to the IMO's regular small adjustments to the capacity numbers.

Chris,
Here is a copy of our top counterparty list.  The online group will be sending out a packet that includes this list and all the information you're group will need to get started.  Please fill out the areas highlighted in red.  We simply need to assign someone from your office that will be our point of contact, as well as the person responsible for getting in the Password Application.  We are using each of the desks relationships to jump start the effort.  Once that is complete, the responsibility will role back over to the online group.  If at all possible, I'd like to have the appropriate names early this afternoon.  Sorry for the short notice.

Thanks again for your help,

Dan

John, hope things are going well up there for you. The big day is almost here for you and Jessica. I was wondering if I could use your name as a job reference if need be. I am just trying to get everything in order just in case something happens.

It was a tough decision, but Angela and I have picked a winner and two runners-up for coming up with the most creative idea for the ""mystery item.""  The winners and their answers are listed below:

Winner: 

David Hanslip for his answer of: 

""...To the casual observer, they look like the support pillars of any standard monitor stand. In reality, their special hollowed out interiors may be used to conceal sensitive accounting documents outlining off-balance sheet financing transactions from the FBI.""

Second Runner Up: 
Paul Dunsmore for his answer of: 
""They are clearly snow shoes for the Smurfs that live in our office..."" 
Third Runner Up: 
Carlee Gawiuk for her answer of: 
""The purpose of the object is for getting the attention of the commercial staff when they are not paying attention to their admin assistants.  There are 6 of them, 3 for each phone.  Simply pick up the object, close your fist around it, extend your arm behind your head, bring it forward in a fluid motion and release the object in the general direction of the person you are wanting to get the attention of.  If it takes more then one throw, that is completely acceptable.  It takes a little practice, so don't be too hard on your self if you need to borrow a few from the other phone.  It is not too big, so no serious damage will be done, & it's not too small so the person or anyone surrounding them will not lose an eye.  The colour is black to contrast with desk, or floor, so it is easy to find after it has been thrown.""

Thank you to everyone else for your very creative answers! 
Congratulations to David, Paul, and Carlee (you may drop by front reception to pick up your prize)!!! 
Thank you, 
Megan Scott "

Guys, its getting late in the day and I feel we need to let people know where they stand. Please sit down with each of your direct reports and let them know that they will be receiving an offer of employment from UBS (hopefully by tommorrow).

With respect to Fabian and Gerry, I think its important to stress that although they didnt make the first cut, there is still a high probability of being offered UBS employment following the results of round one.

Tim and John, I wanted to touch base with you regarding a problem that we have run into between EOL and a trader having multiple trading books. EOL has been set up to have a trader associated with one and only one trading book in the stack manager. As a result, when creating the interface between EOL and Enpower we can cannot assign multiple trading books to one person. David Poston in the Enpower IT support group in Houston has been working with the EOL group and has come up with a solution.

1. If you definitely plan to be trading on EOL for all trading books associated with your name, EOL IT can define certain products to each trading book. If this is the approach that you would like to take, I will need a list of what products you want to trade and to which trading book they are affiliated with. 

2. The other option is that you will just use one trading book under your name. If that is the case, no changes will have to be made.

If the plan is to use the first option, please let me know so we can make the changes and do the necessary testing on this.

John"

John,
I'm hearing rumblings from Whalley and others that UBS may want to pick up Canadian service contracts from the Estate.  

Can you give me download of these deals?  (high level summary)

uropean schemes still look sharper with the western ridge and eastern troug=

he time was to go with the warmer solution. This time I am running with the=
 colder one. The Canadian model has been consistent with a stronger Eastern=
 trough since the middle of last week. It brings a moderate batch of arctic=
 air next week into the Eastern U.S. The potential of some sort of East coa=
st storm also remains in this pattern. I am not by any means forecasting an=

oks which are above normal in the Eastern U.S. I believe most of the region=
 will grade out slightly below normal instead while th! e West is in a mode=

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, ""I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal.""

He added, ""My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."""

With the recent shuffle of people moving to new desks, I'm sure there will be keyboard trays that need to be moved, as well as some repairs.  Wall 2 Wall will be in on Wednesday afternoon to look after this.  

Please let me know by Wednesday morning if you need anything done. 

Thanks,

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

This is my cheat sheet if it helps:  

H Drives:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

It looks like 713-584 are the new prefix's, but they are as follows:

713-584-1091
713-584-1093
713-584-1050
713-584-1092

I've not been in that room, so I would guess that the first number would be sufficient."

n:   Pattern has a colder look to it this morning, while the Southern storm=
 track shows signs of action. Eastern ridge gone while arctic air tries to =
reload to the Northwest.   This may be the first time this winter a forecas=
t understates the cold rather than overstates it. Part of it stems from the=
 snowcover in the Plains, but most of it simply did not give the European e=
nough credit for its SE rotation of a Canadian air mass. I do believe its t=
ransient though with some moderation in order by midweek and the five day n=
umbers taken as a whole still are not that cold relative to normal. In many=
 ways, this will be similar to what happened in late December with the larg=
est departures from normal in the South. That will be due more from an acti=
ve storm track rather than any real intrusion of arctic air. Speaking of so=
uth! ern storms, we see rain breaking out across much of Western and Northe=
rn Texas today. This system will bring rain to much of the old South the ne=
xt couple of days. There is some potential for SE coastal development later=
 in the week which could be a Mid-Atlantic snow. But, I am more bullish on =
the next system in the series which could be a big storm over the weekend. =
While its turning colder in the East, often times we see a reversal in the =
West. That does not appear to be the situation in this case. Cold air is tr=
apped in much of the region and the upper level flow is not favorable to sc=
our this out. A gradual moderation may occur, but it still looks below norm=

Subject:	Curves and Correlations

I have to clean up clustering and curve mappings from Estate to NETCO.  Last correlation update was Nov. 29th and I'm assuming we may have some issues.  The curves we are rolling into NETCO need to be highly accurate for the last 60 days to ensure variance covariance matrix is appropriate.  Please provide me list of curves we are using in NETCO.  Identify which curves should be primary and which curves can be secondary.  Additionally, please identify if there are any regional constraints that need to be ""locked in"" between primary and secondary curves.  I will then re-run correlations so we can properly understand diversification benefit across wholesale as it relates to proposed VAR limit structures.

Thanks,
Frank

John,
This note is to officially announce that I will not sign the contract with UBS. I feel it is time for me to start something new and a great opportunity was presented to me in  Montreal. I want to thank you for everything you and this company did for me. I sincerely wish you all the success you deserve in this new adventure.

After having talked to Dawn, I will be in the office until Thursday Feb-21. It was understood that I will be paid for any unused vacation days.

Once again, thank you for your support and good luck with UBS!

Yours Truly,

Stephane Brodeur"

***********************************************************************

LOOKING FOR THE VALUE IN ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGIES

Corporate leaders often found it difficult to determine if environmental
strategies are paying off. As a broader set of corporate stakeholders
influences the shape of environmental strategy, corporate leaders regularly
encounter conflicting evaluations of their performance and frequently lack the
evidence to justify changes in strategy.

*  Increasing shareholder value is the ultimate success factor but corporations
cannot easily demonstrate a direct link between how an environmental strategy
is implemented and shareholder value.

*  Corporations are searching for proxy indicators that often blend the
quantitative and the intuitive from both internal and external sources.

*  Recognizing that a broader set of evaluation tools are required reduces the
frustration of searching for the perfect performance measure and, in the long
term, improves assessment efforts.

Stephane Brodeur should be removed from the list.
I am not sure about Chris Lambie, whether he is joining the company.
Garrett Trip should be added as the Ontario Power trader (that market won't open until May 2002)

This is not a circular and you will not get another chance.  This deals with migration to new systems and you need to migrate your own information or applications in the next day.  Remember do not delete anything and data to be transferred must comply (see attachments below).

The policy must be complied by Thursday.  Please ensure that everyone in your group has moved everything which is in compliance with the policy.  We will not be delaying close or restart for people not having completed their own migrations.

Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply (eg Dana - please cover Kevin's migration requirements)

Thanks

Louise

Hello John:

I received your voice mail since NOVA, Power Pool of Alberta, OASIS and ESBI don't fall under market data I will take them off of the list and you can setup the accounts directly with the vendors out of the Calgary office.  I will leave IHS Accumap under Market Data UBS since we currently have an agreement with them.  I will use Carmen as the contact for IHS Accumap. 

Thanks,

Danielle "

John,

I understand Peter Keohane is here today and through the weekend if necessary to complete contracts for Canada with UBS legal. I am hoping that completion of contracts includes identification of corporate entity (vain hope?)

d  I started fly fishing two years ago out of what some  would call the bat=
tle of the sexes. I had taken an ""old"" boyfriend  backpacking; he brought a=
long a fly rod. I think he had just started  fly fishing. I tried it out af=
ter watching him for a while and I  liked it. It reminded me of Tai Chi and=
 meditation - flowing water,  fresh air - it felt so natural.    So when we=
 returned from our trip  I told my boyfriend that I wanted to fly fish. He =
replied,  ""You don't know how."" Instantly the tomboy in me rose to the  cha=
llenge. Growing up with three brothers, it was a  conditioned response. I h=
ad to prove to this boy that I could  indeed fly fish if I wanted to.  So I=
 said, ""I'll  learn."" And a few weeks later an old timer in Arizona gave me=
  an old rod, a Reel O'Matic and my first casting lesson. I was  hooked and=
 ready to prove myself to the guys.  With a  good year of fishing under my =
belt, I found myself at the  Santa Ynez River early one morning; no one aro=
und yet, big  pools, bubbling water, a golden eagle cruising up the river, =
 silence. I was fishing a hole with trout and smallmouth bass  in it. All a=
lone, my mind wandered, and I was soon asking  myself whether or not I trul=
y enjoyed fishing, or whether I  was just trying to be better than the boys=
. I contemplated  this thought while casting, the line unrolling rhythmical=
ly on  each forward and back cast. And I felt so very present, in the  now,=
 in peaceful solitude with my world, breathing deep and  then? Fish on!  An=
d the answer was yes. I love this. I  love the way I feel after a day of fi=
shing, as though I had  spent the whole day meditating. I feel fresh and li=
ke a kid  again, all sun-baked and dirty after a day rock hopping up a  cre=
ek. I enjoy most the solitude. Even if I fish with a buddy,  I am still jus=
t with myself, my rod and the cast, trying to  come up with a recipe for ca=
tching that fish. I become so  peaceful fishing. And when I spot that big t=
rout rising across  the stream, the adrenaline rush is crazy. It's amazing =
to me  that I can get so excited about a fish.  I realized that  what had s=
tarted out as me trying to be as good as the guys  had become a practice in=
stead. It is not a battle after all,  but simply fishing: sharing tips, swa=
pping stories, being part  of a community.  I love being a beginner. It mea=
ns I  have years to practice and learn about this thing called fly  fishing=
. And I hope I never lose that beginners mind, because  it is the fuel that=

Looks good.  Feel free to write a couple of bullets regarding the types of instruments/commodities you believe are necessary, as this will help me flesh out ideas with UBS regarding trading universe.

Subject:	UBS Trade Products

My apologies if this has been done, but I'm in process of assembling list of products that UBS will be trading.  If this list has been compiled, please direct it to me.  

I'm interested in getting the greatest granularity possible breaking it out by VaR portfolio name, trader, trading book, commodity, instrument, location, tenor, relative liquidity for each instrument expressed in contract/day (i.e. could impact holding period for VAR) and best risk mitigator.  (Regarding best risk mitigator, I'm not looking for liquidating position comments, but rather best hedge given curve location.)  This will help in directing correlation efforts for VAR.  See attached spreadsheet for suggested format.

Thanks,
Frank

Peggy & John
The estate's DPR reporting requirement to risk controls in Houston is going to be twice a week.  Consistent with this I would also like to change our internal DPR reporting process for ECC Power-Estate from DAILY to twice per week.  Note that curves and an official calc will still be required daily.
 
I would like to make this change starting Feb 1.  Please let me know if you are okay with this.
 
Kathy

As a follow up to this email, we will start reporting the DPR's on Wednesday's and Monday's, for Tuesday and Friday valuations.  The first Wednesday will be the 30th of January.  Each day we should expect to report the positions, P&L and PRMA of only those transactions we expect to fulfill.  With the exception of Gas, Susan Trevino will be sending the benchmarks to each of the groups for their review.  
 
If anyone anticipates any problems with this time frame, please call me or Shona to discuss.

Subject: DPR reporting for 22nd trading due today - request by Fallon


Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
 
- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
 
Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.
 
Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.
 
Thanks in advance

 Wisconsin and eventually to Interior New England. Copious rains will fall =
in the warm sector. This storm should end the recent record warmth in the E=
ast with signs now that it may not return for sometime. One thing that has =
my attention is this current situation is colder than forecasted in the col=
d sector of the storm and thats the first time this winter the models have =
underdone the cold. Until now, its been the other way around. I am not look=
ing for an! ything bitter under a split flow jet stream, but its late Janua=
ry and early February and it can still get cold. Also, the pattern while te=
mporarily taking a break from the storms after this current event looks to =
reload again in the medium range. The short term temperatures still reflect=
 the heat in front of this winter storm, so most of the East is still above=
 normal while the West is below.    Tomorrow: Thursday, January 31, 2002   =

Used Within the Volatility Matrix    Day 6-10 Discussion:  There are severa=
l considerations in the 6-10 day period. First, we could briefly turn on th=
e ""Lake Effect"" snow machine with a weak Clipper system early next week. Th=
is should not be anywhere near the magnitude of the Buffalo Christmas event=
, but is the first one since then. It drags a moderately cold airmass in be=
hind it. Then, later in the period the Southern jet stream becomes active o=
nce again. Most models show another sizeable winter storm mid to late next =
week and at a farther South latitude than the current one. Now, I dont see =
this 6-10 day period as particularly cold in a relative sense though certai=
nly it will be chillier than recent periods. Numbers may turn out a bit bel=
ow normal especially over the Northern half of the USA. Some of the models =
just past this period suggest a more significant Canadian high woul! d be p=
oised to drop down. The warming of the Canadian prairies does not look as l=
ikely as I have thought over the past few days, so this idea may have some =
merit. If the surface pressures forecast turn out to verify, the ocean indi=
ces(NAO and PNA) switch their signals and we get some snowcover the next 10=
 days from potential storms, then this may all come to pass. It would not b=
e an exaggeration to suggest the coldest air mass of the season could come =
down the second week of February.        Day 6: Monday, February  4, 2002  =

John:

I have IHS listed on the spreadsheet.  It was not in yellow because we are already talking with IHS. 

For nova, oasis and power pool of alberta I had added to the list because I assumed they needed to be addressed I will remove them from the list??

I didn't see accumap added to the new list that was sent by chris behney,

the nova, oasis and power pool of alberta accounts that were added in yellow were inappropriately added as these are 
not data sources that require purchasing, they are simply accounts to set-up much like a membership account"

Enron employees may find the current circumstances stressful.  We want to remind you that Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is still available and currently offering services to assist you and your family.

Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending. These sessions are designed to address the challenges employees may be facing and to suggest ways to minimize the impact of stress on employees and their families.

	9:00 am -- 10:00 am

Everyone,

We are in the process of creating new contracts with UBS for all Market Data real-time applications, subscriptions and publications.  Attached is a comprehensive list of all contracts that will be renegotiated under the UBS name for use by the Gas and Power trading entities.  

In order to leverage UBS' significant discounts and avoid duplicate efforts, Danielle Marcinkowski with Market Data will be the initial point of contact when inquiring about the addition or status of applications or publications.  I bring this to your attention because we understand that several groups have initiated discussions with the various vendors over the past few days.  

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at 713-853-9358 or Danielle at 713-853-7926.  If you think something is missing from the list, please bring it to our attention immediately.  Please pass this word around within your group as appropriate.

Regards,

Chris Behney

cussion:  More troughing in the East and ridging in the West. Pattern devel=
oping as advertised, but will the cold air materialize?  The Southern strea=
m storm track is alive and well and should continue to be so for the next c=
ouple of weeks. All of the models point to the potential of healthy winter =
storms in the midst of a warmer than normal temperature pattern. The lack o=
f realized cold continues to frustrate me as once again the air simply is n=
ot that frigid. We are still below normal relative to normal over much of t=
he South and West. In the West, it is due to high pressure trapped in the I=
ntermountain region while in the South it is in response to inclement weath=

 to its old tricks of a sharp cooling ""just past this period"" and the Canad=
ian still insists on a moderate intensity high coming down this weekend. It=
 may well turn cooler, but certainly not in an excessive way. The five day =

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

ion:   A very healthy spring/winter storm to deal with in the short term. T=
his storm will bring about a pattern change, though still nothing severe in=
 terms of cold.  A mixed bag of precipitation has developed today over the =
Central Plains. A healthy combination of shallow cold air in the North and =
record warmth in the South will help spin up a sizeable storm in the Southe=
rn Plains later today that will turn to the NE. There are a variety of wint=
er weather watches out from Kansas, Missouri , Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois=
. More can be expected through the Great Lakes and New England later in the=
 week. There will be snow with this, but also some potential for significan=
t freezing rain as well. The storm track is expected to run from NW Texas t=
o just South of Chicago then Western New York. To the South, this is a rain=
 ! event with some thunderstorms as well. This storm will serve to collapse=
 the strong ridge that has been in place over the Eastern U.S. I certainly =
expect a drop from the record highs of recent days, but nothing in the eart=
h shattering cold category. In fact, the raw numbers from the MRF have tren=
ded warmer the last few runs. Since we dont have a thick snow cover to tap =
from, I believe the period of cold setting up will not be as harsh as what =
we saw in late December. As all of this is going on, some of the chill that=
 has invaded the West will be lifting out. I don't see a big run to above n=

hile the talk in recent outlooks for the 6-10 day period has centered on co=
ld, it is interesting to note the new 6-10 and 8-14 day outlooks from the N=
WS still have a warm bias to them. There is not a big snow cover on the gro=
und, a split flow in the jet stream is expected and the polar vortex in Can=
ada continues a slow retreat. With all of that as a backdrop, the slight po=
sitive departures look reasonable to me. We may however crank out a ""Clippe=

we are currently seeing. This is especially true if the air flows over the =

Transmission Expansion and Systems in Transition  Conference
Feb. 5-8, 2002,  Miami, Florida
 
OVERVIEW
 

This conference will examine the  business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in  effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger  and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO  initiatives.  The conference will  review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and  new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for  effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing  alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also  discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to  achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and  regional trading system.

March  26-28 2002, Atlanta, Georgia
 
OVERVIEW
 

This conference will highlight the commonalties and  common applications between the asset management processes used throughout the  enterprise.  The conference will  emphasize the need to link the physical power generation asset management  processes to the activities and processes of the trading and marketing  process.  The processes of Asset  management will be addressed from three distinct perspectives, first, the  long-term perspective of portfolio developers, second the more medium term  perspective of maintenance/system planners and third the conference will link  short term issues of the trading & marketing departments. The purpose is to  show how these processes can be integrated to the individual assets (plants) in  order to provide consistent and profitable strategies for the generation asset  owner.

Ancillary  Services Conference
 
April  10-12, 2002, Denver, Colorado
 
OVERVIEW

 
As more and more regions in North  America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary  services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the  same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both  commerce and reliability. 
 
This conference will cover the key  engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these  functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various  markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions,  successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New  England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario,  will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead  scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and  congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating  costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply  these services.
 
The brochure for the Ancillary Services  Conference, April 10-12, 2002,  Wyndham Hotel - Tech Center, Denver, CO can be obtained by clicking on the link  below:http://www.euci.com/pdf/anc_svcs.pdf

Title: A Moving Supply and Demand Picture
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2958;


***********************************************************************

US WEST HYDRO ON THE RISE, DEMAND LOW

Shifting 2002 electricity demand drivers and improvement of hydroelectric
conditions in the US West continue to change the outlook for 2002 and beyond.
Although 2002 demand will still contract from 2001 levels, CERA's updated
outlook calls for modestly stronger demand than previously forecasted. The weak
January fundamentals that have dragged down Henry Hub and western regional gas
prices should continue through February.

*  The level of voluntary and price-responsive electricity conservation in
California appears to be falling as the supply crisis abates.

*  Gas prices have been kept at bay by the lack of evidence of the expected
decline in US supply and weak national economic trends that point to further
delay in the rebound of industrial and power generation demand.

*  The abundant western snowpacks that will be shown to the world during the
winter Olympics are having an impact on regional energy markets.

Louise, given the number of declines, is there any latitude in moving up the Canadian Headcount. I believe we cut very deep on the 1st go round. Specifically, there is  a couple of analysts and one manager on the commercial side and on the non-commercial side we'd like to have at least one if not two admins for answering the phones (Admins are roughly U.S. $15K/annum and ours are extremely good). We still might come in under our initial headcount given the decline probabilities, but I would like to offer additional jobs asap as opposed to waiting for responses. "

Greg/Louise - I would like your approval for a pool of $$$ to try to get all of the outstanding commercial staff in Canada signed. I would like approval for up to U.S. $250K/$250K to sign up the following ""hold-outs"":

1) Howard Sangwine
2) Grant Oh
3) Dean Drozdiak
4) Garrett Tripp
5) Steve Burnham
6) Lon Draper

Each of the above are highly marketable and have competing offers in hand. They have also been talking to their U.S. counterparts and know that there are funds available. Please advise.

The contracts might have been from Calgary, I just don't know if anyone from Calgary is talking with the contracts group from UBS?
Does anyone know?

 I'll look into the other issues, I just thought that you may know who may be handling it, we may just do it directly from Calgary

I have not found anyone who was trying to renew these contracts.  I am meeting with IHS on Thursday so I will make sure we add Accumap.  How many user of Accumap will you need?  I will forward the cost to you prior to sending the contracts to UBS.  

Do you know who managed the contracts with NOVA, Power Pool of Alberta, OASIS or ESBI so that I can gather contact information and begin the contract management of these applications.

Thanks,

Here are the contracts we are currently creating with UBS.  Please verify that we have not missed any applications/publications or subscriptions.  

Highlight in Red the systems you will need and mark the priority from 1-5,  1 being critical.

Please find attached the latest, and what should be the final for the immediate period of time, copy of the marketing list. Please filter the PA column by your name to double-check against the list you are currently working off of. 
There are some smaller subsids of larger companies previously assigned now listed. I pulled these subs in from the credit pre-approval list. I will be passing out draft contracts folders for these counterparties tomorrow to the people responsible for the respective parent companies.
There are some companies on your lists that do not have draft packets. These companies have NOT been pre-approved by credit, but credit is working on them now. Continue to call these customers regarding password applications, but do not promise that the ISDA documents, etc. are immediately forthcoming until we receive those worksheets from credit.
Please continue to pass on both the pa information and the draft packets as you receive the correct contact info. If you have any questions at all, please call me at 5-3614 or come by my desk at 06541 in the rotunda.

Thank you,
Jennifer McQuade

Subject:	FW: UBS Warburg Energy - First Priority Trading Agreements


The first group of trading contracts will go out to 77 companies for a total of 168 counterparties (most companies have multiple entities).  This group obviously does not include everyone, but we have most of our major relationships (and it is the official list that has been submitted to UBS for credit approval.)  

The general marketing plan is as follows:
- Contact all customers this week to tell them about UBS Warburg Energy
- Get contract/PA packages in front of First Priority counterparties this week
- Arrange meetings or follow-up calls as appropriate
- Dave Forster and the ubswenergy.com team will be sending out online PA packages to all parties later this week (so it is important to have contacted all customers)
- Once the initial wave of contracts is out and review/negotiations are uderway, we will submit a Second Priority list for credit approval

The attached file has all of the First Priority counterparties, along with names for gas, power, online, credit and legal.   Apologies for the imperfect information - it came from several different sources.  In addition, we have columns for describing the type of agreement and its status (not pursuing, incomplete, done).  Please complete and/or edit the attached and forward to either Debra Bailey or Lloyd Will.  If you think you should take the lead on a particular counterparty, call up the other person and work it out!  Progress on this effort will be reviewed during our twice-weekly calls.

Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,
UBSWenergy.com

I attach an updated list (to Feb 5) of the terminated contracts to date.  F=
or informational purposes, I have added a column that sets out the settleme=
nt dates for contracts we have settled, so there may be some additional cou=
nterparties added to my previous list where there was no ECC agreed termina=
tion date but we have settled and terminated (no one needs to do anything f=
or these c/ps).  Again, the first table sets forth the physical contracts t=
hat have been terminated and the second sets out the financial contracts, a=
nd all data reflects ECC's (not the counterparties') perception of the worl=
d.  I have vetted my list against Blakes' master list and believe this is a=
ccurate in all respects.  As I indicated in my previous e-mails to you ther=
e were a few date discrepancies and I have previously provided you with the=
 corrected dates for El Paso, Marathon, AEC Marketing, Calpine (Encal), Wil=
liams Energy and Baytex (all physical), all which are now correctly reflect=
ed in the attachment.  A few others that were not previously on the list in=
clude Coast Energy (physical) which auto terminated on Dec 2 and PrimeWest =
Energy (physical) which auto terminated on Dec 2. =20

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

Further to prior e-mails, I have now confirmed with Blakes that the following c/ps originally had the wrong termination dates set.  They have now been corrected to the appropriate dates, all of which were Feb 1, 2002 (John, these are the same ones I identified to you last week).

Calpine Canada Natural Gas Partnership (Encal) physical, gas - February 1, 2002
El Paso Merchant Energy, physical gas - February 1, 2002
Williams Energy Marketing & Trade Co. - February 1, 2002

I have updated the list to reflect all changes received. If you notice any more errors or if any counterparties have been reassigned, please let me know so that I can continue to make changes.
Also, please see Louise's additions at the bottom of the list (from Adams Resources Marketing downward) and let me know if you have good relationships with any of these counterparties and could please take responsibility for them. Otherwise, our marketing team will be contacting these customers.
Finally, please note that even though there may be names for a specific counterparty in both the gas and the power columns, the person ultimately responsible for contacting that customer regarding the password application and registration forms is the person in the PA column on the far right.
Please remember when you are speaking to your customers to get all contact info possibly including contact name, phone and fax, e-mail, and address and send all this to Mary Griff Gray so that she can send them the PA and registration forms. 

Please call me at 5-3614 if you have any questions or come by my desk at 06541.

John,

Sorry, I missed you on the original distribution list.  I work for Lloyd Will on the East Power Desk and have been coordinating the UBS start up steps related to NERC, ISO's and TP's.

Leslie, Jim:

We will need the following information to complete the transmission provider applications, ISO agreements, and NERC memberships.  

- Billing Contact including address, number, email etc.  
- Customer Contact including address, number, email etc.  (We recommend Corry Bentley for the East, however need to confirm address)
- Routing numbers, billing fax numbers
- UBS AG DUNS number
- Confirm what company name to be utilized for the Transmission Provider, ISO and NERC Regional Reliability Council agreements/memberships.

Leslie, can you assist in helping us finalize the above information.  We would like to begin mailing in the TP, ISO & NERC agreements next week on the 12th. 

In regards to NERC ETAG and NERC business entity, we would like to register as UBS.  If we register as UBSWE it may get confused with the East and West scheduling desks.  Therefore, we would like to use the following initials for the NERC scheduling desk codes: UBSE (east desk), UBSW (west desk), UBSC (canada).   I will coordinate this with the West and Canada desks this week, in addition to other remaining steps such as registration with Tradewave for JTSIN OASIS etc.  

Debra

In order to commence physical trading on February 11th, we are dependent upon the following:

	(1)	Determination of the Canadian entity name for contracting purposes
	(2)	Obtaining financial information for this entity to submit to the pipelines for their credit review
	(3)	3 - 5 business days for the pipeline to process our request

The bottom line is that unless items 1 & 2 can be resolved early next week (preferably by Monday), we will not be able to trade physical gas in Canada on day 1.  We have the pipeline requests essentially completed, but the critical pieces identified above are missing.  Also, I have been informed that under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, we are currently not allowed to contact the pipelines.  I do not have an estimate of when this restriction will be lifted, but this would also impact our ability to obtain the transportation service required to handle physical transactions.

Please let me know if you have additional questions.

Greg,


Further to my email to you earlier today, we have tracked down the reasons for the discrepancies in the termination dates in your list versus the chart we have prepared.  In many instances, that contract was reviewed by BCG, and it was determined that the wrong termination date was set, given the provisions of the contract.  I understand that a memo with respect to this issue likely was forwarded to ECC by Chris Christopher and John Eamon on January 8, 2002 ( a copy of which is attached), which set out that based on our review of the contracts, the following parties and their proper termination dates are:

AEC Marketing, physical, gas  - February 1, 2002
Calpine Canada Natural Gas Partnership (Encal) physical, gas - February 1, 2002
El Paso Merchant Energy, physical gas - February 1, 2002
Williams Energy Marketing & Trade Co. - February 1, 2002

Our review last night also revealed the following:
Baytex physical, gas- ECC list says terminated January 6/02, but the January 4/02 letter from ECC set a termination date of January 8/02, which is reflected in the Chart

Marathon Canada Limited physical, gas - ECC list says terminated December 18/01, however the chart suggests that this was revised by a letter from ECC, sent December 31, 01, changing the termination date to January 4/02.  Chris Christopher recalls the letter, but we do not have a copy of that letter.

Calpine Canada Natural Gas Partnership (Orbit) physical, gas - we have reviewed the contract and determined that the chart is incorrect.  It has been changed from February 1/02 to December 18/01, as set out in the ECC list.

I understand that you have reviewed the Cinergy contract and determined the reason for the discrepancy in that instance.

We continue our review of a couple of entries, namely Canadian Natural Resources, Talisman Energy Inc, and Dynegy Canada.  The remainder of the list was either consistent with the Chart, or had no entry and was therefore updated with your information.

Thank you for forwarding this to our attention.

My apologies if this has been done, but I'm in process of assembling list of products that UBS will be trading.  If this list has been compiled, please direct it to me.  

I'm interested in getting the greatest granularity possible breaking it out by VaR portfolio name, trader, trading book, commodity, instrument, location, tenor, relative liquidity for each instrument expressed in contract/day (i.e. could impact holding period for VAR) and best risk mitigator.  (Regarding best risk mitigator, I'm not looking for liquidating position comments, but rather best hedge given curve location.)  This will help in directing correlation efforts for VAR.  See attached spreadsheet for suggested format.

Thanks,
Frank

Hi John,

     As per our conversation last week, I just wanted to double check on a potential raise before the deal closes on Friday. I know that more than a few non-promotional raises have been offered and accepted for the transfer to UBS, and I'd like to make absolutely sure that I'm not eligible for one. As Cowan says, potentially the bonus pool may be much bigger next year, which is great, but it's not for sure. And given the promises Enron has dolled out over the years, it doesn't mean that much right now, especially considering it's in UBS's best interest for us not to make a killing in the first year in order to buy out the company at a lower price.

Thanks,
Ryan"

 I'll look into the other issues, I just thought that you may know who may be handling it, we may just do it directly from Calgary

I have not found anyone who was trying to renew these contracts.  I am meeting with IHS on Thursday so I will make sure we add Accumap.  How many user of Accumap will you need?  I will forward the cost to you prior to sending the contracts to UBS.  

Do you know who managed the contracts with NOVA, Power Pool of Alberta, OASIS or ESBI so that I can gather contact information and begin the contract management of these applications.

Thanks,

Here are the contracts we are currently creating with UBS.  Please verify that we have not missed any applications/publications or subscriptions.  

Highlight in Red the systems you will need and mark the priority from 1-5,  1 being critical.

With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.

To continue getting familiar with Ontario, please review the document OEFC_demandSupp_UBS.ppt on your I:/common/OEFC directory.  It is a presentation we gave to OEFC in the fall.

Here is a spreadsheet with additional information.

 
Some intertie information may vary from source to source.  This is due to the IMO's regular small adjustments to the capacity numbers.

Rob,

Markets
My marks show how we believe the market would trade if the market were open today, considering neighboring markets, transmission/wheeling costs, and fuel costs.  More of a expected liquidation value vs. the current Ontario market players bids and offers.

The market on 3yr 7x24 is being shown by a broker: $46-$48, and on the wholesale side I doubt the bid is actually there, or if so it is only a piece deep (50MW).  

As a result, I would show an actually two way of $43-$47.50 and be coming from the sell side to the industrial customers who may pay in the $46-$47 range.

Peak, my 3yr mark is $52, but given the often bullish nature of new markets, I would be a bid for this summer and then look to offer the 3yr in the low fifties.  Upcoming changes in the Ontario system (Nodal vs. Zonal pricing) would have an effect on these term deals.


Staffing and Services

Trading
On the trading side, I will need to rehire personnel for the roles we laid off (an analyst and a temp IT programmer for fundies development).  Analyst wise, I am interested in bringing Brian Loy back if he is still available.  He has a good knowledge of the NUG contracts and is a good fit for a trading desk.  As our need for providing IMO Energy and Operating Reserve Services (bidding for specific NUGS and Dispatchable Loads) grows, it may be a good idea to bring Heather Mcillmurray over from the settlements group.  I have had initial discussions with Richard Crouch, Paul Devries and Heather on this matter.

Origination
This is your area of expertise. I would suggest two originators and an analyst.  If Dan Dorland is staying, he could continue on the origination side providing education to our new origination team, and being the analyst to assist the OEFC-NUG point personnel (Brian Loy's previous role).  

IT
Implementing the trading and VMS systems is a very important issue where timing will become an issue. I would suggest a short term (6mo) contract with Mike Marryott to manage the system's side of this process and to integrate with the Estate and NETCO on trading and settlements systems (specifically David Posten's VMS team).  His location should be in Toronto.  

Let's get on these issues as soon as possible.

On specific personnel, I would have liked to have retained Jeff Borg and Chris Gaffney. 

Office Space
Tembec, our neighbor on this floor, has often indicated that they are interested in some of our office space. If that interest remains, we could examine leasing all of the space passed the flat screens (the origination desk/pod, one conference room and storage area, not to include our server room).  This would leave us with space for up to 24 people, two conference rooms, & kitchen.  As an alternative, we could consider moving upstairs into the Enron Direct location.

Potential Conflict of Interest
I would suggest releasing employees that will not be part of Estate or UBS relatively soon.  Specifically, the group that is leaving here, but will be participating in the Ontario market.  UBS Ontario information and resources are proprietary and confidential.  If personnel are being kept on to wind-down specific activities, their access to UBS power & gas curves should be restricted.

As time becomes available, we should get together and discuss Ontario's business plan. 

Thank you
Garrett

This email is acknowledgement from the Power Pool of Alberta of the change
in direct sales registration for contracts that are currently registered
with the Power Pool between your organization and Enron Canada Power
Corporation for trading after December 29 HE 1 2001.  On January 4 the Power
Pool received your acknowledgement of Enron's change in the source asset for
the direct sales registrations for contracts 259, 260, 1950 to 1976 (total
of 29 contracts) to modify the source from the Sundance 3 unit (SD3) to
Enron's unmetered source asset (ECP-).  The modified registration terms will
be effective December 29 HE 1 2001 and will apply until the expiry date of
the contract for net settlement purposes.

In addition, as has been verbally communicated to you, the Power Pool was
required to modify two of Encore/EPCOR's direct sales contracts with Enron
Canada Power Corporation that were registered with the Power Pool in 2001
due to the sale of the Sundance 3 unit effective December 29 HE 1 2001.  The
details of these changes are provided below.

John,

Further to the voice message that I left you, I have recalculated the amount
of security that would be required if all of the modified direct sales
contracts are acknowledged by noon January 4.  The calculations are still a
bit rough but I thought this spreadsheet would provide you with something to
review.  I have used a $35 Pool Price in the calculations.  Note the
additional tabs in the spreadsheet that detail the hourly generation that
the Pool has received for SD3 and SD4 .

In determining the actual security required, we will need to review the
megawatts in the contracts registered in detail once we have the
acknowledgements tomorrow.  For simplicity I have assumed that everything is
base load and I know this is not correct.  Once we know exactly what
contracts we are looking at, we can fine tune the calculation.

Tricia, John has a stock option amount reported on his final pay stub that needs to be adjusted. The amount represents taxes on stock options and restricted stock exercised in 2001.  The stock option numbers on the memos sent by PaineWebber are correct, however, the restricted stock exercise should not be reported on the T4 (as per verification by Dave Peters at PriceWaterhouseCoopers on Jan 2/02).  Please make the appropriate adjustments so that the T4 is correct and advise me when corrected.  Thanks!"

John, we just received an invoice from the above company for an electronic tagging service agreement that Bill Greenizan had executed last year.  It is to renew the ETS agreement for an additional one year commencing March 10, 2002 and is in an amount of US$3,000.  I am unsure what the purpose is of the agreement and whether ECC or UBSW need to continue it.  Can you let me know what we should do with the invoice and agreement?

Thanks
Greg"

Please note that Wall 2 Wall has been delayed and will be in tomorrow instead of today.  

Sorry for any inconvenience. 

Carla 

With the recent shuffle of people moving to new desks, I'm sure there will be keyboard trays that need to be moved, as well as some repairs.  Wall 2 Wall will be in on Wednesday afternoon to look after this.  

Please let me know by Wednesday morning if you need anything done. 

Thanks,

Make sure that all curves are downloaded by the end of simulation, 11:00 CST, tomorrow.  Ideally, the 2/7/02 curves should be marked in the morning prior to simulation.  We have been instructed to kick the calculation off as close to 11:00 CST as possible.  This is to ensure that ALL downstream systems are able to run through the simulation.

Please forward to all applicable traders.

Thanks,
Stacey"

Do you need Accumap day one?  Carmen said that it had not been renewed so do you have access to it now?  
If you do need an account how many and for who?

Howdy ,
Friday we closed Cal 2002 $39 and Bom $25 !  
Monday , today , we had a 2003 seller who sold 75  MW, 36, 36.25 and someone else flipped it at 36.5. 
It traded away 36. 
Cal 2002 traded 40.
And, BOM went at $30 for 25 MW 
I have a feeling we need you in this market. Some  of these heat rates are pretty low. Any new things on the horizon ? If you need  more off the record colour give me a call.

Hi John

How was Thanksgiving?  Was the baby shower fun?

I was wondering if you'd have some time to read over Ali's Chicago essays
later tonight?  He's going to submit them on Wednesday.  Let me know if
that's okay.  Do you have a printer at home?  Can I send them to your home
account?  (I don't think Ali will be done before about 8pm or so tonight).

PS:  We need to talk about mom.  I saw her this weekend -- she's gained a
lot of weight, and hasn't been exercising at all.  Dad's pretty frustrated
because all she does is watch tv.  I had a talk with her yesterday telling
her that she has more risk of having a heart attack if she doesn't walk /
exercise than if she exerts herself when exercising (i think she's afraid
of having a heart attack while exercising).  We need to do something --
she's 170lbs now, and should be at around 140lbs to be healthy.

Subject: ClickAtHome Canada Internet Subsidy - Final Reimbursement
Sensitivity: Confidential


Here's the way to claim your Internet fees as part of the ClickAtHome Canada program.   Internet fees are reimbursed through payroll with the final processing date being December 15th .  Below are the simple steps to claim your Internet fees  up to December 31, 2001 :

(1)  Enter your Internet payment information on the ""Clickathome.enron.com/canada"" site.  This initially registers you as an Internet user in the ClickAtHome Canada program and then provides the appropriate information to our accounting department for payment.   You can include your Internet fees from the commencement of the program (June 5, 2001) or for pilot program participants from your commencement date to December 31, 2001. 

(2)  Please complete the first step by  December 15th so your claim can be processed and paid on  December 30th through payroll.   

(3)  Kindly retain a copy of all your claimed receipts as back-up in the event you are asked by Calgary Accounting to provide it. 

** Can't remember your SAP number??  Use this handy site:  <http://isc.enron.com> (follow the instructions for 'SAP or eHRonline password reset' and then 'click here if you have forgotten your personnel number').   Use your SIN number where it asks for Social Security Number and your all set.

If you need assistance with your registration or have questions about your Internet subsidy, kindly contact  Tricia Henry.

i just talked to mom again.  she was super crusty (and even swore!).  i
asked what was wrong, and she said that it's partially about dad, and
partially about the house.  she said dad isn't doing anything around the
house (vacuum, mop) and then she wants to do it, but gets tired.  i told
her i'd get her a maid, and she said no, but i think we should anyway.
what do you think?

i think something's wrong with mom...she's totally down in the dumps (i've
called for the last few days now, and every time she seems depressed)

maybe you should give her a casual call, just to say hi and see what's up
(but don't make it a big deal, or else she'll pretend she's happy and
everything's okay)

PS:  i went to pottery barn kids the other day....super cute!  how's your

Remove 1 teaspoon adobo sauce and 1 chile from  canned chiles; mince the chile.  Place remaining sauce and chiles in a  zip-top plastic bag and freeze for future use.
 
Melt butter in a large Dutch oven over medium-high  heat.  Add bell pepper and bacon; saut? 4 minutes.  Add onions; saut?  1 minute.  Stir in the adobo sauce, minced chile, flour, chili powder, salt  and cumin; cook 1 minute.  Gradually add milk; cook until thick and bubbly  (about 4 minutes), stirring constantly with a whisk.  Remove from  heat.  Gradually add 1 1/2 cups cheese and cilantro, stirring until cheese  melts.  Add pasta to pan; toss well.
 
Spoon the pasta mixture into a 11x7-inch baking  dish coated with cooking spray.  Sprinkle 1/2 cup cheese over pasta  mixture.  Bake at 400 degrees for 15 mins or until browned.   Yield:  6 servings
 
 
Cooks note:  I could not find the prepared can  of whole chiles with the sauce so I just used the can of diced green chiles I  found in the Mexican food isle and threw in what looked to be the right  amount.
 
Enjoy!

Dear Mark  :

Here is the Customer Satisfaction Survey promised in my October 31, 2001 letter. Your input will help improve Customer Service at ESBI Alberta Ltd.  Our consultant, Praxis Research, has worked with us to develop an easy-to-use online survey that should only take about 5-10 minutes to complete.

You may complete the survey online or fax a completed printed version of the web survey to 1-403-249-8983.  If you would prefer to complete the survey via telephone, please call Praxis Research at 1-888-882-1285.

To access the online survey, please click on the following Internet link: www.praxis.ca/eal/eal_survey1.htm.

We have assigned you an individual password: mad98  which you need to access the survey.   If you do not complete the survey at one sitting you can use your password to re-enter the survey and finish your partially completed survey or revise your responses. (Up to Nov. 30 at which time the response period terminates and we analyze the input).

Your responses are confidential. Praxis, the independent research firm collecting the information, will aggregate all data. Comments will always be aggregated by Praxis to maintain individual confidentiality. If, however, you choose to identify yourself, EAL will be glad to respond to any specific comments you make. If you have any questions or concerns about the online survey please contact David de Lange at Praxis Research at 1-888-882-1285 or by email at delange@praxis.ca.

All participants will receive an executive summary of the survey.  In addition, early in 2002 we intend to host a workshop to, among other things, develop customer service improvement initiatives in response to the survey findings.

Your participation in this survey is greatly appreciated.


Sincerely,


Vincent Flynn
President and CEO
ESBI Alberta Ltd.

CNN) -- Seven airport security workers have been suspended after police said a man made it through a security checkpoint at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport with knives, a can of Mace and a stun gun. 
Security screeners took two knives from Subash Gurung, 27, after he initially went through the checkpoint Saturday night, authorities said. Gurung then was allowed to pass through. Seven more knives, Mace and a stun gun were found in his carry-on luggage during a random search before boarding a United Airlines flight, police said. 
The suspect, who told authorities he is from Nepal, was arrested Sunday night by the FBI and will be arraigned Monday on a federal charge of unlawfully taking a weapon aboard an aircraft. He originally had been arrested Saturday by local police, charged with two misdemeanors and released on bond. 
CNN has learned of a possible connection between Gurung and a man who is being held as a material witness in the September 11 terrorist attacks. Gurung listed the same West Hollywood Avenue address in Chicago as the detainee. (Full story </2001/US/11/05/inv.ohare.security.breach/index.html>) 
In the U.S.-led retaliation for the terror attacks, Taliban forces were leaving their southern Afghan stronghold of Kandahar on Monday as U.S.-led airstrikes intensified. 
After a quiet day Sunday -- allied planes dropped a single bomb southeast of the city -- CNN's Kamal Hyder reported heavy bombardment of rural districts around Kandahar as well as military targets to the northeast, southeast and west. 
There were reports of further attacks overnight on the Kajaki Dam area, where a hydroelectric plant is located that provides power to Kandahar. 
Taliban frontline positions north of Kabul also were hit Monday, and there were reports of intense fighting near the strategic northern city of Mazar-e Sharif. "

Subject:	2001 Management Conference


During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Regards,
Ken Lay "

WATT-EX ANNOUNCES EQUITY FINANCING AND MARKET-MAKER AGREEMENT

Dynegy to Enhance Liquidity in Canadian Electricity Market

Calgary, Alberta, Canada (Oct. 26, 2001) - Alberta Watt Exchange (Watt-Ex)
today announced significant advancement in its long-term business plan with
the execution of two definitive agreements. ENTx Capital Corporation and RAW
Energy Ltd. have agreed to purchase treasury shares in OXEN Inc., the parent
company of Watt-Ex. The new capital will be used to broaden the range of
services offered by Watt-Ex and for general corporate purposes.

Watt-Ex also announced that Dynegy Canada Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN), has agreed to provide market-maker services. Under
the terms of the agreement, Dynegy Canada will maintain bid and offer prices
in Alberta electricity forward contracts traded on the online Watt-Ex
system.

Dynegy Canada's market-maker service will serve as a platform for enhancing
liquidity in the Alberta electricity market. The increased liquidity will be
available to suppliers and users to manage price risk, reduce financial
uncertainty and bring greater economic performance into the Alberta
electricity market.

Watt-Ex is an independently owned and operated online trading system for
electrical energy in the Alberta market. It allows market participants to
buy and sell contracts for firm forward commitments in the real time or spot
electricity market, as well as providing for the trade of ancillary
services.

ENTx Capital Corporation is a private equity investor, specializing in
emerging, innovative and financially sound small cap operating companies in
the electric power industry.

RAW Energy Ltd. is a private company, active across most aspects of the
energy industry.

Dynegy Inc. is a leading energy merchant and power generator in North
America, the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. A Fortune 100 company,
Dynegy in 2000 established its communications business, Dynegy Global
Communications, which is engaged in providing network solutions and
connectivity to wholesale customers worldwide.

Dynegy has been an active participant in Canadian energy markets since 1994.
With headquarters in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Dynegy Canada is one of the
country's largest marketers and traders of natural gas, electricity, crude
oil and natural gas liquids.

Certain statement included in this news release are intended as
""forward-looking statements"" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. These statements include assumptions, expectations, prediction,
intentions or beliefs about future events. Dynegy cautions that actual
future results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in any
forward-looking statements. Some of the key factors that could cause actual
results to vary from those Dynegy expects include changes in commodity
prices for energy or communications products or services, the timing and
extent of deregulation of energy markets in the U.S., Canada and Europe;
general capital market conditions; the effectiveness of Dynegy's risk
management policies and procedures; the liquidity and competitiveness of
wholesale trading markets for energy commodities, including the impact of
electronic or online trading in these markets; operational factors affecting
Dynegy's power generation or Dynegy's midstream natural gas facilities;
uncertainties regarding the development of, and competition within, the
market for broadband services in the U.S. and Europe; and uncertainties
regarding environmental regulations or litigation and other legal or
regulatory developments affecting Dynegy's business. Moreover, statements
regarding expected delivery dates of new liquids carriers are subject to
various construction risks that could cause such delivery to be delayed or
prevented, such as a failure to obtain financing or the failure of
third-party contractors or perform their contractual obligations. More
information about the risks and uncertainties relating to these
forward-looking statements are found in Dynegy's SEC filings, which are

Today marks the completion of the 2 week commissioning period for ADMS.
Effective October 26th at 16:00 the System Controllers will no longer follow
up ADMS dispatches with a voice confirmation unless a ADMS message has timed
out because of technical difficulties or the System Controllers have been
notified that a participant is having technical difficulties receiving ADMS
dispatches and directives.

The time out period will be adjusted from the 10 minutes to 5 minutes. We
intend to further reduce the time out to 2 minutes following a reasonable
delay and reassessment based on our operating experience.

We are currently reevaluating the ADMS dispatch procedures with regards to
the Interconnections. Any changes to the Interconnection procedures will be
conveyed to participants well in advance of implementation.

Thanks to all of you for your patience during our implementation of this
valuable new tool.

Sincerely,

Don Adair

Gentlemen,

Besides the upcoming workshop we are organizing in Calgary, I would like
to bring to your attention some of the software technologies we are
developing for Energy Risk management in Calgary.

Our technology is Modular (multithreaded C++ DLLs) and can be integrated
into yours with great ease.
More generally, the cost of software development is quite lower in
Canada, I would also like to explore the possibility of outsourcing some
of your development: we have a strong analytics team: 3 PhD in Numerical
and applied math (all of us are well established Profs at the
University), and a software team ...

I have included a document describing our products.

Regards,
ali lari lavassani

Hi John 
 
The Critical Illness packages were delivered Oct.12 and should be an entire policy in a clear plastic zip bag.  If you can not find the policy at home or around your desk I will gladly request a new policy from Unum.  Unfortunately this is not a generic form, but one that had been preprinted by the Insurance Company.   Let me know...
 
Thanks,
Michelle

Gentlemen,

First, my condolences on your stock price.  All I can say is that I
empathize: AES fell 49% in one day a few weeks ago.  I suspect the market
will bounce back for both our companies before very long.

I attach a speadsheet with slightly revised performance numbers, and per
our last conversation, I have added numbers on ramp rates and start times
to help you better model the optionality.  When the forwards improve (as a
developer, I MUST be optimistic!), you can use this updated information to
update your pricing.  I look forward to resuming our discussions.

Regards,

Derek Denniston
Vice President

I want to install some reporting measures on position limits and VAR metrics here in Canada.  Can you give Brian Gillis the necessary access so that he can prepare the reports for me.

If you have any questions give me a call ?

John, as we discussed, we need access to the O:/erms/controls/rmsdata/~0RMSDBS97a.ldb database in order to run our VAR metrics model here in Calgary (enabling to report Return on VAR, efficiency ratings etc.)  If you could follow up on this on our behalf that would be great.

FYI - I have attached the last e-mail chain where I made the request.

Looking for access, eh?
Database users have gone nuts last few months and even myself, who has access, is being told that I can't run queries I used too.  I'm thinking about putting perf report requirements into a ""gooey"" so IT can program.

I'll continue prodding Bharat to give you the query, and I'll see what I can do regarding the database?

Frank, I have no problem cc'ing you on the report - and it is basically the package of info that Bharat sent to us (RoVAR, Efficiency, Sharpe, etc.).  But Rob and John are not seeing any of these stats yet since we don't have access to the database and therefore do not have current information.  Are you the one to authorize the access?

Debbie, 

I was wanting to get access to the following database for myself and Chelsea Bardal:

O:/erms/controls/rmsdata/~0RMSDBS97a.ldb

We need this access so that we can query and load the VAR information for the Calgary gas desk by trader.  This information will be used to generate a weekly set of performance measures for Rob Milnthorp, the president of ECC, and John Zufferli, the head of ECC trading.

Please let me know if there will be any problems with this.

Once again , the EOL report is ignoring the new customer list that I have given twice now.  They seem to insist that the the Canadian subs that are now tradinig Alberta power that have traded other products on EOL are not new customers. I have all but given up on this issue.

In terms on of # of trades/day for Alberta Power, the numbers for Aug and Sep are low:

August is 24 trades/day not 22 trades/day
Sep is 13 trades/day not 8 trades/day

I will check the gas info later

After having talked to Dawn, I will be in the office until Thursday Feb-21. It was understood that I will be paid for any unused vacation days.

Once again, thank you for your support and good luck with UBS!

Yours Truly,

Stephane Brodeur"

Subject: Management Conference - San Antonio, Texas - November 14-16, 2001
Importance: High



 
It is apparent that the recent September 11th terrorist attacks in the United States has caused havoc in the airline industry with cancelled flights and the rescheduling of numerous flights.  In this regard, I am now looking into chartering a flight from Calgary to San Antonio (and back to Calgary, of course) for the staff invited to the management conference in November.  Could you kindly confirm whether you will be attending the management conference in San Antonio in order that I may provide this information to the airline charter companies with respect to selecting the appropriate sized aircraft.  
 
Paul, I am not sure if you would like to join the individuals travelling from Calgary or if you would prefer to fly directly from Toronto.  Please let me know your thoughts on this.

Regards, Nella 

PS:  I would suggest that anyone who has already booked their flights to cancel same. "

1) Westcoast/Duke Merger (b.c. trading implications)
2) TCGS/Mirant Transaction (market power implications - control of ~8bcf/d supply)

It might be worthwhile for you, me, lambie, hemstock, and keohane to discuss. "

An update from the ADaMS implementation team...

Last week was quite hectic with training and last minute fixes. My thanks to
all of you for your patience and participation and apologies for some
appointments missed.

1. This afternoon we implemented the System Controller portion of the AdAMS
software. All real dispatches will continue 'voice only' until this Thursday
at 14:00.

2. Our development/ test  system will be available until Thursday afternoon
for training dispatches. Al Gulutzan (403-233-4685) is in charge of
participant training.

3. On Thursday at 14:00, we will enable the Participant portion of the ADaMS
software. We expect that you have your people logged in and we'll begin the
parallel operation period where all dispatches will be sent electronically
and will be accompanied by voice dispatch. This period is expected to last 2
weeks. We fully expect that some participants will need longer than 2 weeks
and some will need less.

4. Please advise by return-email if you do not wish to be on this
distribution list or if you want someone else to be on the list

We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:

Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power
Lloyd Will for East Power
Geof Storey for Gas 
Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net
Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys
Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada.
Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.

Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.

I am assuming its zero at the moment.

Hey Jim and Greg, Jessica and I sent a card to Chris's wife asking about his well-being and this is the unfornate response.


 Sent: Friday, October 05, 2001 3:04 PM
Subject: From Anne Wodenshek
Jessica and John,  
Thanks for the card, yes Chris was in the WTC, 105th floor on Tuesday  the 11th...2 days after our 12th wedding anniversary.  I hadn't spoken to  him at all that day and he wasn't able to call after the attack.  I only  hope that he wasn't frightened and that he didn't suffer. 
Some of the  other people who worked for Chris were able to contact their loved ones and they  said that they were going to be evacuated.  None of the 36 people who  worked for Chris got out, and in total, there were nearly 700 employees of  Cantor, Espeed and TradeSpark that didn't survive. 
We are all in a state  of shock and disbelief.  Chris would have turned 36 on 9-22.  He was  the most wonderful, hardworking, dedicated, easy going, kind, loving and  respectful person I have ever known.  He never had a bad word to say about  anyone nor was there a bad bone in his body.  The children and I, (5), feel  like our lives ended that same day.  I can't imagine moving on or ever  being happy again.  There is no reason for this dispicable act...this world  will never be the same. 
There were many articles about Chris in various  papers here in NJ and NY.  I was also on CNN when we were searching for  him.  You can find these at the Starledger.com, NYtimes.com, the Stamford  Advocate, Bergen record and info on the Cantorusa.com website.  I have set  up a trust fund for the children if you are interested.  The address is The  Christopher Wodenshek Children's Trust c/o Attorney Thomas Palace 20 Court  Street Hackensack, NJ. 
I am not sure if John worked at TFS with Chris,  but that sounds familiar to me.  If so, I wanted to let him know the Ted  Mahoney ( or Maloney?) was also at Cantor and is also amoung the missing.    
Thanks again for your kind card and prayers.  Please continue to  pray for peace in our and our children's time! 
Fondly, 
Anne, Sarah,  Haley, Mollie, WIll and Zachy Wodenshek "

This is correct, except that a significant portion of his cost should be reapplied to Enron Direct

I am just wanting to confirm information I received from Tricia Henry earlier this week -  that Sean Lalani should be getting charged to Cost Center 107083 - Power Trading.

To date he has been costed to 150156 - Power Originations.

Please advise whether it is correct to reclass all previous transactions to 107083.

Subject:	Wholesale Offer to Retail


Guys - I understand that you met with Cross et al to discuss wholesale offers to retail. My original position on the matter has not changed. That is, the wholesale desks need to show a wholesale offer to retail. In other words, the offer shown to our retail affiliate, at a minimum, should equal the offer that would be shown in our wholesale business (either through EOL, brokers or the offer given to originators for wholesale customer deals). 

There has been a great deal of discussion with respect to the margins retail is adding to the wholesale offer. From a wholesale perspective, this is irrelevant. The retail business requires large margins due to its nature - small vol, high credit, commission, call centre, invoicing, etc. 

The retail margin only becomes relevant if prices need to be tighter. In those particular cases, both parties need to work together to make sure that our price is ultimately competitive. This may involve one or both parties reducing their imbedded margins and/or offer. 

I am looking to the two of you to help build the retail business. Your leadership and assistance are crititcal to the success of the retail initiative. Without your cooperation, the business is dead. You are both in a position of power to make or break the retail business in Canada. It is very clear that EES Houston is relying heavily on Lavo and his folks to push forward the retail business in the US - it seems to be working. We need to ensure that we are doing the same. I can guarantee you that your efforts will not go unnoticed. 

I understand that sharing the margin was discussed as an option. This option will not work. From an external perspective, it is imperative that Enron demonstrate its retail capabilities as well as retail earnings. If a portion of retail margin remains in wholesale, it does nothing for expanding the stock multiple. I am convinced that the key lever to expanding our stock multiple lies with retail and therefore retail earnings.

If you have any questions or concerns, I would be happy to discuss this further - at the end of the day, it is imperative that we are all on the same page. 

Regards
Rob"

Take the TransCanada Hwy 1 west to Calgary.  This becomes 16 Ave N in the city.

Take Highway 2 south (Deerfoot) when you get in the city.

When you come to the Deerfoot/Glenmore intersection take Glenmore Trail East.

On Glenmore, you'll pass under Macleod Trail (there is a big mall Chinook centre on your right), you'll pass over the Glenmore reservoir.

When you get to Glenmore and 37 st get in the inside lane of Glenmore.  After 45 st, Glenmore will split in 2, stay in the inside (i.e. leftmost lanes).

This fork will lead you to a stop light where you turn left onto Highway 8 Bragg Creek.

On highway 8 you will pass 69st, after the light get in the outside lane and take your next right on Lower Springbank Rd.  At the the stop sign turn left onto Lower Springbank, you should now be going parallel to Highway 8.  After 85 st and before 101st there is a gravel entrance road on your right, take this road, it is 100 feet long and leads to Slopeview Dr, turn left when the gravel road joins the pavement and go to 133 Slopeview Dr.

John,

I would like to talk to you about this EES-Canada position we have.  I have attached the spreadsheet which outlines the Retail Transaction and the hedge position.   My thought is that we should be handling this position out of the Calgary office, I am working on booking of this transaction in a system where we can value it, as it stands right now we have it in an excel spreadsheet.

I will give you a call sometime later this morning.

Thanks,
Jeff Richter

To: All Interested Parties

The ESBI Alberta Ltd.(EAL) would like to invite you to a presentation of the
results from the Powertech study to be held at EAL's offices from 2:00 pm to
4:00 pm on Tuesday October 9, 2001..  EAL commissioned Powertech Labs of
Vancouver earlier this year to carry out studies to derive Total Transfer
Capabilities (TTC) for both imports and exports across the AB-BC
interconnection.  These studies have now been completed and work is underway
to revise existing operating policies (ie.  Specifically OP-333 and OP-328).
The studies confirm that there is an increase in export capability from
additional generation in the Calgary area.

This presentation will focus on the technical results of the Powertech
studies and the impact on TTC for the AB-BC interconnection.  To make the
most of this meeting, please give some consideration to questions of
clarification around TTC you may require.  Please confirm your attendance at
this meeting with Debbie Nering at (403)-705-5210 or e-mail at
debbie.nering@eal.ab.ca <mailto:debbie.nering@eal.ab.ca>  no later than
Thursday October 4, 2001.

Yours truly,
TRANSMISSION ADMINISTRATOR OF ALBERTA

This is operational stuff I received from the Power Pool.  

I seem to be receiving a lot of this kind of stuff and I think it is now appropriate for Enron to change our designated contact person with the Power Pool from me to someone who is more operationally focused.  Please let me know who you want to do that and I will advise the Power Pool of the change.

Dawn,

In addition to my prior e-mail, I have already had an interview with John Zufferli, John Disturnal, Mike Cowan, and Chris Lambie on September 13, 2001.  The interview lasted for 3 hours!  I have not heard back from any of them yet.  Just wondering, would that then be considered as my first round of interview, or would that be already my ""Super Thursday (Saturday)""?

I would also like to thank you for putting me as one of the potential candidates.  I have attached a copy of my updated resume and a copy of my online academic record.  My GPA is back to where I used to be, around the 3.3 range.  Let me know if you would like me to fax in a transcript to you as well.

If you would like more information, please don't hesitate call me at 605.7568 (cell) or e-mail me at school vbleung@ucalgary.ca.

Have a wonderful week ahead!

Subject:	Good Bye

As most of you already know I am leaving Enron after five years to go to Harvard MBA School.  My times at Enron have been beyond the expectations that I had when I stepped into trading hourly power at odd hours of the night  when  I first became an Enron analyst.  Since the very beginning, Enron has given me the chance to demonstrate my talents and the chance to prove myself.  No other company would have given those chances at such a young age.  I like to think that I repaid the favor to at least some degree and am leaving Enron a little stronger than it would have otherwise been.  

Even though I contemplated several other opportunities to leave over the last five years, I never left for another company.  I came to realize that the people that work here are the best, and I have always strived to be among the best.  Aside from the professional skills and energy, the people here have become good friends of mine.   Enron is among the best corporations in the world because of the high quality of people that we have attracted over the years.

Special thanks to Jim Fallon, Jeff Golden, Mark Muller, Dave Delainey, Kevin Presto, and Rogers Herndon, all of  whom have provided me direction and excellent leadership during my time here.

Please find my forwarding email address, phone numbers, and address.  If any of you need anything or come to Boston please look me up, I will always buy the first beer!  Good luck to you all.

Your friend,

John

Corporately, we are not allowed to trade currency outside of Houston.  In the same way, we can't make markets on other traders' markets.  If EOL has enough products in currency, we may be able to post our numbers on the screen inside of the Houston currency traders' two-ways.  I am unsure if we are even allowed to do this.

Subject:	Currency Trading

Hi John,

I am interested in started a currency trading desk in this office. The ultimate goals of this would include providing tighter two-ways for our traders as well as improving our bottom line.   This would open up opportunity for investing in money markets outside of Canada and the US.   The Swiss Franc rose 5.5% versus the US dollar last week and I think that we are currently missing out on excellent opportunities to increase our income.  I think I could make money at currency trading, and this area shouldn't be overlooked. I understand that a substantial amount of preparation is required before this could happen.  Let me know whether or not you think this may be feasible and we can take it from there.

Thanks,
Ian "

As most of you know, American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles was hijacked yesterday and then crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York.  We are very sorry to report that we believe an Enron employee was on board that flight.   Nick Humber, a director in Enron Wind's commercial origination group, was listed on the flight's manifest, and although his family has not received official confirmation that he boarded the flight, they have been unable to contact him.  Nick was based in Boston and was traveling to Los Angeles for a meeting.  We have talked with Nick's family and offered our full support.  Please continue to keep Nick's family and everyone affected by this horrific event in your thoughts and prayers."

I have forwarded you e-mail to John Zufferli.  I don't know who in Canada had input into the Cdn. Operations timetable but I would have thought we would have wanted some physical day 1.  We have 5 of  8 traders here who are very, very, physical in what they have typically traded.  Hopefully John can give you some further insight.

Chris.

Chris,

Do you guys want to trade physical gas (and power?) from day 1?

If so, I note that Cdn. Operations timetable identifies this as a post day 1 item, as they think physical trades will not start until later.

Subject:	APMA Meeting Banff


Alberta Power Markets Association (APMA),  Banff Meeting, September 7, 2001

Location:
Rocky Mountain Resort, Banff
Summit Room (Main Building)

Agenda:
9:00      Coffee
9:30      Opening remarks
10:00     Discussion of the Alberta Power Market with the Minister of
Energy, Murray Smith
11:30     Move to Banff Springs Club House
11:45     Lunch (optional)
12:40     First Tee Time

Note about the meeting:
Our suggestion regarding the tone of this meeting is to forge a stronger
relationship between the market (the members of the APMA) and the
Government (the Honorable Minister of Energy Murray Smith).  The meeting
has been positioned with the minister's office as a discussion forum around
certain key fundamental topics (see points 1 to 4 below)

If you would like to discuss other topics that interest your company please
feel free to air these issues in the discussion.

We are suggesting that everything discussed in this form is held ""off the
record""

Directions:
From Calgary, follow the Trans Canada Highway West to the first Banff exit
(Banff/Lake Minnewanka sign).
Turn left onto Banff Avenue and proceed towards downtown Banff.
The Banff Rocky Mountain Resort is the first hotel on the left, at the
corner of Banff Avenue and Tunnel Mountain Road.


Business casual or golf attire


Potential subjects, as relayed to the minister's office:

1. What is the Government planning to do with the Electricity market?

Over the past 12 months intervention by the government and governmental
agencies drastically affected the market for electricity.  These actions
caused dramatic sudden changes in forward market prices.  The APMA members
are concerned that this behavior (often given the idiom 'reactionary
regulation') will persist.

2. What is the Governments view on transmission lines to the US markets?

The prospect of transmission lines that would directly connect the Alberta
market with US market is an interesting subject to most power marketers.
What is the current position of the government on the how the building,
owning and marketing of these hypothetical transmission lines would work in
the new market?

3. What is the government planning to with the remaining unsold PPA?

Last years decision by the Balancing Pool to sell energy from the unsold
Power Purchase Arrangements in a single auction dramatically affected the
forward market for electricity.  With the balancing pool still the
custodian of the unsold PPAs ? What is the plan going forward for the
release of the unsold PPAs into the market.

Not sure if you have seen this or not, but I thought it was cute.....

 On July 26, 2000, two friends, Jim and John, each received a $1000 bonus
 at work.
 (They both work for Nortel Networks, where in the summer of 2000, there
 was LOTS of money around for bonuses). Jim, being an intelligent,
 financially conscientious person, put the whole $1000 into Nortel
Networks stock. With his $1000, and the transaction cost of
 $35, he was able to purchase 7 shares at $123 each. Having watched the
 Nortel stock climb and climb, he felt very good about this investment,
 happy that he is preparing for the future.

 John, being a more care-free sort, did something slightly different with
 his $1000. John borrowed a friend's truck, and proceeded to the
  Beer Store, where he purchased 33 cases of beer. John also felt very
good about his investment: 33 cases x 24 = is 792 bottles of beer! John,
also
 being an intelligent guy, although perhaps not as forward-thinking as
Jim, calculated that he could drink about 15 bottles per week, and he
wouldn't
 have to buy beer for a whole year.

 Jim, of course, was appalled by John's purchase, and berated him
 constantly about it. As months went by, Jim excitedly watched the
 stock prices, and saw it start to dwindle. ""It'll go back up"", he'd say
to Jim.  Jim, who has been reaping the benefits of his investment
on a daily basis, would reply, ""Ya, it will.  Hang in there buddy ""burp"".

 Months went by, and the value of the stock continued to fall, and there
 was the beginnings of a noticeable dent in the beer pile. Midwinter came,
 Jim's stock had fallen to about half of it's original value, and John's
 beer was about half gone. Jim, being sure that the
 stock had hit rock-bottom, still was berating John for his frivolous
 purchase, telling him ""Your beer will be gone in six months! Who knows
 what my stock will be worth!!"".

 Well, summer has come, and hard times at Nortel continue. Bad news: Both
 John and Jim have been affected by the layoffs.  Last week, in order to
 raise some cash to help through the rough time, Jim sold his 7 shares, at
 that day's value of $12, and got $84, then after paying the $35
 transaction fee, he only had $49.

 Jim stopped by John's house later that day (everyone needs their friend's
 during rough times), and as luck would have it, there were
 two bottles of John's beer left. John, being a good, compassionate
friend, offered to share his last two bottles of beer with his friend.
 Jim appreciated the gesture, and enjoyed the cold beer on the hot
summer's day, but he felt a bit guilty.

 ""At least I got fifty bucks back out of it - you have nothing now."", he
 said. ""That's ok."", replied John.  ""Perhaps you can help me, I need to
 return all these empties."", he added as his other friend with the truck
 pulled in. So, they loaded up the truck, and proceeded off to the beer
 store.

 Upon arrival at the beer store, they unloaded the empties, feeling a
 little grim. John went to the counter, and collected his refund for the
 bottles. ""33 cases x 24 bottles, at 10 cents per bottle, that comes to
 $79.20"", the friendly Beer Store clerk said to John as he handed him the
 money. Jim was speechless. Poor guy. Can you imagine  how you would feel
 if you just discovered that over the course of the
 last year, your $1000 stock investment left you with $50, and taking same
 $1000, buying beer, and drinking it, would leave you with $80. I'll leave
 it up to the reader to come up with they're own ""moral to the story"".

I talked to Milly yesterday, he was ok with the concept of covering the 1 month salary.  I talked to Trish and the easiest/non-tax affected way to handle it is to submit expense forms.  The problem is if you sell the car at a loss, then the loss compensation is tax deductible, if you import the car, then the transport costs/imports duties can be submitted as an expense and is not exposed to taxes. I talked to Trish about exactly what you have proposed and she wasn't sure from an equity standpoint between what was given to other employees that she could do that. However, don't worry about it I'll do my best so that you are kept whole in one way or another.  The easiest position for me to push is if you actually want to keep your car, then you can expense the duty.

John,

Did you have a chance to talk to Dawn / Milly? Even if you want to work the flight / hotel / movers the usual way and then pay the balance as a ""signing bonus"" or something that would probably work. I am going to take a bath on my car in a big way. The option of moving my it back to Canada is out of the question as I just found out I would have to pay 6.1% import duty, 7% GST and about $400 in excise taxes and permits. Let me know.

John

I am interested in joining the gas trading team next summer as I will be graduating from the U of C in April.  I don't know if I should try going through the fall recruiting or try a different route.  I have not talked to neither my superior (Peggy) nor Kathy yet.  

I've been with Enron since October, but I was (will be again this fall) doing support work for Ryan Watt, and sometimes for Mike Cowan during the weekends.  I work with their supply and demand models, calculate their positions, schedule gas on the Nova pipelines, and work with the Suncor and PetroCanada accounts together with the outsourcing team.  Over the summer, I had the opportunity to work with Kathy's group to get some experience on the slightly more complex deal types that Enron offers.

I had an interview with McKay back in early June.  However, I guess back then I was doing summer classes, the interview did not go as well as I hoped.  Now with summer classes over, I was just wondering if I could try again.

Please let me know what you think and I look forward to your reply.

Kind regards,

Victor Leung

Hi  John,
 
Nice to meet you by email and thank-you very much  for making yourself available as a source of further info and assistance!   I'm sure you have gotten a ""download"" that sets the context for us to  have a conversation (or two...) over the next little while.  I am  actually flying to Calgary tonight, so I was going to try calling you tomorrow  morning - however, as a trader, would you prefer NOT to receive any calls during  business hours?  If so, when is a good time to be on the phone for  ~25min?  Please let me know.
 
Per your (relayed) request, I have also attached a  current resume.  In addition, I have pasted in some bullet points from a  recent cover letter that outline what I am interested in pursuing and what I  bring to the table.  I'm primarily interested in tapping you for some  energy industry knowledge and a sense of your experiences.  We'll see what  else can happen from there.
 
Thanks again for making yourself available and  hopefully we can hookup soon.  Have a great day!
 
Andy Crysdale.
 
 
 
What I bring to  the table:

Capabilities: I have developed a broad set of analytic,  communication and project management skills and experience. I have leveraged  these skills extensively in realising successes as a technology salesperson  and project manager, an MBA student and management  consultant.  
Capacity to Learn: Three years ago, I had never heard of  WACC.  I had written a 90th percentile GMAT and was on my was to  Ivey.  In the time since, I have completed the MBA, achieving top marks  in Finance, Marketing and an overall Dean's Honour List standing, I  have taught business courses in Russia, I have worked at two top consulting  firms, consulting on a range of projects in various industries, I have paddled  the Yukon River and my wife and I have bought a house and enjoyed the  arrival of our first child. I am a proactive learner with few  limits.  
Commitment: My personal mission statement is to  positively impact people by creating and facilitating positive change.   This core value keeps me highly motivated and interested in being a catalyst  for change.

 
What I am interested in  pursuing:
 
Strategic Planning and  Analysis:  Following on what I was doing at Monitor, I'm looking around for  companies that have an active corporate planning/internal consulting  group.  For the prospective employer, I bring a valuable set of skills  and the rigorous, hard-working disposition that is a by-product of the Monitor  pedigree.  For me, an internal planning or consulting group allows me to  keep growing my experience with various businesses or business units in  various industries.  It also allows me to network, learn an industry and,  with the right company, transition into line management in the  future.  
Business Development: I am also attracted to the  idea of growing a business, primarily because I like generating impact.   I would be interested in ""business development"" roles that combine an element  of selling with involvement in the strategic planning process; basically, the  processes of figuring out what to do and where, and then doing it.  
Growing, Changing Industries:  I am primarily  looking in the financial services, pharmaceuticals and energy  industries.

hey john,

a few more things.  do you think Enron may be hiring any traders any time?
if so, maybe you could let ali know (he's still figuring out what to do).
also, do you have a soft copy of your UChicago MBA application?  ali's
going to write his GMAT in Sept. and start to apply to bus school.  He's
thinking of applying to Chicago, Columbia, Wharton, Kellogg, and Stanford.
Any thoughts on those?

   Hi John,

   Remember i told you about the guy at work who got fired last week -- he
   has
   a brand new baby and just bought a new house?  Anyway, he wanted to
   speak
   to people in the oil and gas industry (his wife is originally from
   Calgary
   and they may be interested in moving back).  I think he just wants
   general
   info about the type of work you do (or others in the field) and what he
   should think about in terms of applying to firms.  Is it okay if i give
   him
   your number?  If so, would you prefer work or home?

   livia

Subject:	UBS Trade Products

My apologies if this has been done, but I'm in process of assembling list of products that UBS will be trading.  If this list has been compiled, please direct it to me.  

I'm interested in getting the greatest granularity possible breaking it out by VaR portfolio name, trader, trading book, commodity, instrument, location, tenor, relative liquidity for each instrument expressed in contract/day (i.e. could impact holding period for VAR) and best risk mitigator.  (Regarding best risk mitigator, I'm not looking for liquidating position comments, but rather best hedge given curve location.)  This will help in directing correlation efforts for VAR.  See attached spreadsheet for suggested format.

Thanks,
Frank

Hi John,

Remember i told you about the guy at work who got fired last week -- he has
a brand new baby and just bought a new house?  Anyway, he wanted to speak
to people in the oil and gas industry (his wife is originally from Calgary
and they may be interested in moving back).  I think he just wants general
info about the type of work you do (or others in the field) and what he
should think about in terms of applying to firms.  Is it okay if i give him
your number?  If so, would you prefer work or home?

livia

I have given Bill Greenizan formal authority to be your direct supervisor.  Bill will be the point person for any questions, development issues and concerns that your group may have.  You are still welcome to approach me at any time.  However, I feel that given my increased responsibilities with the gas group, it would only be fair to the four of you, in terms of career development, to have more frequent and detailed interaction with Bill.

Thank you.

P.S. I would like to make this announcement in person but as you know it is difficult to get all four of you at the same time."

Just to keep you informed, we are progressing towards launching the AIS Demad Swap. As discussed I have a target date of Sep 30, 01 to launch this product.

Per your suggestions, we have changed the product from a peak to flat (7x24).

John, we are planning to meet and educate counterparties in Alberta to market this product. Do you think brokers are going to play a role in this? Please let me know. If yes then we will educate them on this product as well.

If you think of some thing that we need to take care of at this time, please let me know.

Thanks,

Sanjeev

The estate's DPR reporting requirement to risk controls in Houston is going to be twice a week.  Consistent with this I would also like to change our internal DPR reporting process for ECC Power-Estate from DAILY to twice per week.  Note that curves and an official calc will still be required daily.
 
I would like to make this change starting Feb 1.  Please let me know if you are okay with this.

As a follow up to this email, we will start reporting the DPR's on Wednesday's and Monday's, for Tuesday and Friday valuations.  The first Wednesday will be the 30th of January.  Each day we should expect to report the positions, P&L and PRMA of only those transactions we expect to fulfill.  With the exception of Gas, Susan Trevino will be sending the benchmarks to each of the groups for their review.

Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
 
- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
 
Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.
 
Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.
 
Thanks in advance

Hi,
Did you go away this weekend?  Mom kept trying to call you all weekend.

I took the cousins out all weekend -- they had a good time.  Just wondering, it
was kind of an expensive weekend (i took them out for 2 meals, plus all parking
/ other stuff).  Would you and Jess mind contributing $100-150 to the cause?  I
hate to ask, but i'm trying to keep expenses down given all recent events.

Livia

July  [Angela]  5 th -  [Angela]  14 th are the dates for 2002 Stampede

Tickets for the 2002 Stampede Rodeo go on sale Monday, August 20 through Ticket Master.  I am enquiring how may tickets we would like.  Eric talked about possibly sitting in the Infield seats for our customer event or renting a suite.  Suites will not be determined until the beginning of 2002 once the major corporate sponsors have decided on if they wish to lease the suite for the day.  If you could please try to get back to me by Wednesday with ticket numbers.  I will order tickets on Monday when Ticket Master opens.  

Infield apx $55
Regular Rodeo Seating apx $32

Suite cost about - 
Super Suite - 2001 prices
Rodeo Only includes 50 suite tickets for Afternoon Rodeo only
July 6-13	$13,520	
July 14-15	$14,870	
Chuckwagons Only includes 50 suite tickets for Chuckwagon Races only
July 6-13	$6,760	
July 14-15	$7,435	


Thanks for your request for information on the Calgary Stampede's Infield
Suites.  The Stampede's inventory of Infield Suites for the entire 10 days
of Stampede are held by our major corporate sponsors who have licensed the
suites as part of long-term contracts.

Each year, however, a very limited inventory of suites are offered back to
us from some of our 10-day suiteholders in ""whole-day packages"" -- what that
means is we receive back both the rodeo performance and chuckwagon race
performance to be sold as a package.

This ""return"" of suite dates does not traditionally occur until the new
year, when the companies begin to firm up their plans for the upcoming
Stampede.  Until then we maintain a waiting list of companies wishing to
lease suites for a single day or days.

To be added to the wait list, I require a request in writing with all
company details and preferred dates for Infield Suite use.

Please let me know if you have any other questions, I would be happy to
assist.

We can meet at my house at around 7:30 PM tonight.

Can every dress up in as bushman or farmer outfit as you have.

It might be funny for Rob to wear a hockey jersey with the letter C on it.

Does anyone have a chalkboard?

Kyle can you bring you abacus?

Are we papering ECC's financial trades with BP Corporation North America (BPCNA) under the ISDA that we have between ENA and BPCNA and just back to backing our trades between ENA and ECC???  I am not trying to be a pain in the butt...but... I just want to make sure we are covered.  Please advise.

Subject:	Etag 1.7 Training

I was looking in to the up-coming training sessions for the new etag system that OATI is rolling out on October 25, 2001.  They have two different training sessions, a one day workshop that is for experienced users and does not include any hands-on training, and a two day training session that includes hands-on training.  The two day session however, includes a second day of training on NERC Policy 9 regarding congestion management that may not be overly important to Calgary operations.

OATI says that version 1.7 is drastically different from the current software and training is highly recommended.  I was thinking that it would be a good idea to send one of us to the 2-day training session and then that person could pass on the information to the other 3.  I think, by the sounds of it, we would only need to attend one day since the second day deals with the NERC policy for the eastern interconnect only.

There is a training session that runs on October 1-2 in Minneapolis.  I am off those days, and would be more then happy to attend.  I can take care of all the registration and travel planning with Angela if you would like.

The cost of the session is $250 for 2 days, or $150 for the first day only.  There are only 8 spots left for this session.

Let me know what you think.

Mike

Can you re-activate the Alberta Power Pool Access to EnronOnline.  Although this entity doesn't trade, it is important that they have access to the Alberta Gas and
Alberta Power product for view only.  This is a government entity that controls important gas generators in the province. They use our info about AECO gas in dispatching these units and they are an advocate for electricity trading in the province.  Therefore, they need to see the Alberta Power market data on EOL.

Thank You 

John Zufferli

Sad day.  Monitor North America is laying off people today -- ali got fired this
 morning (he was intending to come back to work this month)
Anyway, it happened fairly quickly and without notice.  My job is safe for now,
but who knows.  I'm going to start looking
around I guess...not sure at what.  Ali's not sure what to do -- maybe apply for
 an MBA program.  John -- would you
be able to give him pointers on what he should include for a Uof Chicago
application?

I'm going to see mom tonight in London.  Her surgery is tomorrow, and she's
pretty nervous.  This is just working out to be

John,

We are working on an EnronOnline Website Audit.  We have noticed that many traders have duplicate ID's and are not using some of them.  In an effort to reduce risk, we would like to inactivate all ID's that are no longer valid for traders.  Please note that inactivating these ID's will not effect matrix trades.  Please review the following information and let us know if these are valid books and ID's.

The balancing pool committed in the their beginning of year release to dispatch Milner as follows:

70 MW @ $0
50 MW @ $35.49

Milner has been down for maintenance until recently.

Since coming back from maintenace, the 50 MW block @ $35.49 has disappeared.  We analyzed the offer stack and it appears
that Milner has the full 120 MW @ $0

I called Doug Heath to discuss this.  He hasn't called me back. 

The issue I raised last week about Sherness dispatch is OK. I received a justified answer.  However, this Milner issue is harder for th pool to defend.

Can we pursue this.


Thanks

I was talking to John Lavorato just this morning and he said that he e-mailed you a memo that described the topics that he wanted to talk about next week. 
Do you have a copy of that?

John, you will see that a number of topics that Lavo wanted to cover with you and your trading group can be illustrated through the use of the performance metrics that are being put together. You may want to use these v. creating new ones.

Good afternoon, all.  

We are exploring ways to assist you with your financial planning needs and have asked a financial planner to meet with you 'en masse' to discuss financial structures that are out of the norm - innovative solutions to tax, retirement and other financial planning issues.  His name is Murray Greenberg and he's associated with the firm, Financial Dynamics.  Murray has extensive experience dealing with senior managers at companies that include Northstar Energy, Deloitte & Touche and Toronto Dominion. 

If, as a result of this meeting, you are interested in what Murray has to offer - you may approach him individually and arrange for personal financial planning.  You are responsible for any fees associated with future arrangements.

Please let me know if you are interested in attending this meeting or if you would like further information.  Nella and I will pull together some potential meeting dates within the next 2 weeks.

Thanks....."

Can you change John MacKay's name in the Natural Gas Fixed Price Positions by Trader, Natural Gas Basis Positions by Trader, Natural Gas P&L to Chris Lambie.
John is being relocated to Houston and Chris Lambie is now in charge of the Alberta Gas Term Desk.  Additionally, can you merge the P&L under  MacKay and
Add. Trading into one line item and call it Lambie. Therefore Lambie should be (41,480) as of yesterday's report."

Your numbers amount to a adjustment of (1,746,675), were the total 2nd order from Jun 29 was (1,891,851), now I understand that I would receive a some negative 2nd order to explain some of this difference I just thought that (145,176) difference (i.e. (1,891,851-1,746675) which should be the true 2nd order) was a bit high.

Subject:	p/l adj due to option liquidations

I wanted to update you on what we have found regarding the liquidations for the financial options and the 2nd order. The problem began at the end of June when coding in enpower was changed for how the delta was reported for put options only. This change to the delta did not carry through to the liquidation values for and as a result the options were liquidating showing a loss instead of a gain. This resulted in large losses in 2nd order because the p/l that could not be explained due to the incorrect liquidations was placed there. The IT group is working to fix the problem which should be done in the next day or two. Until then, Karim and myself will manually reflect the correct liquidations and p/l in the DPR until Enpower is fixed going forward starting with July 18th p/l.

Karim and I have figured the p/l adjustment that needs to be made for July and the last day of June. The total adjustment is $1,746,675 as follows:

July = $1,529,869 (July 1 - 17)
June 29th = $216,806  

The July adj was captured on July 17th p/l. The June adjustment needs to be captured as PMA adjustment. As result of the DPR being incorrect for June against the financial liquidations report, the liq rec should be out of balance by at least the adjustment noted above. An FYI for accounting, the financial liquidations report is reporting the correct liquidations numbers for any financial put options!!! The problem lies within the Enpower portcalc not the Financial liq report and that is why the lic rec should be out of balance.

John,

I just got of the phone with Postlethwaite and he said we will make the adjustment tommorow morning before the final dpr #'s, the correction should add approx. $1.5 million in P&L.  Sorry for the delay in resolving the issue.

I also found out that you had no liquidations in June
and had $22,000 in liquidations in May in your options book (these amounts do not take into consideration any premiums)

Do these #'s seem right to you??? ( I am going off what Postlethwaite has told me).

Hi everyone,

I just got of the phone with Hai and he told me how to make an adjustment on a day to day basis in regards to incorrect liquidations but he also explained this is just to make the daily P&L #'s right, if nothing were done the month end P&L would still somehow work out because adjustments would be made. Does this mean that for June and for a certain portion of July we should not do anything and just make adjustments on a going forward basis (and assume everything will work out at month end)?
If this is the case I would like someone to walk me through June to see if the numbers did really work themselves out as there was a large swing in second order on June 29 that was not adjusted for.

Let me know if one of you could help me do this.
Karim.

The post id I am looking at for Calgary is 11608. I am looking at the option liquidation report and all of the $65 puts are in the money and the $75 call is also in the money. Shouldn't all the liquidation values from the beginning of the month be a negative (representing positive liquidation) for the puts? The liq value for the call is CORRECT.

Hi John;

I have a commitment (signed application) from the client to contract for power from Enron Direct. I now need to fix the price with you. I had given the attached spreadsheet to Jason last week and the load following ratio was calculated at 1.12 to the flat block pricing. 

The power flow date is July 20, 2001 and ends at 0:00 A.M. on August 1, 2002.

The data on the spreadsheet is the notional quantity of power in kW, for each day, by hour ending, by month. 

Total annual consumption is 3,778,235 kW.

Normally I would get Jason or Shawn to give me the price but I understand they are out of the office for the afternoon.

Please advise me if you need anything else.

Thanks,
Mark Dickin.

Dear Participants:

I'm writing to provide you with an update on our progress to launch the
Automated Dispatch and Messaging System, or 'ADaMS' for short. In my May 25
note I outlined the efficiency benefits of the new system, and attached a
copy of our tentative implementation schedule.

Since then, we've been busy testing the product to make sure it meets the
Power Pool's standards for quality, and the expectations of our
participants. And to be frank, at this point in time it doesn't quite
measure up. We feel we'd be jeopardizing the quality of the product to meet
the timeline. And that's not the way we do business. Instead, we've decided
to shift the launch to early September 2001. The change will also provide
additional time for participants to prepare, especially during the summer
holiday season, and allow for more one-on-one training with individual
participants as requested.

Our technical staff will be contacting you in July, to ensure you can
connect to the system and receive test dispatches.  Also, we will contact
you with a firmer implementation schedule as we approach September.

In the meantime, if you have any questions please feel free to contact
either myself at (403) 233-6491, or your respective Participant Liaison
listed below.

Company Name:   A-E  Elizabeth Vergara (403) 233-6405

Thank you for your cooperation.

This is not just a July 6 issue.  Before June 29, my 2nd order effects have been less thatn 15000 CDN$.

For the following days, my 2nd order effects have been:

June 29		C$ (216,729)
July 2		C$ (140,533)
July 3		C$ (212,285)
July 5		C$ (117,156)
July 6		C$ (385,535)
July 9		C$ (264,504)

What is going on?  Can you explain ?

The following is a summary of our findings regarding the high 2nd order for option deal 638008 , effective date July 6, previous date July 5:

The total deal daily change: -172899 is correct.
The historical greeks and curve shift are correct. They add up to -62084
The daily liquidation value  [196872] is not correct, and is pushing the 2nd order to a very high (highly negative) amount. Upon examining the option liquidation report, we find that there is $43680 in liquidation and $153192 in expiring options. 
This totals to $196872. The issue is, the expiring options are no longer part of the option's effective date value, and they were part of the previous date's value (since they hadn't expired yet). Therefore, the liquidation values should be:
Liq: $43680
Expired: -$153198

which totals to a negative value of -109512. If we use this value (-109512) in the daily liquidation column (which arguably could be split between liquidation and expiry) instead of the current value (196872), which results in a second order value of -1297.

We are still discussing the causes and implications of this issue. Please let us know if you have any further questions or if you have any issues with this explanation.

Hi John,
As I mentioned in my voice mail, Louise has asked that we confirm the information on the attachment, and if appropriate, allocate funds to everyone involved with these deals. We initially assigned the funds to your name because there were not any names listed in the Risk Books for these deals. (please refer to Canada-Zufferli on the Originator tab.)

If you could, please let me know your thoughts by the end of day today per her request.  I'm at x30352 if you have any questions. Thanks!

Hi Louise,

As requested, attached is a file that contains June YTD Originations by Originator.

We've arranged the file in the following sorts:

by team
by Originator (sorted alphabetically)
by Originator (sorted by value)
Top 10 Overall Originators by Value
Top 10 Originators- Gas
Top 10 Originators- Power

An item to note is that not all deals had a related individual's name (such as Enduser)- we left the listing as it appears in the Risk Book in these cases.

We'll send you an update if the DPR amounts move (the DPR isn't final yet.)

Please let me know if you need any additional information!

Two things to note are: 	1) I bought 125 MW of Cal 02 flat from Mirant for a 10 GJ/MWh heat rate

Subject:	Alberta Power vs MID-C

I sent you an update of the Hedge Summary for July 3, 2001.

In that I mentioned that I bought 125 MW of Cal02 at 10 HR flat.  I am long over 500 MW at this heat rate.  The biggest risk in this position is a large hydro year that
tanks the Mid-C (i.e. uncorrelated event with gas).  Mid-C off-peak is $47 USD, Nymex fixed price for Cal02 is $3.79 USD and Sumas basis is $0.16 for Cal02.  This implies a heat rate of close to 
11.9 for the off-peak Mid-C.

I am thinking about buying back some AECO gas hedge for Cal02, then selling Mid-C off-peak to replace the gas hedge.  Perhaps as winter blow-out protection, buy some Jan-Feb Sumas basis.  

The trade for a 25 MW long Alberta flat position would be:
			a) sell 25 MW of Mid-C off-peak
			b) buy 0.25 contracts /day of AECO fixed price Cal02 gas (i.e. to unwind the off-peak Alberta portion of the the gas hedge)
			c) buy 0.25 contracts/day of Sumas Jan-Feb basis

See what you think??

Subject:	Automated Dispatch Messaging from the Power Pool of Alberta

The implementation of the Automated Dispatch Messaging System (ADMS) from
the Power Pool of Alberta is proceeding on schedule, however, the processes
for implementation and training are changing slightly as described below.
The purpose of this memo is to inform all of the participants who have been
contacted for the implementation of ADMS of the processes over the next few
weeks and the requirements for the implementation at your dispatch
locations.

Beginning the week of July 2, 2001 and continuing through July 13, 2001,
Power Pool staff will be contacting you individually to provide you with
your username and password and ensure that you are able to log into the web
site.  This initial web site will be on a development system that is not
connected to the active market system.  This will enable participants to log
onto the system to become familiar with the screens and user features as
well as receive test dispatches.

Beginning the week of July 16, 2001, the Power Pool will turn off the
development system web server and transfer to the active market system.  The
System Controller area will contact each participant and ""walk you through""
the screens and answer any questions that you may have regarding use of the
system.  Once you are familiar with the system through this conversation,
future active dispatches will then be provided over the ADMS system.  The
sequential addition of participants to the system will enable the orderly
transfer from the voice dispatch process to the automated process with a
minimum of disruption in the dispatch process.

The above process changes the manner in which training will be provided.  In
reviewing the user screens, we believe that participants will be able to
understand how to use the system simply by having access to the system prior
to the implementation.  If there is any difficulties encountered using the
system, the System Controllers will be available to assist you with any
questions as your users begin to use the dispatch system.

The majority of you have indicated that your computer equipment is in place
and that you are ready to start implementation.  If you are unable to start
the implementation process on July 2, 2001, please let the Power Pool
contact know and he will arrange to schedule your user names, passwords and
access closer to July 16, 2001.

The implementation of digital certificates to enhance the security of the
system will be delayed for a short period of time to enable a newer and
simpler digital certificate system.  We believe that by implementing without
the digital certificates, fewer implementation problems will be encountered
and will also simplify the digital certificate installation process with
users at a later date.  Our implementation of username and password
protection combined with server certification provides adequate security in
the short term before the digital certificates are incorporated.

As we discussed, the system provides audible alerts for the users when a
dispatch is received.  I am attaching six files that contains audible alert
sounds for you to load on your computers.  To install these .wav files on
your computers, create a folder
			C:\\PPOA\admin_sounds
and copy these files to the new folder.  Your internet browser will then use
these files for the audible alerts that are provided by the system.  You can
review this with the person who will be contacting you with usernames and
passwords if there is difficulty implementing these alert sounds.

As the implementation portion of the ADMS project moves to the operational
area of the Power Pool, contact points with the Power Pool will change.
Effective immediately, would you please use the following contact names for
work on the ADMS implementation.

		Primary contact:
				Jack Kelly
				(403) 233-6410
				jack.kelly@powerpool.ab.ca
<mailto:jack.kelly@powerpool.ab.ca>

		Secondary contact:
				Jerry Mossing
				(403) 233-6409
				jerry.mossing@powerpool.ab.ca
<mailto:jerry.mossing@powerpool.ab.ca>

Thank you very much for your cooperation in getting this system underway.

Barry Rushford

Subject:	Ancillary Services Exchange Customer Document-Version 1

Colleagues
Arising from comments received from Friday to yesterday, Watt-Ex has
incorporated a number of changes into this executable Version 1 of the
referenced document.

We are attaching a blackline copy and clean copy of this document for your
perusal.  We believe we have been able to accommodate most of the change
requests -- but not all.  We would be pleased to respond to any comments you
may have on the changes as well as those we have not included.

The key modifications from Draft 3 to this Version 1 relate to the
following:
	1) 3011. and 3209.  Failure to Supply:  Liquidated damages have been capped
both for non-System Events and System Events.  The original context of costs
attributable to liquidated damages included WSCC penalties -- the caps serve
to limit the total amount of liquidated damages claimed against the failed
supplier.  In addition, the penalties under (b) (i) in both sections have
been removed.
	2) 204.  Code of Conduct:  This section has been beefed up to provide a
directive concerning any potential market manipulation that could cause WSCC
penalties to be applied.
	3) 116.  Mediation and Arbitration Procedure: The Mediation procedure has
been modified to allow the parties the option of proceeding directly to
arbitration if they so wish and have applied a finite completion time on the
process.
	4) Schedule 6, 6000.  General:  Applied direction of applicability of
sections to Transmission Administrator
	5) 6004.08  Additional Security:  Due to exposure on liquidated damages,
Watt-Ex is requiring that Sellers post security for same within 90 days
(this is roughly timed for October trading) unless there is sufficient
Receivables to cover.

We would again request your indulgence to review and execute this Version 1
as soon as possible.  In this regard, we request that customers complete
pages 1-3 of the document plus individual Schedule 2's for each Ancillary
Service Facility and fax a signed copy of pages 1-3 plus the Schedule 2's to
Watt-Ex to immediately activate your trading privileges.  Please mail the
originals to Watt-Ex, we will execute and return your file copy.

If there are any outstanding items you wish to have considered/reconsidered,
Watt-Ex will accept such written comments for consideration in a future
version of this Customer Document.

Watt-Ex is also prepared to provide any of the following documents if it
will assist you in attaining comfort with all the attendant infrastructure
surrounding the operations of the Exchange.  Please advise if you wish a
copy of any/all of these documents.

	1) Alberta Securities Commission Exemption Order
	2) The NCM insurance binder document for the credit backstop arrangements
	3) Deposit Agreement with Watt-Ex's Trustee, Royal Trust Corporation of
Canada
	4) Confirmation of ESBI Alberta Ltd.'s Credit Approval to $20 million.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact the undersigned by
return e-mail or call 403-210-8222, 403-210-2144 or 780-940-2820 (cell).
Thanks
Doug Andrews

I tried to answer you but my response was returned undelivered.  Basically, the pool is agnostic, it pays power producers for the pyhsical energy delivered to the grid and it charges power consumers for energy taken from the grid.  Any financial arrangements between the buyers and sellers are not known to the pool.  The only mechanism the pool uses for physical power transactions is the direct sale mechanism.  The terms and volume of these direct sales are entered in the pool's trading system.  The pool then subracts the volume of the direct sale from the consumers and producers meter and pays/charges the producer/consumer on the net volume (i.e actual production-direct sales or actual consumption-direct sales)

Derek/John,
 
Quick question... from what I have read, it  appears as though the way the Power Pool works, the Pool settles with the buyers  and sellers each month.  However,what happens when we contract with a  counterparty directly?  Does the pool collect payment due for energy  delivered under a bilateral contract and then forward payment onto the  supplying party?  Or does the financial settlement occur directly between  Enron and the counterparty?  Please advise,
 
Thanks,
 
Wendy

Financial settlement occurs between Enron and the customer.  The pool is agnostic to what its participants do (i.e. generators that do 3rd party physical hedge are still paid by the pool, consumers of electricity who do 3rd party physical hedges also pay the pool)

Or does the financial settlement occur directly between  Enron and the counterparty?  Please advise,

Hey John:

Will be in your old town next week, plan to get together with Fisher and
Cunningham and to meet Meghan Fisher for the first time.....

You have any thoughts/insight on when the bleeding stops on your stock, and
others like ILA, RRI, DYN, EPG?  Looks to me like investors are no longer
wowed by big earnings from the western markets and are very concerned about
sustainability of some very high earnings growth rate projections.  Also
curious as to how this has impacted morale vis a vis stock options and if
management is commenting.....

Hope all is well with you!

Group,

Going forward we will be transacting with Enron Canada Corp on an over-the-counter basis.  We will provide them with a bid and an offer suitable for non-firm energy trades.  Enron Canada will contact us each morning to inquire about possibilities for export and import.  We should be familiar with the Alberta Power Pool forecast and be aware of the conversion from CDD to USD.  The lead or NW trader will provide Enron Canada with their estimate or feel of the market each morning and throughout the day.  

Enron Canada will be trying to obtain non-firm transmission nearly every hour.  WE need to tell them if this is an unwise practice from a risk-reward standpoint based on our understanding of the market, as they will lose around $7 per mw (CDD) on unused transmission with zero chance for return.  

Further, Enron Canada wants the opportunity to transact with other counterparties at the BC Border.  They will give us the first look, but if we cannot use their energy, they will contact WWP, IPC, TransAlta or other counterparty in an attempt to recoup some of their loss.  I do not see a need for this and I think it leaves us open to tainted customer relationships, financial loss, and embarrassment.  If we are in contact with Enron Canada before the fact (start of the day, top of the hour, etc.) we should be able to get them the best price for their energy.  Be very clear in your dealings with NW counterparties that you are buying or selling a non-firm product.  Determine a book-out price to solve problems with physical flow if necessary.  We are basically buying a put or a call and should pay our counterparty appropriately.

Finally, I would like to see improved communication with Enron Canada.  It appears we have limited our contacts within our own company and hindered the flow of information to both parties' detriment.  I feel we can do better.  I want to prevent a repeat of this weekend (ECC selling/buying from a counterparty in the US without our knowledge) and do not want the NW being scoured by both Enron Canada and Enron North America.  This is counterproductive for both parties for obvious reasons.  Providing a bid/offer and being prepared to act on it is a change in our relationship with Enron Canada.  This should force a renewed emphasis on communication and market fundamentals that can only be beneficial.  If you have questions or ideas regarding our relationship with Enron Canada, please let me know.

Thanks,
Bill"

John, one thing to consider with your nat gas org is the reporting of disturnal to john arnold. From my standpoint, this was an unfortunate move and is similar to us losing the east gas desk to Houston. You will want to give this careful consideration, particularly if you are looking to disturnal to trade alberta power options. With the change in leadership we should discuss whether we want to grab disturnal back (solid line reporting) and suggest dotted line to arnold.

fyi - his P&L for accounting purposes continues to roll-up to canada. However, for internal mgmt reporting, his p&l rolls up to arnold. "

1) For a full requirements deal, I would like some sense of the load shape of the customer.  Having just monthly total energy consumption is not enough to price a deal.
2) The all requirements price may be less or greater than the peak price, it is dependent on load shape.
3) That is correct.

Subject:	Load Following

John
I would like to clarrify how the load following deals for electricity look.  I understand that you are willing to price full load following deals for ED customers for both cummulative and interval meter sites.

1.  What information do you require us to provide you to price a full requirements deal?  We generally see 12 months of average monthly consumption for cummulative meter sites.  Do you need to know which utility the customer is with?  i.e. for NSLS purposes.
2.  How would an all requirements price compare to a peak hour price?
3.  If you were to provide us with a full requirements deal I am assuming that ED would charge/pay  ECC for the delta between the fixed price and the pool price.

The ED standard contract currently does not contemplate a true all requirements deal.  The standard deal structure being used for cummulative meter sites is for a fixed price / volume block of power and for interval meter sites it is a defined volume by hour of the day  for weekdays and weekends by calendar month.

We would appreciate clarrification from you.

 Many thanks

Kate"

We have traditionally have had currency issues in Canada regarding P&L preservation versus cashflow preservation.

We have been valued in P&L under the US$ but due to Revenue Canada reasons our functional currency has been C$ (i.e.  the preponderence of cashflows were in C$ from the legacy gas deals, PetroCanada, Suncour, etc, and the PPA position).  Since trader evaluation at year end has been in US$, traders would hedge C$ positions immediately as the trade occured.  The hedge would extend until the position rolled of his book.  From a P&L systems point of view, this would preserve the trader's P&L in US$.  However, from a treasury point of view currency risk would still exist until cash exchange hands; these cash exchange dates were different for financial trades, physical trades and inter-company trades.  There was also some currency risk (albeit small) between billing dates from SAP and settlement dates of the respective trade type.

It is my opinion that the functional currency should match the evaluation currency in order to mitigate many of the above problems.  To a certain extent, I am indifferent if it is US$ or C$.

The timeline of the decision is being driven by our accounting group who need to set up the SAP system.  They are trying to work within a deadline to have the company capable of performing transactions by Jan 29.  This is the date that they have been told to meet by Houston.  As a result, we would need a determinination of the functional currency by Mon Jan 28."

John, we may be able to do something for Tyler on this issue.  However, I have no record on file of his seeking approval to take the courses (CFA, I believe).  Can you confirm that you gave him verbal approval or that you were aware that he was taking the course, etc.  Thanks....

Dawn,
Is there any way that I can make a tuition reimbursement claim for the fall? The courses finished before I was let go from Enron, but I didn't receive my grades until recently. Cash is getting a bit tight these days, so I would appreciate it very much if there's anything you can do. Let me know.

Just a quick note after my first look at the numbers.  The only concern I have is with the base number.  Seeing as there is no money up front, the future payments look a lot more like long term comp. than any real signing or retention bonus.  When I came to Enron two years ago I took a $35,000 decrease in base pay in exchange for options and the opportunity to trade for number 1.  That is no longer the case (no options and UBS is not #1) therefore I would look for my base to better reflect market on a go forward basis.  If you are able to accommodate a reasonable adjustment in base I would be very excited about the opportunity to sign with UBS.

I would like to talk about this on Monday, after I have had a chance to look at the paper in full.

Chris."

Seeing as there is no money up front, the future payments look a lot more like long term comp. than any real signing or retention bonus.  When I came to Enron two years ago I took a $35,000 decrease in base pay in exchange for options and the opportunity to trade for number 1.  That is no longer the case (no options and UBS is not #1) therefore I would look for my base to better reflect market on a go forward basis.  If you are able to accommodate a reasonable adjustment in base I would be very excited about the opportunity to sign with UBS.

I would like to talk about this on Monday, after I have had a chance to look at the paper in full.

I am reading your mail, I have asked for the same thing regarding my base. Especially since I came up here with a base salary converted at 1.48 CDN/USD and with no raise since being here at 1.61 CDN/USD I have received a 9% pay cut relative to my peers in Houston.  Not to mention that my base salary is $50-$100 USD/year lower than what other shops are offering.  However, after three attempts, I have been unsuccessful in championing my own cause.

Subject:	RE: Ontario Update

Rob,

Markets
My marks show how we believe the market would trade if the market were open today, considering neighboring markets, transmission/wheeling costs, and fuel costs.  More of a expected liquidation value vs. the current Ontario market players bids and offers.

The market on 3yr 7x24 is being shown by a broker: $46-$48, and on the wholesale side I doubt the bid is actually there, or if so it is only a piece deep (50MW).  

As a result, I would show an actually two way of $43-$47.50 and be coming from the sell side to the industrial customers who may pay in the $46-$47 range.

Peak, my 3yr mark is $52, but given the often bullish nature of new markets, I would be a bid for this summer and then look to offer the 3yr in the low fifties.  Upcoming changes in the Ontario system (Nodal vs. Zonal pricing) would have an effect on these term deals.


Staffing and Services

Trading
On the trading side, I will need to rehire personnel for the roles we laid off (an analyst and a temp IT programmer for fundies development).  Analyst wise, I am interested in bringing Brian Loy back if he is still available.  He has a good knowledge of the NUG contracts and is a good fit for a trading desk.  As our need for providing IMO Energy and Operating Reserve Services (bidding for specific NUGS and Dispatchable Loads) grows, it may be a good idea to bring Heather Mcillmurray over from the settlements group.  I have had initial discussions with Richard Crouch, Paul Devries and Heather on this matter.

Origination
This is your area of expertise. I would suggest two originators and an analyst.  If Dan Dorland is staying, he could continue on the origination side providing education to our new origination team, and being the analyst to assist the OEFC-NUG point personnel (Brian Loy's previous role).  

IT
Implementing the trading and VMS systems is a very important issue where timing will become an issue. I would suggest a short term (6mo) contract with Mike Marryott to manage the system's side of this process and to integrate with the Estate and NETCO on trading and settlements systems (specifically David Posten's VMS team).  His location should be in Toronto.  

Let's get on these issues as soon as possible.

On specific personnel, I would have liked to have retained Jeff Borg and Chris Gaffney. 

Office Space
Tembec, our neighbor on this floor, has often indicated that they are interested in some of our office space. If that interest remains, we could examine leasing all of the space passed the flat screens (the origination desk/pod, one conference room and storage area, not to include our server room).  This would leave us with space for up to 24 people, two conference rooms, & kitchen.  As an alternative, we could consider moving upstairs into the Enron Direct location.

Potential Conflict of Interest
I would suggest releasing employees that will not be part of Estate or UBS relatively soon.  Specifically, the group that is leaving here, but will be participating in the Ontario market.  UBS Ontario information and resources are proprietary and confidential.  If personnel are being kept on to wind-down specific activities, their access to UBS power & gas curves should be restricted.

As time becomes available, we should get together and discuss Ontario's business plan. 

Thank you
Garrett

I can't afford to bump anyone, unfortunately all the people on this list are top notch.  We are trying to separate the cream from the cream.  Given that, and working on the assumption that Dan D is a rock star (i.e. not knowing him from Adam otherwise) I think we should relace Lalani with him.

Guys, I believe Dan would like to go to UBS. I'm not sure that I will be successful at moving our headcount up to accomodate him. Any thoughts on who we would bump? The current list is as follows (headcount = 20):

Marketing:			Trading:
Milnthorp			Zufferli
Davies				Cowan
Le Dain				Clark
Biever				Dorland, C.
Drozdiak			Draper
Sangwine			Lambie
Burnham (TO)			Richey
McPhee 			Watt

Lalani				Brodeur (TO)*

* possibly unneccessary if D. Dorland is in. however, could support marketing"

Things are going well here. We have been working on cleaning up Dec. I cautiously optimistic about UBS. I think the fact that they put no money up front could make things difficult with the creditors. I am not sure if they will accept the fact that will only get money from profits that we make. There are no guarantees that we will be profitable.

Yeah, the last few weeks are hard. I am sure she is at the point she just wants it over with. Are you ready for your life to get flipped around. It's a lot of fun but difficult for the first 2 months. After that it get's easier as you go.

So I assume you are riding it out with UBS? Not sure how I feel about the situation. Could be just the fear of the unknown.

How is Cooper doing?

Dad asked if I wanted to lend you some money but I am reluctant to do it at
this point in time since:

a) I am not completely at liberty to touch all the cash that I have
received lately for concern that it may be taken bank under potential
creditor action against Enron.  Unfortunatelty, without this cash, I really
can't afford to lend any.  The cash that I received recently represents 80%
of the cash that I have and I am not sure when I can count on this cash
with any degree of certainty.  Therefore, I am reluctant to touch this
money for at least 6 months.

b) As of right now, I don't have a job after Feb. 28.  The new company deal
that Enron is trying to structure with its traders and a new buyer will not
be
done until the month.  If this deal falls through, then I have to find a
job with another company.  In this case, it is most likely that I will have
to move back to the
US since my contacts and the most lucrative opportunities (i.e. compared
the the new Enron deal) are there.

c) If I had the cash to give, Dad asked that I could give you a discount to
the bank mortgage.  With discount rates near 5%, even if I gave you a
mortgage at
4%, I don't think the monthly interest saving for you would be material
enough.

d) I think it is good for you to develop a credit rating with a bank
through a mortgage.  It is very beneficial for later on in life.  Paying
visa bills does help you a bit in this
category, but not like a mortgage.


Hopefully, you can get the financing from a bank.  I think that this is the
best solution in the long run.

   Hi John,

   Wanted to talk to you about the house stuff.  Dad told me that he was
   talking to you about financing options.  I just wanted to say that I
   don't
   want you to feel compelled to write a mortgage for me -- dad's just
   trying
   to explore different options.  I know it's a lot of cash, and I would
   never
   want to impose on you.  I'm sure that I can get a mortgage from the bank
   at
   a decent rate, as long as I can put down the 25% down payment so that I
   can
   avoid the mortgage insurance, which is costly.  I'm cashing in some GICs
   and other bonds, and Ali's going to lend me $10K, so I will be able to
   come
   up with the $55K for the down payment.

   If writing the mortgage is something that you would like to do for a
   stable
   investment, then we can talk too.  My time horizon on the condo is 5-7
   years, so i recognize that that would hold up your capital for a long
   while.  Anyway, I have to go ahead and get the guarantee of financing
   within 5 days or so, so I have to make a decision in the next day either
   way.  Maybe you can call, or email me?

If the legacy deals move to NETCO then we need the ability to trade Canadian gas.  Canada would not be out of business if we only traded US denominated financial products but it reduce our daily transactions by 75%.

John, 
Dealing with Canadian issues and NETCO.  Original thought was that legacy deals go away and we can do in Canada as we do in US.  Unfortunately feedback is that currency issue will still exist.  In your minds eye, will it put Canada out of biz if we require that during first 45 days only ""US like"" transactions occur?  

Your feedback would be great.
Thanks,

I am interested in a program for myself.  I am 33 years old, have been inactive for 6 months.  I am 6' 1'' and 225 lbs.  I can easily ride 50 km at about 27 km/h on flat terrain.  I would like to lose 15 lbs, improve my speed an definitely improve my hill climbing ability.  I live at 3800 ft altitude and hill climbing is very difficult.  I hit lactate threshold fairly quick.

Hi Karen - Lethbridge Ironwork's physical deal is registered incorrectly -

You should talk to Jess about that, she is due March 2 but I am not sure when her mom is coming and going.  I would think that the 2 week in march is good though.  Look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

hey there.  dad told me that you got your bonus -- congratulations!  that's
a piece of good news at least.

i got some bad news about bonuses today -- we usually get them paid out
this week, but we just got an email from our CEO saying that only a few
""exceptional performers"" will get some sort of bonus but they won't
disclose the information until the end of January.  given that i have to
have a new place to live for february, i don't think that I'll be able buy
a condo anymore (the bonus money would have been for the down payment).
anyway, kind of annoying but i guess i should be grateful that i have a
job.

mom's size is large -- she's 5'4"" and about 145 pounds.  could you pass
this on to jess?

by the way, our flight comes in at around 10pm on saturday, but i'll call
to confirm

hey -- how are things going this week?  any new developments (that are
public -- i haven't read the papers all week as i've been here until 1am
every night)

ali just found out that he got dinged for the 'early rolling round' at
columbia, but they reinvited him to apply for normal rounds in January.
he's really disappointed, because he was most bullish on his chances at
columbia.  i don't get it though -- his gmat and marks are awesome, he has
good work experience (4 years), he has a masters degree, and apparently, he
said the interview went really well.  kinda shitty.  he has an interview
with stanford next week is at least positive.

Enron is willing to perform the operation under question (1) but not (2) and (3) as we have no control over these processes and only have control over process (1).

Subject:	Supply Shortfall Procedures

As I have discussed with many of you, we are revising the Power Pool Supply
Shortfall Procedures (POP 801) in accordance with Transmission Operating
Policy OP-107.  POP 801 contains several steps from the time all the energy
in the energy market merit order has been dispatched up, to the time when a
firm load directive will be issued by the System Controller to curtail firm
load. In order to gather the information required to develop the procedure,
would you please answer the following questions.  Any action you choose to
take is on a voluntary and best effort basis, without any obligation on your
behalf.

In an effort to reduce the amount of, or possibility of having to issue, a
firm load directive to curtail load, would you please reply whether you will
comply with any of the following requests from the System Controller prior
to the issuing of a firm load directive to curtail load.  Please reply not
applicable (N/A) to the questions that do not apply to you.  If you will
comply to any of these requests, we will include the request(s) in the steps
identified in POP 801.  Also, if you will comply to any of these requests,
please indicate the appropriate party for the System Controller to contact.
If you choose not to comply with any of these requests please reply that you
will not.  This will let us know not to make a request for something that
will not be provided, which otherwise could cause confusion and waste
valuable time during the management of this type of an event.

1. Would you provide available generation energy that was not offered into
the energy market merit order if requested to do so by the System Controller
prior to a firm load directive to curtail load?

Name of Plant:				Response (Y/N):
If yes, please indicate who the System Controller is to contact:

Subject:	EOL - Multiple Trading Books (URGENT)

Tim and John, I wanted to touch base with you regarding a problem that we have run into between EOL and a trader having multiple trading books. EOL has been set up to have a trader associated with one and only one trading book in the stack manager. As a result, when creating the interface between EOL and Enpower we can cannot assign multiple trading books to one person. David Poston in the Enpower IT support group in Houston has been working with the EOL group and has come up with a solution.

1. If you definitely plan to be trading on EOL for all trading books associated with your name, EOL IT can define certain products to each trading book. If this is the approach that you would like to take, I will need a list of what products you want to trade and to which trading book they are affiliated with. 

2. The other option is that you will just use one trading book under your name. If that is the case, no changes will have to be made.

If the plan is to use the first option, please let me know so we can make the changes and do the necessary testing on this.

John"

Good morning everyone,
As you know we will be calling our counterparties today to discuss the Court Case slated for Wednesday. I have created a spreadsheet that lists which counterparties you have been assigned to contact. It can be found at I:/Canadian Energy Services/Counterparty Talks.xls. Please keep it updated throughout the day. It is a shared file; therefore, more than one user can access it at the same time. Just hit ""F9"" to update changes other users have made to the sheet throughout the day.
John - Can you please let your group know about the sheet and assign your traders to the counterparties listed under ""Traders""?
Thank you,
Nicole

Hi,

Are things a little less crazy today?  Did you and Jess work things out
last night?  Why was she so upset (besides the obvious reason on the work
front).

I just went to the cardiologist for my follow up heart tests.  They said
everything looks okay, and i just need to go back once a year for stress
tests.

I'm going to look at condos on Monday.  Starting in the Yonge and
Davisville area, then going to look at St. Lawrence Market (lofts mostly),
King & Bathurst and Bay / Bloor.  Still not sure if I should buy....

i don't know about the heart classes.  i'll look into it, but her dr (ravi)
isn't offering up any suggestions or anything.  she saw him before the
surgery in august, and he said things were okay.  i really don't think he's
too helpful.

she is lazy -- but it really frustrates me that she doesn't want to help
herself.  i told her that not walking is like not taking her heart
medication.  that didn't seem to resonate.  dad is going to go to the YMCA
tomorrow and maybe get a membership for both of them -- they have a walking
track there (at least it's something to do in the winter).  when she was
down this weekend, we walked around the craft show (at the Exhibition
place) and she said that was a lot of exercise (2 hrs).  The only problem
is that we were just strolling, and not really walking very fast.

   Hi John

   How was Thanksgiving?  Was the baby shower fun?

   I was wondering if you'd have some time to read over Ali's Chicago
   essays
   later tonight?  He's going to submit them on Wednesday.  Let me know if
   that's okay.  Do you have a printer at home?  Can I send them to your
   home
   account?  (I don't think Ali will be done before about 8pm or so
   tonight).

   PS:  We need to talk about mom.  I saw her this weekend -- she's gained
   a
   lot of weight, and hasn't been exercising at all.  Dad's pretty
   frustrated
   because all she does is watch tv.  I had a talk with her yesterday
   telling
   her that she has more risk of having a heart attack if she doesn't walk
   /
   exercise than if she exerts herself when exercising (i think she's
   afraid
   of having a heart attack while exercising).  We need to do something --
   she's 170lbs now, and should be at around 140lbs to be healthy.

   Livia
