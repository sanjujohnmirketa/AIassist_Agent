In its Order on Rehearing issued by FERC in Docket ER00-1969-002 on
November 8, 2001, the Commission rejected the NYISO's request for rehearing
to continue to bill for operating reserves based on the $2.52 bid cap in
effect for the period March 1 through March 27, 2000.  FERC also directed
the NYISO to re-calculate operating reserve charges for that period without
the bid cap in place.

On Friday, November 16, 2001, the NYISO filed a stay/extension with FERC in
order  to postpone any re-billing pending an appeal of the FERC decision in
the  Federal Appeals Court. In the event that FERC does not act in a timely
manner   on  the  NYISO's  request,  the  upcoming  March  2000  settlement
adjustment,  expected  to  be  issued  on  or  about December 7, 2001, will

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under ""SEC Filings.""

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=

""Kirkpatrick, Joe"" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

In order to have a functioning market model it is imperative to have a
level playing field for all market participants.

Is it a level playing field or even appropriate for any individual
market participant to dispatch generation and transmission facilities
that affect the economics of other market participants? The dispatch of
transmission and generation to resolve congestion must be made with the
overall economics of the entire market in mind. The only entity that has
the information and empowered to make these decisions is the NYISO.

With that in mind why does a particular market participant have control
over major interfaces that interconnect New York and PJM. Specifically
the control points would be the Linden-Goethals phase angle regulator
and the Hudson Farragut phase angle regulators. These PARs are under
ConEd control and are utilized by ConEd to facilitate whatever
requirements they deem required. As this is being written the New York
PJM schedule is 546 MW out to New York with a flow of 762 MW the flow on
these PARs (including Ramapo) is ~1500 MW to New York.

Are the interests of all market participants being considered by a
market participant that has over 40% of the load in New York State, that
has control over a significant amount of generation utilizing OOM
dispatches and by having control over a significant amount of
transmission facilities capable of altering the flow into New York City
and Central x East.

I suspect not.

Case in point..

There is a transmission constraint in an area in New York city. This
constraint can only be monitored by ConEd and therefore is resolved
utilizing an OOM dispatch request. Generation was reduced to resolve the
constraint, there is another generator in the area that can be reduced
to resolve the constraint, but it would appear that this control action
is not utilized . Coincidently the power from this other generator is
under contract to ConEd (take-or-pay). There is also a PAR
(Linden-Goethals) that can be moved to alleviate the constraint, which
unfortunately is not utilized either. Instead generation is reduced that
does result in additional uplift charges that is socialized as a cost to
all loads in New York. Whether the right economic decisions are being
made is an issue but the larger issue is why is a market participant
with a large economic interest making these decisions.

The NYISO was asked why the PAR was not utilized as a control action to
alleviate the constraint, simply put since the PAR is not under their
control they do not consider it as a control action.

Since ConEd does not have the overall market view or the economic
interests of all market participants in mind is it appropriate to allow
them to operate and dispatch a large part of New York State?

When the NYISO is not controlling major inter-area transmission
interfaces but allows that control to be utilized by a market
participant it is a compromise of the entire market. Economics of an
individual market participant are overriding the economics of all other
participants in New York.

This is not a ""best practice"" that any sane individual would recommend
for any RTO model.

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd

""May, Tom"" <Tom.May@ENRON.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

As usual, Joe has cut directly to the issue and I could not agree more.
While there has been progress made in New York, the NYISO and the New
York market will never gain credibility or the confidence of the market
as long as these situations exist.  While the NYISO may not have the
ability to unilaterally change this, they would at gain some credibility
if they were the ones raising the issue and aggresively and publically
advocating for change.

Joe has brought up some great  points once again. As Tom has pointed out that
the NYISO should be in the forefront in addressing this. Since 1999 the PAR
issue has been brought up time and time again, both in committees and in direct
complaints to the NYISO. The ball is squarely in the NYISO's court. I, would
like to see on this forum, an update/discussion from the NYISO addressing Joe's
concerns. If nothing else it would bring everyone up to date on where we are on
this issue. All too often good points are brought up on this forum, just to die
because there was no NYISO imput or the answer was off line.

Actually I have raised issues related to the PARs several times. There is
currently an item on the MSWG agenda concerning them though not concerning
control (ISO vs ConEd) but rather modeling and pricing.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

JSavitt@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The NYISO has been experiencing difficulties in posting price reservations
to the TIE.  The postings have from time to time been extraordinarily
delayed.  Our internal process identifies such delays in enough time so
that we can generate another posting by COB of the appropriate day.
Several times the originally delayed posting has shown up on the TIE as
well, resulting in dual postings.  The NYISO apologizes for any confusion.
The NYISO notes that the price reservations are also posted to the OASIS,
and that there have been no problems in tghe latter process.

B,

Good talking to you.  I will email your dad today to get his advice.

Does he have a junior executive type that works directly for him?  In my
ideal fantasy world I would really like to work for someone like that and get
that type of exposure to corp finance/ industry......

I am probably dreaming, but didn't know if CEO's had people like that working
directly   for them.  Obviously not an assistant, but someone in a junior

YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED=20

Q. Should an investor be concerned if one or more officers of a=20
company sell shares of its stock that they own?=20

A. Although it may look like a red flag, it isn't necessarily=20
one. Many executives today receive a large part of their=20
compensation in stock options. So when they have to buy a house=20
or make a college tuition payment, they sell some shares. They=20
may also be trying to diversify their investments, not wanting=20
to have too much of their portfolio in one company.=20

On the other hand, one insider (or many insiders) selling might=20
indeed signal a loss of faith in the company. If you're worried,=20
you might want to take a closer look at the company's recent=20
performance. Perhaps fire up your computer and see what people=20
interested in the company are saying about it online, on message=20
boards.=20


Q. What does ""insured by FDIC"" mean, and what does it NOT=20
insure?=20

A. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) insures our=20
traditional checking, savings and money market accounts (as well=20
as CDs) held at banks and thrifts for up to $100,000. Note,=20
though, that the FDIC does not cover stocks, bonds, mutual=20
funds, life insurance policies, annuities and the like. For=20
these, check with your financial service company to see what=20
kind of insurance may be provided.=20

Learn more about the FDIC at their website. To make sure you are=20
stashing your short-term cash in the most profitable place,=20
check out our Savings Center.=20

-----------------------------------------------------------------
THIS WEEK'S LESSON=20

OPTIONS 101
Imagine you want to invest in Legume Gas Works (ticker: BEANZ).=20
You can buy shares the usual way -- or you can buy options.=20
Here's an introduction to options.=20

There are two main types: calls and puts. A call gives you the=20
right to buy a set amount of shares at a set price within a=20
certain period of time (often just a few months). For this=20
right, you pay a price premium. Puts are similar, but give you=20
the right to sell shares.=20

If Legume is selling for $50 per share and you expect it to=20
rise, you could buy ""October $55"" call options for it. Let's say=20
you snap up calls to buy 100 shares, for $6 each, or a total of=20
$600. If just before your options expire Legume is selling for=20
$65 per share, you can exercise your options and buy 100 shares=20
for $5,500. Then you can keep them or sell them for $6,500.=20

If you sell, you make a $1,000 profit, right? Nope. You paid=20
$600, remember? So your profit is down to $400 -- less, when you=20
account for trading commissions.=20

Options are risky. If Legume stays at $55 or falls, your $600=20
would be entirely lost. It has to top $61 per share -- $55 plus=20
$6 -- by October for you to profit.=20

Some folks like options because of the leverage they offer. They=20
point out that if you only have $1,000, you can only buy 20=20
shares of a $50 stock. Alternatively, that $1,000 could buy many=20
more options tied to hundreds of shares of stock. True enough.=20
With options, though, timing is critical. If things don't go=20
your way in a short-term time frame, your option will expire=20
worthless.=20

Most options expire unexercised and worthless. (Those most=20
likely to profit from options are the ones who ""write"" or sell=20
the options.) That's because options are really about buying=20
time, not stocks. If you're sure that Legume's stock will rise,=20
you're probably best off buying its stock. Then if it doesn't=20
behave as you expected it to, you can either sell the shares or=20
hang on patiently.=20

Options are not for beginning investors, and even more advanced=20
investors might consider steering clear.=20

You can read more about options at this Motley Fool FAQ.

Dear Market Participants,

Software release for December 4, 2001

The ability to simultaneously offer fixed block schedules at
biddable prices will be introduced to the NYISO market.  This
Multi-Hour Block Transaction (MHBT) functionality will allow
users to specify a minimum run-time characteristic to their
external transactions.  SCUC will account for the minimum run-
time parameter of MHBTs in determining the least production cost
evaluation for the day.  As a result, if SCUC schedules the MHBT,
it will be scheduled at the full requested MW and requested time
frame.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
representatve or the Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations"

RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

In its Order on Rehearing issued by FERC in Docket ER00-1969-002 on
November 8, 2001, the Commission directed the NYISO to re-calculate
operating reserve charges for March 2000 within 15 days.

The  NYISO  initiated  the  rebilling of March 2000 settlements through the
settlement  adjustment  process  on  the  afternoon  of  November 21, 2001.
Advisory  billing  statements  have  been posting to customer web locations
since  midnight November 22, 2001.  The NYISO anticipates completion of the
March 2000 settlement adjustment at approximately 18:00, November 23, 2001.
Posting  of  advisory billing statements will continue through the evening,
but should complete by 23:00.  Invoices are scheduled to be posted for this
settlement adjustment on, or about, December 7, 2001.

Randy A. Bowers

                    AM                   Subject:     FERC ruling on March 2000 Operating Reserves





In  its  Order  on  Rehearing  issued  by  FERC  in Docket ER00-1969-002 on
November 8, 2001, the Commission rejected the NYISO's request for rehearing
to  continue  to  bill for operating reserves based on the $2.52 bid cap in
effect  for  the period March 1 through March 27, 2000.  FERC also directed
the NYISO to re-calculate operating reserve charges for that period without
the bid cap in place.

On Friday, November 16, 2001, the NYISO filed a stay/extension with FERC in
order  to postpone any re-billing pending an appeal of the FERC decision in
the  Federal Appeals Court. In the event that FERC does not act in a timely
manner   on  the  NYISO's  request,  the  upcoming  March  2000  settlement
adjustment,  expected  to  be  issued  on  or  about December 7, 2001, will
reflect  this  re-calculation in accordance with the FERC Order.  The total
amount  of  this  adjustment  is  approximately  $27 million, which will be
allocated  to the appropriate suppliers and LSE's for the period of March 1
through March 27, 2000.

Randy A. Bowers

Dear Market Participants

Note:  The following change was originally scheduled for October 17, 2001.

On October 31, 2001, the NYISO web servers will be upgraded.  This will
require both software and hardware changes.  While these changes will be
transparent to the users, these changes will require that the MIS system
be unavailable for approximately 60 minutes.  The outage will begin at
approximately 11:35 AM.  Market Participants planning on submitting
HAM transactions or modifying Day Ahead bids should act accordingly.

The NYISO will minimize the duration of the outage as much as possible
as we recognize the inconvenience caused by system outages.  Ultimately,
these changes will result in a more stable environment and provide enhanced
services that the current web servers are unable to perform.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
Representative or the Help Desk at (518) 356-6060.

Thank You

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Attached please find a Word document for the November 28 BAWG meeting
agenda.

Also attached, please find an Excel file with very rough first draft of a
list of BAWG issues.  This file will be discussed under agenda item #4.
The goal will be to solicit comments from the BAWG members and NYISO Grid
Accounting staff at the November 28 meeting to correct all the rows and
columns of this spreadsheet.   Eventually, this will be the official,
disclosed list of BAWG issues posted on the NYISO web site per approved
NYSEG motion from the November 2001 BIC meeting.

Importance: High



Dear Equity,

Good morning, 

I hope you had a god weekend.  I was finally able to catch up on all the
gimmicks being thrown around to jump-start the economy.  Have you seen the
one that would temporarily suspend sales taxes, a la 0.0% financing on
autos?  What the politico's should really do is get some ideas from the
organizers of the Victoria's Secret (no, there's no relation unfortunately)
TV show or the Britney Spear's HBO show.  Have you seen the ratings on
those!?  That seems to be what is drawing the American consumer these days. 

But despite that being still up in the air, it looks like the economy is in
the process of bottoming anyway.  Stocks have continued to rally, oil is
below $18, commodities have rallied, money is up and so is refi.  If we
could only get the surveys to behave, we'd be very happy.  Interest rates
had been falling up until last week when the backed up.  This was largely
interpreted as the bond market smelling the economic recovery.  If rates
get too high, it could obviously be a problem, but this ""hiccup"" in rates
is something we have seen before in periods of transition.  Page 3
highlights the ""hiccups"" in the past when you had the economy shifted from
a recession to a recovery.  

Another big question on everyone's mind is Holiday Sales.  They are widely
expected to be weak, weak, weak.  So where does that leave room for a
surprise? on the upside.  Turn to page 6 for all the positives that could
help Holiday Sales.  I for one am not expecting a lump of coal.  

The political report highlights the effects of the war in Afghanistan on
globalization.  Despite all the initial doom-and-gloom, it looks like it
has actually pushed global cooperation along.  

Jim Moltz thinks the market is just about fairly valued here at about 22
times 2002 earnings.  That being said, he also thinks the liquidity
available out there will drive the market higher when those assets start to
actively look for higher yielding instruments.  Some of that could be into
the long end of the curve if rates stay higher, but some will also be into
the equity markets.  Jim also tweaked his operating earnings estimate for
2001 from $38 to $39.50.  2002 is still at $50.  

Have a great week and a very happy Thanksgiving.  If there is anything I
can do, I will be in so please just let me know.

On Saturday, 11/17, the Operational Announcements  state that both Roseton units would be committed for Local  Reliability on Sunday.  I have two questions concerning this  commitment; 1) What happened after SCUC ran that required two 600 mw units be  put on at minimum?  2) Since the local Transmission Owner didn't request  these units on, why is it referred to as Local Reliability?  There is a  substantial amount of uplift generated ( no pun intended ) by this decision and  when the term Local Reliability is used it raises a question as to the  allocation of this cost.  "

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com"

   [IMAGE]Aggressive Growth!   Strong Buy Recommendation! =09


  Over the last six months  investors who have followed our recommendations=
 have realized an average  return of 78% on their money.   =09


 [IMAGE]  OTC:BB Ticker:  LQDX  Rating: Strong  Buy =09 Shares Outstanding:=
  10,700,000  Float (estimate):  2,900,000  Current Price:  $2.08  12 Month=
 Target Price:  $16.80 =09


    Our current  recommendation is:  Liquidix Inc.  (OTC BB:  LQDX)       S=
mart  investors understand that companies with government and military  app=
lications are especially attractive in times of global  instability.    Our=
 current recommendation, LIQUIDIX, INC. of  Arizona (OTC BB: LQDX), has pos=
itioned itself as the leading competitor in  the high-tech industrial manuf=
acturing industry with its customizable  array of magnetic fluid vacuum sea=
ls.    NASA, Honeywell,  ADM, Intel, have already used the vacuum seals cre=
ated by Liquidix. These  products benefit such important technologies as na=
vigational gyros,  infrared detectors, heat-seeking missiles, laser sightin=
g and night-vision  equipment.  =09


    ABOUT THE  COMPANY     LIQUIDIX, INC.  recently purchased Advanced Flui=
d Systems, a company based in the United  Kingdom, strategically increasing=
 its marketshare and making Liquidix  competitive in the global market.    =
 Liquidix has  signed contracts with several Military/Government Agencies a=
nd U.S.  National Laboratories, including NASA, which have produced signifi=
cant  growth in the company.     Liquidix is one of only three  companies i=
n the world to produce magnetic fluid vacuum seals and it's the  only one t=
hat is traded publicly in the United States. Because costs in  this industr=
y are very similar between companies, Liquidix has studied and  surpassed i=
ts competition in delivery time. Liquidix can deliver the same  product to =
its destination in 1/4 the time of its nearest competitor,  making them esp=
ecially desirable for companies who must meet an increasing  demand for mag=
netic fluid vacuum seals.     Liquidix has  conservatively estimated that t=
heir gross revenues for 2002 will increase  more than 40% over 2001, and by=
 2003 will increase another 110%. Through  strategic mergers and acquisitio=
ns Liquidix also estimates that their  profit margins for 2002 will increas=
e by 60% over 2001, and by 2003 will  increase another 200%.      REASONS T=
O OWN THE  STOCK    1. Liquidix  provides magnetic fluid vacuum seals for g=
overnment and military  applications that are in higher demand due to incre=
asing military activity  in the U.S.       2. Liquidix, through  strategic =
alliances and acquisitions, has established itself as the leader  of an ind=
ustry that is projected to earn more than $4.5 billion dollars by  2002.   =
    3. Liquidix provides  products to industry giants such as NASA, HONEYWE=
LL, INTEL, and ADM,  virtually guaranteeing the growth of this strong  comp=
any.       4. Liquidix aggressive  and strategic acquisition of companies l=
ike Advanced Fluid Systems  demonstrates a strong vision for the future and=
 positions them as a world  leader in magnetic fluid technology.     5. Liq=
uidix is one of  only three companies in the world to produce magnetic flui=
d vacuum seals  and it is the only one that is traded publicly in the  U.S.=
       6. Facilities owned and  operated by Liquidix in the United States a=
nd Europe have given the  company a foothold on both sides of the Atlantic,=
 with opportunities to  break into additional international markets.  Wall =

Sent:	Monday, November 19, 2001 7:13 AM
To:	undisclosed-recipients:;@ENRON
Subject:	Electric Utilities:  Weekly Report

KEY POINTS
*	We continue to recommend an overweighting in the electric utility group.  The group's attractive relative P/E
valuation, its high relative yield, its defensive nature and interest sensitivity are all reasons why we think electric
stocks should perform well versus the overall stock market for the rest of 2001.
*	The average P/E ratio for the electric utility group is now 10.8x estimated 2002 EPS, compared with a 2002 P/E
of 24.2x for the S&P 500.  The relative P/E ratio of 0.45x is below the 25-year historic normal range of 0.60x-0.80x,
and is also near the all-time low of 0.40x.
*	The average yield for the electric utility group is now 4.96%, which should make the group attractive to
individual investors earning around 2.25% in the typical money market fund.  Historically, the yield on utility stocks
has rarely been more than twice as high as money market fund yields like it is today.
*	Falling oil and natural gas prices have caused wholesale power prices, that were already very low, to fall even
further.  Electricity futures prices, shown in Exhibit 2 on Page 5, fell by another 5% in most regions in the past week.
Electricity futures prices have fallen by about 10% across the U.S. in the past month.
*	Coal prices have not come down in line with the big declines in the prices of oil, natural gas and wholesale
power (see Page 8 for data on spot coal prices).  The spot price of coal is more than 50% above the price levels from
late last year in all coal markets.  It appears that due to supply constraints, coal prices have not followed the
decline in oil and natural gas prices.
*	Electric utility stocks lagged the overall stock market last week.  For the five trading days last week,
electric utility stocks went down in value by 3.7%, compared with a gain of 1.6% for the S&P 500.  IPP stocks had a good
week, with an average gain of 7.1%.
*	SPECIAL HOLIDAY TRIVIA QUIZ.  This Thursday, Americans celebrate the Thanksgiving Day holiday.  Can you name two
nuclear power plants whose names remind you of Thanksgiving?  (The answer is on the bottom of Page 4.)

ill suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that continue to take t=
heir own toll on the stability of the market. In other words, transmission =
capacity in the region has been determined to be deficient to the extent th=
at power outside of the city cannot be reliably imported. The fact that Ast=
oria Energy has received approval from New York state's siting board to pro=
ceed with this New York City-based plant is significant, but it should not =
be forgotten that the company also must receive local permits from city gov=
ernment. This could be easier said than done, as other planned power plants=
 in the area have been blocked or significantly altered over the last year =
by community groups in New York City and surrounding boroughs who ardently =
voice concerns about environmental and other ramifications of new plant con=
struction.   The problems within the New York power market have been well d=
ocumented. The state of New York reportedly has not brought a new plant onl=
ine since 1996, when a 200-MW plant opened in Brooklyn. It has been almost =
seven years since a 1,000-MW unit in Oswego, N.Y., marked the last plant to=
 open upstate. Further, New York expects only a 3.5-percent increase in new=
 capacity in the next three to four years. Consequently, concerns about the=
 state's ability to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum. =
Pressure has been placed on New York regulators to expedite the approval st=
eps for siting new plants in the state. However, at the same time, environm=
ental and community groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and o=
ften lobby for limitations on how and where the new plant will produce powe=
r.    While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages, the probl=
em appears to be particularly acute in New York City. A November 2000 repor=
t issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) entitled ""Inves=
tigation of Bulk Power Markets, Northeast Region,"" highlighted specific cap=
acity problems in the New York City/Long Island community of 11 million peo=
ple. These areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from=
 most of the state's grid, the study said. Like Northern California, which =
suffered rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints, New York City a=
nd Long Island can only import limited quantities of power on constrained t=
ransmission lines. Hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate New =
York, but cannot reach the city. Being both densely populated and heavily r=
esidential, it is difficult to site new power plants in the area. Consequen=
tly, 80 percent of the power that the city consumes is generated by the cit=
y. New plants such as the one by Astoria Energy are being proposed because =
New York City reportedly will be short of its generating capacity needs at =
times during the course of 2002. The projected shortfall is expected to inc=
rease by another 200 MW by summer 2002.    Increased demand is causing addi=
tional problems for the energy markets of New York City and New York State.=
 Demand in the state rose by 2,700 MW from 1995 to 2000, or 2.5 times as fa=
st as new generation capacity was added. Demand over the course of 2001 was=
 expected to reach 31,100 MW, or about 3.7 percent above regulators' earlie=
r forecasts.    It is within this market context that Astoria Energy will p=
roceed with its plans for the new power plant in New York City. Astoria Ene=
rgy is a private company seeking to generate electric power with energy-eff=
icient and environmentally sound technologies in the New York City area. Th=
e company is a subsidiary of SCS Energy, a privately owned energy developme=
nt company formed in 1998 for the purpose of developing and owning new elec=
tric generating facilities. Information obtained from Astoria Energy sheds =
some additional light on the proposed plant. As noted, the 1,000-MW unit wi=
ll be a natural gas-fired facility, which will obtain natural gas supplied =
from the ConEd/New York facility pipeline. The capital cost for the plant r=
eportedly will be $600 million. Commercial operation, pending the necessary=
 approvals on the local level, is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2003.=
 Astoria Energy is seemingly confident of its chances to gain approval for =
the new plant because it will be using a technology that is specifically ge=
ared toward the reduction of air emissions.    However, despite this optimi=
sm, the community opposition factor should not be discounted, and there are=
 several examples that may foreshadow the opposition that Astoria Energy co=
uld face. Take Sithe Energies, for example, which hit a roadblock with its =
construction plans in the New York area earlier this year. Sithe Energies o=
riginally planned a 827-MW combined-cycle facility fueled by natural gas in=
 Ramapo, N.Y. Chief among the concerns of local residents is that the Ramap=
o plant was originally planned to run all the time to meet demand, and as a=
 result would use local water resources for cooling purposes. Community res=
istance thus became an issue for the company, which altered its plans and b=
egan to consider a 510-MW peaking unit (also powered by natural gas) that w=
ould only be operated in times of increased demand.     As another example,=
 environmental and community groups won a victory in court just last week t=
hat essentially will block construction of small power plants in the South =
Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island areas. Each is a 44-MW plant, thou=
gh at some sites there are twin generators operating at less than 80 MW.  A=
 coalition of the groups had opposed the construction of various plants in =
these areas and sued the New York Power Authority, claiming (among other th=
ings) that the state had failed to perform adequate environmental-review st=
udies. The groups claim that the state should test the plants for their out=
put of fine particulate matter. A lower court had ruled in favor of the sta=
te, but a judgment last week in the New York Court of Appeals was clearly a=
 win for the environmental and community groups. The new ruling, which repo=
rtedly cannot be appealed further, says that the state must do unprecedente=
d air tests at the 10 plants or shut them down by Jan. 31.     In a report =
issued earlier this year, New York State Electric & Gas Corp. (NYSEG), one =
of New York's seven utilities, said the state will not have enough megawatt=
s to support a truly competitive wholesale electric market until 2008. NYSE=
G, in a report issued late Wednesday, warned there are ""serious problems wi=
th (New York's) generation supply and a lack of transmission and pipeline i=
nfrastructure."" According to data included in a separate report by the New =
York ISO, which manages the state's transmission grid, between 1995 and 200=
0, while statewide demand in New York rose by 2,700 MW, generating capacity=
 under contract in the state reportedly increased only by 1,060 MW.    Cons=
equently, given all of these factors, power supplies in New York remained s=
trained and the area certainly could benefit from the construction of new g=
eneration capacity. However, Astoria Energy, which seeks to bring new gener=
ation online in New York that will be based on clean technologies, may stil=
l face an uphill battle from various groups that seemingly oppose the const=
ruction of any new plants in the region (with the exception of peaker units=
, whose output would be closely regimented). If plans for this plant are bl=
ocked or significantly altered, following the experience of Sithe Energies,=
 the options to resolve New York City's supply / demand imbalance will once=
 again become focused on a combination of other approaches, including conse=
rvation efforts and reliance on distributed generation alternatives.    An =

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.

-- This week TWST has an interview with the Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
of PDG Environmental, Inc.  He states, ""PDG Environmental is an environmental
and specialty contractor. We've been in business since 1984. We have offices
in 14 cities across the country. We are a national contractor with - what we
like to call - a local presence because we are capable of doing the largest
projects as evidenced by a recently awarded $13 million contract with Con Edison
and TRC Companies, but we are also able to respond very quickly to even the
smallest projects in the $10,000 to $50,000 range. Our main lines of work include
asbestos abatement, lead abatement, toxic mold remediation, demolition and
insulation. We are the third largest asbestos abatement contractor in the
country and the thirty-fifth largest environmental contractor.""
He continues, ""We have been making one or two acquisitions a year for the
past several years. We've recently completed an acquisition of a company in
Southern California, which was our largest acquisition to date. Tri-State
Restorations completed the nationwide geographic presence that we wanted.
There are many opportunities for acquisition out there, and we are looking
to acquire companies with a diversified revenue and customer base.""  To read

[IMAGE] ""I'm writing to tell you about a flight I just purchased through my Active Advantage membership. A last-minute trip came up where I needed to fly from New York to San Diego.  I checked a bunch of online travel sources and found fares between $2,257.50 and $2,263. When I checked through Active Advantage, the same flight was $698 - that's almost 70% off.  I booked my flight and my trip went off without a hitch.  This is a great program. Thanks."" Scott C.

The bill for 10/28/2001 may be put on hold due to problems encountered with

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

The NYISO Back-Up Dispatch System  is scheduled to be tested on Tuesday,
January 8 ,2002.  The test will begin at about 10:30 a.m. and last for
approximately one hour.

Security Constrained Dispatch (SCD) will be stopped, but the mainframe
computer will continue to operate, allowing the NYISO to monitor security.
If a situation occurs, the Shift Supervisor will be able to re-start SCD
and take appropriate action.  The Market Information System (MIS) and
Balancing Market Evaluation (BME) will remain available during the test.

If you have any questions, please call Customer Relations at 518-356-6060.

Eric:
There is a book store called the Brown Book Store located several blocks from here.  They have several books on trading within this industry that you will want to read.  You will need to call information to find out where they are.  Good Luck!

Hey Ben-

Hope you had a great holiday and you guys are staying busy.  Things down in EIM are looking a little more promising since our current direction is to hold onto some of our assets and potentially take a group of people forward to do some low-credit trading....I'm cautiously optimistic.

I did want your recommendation on any books for someone interested in learning about power trading.  Any ideas?

Thanks Ben-

Ben,

Change of plans.  Joe would also like you to meet with Tim McCabe,
however Tim is out until 12/4 and there is a possibility that Ken King
will not be back in until 12/4.  Would you be available on 12/4?

-- This week TWST has an interview with the President and CEO of Xchange, Inc.
He states, ""Xchange is a business that started in 1995, a private company,
a profitable business that worked its way to a public offering in 1998. And
through that period of time it assembled a pretty marquis base of customers.
The company has over 300 customers, names you may know such as Ford Motor
Company; J.P. Morgan Chase; actually, 10 of the top US banks; retail companies
like Staples; consumer package companies; big investment houses like Fidelity.""
He continues, ""At Xchange we focus on the largest customers in the Global 2000.
We believe that our history and our customer base there gives us an opportunity
to continue to build a product that's going to perform and scale for a company
the size of Ford. As an example, Ford, last year, did with us over 100 different
marketing campaigns: they want to double that this year. And their biggest worry
is performance, scalability, being able to take the same amount of people and
being able to double the companies and our technology is really the way they do
that. So, competitively, we've done very well at big customers. That's our
focus.""  To read more of this interview

-- This week TWST also has an interview with the President and Chief Executive Officer
of Prophet 21, Inc.He states, ""Prophet 21 develops enterprise software
solutions, including an Internet trading network, and offers supporting
professional services for durable goods distributors that enable them to
increase sales and improve customer service while reducing operating costs.
Ever since our founding by John and Dorothy Meggitt in 1967, Prophet 21 has
positioned itself as a leader in serving the technology needs of durable goods
distributors in North America. We currently have nearly 2,000 customers - each
with an average of five stocking locations - that utilize Prophet 21's
technology and technology services. Our core target markets include industrial,
fastener, electrical, and plumbing distributors.""  He continues, ""Prophet 21 has
a very successful history of bringing enterprise software solutions and the
associated professional services to distributors and that will continue well into
the future. In addition, we recently expanded our offerings to include an Internet
trading network, Trading Partner Connect. Trading Partner Connect streamlines the
commerce process between distributors, their manufacturers/suppliers, and
customers, thereby increasing sales and improving customer service while reducing
operating costs.""  To read more of this interview

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00"

""It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right. I hope
you had the time of your life."" -- Green Day

-----------------------------------------------------------------
TOP STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

HARD TIMES AT MICROSOFT?
Is Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) ready to fly again? Backing out a
$1.2 billion hit in its investment portfolio, the software titan
reported profits of $0.43 a share. That was three cents better
than analysts were expecting as sales grew by 6% to $6.1 billion.

>>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=522447

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Pass the sun block. Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) is reporting
a nickel a share loss for its fiscal first-quarter on a steep
decline in revenue. The top-line sank to $2.9 billion from a
$5.1 billion showing a year ago. Sun's set came as no surprise
since the network computing specialist had warned investors
earlier this month. The California company expects to return to
profitability by the June quarter.

Holy Beanie Babies, eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) is still hot. The online
auctioneer trounced expectations and bid up its fourth-quarter
prospects. Quarterly earnings came in at $0.12 a share on a 71%
surge in sales to $194.4 million. It's also raising the ante for
the current period. While the company was originally expecting
December-quarter revenue to come in between $195 million and
$205 million, it is now hiking up both ends of the range by an
extra $5 million. The strong showing and bar raising is an
impressive feat as the company is a month into its 100-day
Auction for America in which it is waiving its fees for
charitable listings.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=522448

There's no business like e-business for PeopleSoft (Nasdaq:
PSFT) as the enterprise software maker reported earnings from
recurring operations of $0.15 a share, three cents ahead of Wall
Street's projection. Thanks to a growth in license revenue for
its flagship PeopleSoft 8 -- an excellent name for a B-movie if
there ever was one -- sales topped the half-billion dollar mark.

No one is putting struggling cow-patched computer maker Gateway
(NYSE: GTW) out to pasture just yet. While the company's
third-quarter loss was in line with already lowered
expectations, Gateway sees shipments picking back up in the
current quarter. Excluding charges, the company lost $0.17 a
share on revenue of $1.4 billion. The company managed to grow
its domestic market share in the consumer and education segments
and is expecting to report a quarterly profit to close out the
year.

Last doughnuts with the Fool
Finally, it's true. Come next week you will have to enjoy your
Krispy Kreme (NYSE: KKD) glazed doughnut and your Starbucks
(Nasdaq: SBUX) double latte without the company of your
Breakfast With the Fool. It was September 21, 1998, when Yi-Hsin
Chang and Brian Bauer rolled out our first morning plateful. The
Nasdaq Composite stood at 1663.77 back then. It's at 1652.72
this morning. Not a lot has changed. Everything has changed. As
we refocus our efforts towards enhancing many of our existing
features and rolling out new ones, we want to thank you for
being part of our community and appreciate your patience as we
evolve in order to serve you. Hey. You still have some of that
doughnut glaze on your chin. So, onward and forward. Like
Wendy's (NYSE: WEN), we just don't do breakfast anymore.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=522449

-----------------------------------------------------------------
POST OF THE DAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

APPLE Q4 - THE GOOD WITH THE BAD
""Now, we have Apple rather coyly dangling the idea of a brand
new non-Mac device to wow the audience. At the same time,
revenue projections are extremely conservative, at $1.4B for
Christmas. Given the continuous stream of revenue
over-estimation coming from Apple over the last 12 months, we
have to assume that even Apple doesn't expect its special
surprise to help Q4's results.""

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522."

The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 16:00 and 22:00 in the January 14,
2002 Real-Time Market.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hours beginning 9:00 and 18:00 in the
January 14, 2002 Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 15, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

@TIMES - Inside NYTimes.com
Tuesday, January 15, 2002
-----------------------------------------------------

Dear NYTimes.com Member,

One of the most meaningful features to appear in The New
York Times and on NYTimes.com is Portraits of Grief. This
feature first began running on September 15 and presented
brief profiles of World Trade Center victims. On December
31 the final daily edition of Portraits of Grief appeared
in The New York Times newspaper. A book will be published
this year, and the feature will continue to appear from
time to time, as more names become known and more families
agree to interviews.

In the meantime, we invite you to visit the Web site to
see a complete collection of Portraits of Grief,
alphabetized and listed by day. This archive represents
all the Portraits published to date. They will remain at
NYTimes.com indefinitely.

http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/portraits/?rd=hcmcp?p=041_Fz041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm

Another recent special feature has been the multimedia
photo essay. We have already talked here about the essays
done by Vincent Laforet and James Hill. I would now like
to direct your attention to the newest, this one by Times
staff photographer Ruth Fremson about the women in
Afghanistan. The essay features a very strong audio
commentary, which makes the point that not all the women
feel the same about the head-to-toe veil they were
required to wear under the Taliban's rule: in fact, many
are very comfortable dressed as they are.

http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/dayofterror/index.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041_Ja041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm

We have enjoyed participating in almost daily
""conversations"" with correspondents of The New York Times.
In these unstructured talks, each correspondent provides
information not only about the news he or she is covering,
but on what life is like in the particular place he or she
is located. There are over 50 discussions now available
for listening in audio format.

http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/23/national/_begwer-audio.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041_FW041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm

The Winter Olympics games at Salt Lake City begin soon and
NYTimes.com already has started covering this event. Our
Olympics section covers security concerns, athlete
profiles and an interactive map of the torch relay.
Special e-mail updates are now available, and include
periodic countdown reports and details of the torch run,
athlete profiles and event previews. When the games begin
on Feb. 8, we'll send daily dispatches with event results
and exclusive ""postcards"" from Salt Lake City by Times
sports reporter George Vecsey.

http://www.nytimes.com/pages/olympics/index.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041_Ev041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm

I would also like to invite you to explore these new
features on NYTimes.com:

3. New Topics of The Times collections now available
4. The Outlook for business and the markets in 2002
5. Join in for N.F.L. playoffs
6. Best of 2001 in the arts
7. For students, ""TEST"" doesn't have to be a four-letter
word

1. Introducing The New York Times Job Market
------

If you're serious about finding a new job, NYTimes.com is
a better resource than ever. That's because we've just
launched Job Market, which features a more easy-to-
navigate design, articles about careers and the workplace,
and, of course, the best job listings in the tri-state
area and nationwide. You can also post your resume on Job
Market and sign up for daily e-mail alerts.

http://www.nytimes.com/pages/jobs?rd=hcmcp?p=041_Et041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm

------
2. Know the deal with DealBook
------

NYTimes.com's daily look at the world of mergers and
acquisitions, private capital, I.P.O's and more has been
expanded in a new, easier-to-use HTML format. Delivered
daily via e-mail, this popular newsletter edited by Andrew
Ross Sorkin now has even more features to help you know
the deal on Wall Street and around the world. Sign up for
free now.

http://www.nytimes.com/email#dealbook?rd=hcmcp?p=041_EL041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm

------
3. New Topics of The Times collections now available
------

Our Topics of the Times series has expanded. The new
collections include:

-- Thomas Friedman on Sept. 11

Each collection contains up to nine archived articles and
can be purchased for $4.95 at:

http://www.nytimes.com/timestopics/?rd=hcmcp?p=041_Cl041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm

------
4. The Outlook for business and the markets in 2002
------

After two years of poor returns, investors may have a
better time in 2002 as an economic recovery looks more and
more possible. Every January, we publish the annual
economic Outlook section, which includes useful articles
by the New York Times staff.

http://www.nytimes.com/outlook?rd=hcmcp?p=041_Bz041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm

------
5. Join in for N.F.L. playoffs
------

From the first round of the playoffs on Jan. 12 until
Super Bowl Sunday on Jan. 27, NYTimes.com will have
complete coverage of the N.F.L. playoffs, including
features, opinion, game coverage, statistics, audio and
extended use of Times photography.

http://www.nytimes.com/pages/sports/football/index.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041_Bd041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm

------
6. Best of 2001 in the arts
------

The critics of The New York Times review the year in the
arts, including top 10 lists for the year's best movies,
albums and television shows.

http://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2001/12/30/arts/index.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041_AW041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm

------
7. For students, ""TEST"" doesn't have to be a four-letter
word
------

The Learning Network's Word of the Day and Test Prep
Question of the Day help students build their vocabulary
for upcoming standardized tests in ways that are fun and
interactive. Every weekday there's a focus on a different
word -- its definition and an example of its use in the
context of a recent Times article; and students can then
test their understanding online with the day's analogy or
sentence completion question.

http://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/wordofday/?rd=hcmcp?p=041_L4041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm


Thanks for your time.

Yours truly,

Bernard Gwertzman, Editor
The New York Times on the Web

John,

I have scheduled a meeting with you Monday at 1:00pm to discuss our TECO 
deal.  It seems as if we're getting traction around a structure and the 
efforts are focusing on how to maximize our leverage during distress 
periods...your expertise.  The attached materials will help frame the 
discussion.  Meeting attendees will be you, me, Lou Stoler (legal) and Billy 
Lemmons (CTG).

The rest of you are getting the same materials for your reference.

regards,

Don Black

Hey Mike,
Thanks for the pics.  Where were the ones from which  looks to be a wedding?
Hey, how many tickets were you thinking about? Were you thinking two for you
and
your Dad?  That weekend is April 1 & 3, 2000.  I'm not sure whether that is
Easter weekend or not.  One other way to get tics is to go to
www.finalfourseats.com  Let me know your situation.  Where are you spending
the
New Year?  Talk to you later.
Ben

Just wanted to keep you all informed of my recent discussions with Kinder 
Morgan regarding potentially selling them 4 LM 6000's.  At first they were 
interested in some of the development sites, but became more interested in 
the equipment.  They are trying to get their hands on as many LM 6000's as 
possible, because of their plant configuration utilizing 6 LM 6000's per 
plant.  With my last dicussion as of yesterday (Tuesday the 5th), I gave them 
the approximate price at which they could buy the turbines for - $15,000,000 
per turbine.  Their comment was it was a little on the high side, but they 
still sounded interested because of the quick time frame of receiving them - 
1st Qtr. '01.  If they are still interested they will get back with me with a 
non-binding term sheet within the next couple of weeks.  Please let me know 
if you have any comments.  Thank you!

Ben,
Thanks for having us up to Beaver Creek this weekend.  We had a wonderful
time.  I told Raul that Colorado needs to be our vacation every summer bc
this was our best one by far!  Anyway, it was a fun spending time with you
guys and your parents in such a relaxing place.

We need to get together soon and share pictures.  Also, I don't know if I
can go that long without laughing with and at you!

Tell Megan thanks too!

Thanks for the note, except of course for the last comment, why don't you 
just go seat in row 100 - alright.  Megan and I had a great time and enjoyed 
having you guys come out..  I love going out there during the summer.  We are 
going to arrange a ski weekend on President Day Weekend this February - so 
make plans to be laughed at while skiing.  I didn't mean laughed at - I meant 
having a fun time.  Talk to you soon.

Hey Mike:
You won't believe whose wedding Megan and I are going to in early Oct. - 
Marlon and Marissa's.  As well as OB, Choby, Mike and like Patty Donahue, 
Sammy, Amy, etc.  It should be pretty interesting to say the least.  I am 
also running in this year's NYC Marathon which falls on the first Sunday in 
November.  So trying to get to the east coast for a third time has been tough 
to arrange.  How was Patty's wedding -it looked like alot of fun.  I still 
want to meet up with you guys somewhere, but I'm just not sure where at this 
point - I still think DC.  Let me know what you think.
Ben"

The models reflects 10 years on the revenue forecast.  The DASH reflects 
Mitch's changes from Wednesday.  We will talk later.  

Issues to consider:
1)  Payback year shifts back to 3 years from 2.5 years when considering taxes 
and dep.
2)  IRR increases from 27% to 29% with 10 yr forecast
3)  Balance sheet still out of balance

Cliff:
Do you have Dierdre's address in NYC.  Megan and I are staying there next 
weekend and are getting picked up at the airport and need to tell the driver 
where were going.  How is everything going?  Slow down the traveling yet?  
Make sure you include yourself in the Turkey Run on Thanksgiving in Chicago.

Here are the highlighted versions of the plants I've gone through.  I'm sure 
that not all the info I've flagged needs to be pulled, but I'm not sure 
exactly what the guidelines are for whether information is sensitive or not, 
so I tried to flag it all and let someone more knowledgeable than myself make 
that call.

I'm due to arrive back in Houston at 9:00 this evening (space permitting).  
I'll plan to be in late tomorrow morning (11:00 or 12:00) to continue the 
fun.  See you tomorrow.

I can be reached here for the next hour or so at 503-464-7751.

PS.  Jinsung, be careful when boxing up the stuff in my desk!  I'll bring in 
my car for you to wash tomorrow as well!

I have created and populated the due diligence folders in Livelink for the 
1999 Peakers.  Attached are the slimmed-down indexes of the documents that 
were moved.  We'll need to go through these documents to find the redactions.

Poor Bobby!  What a way to go out.  I actually do feel sorry for the guy.  He 
should have gone out on better terms, but now some people will think of him 
only in this context.

I'm trying to find good in this announcement but not much is coming from it.  
I did have a good interview at Duke Business School last week.  I should be 
hearing from NYU-Stern and Duke in the next couple of weeks.  What is my next 
option?  Any suggestions regarding writing letters to anyone you know at Duke 
or NYU?

Attached is the latest version of the investor list.  However, I have not
been able to touch base with Jim yet to get his comments.  If he has any, I

We are not going to send back this investor list anymore.  I am going to send 
both you and James an update each night that we send something out, but only 
you guys make changes to the Investor List.  Also make sure that you still 
send the signed CA down to us even if there are not any changes to the CA, we 
need to have our legal team go through it first.  Thanks!

I talked with Thomas Favinger and Tom Boren is the CEO of PG&E, which is not 
the best guy to send the books to.  The better person is Thomas Favinger and 
his address is:

Bethesda, Maryland 20814

Phone: (301) 280-6231

So please send out 2 books to Thomas tonight.  Thanks!

I've finished with Wilton Center.  Here's my highlighted index.  Once again, 
I've probably included too many documents (land, rough cost estimates, etc).

Tomorrow I'll get started on the '99s.  Hopefully we can get a fairly quick 
turnaround on these to get scanned in again.  If we can get these documents 
skimmed through in two days (tomorrow and Wednesday), we should be in good 
shape to get everything scanned in and done by Friday.  Keep your fingers 
crossed.

Attached is and update to the LES and OPPD short positions.  These numbers 
should change as we have more contact with the desk regarding the deal.  Ben 
could you please update the model with this information so that we can start 
the process of capturing the different segments that may add value to the 
project.  Once we hear from LES regarding the proposal Oscar sent to them 
yesterday, we can start plugging the pieces together to come up with a sound 
value for the deal.  Let me known if you have any questions.



Thanks,
Russ"

Iaia:
How the hell are ya?  Wanted to drop you a line and see how you were doing 
and let you know that Brandon and I continued the tradition and went to the 
DMB concert last night.  Must say that it wasn't the same as being with you 
in a limo, but we still had fun.  Wanted to get your number up there, b/c I 
will be up in Chicago for Thanksgiving and was hoping to meet you in Chicago 
then.  Gotta run, but I hope all is going well and I'll talk to you soon.

We conducted a conference call with Lincoln today and they advised they are 
no longer interested in working with Enron on the LM-6000 opportunity that 
had been under consideration.  The main reasons given was that there was 
extreme existance in the organization.  Lincoln said they would need an 
annual payment of $90 to $100 per kw/yr to do the deal which they feel is 
extremely out of the market and Enron would not transact.  At this level, we 
would be break-even at best, even with the OPPD work-out value and the gas 
deal.

Lincoln is currently developing a peaking project using ABB units that must 
be in operation 6/01.  All of their resources are dedicated to this project.  
Their plan is to install LM-6000's for a 11/1/03 start date and they are not 
prepared to deal with an acceleration of the project.  The feel that working 
with Enron at this time only complicates their workload.

Lincoln did say they were interested in working with us on a gas supply and 
pipeline transaction as the site for development is 6 miles from Northern 
Natural Gas.  

I will begin this evaluation and consider the possibility of selling two 
LM-6000's bundled with the supply and infrastructure deal.

Oscar

I am in the process of firing the off the first shot to Cinergy for a 5 or 10 
year toll starting 1/1/03.  Please provide any comments with regard to 
pricing, etc.  I just pulled the Capacity charge out of the air.  I made the 
10 year a little lower in hopes of making it more attractive.  I think a 10 
year toll attached to the asset will make it more attractive to the tolling 
providers of the world (AES, Calpine, Tenaska,etc.).  Let me know your 
thoughts and concerns before I send this off to Cinergy."

Ben,

DC is still treating me well.  10 years here and still going.  My wife and I
moved into our new home in June.  So I've been getting settled in the new
place all summer, real busy but it's been fun.  Just had the 1 year
anniversary, can't believe it's been that long.  Flather Hall, Kitty's, and
'box' seem like yesterday...

Marlon's wedding sounds like fun, too bad it's Homecoming weekend.  Would be
nice to see everybody.  We need to make some plans and all get together
soon.  The marathon sounds great, good luck, the only running I have time
for these days is from Home Depot and back to the house. But I manage to go
to the gym a few days a week to maintain my 250 lbs slim figure.

I still hang out with Penney and his new little girl, never thought he would
be the first to have a baby.  Saw Ken and Theo a few weeks ago in DC.  Dolan
and Sofie are now in San Fran and I talk to him from time to time.

Hard to make plans with a big bunch of people.  Sometimes you just gotta
make the plans with a few and throw it out there for the rest of the group.
Let me know if you have any ideas or possible locations.  Maybe just plan a
weekend somewhere, DC or otherwise and try to get as many people together.
Maybe a big party or something like that.  We'll hire Vince O'Neill to
organize it.  An un-official homecoming party.

See ya

Ben,
Here's the information on the ABB GT11N turbines.  They are available for 
immediate delivery (once removed from New Brunswick).

If the party has questions please have them give me a call.  If they need 
more detailed information on the units we can put a CA in place.

Attached is the turbine report we discussed yesterday.  We will continue to 
prepare the LM6000 list you have seen in the past, but this will replace the 
master turbine list and will be updated bi-weekly.

Attached is our first Turbine Position Report.  We intend to issue this

report by turbine as well as three summary reports:

Summary by Status
Summary by Controlling Region
Summary by Turbine Type

Some of the financial data in this report is preliminary.  I will be working 
with the respective regional accounting groups to establish procedures for 
financial updates on a regular basis.  In the meantime, I welcome any 
corrections / suggestions you may have.

George,

Thanks for the note and the message. I will try to call you later today, but
will send this note just in case I miss you.

While I am interested in following up with Tim about our project in the NW,
there are two other more pressing reasons for talking with the right guys at
Enron. First, we have just secured the rights to a 1600 MW plant in Texas -
permitting complete and just about ready for financing. We are also close to
securing the rights to a 800 MW project in Oklahoma. So we would like to
talk about tolling, etc. for both of those plants.

Also, word on the street is that Enron is not only selling existing
generating stations, but also its projects under development. I think I saw
a report that your CEO denied this. But, if there is any truth in the
statement, we would like to follow up, especially concerning the development
sites. It may be possible for us to take over development and have a tie
back to Enron for the marketing (and perhaps the operations) of the project.

Hope you are enjoying London,

Cheers,

Chuck

Chas - I left a message on your voice mail regarding Tim Belden, who heads
up our west power desk.  Tim can be reached at 503-464-3820 (Portland).

Tim - Chuck Brown is a principal in Newport Generation (Irvine), and is
developing a gas- fired merchant generating station in the Pacific
Northwest.  He would like to talk with you about a PPA / marketing
agreement for the output of the station.  His number is 949-475-9570.
Please contact Chuck to discuss the details.  Thanks.

I am in London this week and can be reached at 44-20-7783-4160 if either of
you would like any additional information.  Otherwise I leave it in your
capable hands to get together.

Cheers,

George

Dave Delainey has requested feedback on all the interested parties by this 
Friday.  If you have recently made contact with your respective company(s), 
please drop me a line and let me know the latest.  If no contact has been 
made recently, please call and see how things are going.  All of these 
companies should have had books for a week plus.  As you all are aware, bids 
are due a week from Friday.  I am unsure who ultimately made the contact with 
some of these companies, so I have bunched them together.  If there are some 
companies that I haven't included, but that you have feedback on, please let 
me know what it is.  Thanks for all your help, and it looks like the real fun 
is just around the corner.

All of you continue to play a key role in the success of the sale of the 
Peakers, LVI & II and Pastoria.  A number of different parties are currently 
reviewing the book. Since we haven't had a chance to gather as a group 
recently, I thought it might be beneficial to send out an email highlighting 
the schedule over the next several weeks and months.

This week and next, we will be finalizing the due diligence room, the terms 
of the purchase and sale agreements (PSA), the management presentation and a 
lot of other stuff.  First round bids due a week from this Friday, on Sept. 
29.    The week of Oct. 2,  we will be notifying those bidders that will 
advance to Round 2 and we will be sending out the PSA.  The week of Oct. 9, 
the real fun will begin with management presentations, due diligence room 
opening and site visits.  The key people involved in these activities should 
work to keep their schedules as flexible as possible from Oct. 9 - Nov 3. We 
need to think about who can do plant tours, give presentations, etc given 
that the most logical people may be giving the management presentation, 
answering questions, and/or unavailable to lead the plant tour.  It is our 
hope and expectations that we will have multiple bidders to juggle in this 
process.  It is going to be a balancing act and I encourage everyone to begin 
to think through people and process.  The schedule then has us selecting our 
preferred purchaser(s) the week of Nov. 6, with a December 18, 2000 closing!

I believe we have identified and dealt with many of the legal, accounting, 
tax and financing (unwind) issues surrounding the sale.  If people are aware 
of other related issues, please let me know so that we can deal with them 
ASAP.

Thanks again for everyone's help thus far.  If by chance you don't have a 
copy of the Info Memo, let me know and I will get a copy out to you pronto. 
Let me know if you all have any questions.

Regards,

Don

We and my family are going to Beaver Creek for x-mas but are going on a 
cruise which travels to different Virgin islands and will be in St. Barts for 
New Years.  We have never been to these Islands or on a cruise before so it 
should be pretty interesting.  I'll let you know about the tics.  See ya

Ben, please find attached the preliminary O&M estimate for the Lincoln, NE 
project that we discussed. It shows O&M cost estimates for a 20 year period 
assuming a stand alone plant with Availability required Monday - Friday, 6 am 
to 10 pm during the peak seasons (hence 2 operating shifts of staff). The GT 
major maintenance accrual is also shown assuming no membership in the Lease 
Engine Membership program. Since we will be buying the output of the plant 
from the Owner & Operator (LES) during a contract period, we may consider not 
showing them these numbers. Before tipping our hand, I'd like to see what 
they plan to ""charge"" us for the O&M portion of the power they provide us 
during the agreement period. Please review these and the other assumptions to 
ensure that I understand the project correctly at this point (especially the 
water treatment part). 


Since its preliminary in nature, please consider its accuracy +/- 25% for our 
proforma purposes.

If LES is to provide what they feel the O&M would be, please let me in on 
their numbers so we can provide our experience.

thanks, Scot"

Is the major maintenance reserve estimate based on a negotiated Long Term
Services Agreement (LTSA)?  If so, will it be in place and transfer with
PEF?

Are spare parts for the first major overhaul included anywhere in the
capital cost estimate or are they assumed to be purchased through the
maintenance reserve estimate (i.e. the LTSA) charge?

PEF?

Are spare parts for the first major overhaul included anywhere in the
capital cost estimate or are they assumed to be purchased through the
maintenance reserve estimate (i.e. the LTSA) charge?

Subject: Lincoln, Nebraska Preliminary O&M Estimate

Ben, please find attached the preliminary O&M estimate for the Lincoln, NE 
project that we discussed. It shows O&M cost estimates for a 20 year period 
assuming a stand alone plant with Availability required Monday - Friday, 6 am 
to 10 pm during the peak seasons (hence 2 operating shifts of staff). The GT 
major maintenance accrual is also shown assuming no membership in the Lease 
Engine Membership program. Since we will be buying the output of the plant 
from the Owner & Operator (LES) during a contract period, we may consider not 
showing them these numbers. Before tipping our hand, I'd like to see what 
they plan to ""charge"" us for the O&M portion of the power they provide us 
during the agreement period. Please review these and the other assumptions to 
ensure that I understand the project correctly at this point (especially the 
water treatment part). 


Since its preliminary in nature, please consider its accuracy +/- 25% for our 
proforma purposes.

If LES is to provide what they feel the O&M would be, please let me in on 
their numbers so we can provide our experience.

thanks, Scot

PG&E Gen is most interested in Pastoria and had several questions/concerns
that they asked about during my discussion with them:

* What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is
concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to
either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.
* What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to engage
NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control over the
turbines?
* They also questioned whether there would be any ""agricultural
restrictions""?

Subject: Lincoln, Nebraska Preliminary O&M Estimate

Ben, please find attached the preliminary O&M estimate for the Lincoln, NE 
project that we discussed. It shows O&M cost estimates for a 20 year period 
assuming a stand alone plant with Availability required Monday - Friday, 6 am 
to 10 pm during the peak seasons (hence 2 operating shifts of staff). The GT 
major maintenance accrual is also shown assuming no membership in the Lease 
Engine Membership program. Since we will be buying the output of the plant 
from the Owner & Operator (LES) during a contract period, we may consider not 
showing them these numbers. Before tipping our hand, I'd like to see what 
they plan to ""charge"" us for the O&M portion of the power they provide us 
during the agreement period. Please review these and the other assumptions to 
ensure that I understand the project correctly at this point (especially the 
water treatment part). 


Since its preliminary in nature, please consider its accuracy +/- 25% for our 
proforma purposes.

If LES is to provide what they feel the O&M would be, please let me in on 
their numbers so we can provide our experience.

thanks, Scot

Ben, 

Here is the first cut of Wheatland. I did not reflect all comments from Mike 
since I think we need to sit down with Don tomorrow morning before we make 
any structural changes. We will decide tomorrow regarding how we present key 
sales point - general to all peakers vs specific to each peakers and other 
things. Thanks.

Quick comments.  Mike, what are your thoughts on my answer in O5?

I'll provide start numbers for O5 later today.

E2.  No; however, CFR60 subpart GG short term limits still apply 
(approximately 90 ppm NOx) which are well above the turbine emissions.

T1.  ""on any asset"" should read ""of any asset""

O5. Since commercial operations, the Wheatland facility has averaged xx 
starts per machine, and the Lincoln facility has averaged yy starts per 
machine.  The start-up and commissioning process followed a normal startup 
progression.  The Lincoln facility experienced a generator failure in unit #7 
during the first run season.  General Electric replaced the generator under 
warranty provisions.  Sratification of gas flows was observed in the stacks 
at the Wheatland facility during CEMS certification.  The CEMS certification 
was then postponed until Summer '01.

O6.  Wasn't it a strip mine?  I didn't think it was a coal mine.

Mitch

I received a call from Tom Favinger at PG&E today.  He is looking for the
responses to his questions from last week and also has a new question.  He
would like to get a breakout of the $10.25 million item in the Pastoria
capital budget labeled Pre-Commercial Operations Costs.

I also spoke to Darryn O Llegas from PECO today.  They are planning to bid
on the peakers and LV Cogen on Friday.  His questions are:

Peakers

* Will Enron's control area dispatching/scheduling software be
included in the property conveyed with the peakers?
* Do the Peaker's permits make any allowance for combined cycle
operation or would they need to re-start the permitting process?
* They would like clarification concerning the joint ownership of gas
interconnects - what is owned, cost to maintain, etc.

LV Cogen

* Update on status of Phase II permitting?
* Update on status of development process?
* Are there any tax abatements of any type for the Phase II project?

Additional Comments from PECO:

* Don't have price curves yet for all of the peakers markets - will
need to develop prior to final bid.
* May have a concern re: market power for the peakers as a result of
the PECO/Unicom merger.  They will be comfortable enough to bid this week
and don't expect it to be a concern for the final bid.
* They will probably submit a bid with separate values for: Wheatland;
other peakers together; LV Cogen.
* They are working their bid from two perspectives: replacement cost
plus a premium and discounted cash flow.  DCF will obviously change as they
get their price curves updated.

My responses to one set of PG&E questions would be as follows.  Dean is 
answering the other one and will send back to you directly.

* What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is
concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to
either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.

RESPONSE: Enron is very flexible re continuing involvement:  scheduling 
coordination, fuel supply, power marketing, etc.  We are also flexible re the 
time period and the terms of the continuing involvement.  Whatever 
arrangement is developed would be mutually beneficial.



* What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to engage
NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control over the
turbines?

RESPONSE: o EPC negotiations are complete with NEPCO.  Contract has not been 
executed, but has been ""put on the shelf"" awaiting decision on successful 
bidder for the purchase of the Pastoria project from ENA.  Successful bidder 
and NEPCO will each have the option of executing the EPC agreement.

  o Successful bidder is under no obligation to engage NEPCO.

  o West LB has control of the turbines.  They can be assigned either to the 
LLC or to ENA.  (If assigned to ENA, it was because the successful bidder for 
the Pastoria project did not want the turbines with the acquisition.)  If 
assigned to the LLC as part of the acquisition, the LLC can then assign the 
turbines to the ultimate EPC contractor.   



* They also questioned whether there would be any ""agricultural
restrictions""?

RESPONSE: The project site is presently under a Williamson Act contract to 
maintain agricultural use in exchange for lower taxes.  Last week, the Kern 
County Board of Supervisors voted to cancel the Williamson Act contract to 
allow for industrial use, which started a 180 day public comment period.  
However, the Governor has on his desk a bill for signature that would reduce 
the public comment period for the cancellation to the same time frame as the 
request for rehearing period for the CEC Final Decision.  (The Governor has 
until 9/30 sign the bill and is expected to do so because of the overwhelming 
support of the bill in the Assembly and the Senate.)  The cancellation will 
be contingent upon a successful CEC decision and a payment of a Williamson 
Act cancellation fee.

Jon: 
Here is the first of six e-mails regarding the inventories of the peakers.  
Regarding, the output and heat rates on the turbines, we copied for you the 
performance tests, which should have summary information on the output and 
heat rates at the end of each of the performance tests.  Please let me know 
if you do not find them.  Thanks!

I just want to give everyone my idea on how we will maintain DealBench to 
catch up with LiveLink.

Tonight I will finish moving files from LiveLink to ""O"" drive for 6 peaker 
projects. Once I move everything to ""O"" drive, I need to do following two 
things to maintain DealBench.

Update files from ""To be filed"" folder since every file to go to ""Due 
Diligence"" folder goes to ""To be filed"" folder first.
Jon: Please let me know whenever you move files from ""Project Files"" to ""Due 
Diligence"" and whenever you delete files in ""Due Diligence"".

I think this process should allow me to make sure that DealBench files are 
same as LiveLink files. Let me know if you find any hole in this process. 
Thanks.

Is the major maintenance reserve estimate based on a negotiated Long Term

PEF?
Answer:  We have not negotiated an LTSA with anyone at this time, and we do 
not expect to have one in place to transfer with PEF.  The maintenance 
reserve is our estimate based on industry data and information from GE.

Question: Are spare parts for the first major overhaul included anywhere in 
the
capital cost estimate or are they assumed to be purchased through the
maintenance reserve estimate (i.e. the LTSA) charge?

Answer:  The maintenance reserve is intended to include parts and labor for 
the overhaul."

Subject: Additional Questions


I received a call from Tom Favinger at PG&E today.  He is looking for the
responses to his questions from last week and also has a new question.  He
would like to get a breakout of the $10.25 million item in the Pastoria
capital budget labeled Pre-Commercial Operations Costs.

I also spoke to Darryn O Llegas from PECO today.  They are planning to bid
on the peakers and LV Cogen on Friday.  His questions are:

Peakers

* Will Enron's control area dispatching/scheduling software be
included in the property conveyed with the peakers?
* Do the Peaker's permits make any allowance for combined cycle
operation or would they need to re-start the permitting process?
* They would like clarification concerning the joint ownership of gas
interconnects - what is owned, cost to maintain, etc.

LV Cogen

* Update on status of Phase II permitting?
* Update on status of development process?
* Are there any tax abatements of any type for the Phase II project?

Additional Comments from PECO:

* Don't have price curves yet for all of the peakers markets - will
need to develop prior to final bid.
* May have a concern re: market power for the peakers as a result of
the PECO/Unicom merger.  They will be comfortable enough to bid this week
and don't expect it to be a concern for the final bid.
* They will probably submit a bid with separate values for: Wheatland;
other peakers together; LV Cogen.
* They are working their bid from two perspectives: replacement cost
plus a premium and discounted cash flow.  DCF will obviously change as they
get their price curves updated.

Miller/HOU/ECT@ECT 
Subject: PG&E Questions


My responses to one set of PG&E questions would be as follows.  Dean is 
answering the other one and will send back to you directly.

* What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is
concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to
either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.

RESPONSE: Enron is very flexible re continuing involvement:  scheduling 
coordination, fuel supply, power marketing, etc.  We are also flexible re the 
time period and the terms of the continuing involvement.  Whatever 
arrangement is developed would be mutually beneficial.



* What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to engage
NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control over the
turbines?

RESPONSE: o EPC negotiations are complete with NEPCO.  Contract has not been 
executed, but has been ""put on the shelf"" awaiting decision on successful 
bidder for the purchase of the Pastoria project from ENA.  Successful bidder 
and NEPCO will each have the option of executing the EPC agreement.

  o Successful bidder is under no obligation to engage NEPCO.

  o West LB has control of the turbines.  They can be assigned either to the 
LLC or to ENA.  (If assigned to ENA, it was because the successful bidder for 
the Pastoria project did not want the turbines with the acquisition.)  If 
assigned to the LLC as part of the acquisition, the LLC can then assign the 
turbines to the ultimate EPC contractor.   



* They also questioned whether there would be any ""agricultural
restrictions""?

RESPONSE: The project site is presently under a Williamson Act contract to 
maintain agricultural use in exchange for lower taxes.  Last week, the Kern 
County Board of Supervisors voted to cancel the Williamson Act contract to 
allow for industrial use, which started a 180 day public comment period.  
However, the Governor has on his desk a bill for signature that would reduce 
the public comment period for the cancellation to the same time frame as the 
request for rehearing period for the CEC Final Decision.  (The Governor has 
until 9/30 sign the bill and is expected to do so because of the overwhelming 
support of the bill in the Assembly and the Senate.)  The cancellation will 
be contingent upon a successful CEC decision and a payment of a Williamson 
Act cancellation fee.

I talked with Theresa Voss about the insurance on the peakers and she said 
that they have been making payments on the peakers and that this ""billing 
separately plan"" on the peakers will last until March of 2001.  At that 
point, an umbrella plan will cover the turbines.  Regarding the balance 
sheet, they have been accounting for it under prepaid insurance and have been 
amortizing it each month as its been paid.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

I am working with Don Miller and will be responsible for receiving and 
processing all due diligence requests for Pastoria.  

Below are our responses to PG&E's questions:


QUESTION:Is the major maintenance reserve estimate based on a negotiated Long 
Term Services Agreement (LTSA)?  If so, will it be in place and transfer with 
PEF?

RESPONSE:  We have not negotiated an LTSA with anyone at this time, and we do 
not expect to have one in place to transfer with PEF.  The maintenance 
reserve is our estimate based on industry data and information from GE.


QUESTION: Are spare parts for the first major overhaul included anywhere in 
the capital cost estimate or are they assumed to be purchased through the 
maintenance reserve estimate (i.e. the LTSA) charge?

RESPONSE:  The maintenance reserve is intended to include parts and labor for 
the overhaul.


QUESTION: What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is 
concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to 
either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.

RESPONSE: Enron is very flexible re continuing involvement:  scheduling 
coordination, fuel supply, power marketing, etc.  We are also flexible re the 
time period and the terms of the continuing involvement.  Whatever 
arrangement is developed would be mutually beneficial.


QUESTION: What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to 
engage NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control 
over the turbines?

RESPONSE: o EPC negotiations are complete with NEPCO.  Contract has not been 
executed, but has been ""put on the shelf"" awaiting decision on successful 
bidder for the purchase of the Pastoria project from ENA.  Successful bidder 
and NEPCO will each have the option of executing the EPC agreement.

  o The successful bidder will be under no obligation to engage NEPCO.

  o Pastoria has control of the turbines.  


QUESTION: They also questioned whether there would be any ""agricultural
restrictions""?

RESPONSE: The project site is presently under a Williamson Act contract to 
maintain agricultural use in exchange for lower taxes.  Last week, the Kern 
County Board of Supervisors voted to cancel the Williamson Act contract to 
allow for industrial use, which started a 180-day public comment period.  
However, the Governor has on his desk a bill for signature that would reduce 
the public comment period for the cancellation to the same time frame as the 
request for rehearing period for the CEC Final Decision.  (The Governor has 
until 9/30 sign the bill and is expected to do so because of the overwhelming 
support of the bill in the Assembly and the Senate.)  The cancellation will 
be contingent upon a successful CEC decision and a payment of a Williamson 
Act cancellation fee.


QUESTION: I received a call from Tom Favinger at PG&E today.  He would like 
to get a breakout of the $10.25 million item in the Pastoria capital budget 
labeled Pre-Commercial Operations Costs.

RESPONSE: The breakdown (in $MM) is as follows:

Project management during construction  $1.000
Start-up and acceptance    2.900
Insurance and performance bond   1.846
Owner's Engineer     1.500
County Chief Building Officer/Engineer/Consultant 3.000

TOTAL      $10.246


Should you have any questions, please call me at 713.345.8992."

I spoke to Aquila again today.  They are planning to submit bids on Friday
for Gleason, Wheatland and Pastoria.  They already have a tolling agreement
in the Lincoln area and don't want more capacity there.

Aquila's question:

They questioned the development costs for Pastoria - look very high.  I
noted that it includes the ERC's.  They would like a breakout of the
development costs


PG&E's question is below.  Are you comfortable disclosing this at this stage
or is this a phase II due diligence item?

Subject: Additional PG&E Question and an Aquila Question - all on Pastoria


I spoke to Aquila again today.  They are planning to submit bids on Friday
for Gleason, Wheatland and Pastoria.  They already have a tolling agreement
in the Lincoln area and don't want more capacity there.

Aquila's question:

They questioned the development costs for Pastoria - look very high.  I
noted that it includes the ERC's.  They would like a breakout of the
development costs


PG&E's question is below.  Are you comfortable disclosing this at this stage
or is this a phase II due diligence item?

Since we do not have to accept the NEPCO contract, can you break out the
cost and scope of equipment (Enron uses the term ""power islands"")?  Can we
get this information tomorrow?  Both cost and scope of this is important to
be able to assess the ""EPC"" price and determine bid price.

I know how e-mail is suppose to work, but its been so crazy here that I 
haven't even been able to do that.  We were here last night till 10:00 and it 
looks to be the same tonight and potentially for the rest of the year.  This 
project is going to kill me.  I glad to see that you are active on the net.   
I'll keep in touch a little better. Love

It wasn't like I was neglecting you.  You must understand that e-mail is 
faster than sending a letter and its slower than calling someone, but there 
is not always an immediate return.  Some people are lazy with returning 
e-mail.  It has been really busy here.  We are working long hours and this 
project is trying to close by the end of the year.  It's a $1 Billion 
project, so it takes alot of work.  Talk to you soon.

TO: Houston Area Employees Participating in the Domestic Medical Plan Benefits

You may have recently received communication from United HealthCare (UHC) 
concerning Memorial Hermann Health Systems' (MHHS) decision to terminate 
their contract with UHC  in the Houston/Beaumont area.  This communication 
also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network 
due to this action.  It is our intent to help you understand the situation.

It is our understanding that Memorial Herman Health Systems asked for a 40% 
increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to 
you and Enron!  When United HealthCare attempted to negotiate with a counter 
proposal, Memorial Hermann cancelled their contract.

While this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and UHC, 
Enron continues to support UHC in their ongoing contract negotiation 
efforts.  At this time, it is only UHC which has been affected, however, it 
is our understanding that Cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group 
and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well.  

Many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals 
within the UHC Network or have contracted directly with UHC including those 
with admission privileges to The Woodlands, Sugarland and Clear Lake 
Hospitals, to name a few.  In a further effort to limit disruption to our 
affected employees and families who are enrolled in the UHC Network or EPO 
options, Enron has authorized UHC to process claims incurred between 
September 28 and December 31, 2000 as if the termination of the Memorial 
Hermann Health Systems from the network had not occurred and In-Network 
benefits applied.  Office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other 
charges will be covered at 90%.  Hospital admissions will still need to be 
pre-certified with UHC.

These steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by Primary 
Care Physician disruption from 1,050 to 127.

If You Need Medical Attention:  You or your doctor/hospital must call UHC's 
customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.  In some cases 
the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.  
If this should happen, please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to 
UHC with a claim form for prompt reimbursement.  Claim forms can be obtained 
by calling 1-800-332-7979 or in Houston at 713-853-7979 ( press 1).

Open enrollment materials will be coming soon.  Take this opportunity to 
consider your elections for 2001.  

United HealthCare and Enron HR are committed to assisting Enron employees 
through this transition.  We will communicate any  further developments that 
may impact you or your family."

Katherine,

I am unsure of the direction Ross would like for me to take with the Central 
Office (Purchasing & Maintenance).  As you will see I have one ORG for all 
people associated with New Albany.  If Ross would like for it to be listed as 
two, let me know and it will be no problem to generate the second chart.  Let 
me know if I can be of anymore help.

Guys:
Don Miller and I would like to set some time up with you, today if possible, 
to talk about state and local tax issues for the 2000 peakers.  I will talk 
with Don about a good time to meet and let you know.  But let me know what is 
a good time for you this afternoon.  Thanks for your time.

Dave:
Just wanted to remind you about the call I received from Paul Cavicchi with 
Tractebel.  He was calling to ask about an extention to the bidding on the 
assets.  I basically said that there are no extentions except for bids that 
are strong bids that come in on Monday or Tuesday of next week.  He sounded a 
little disappointed that they got the book so late, but still seemed 
interested in the assets.  Hope this helps.

B,

DCR:  405 E. 82nd St, # 4G, NY, NY 10028.

Unfortunately I am still on the treadmill of travel.  This weekend I have to
go to some Robinson siblings dinner that Chris is trying to start as a
tradition... real thrilled about that one.  Be glad you don't live
close.........I want to just stay home and sleep, but that isn't happening.
Next weekend, wedding in NJ, following weekend wedding in Alabama.

Definitely game for the turket trot....

Speak soon.

Junior Achievement (JA) is seeking Enron employees to serve as JA=20
consultants! Join more than 6,000 volunteers from hundreds of Houston=20
companies who have made a difference. As a Junior Achievement consultant, y=

become a role model who shows students how to achieve personal and=20
professional success. By making a commitment to be a consultant in either=
=20
elementary, middle or high school, you can make a positive impact in our=20
local schools.

The time commitment to teach is minimal- only one hour per week for 5-10=20
weeks (depending on the grade level). Volunteers for all programs receive=
=20
training, materials and support from Junior Achievement. You may teach a=20
class alone or team up with a co-worker, friend or spouse. Most classes are=
=20
taught during the school day with an after school program available in some=
=20
areas.

To learn more about various Junior Achievement programs, attend a Brown Bag=
=20
Lunch on October 12 at 11:30 a.m. in EB 552. A representative from JA will=
=20
give a presentation and answer your questions. If you are interested in=20
becoming a consultant this year, please attend.

If you are unable to attend the Brown Bag luncheon, but would like addition=
al=20
information on volunteering, please call Katherine Cheng at (713) 682-4500.

One thing you can count on is the satisfaction of knowing you=01,re making =

130,000 young people during the 2000/2001 school year. With your help, it c=

I recommend putting the attached e-mails and attachments in the DD room.  
We've also had verbal discussions with the IEPA to verify that the retest can 
be postponed.  It can.

Michelle -

Please forward to Mike Murphy.  In general, the schedule is acceptable.
Please work with Merle on the details.  Can you or Mike confirm my
understanding of the following?

1.  Though the units ran within limits on NOx and CO throughout the summer,
GE believes that the performance will be enhanced with the attached
modifications (i.e. NOx will be reduced even further to the 7.5-8.5 ppm
range).

Response:  The GE target will be to have NOx at 7.5-8.5 range. In addition
the expectation is that CO will also be around 10ppm at Base load
conditions.

2.  The liners will have their dilution holes resized.  Will the secondary
nozzles also be modified, or is this not required?

Response:  The secondary nozzles will be modified to meet the new group
number change which will increase the effective area. This is an engineering
requirement. In addition the primary nozzle effective are will change with
the new part numbers. The liner dilution hole change will be standard across
all the units.

3.  You can postpone the retest until the next expected run season
(December/January).

Response:  The retest could be delayed until the winter peak season but in
the event that a unit was run after modification without a test, the risk of
compliance would be to Enron. GE feels very strongly that a reliable
operation of the unit would include retest as soon as practical after
modifications.  In the event the units will not run until 2Q 2001, the
abiity of GE to respond to the site need may be in jeopardy due to the high
number of new unit start ups.

4.  This change will not limit the ability to run prior to the scheduled
test, in the event of an unexpected run call.

Response:  The units would be available to run, but the operator may not
know where the unit would be in a regards to compliance.  We are also trying
to bring the unit back to a nominal firing temperature. The other point to
consider is whether or not you need to alert the EPA of the modification and
what your requirements are with that entity.

5.  Enron or Des Plaines Green Land Development (Lincoln Center) will not
incur any financial obligations as a result of the change-out.

Response:  GE will be paying for all labor, tools and shop work necessary to
perform the modifications, but Enron or Des Plaines Green Land Development
would be responsible for all fuel costs, electrical costs and operator
costs.

Thanks for your diligence, and please let the GE team know that I
appreciate the effort given to the Lincoln plant.  Regarding both the
generator change-out and the emissions effort, I have no complaints with
GE's performance.

Regards,

Mitch

Mitch,

Attached is the handout presentation that was given today to the Enron
team.
I have also attached the proposed schedule for the work at the Lincoln
Center site. The plan is work two (2) shifts per day, ten (10) per day. It
is expected to take six (6) days per unit at this time. GE will work to
minimize the schedule and we hope with productivity and best practices to
improve the schedule. After the hardware changes made, retesting of the
units will need to occur. GE will bring and emissions test vendor to the
<<Wilton Customerhandout.ppt>>  <<Emissions schedule.xls>>  site and check
the NOx and CO readings. It is expected that the units will need to run at
Base Load for Approximately 8-10 hours and then at the reduced loads to
check part readings. The total operating time should be about 12 twelve
hours.

If you have any questions, please contact Michelle April or myself.

DealBench

Enron Net Works' newest initiative is now online!  

The Product
DealBenchTM is an online platform that enables licensing companies to arrange 
and execute transactions  efficiently and effectively.  Companies that 
license DealBenchTM are able to organize their transaction materials, upload 
documents and other materials to a secure website, invite deal participants 
to view deal materials, host various types of online auctions and manage, 
track and close a transaction online.  
DealBenchTM incorporates five specific business tools that streamline the 
transaction process for licensees:
Document Sharing:   deal-related materials in various formats (Word, 
Powerpoint, Excel, CAD drawings, digital pictures,      etc.) can be uploaded 
for deal participants to view and/or edit.

Auctioning/Bidding:   licensees can design and monitor (in real-time) forward 
or reverse auctions and collect sealed tender      bids.

Multi-media:    customers can present high quality virtual road shows and 
asset descriptions using streaming video.

Secure Communication:  DealLineTM messaging system facilitates one-to-one, 
one-to-many, and many-to-many        communication.

Deal Management:   DealNotesTM  enables customers to monitor the progress of 
their deals using statistics on user      downloads, bidding/auction results 
and user page views.


Applications
DealBenchTM has been used by Enron during bank product syndications, the sale 
of a large portfolio of leases, and the procurement of certain materials for 
the new headquarters building.   Soon, DealBenchTM will also meet the 
collaboration needs of Enron attorneys, facilitate online RFQs and provide 
for the hosting of online datarooms.  

To learn more about DealBenchTM, please join eSpeak on Wednesday October 4th 
when Harry Arora (Vice-President, eCommerce) will answer questions regarding 
this Enron Net Works initiative.  For additional information, please visit 
https://www.DealBench.com (username= guest, password= dealbench) or email 
webmaster@DealBench.com.
NOTE:  If you are unable to execute the above link, please copy the link into 
the address line of your installed browser.

We welcome all thoughts and ideas on how the DealBench platform can be 
utilized to address the needs of Enron's business units.  Further, as the 
platform is available to be licensed externally, please forward new business 
development leads to members of the    DealBenchTM team."

Team,

As everyone knows, we will use DealBench (a secure on-line platform) as a 
virtual due diligence room and for more. We are in the process of uploading 
electronic copy of due diligence documents, plant pictures, due diligence 
list, management presentation with voices of developers and more on 
DealBench. 

Attached is the first draft of DealBench instruction I prepared. You will 
receive invitation email(s) to DealBench. Please read attached instruction 
and  log onto DealBench. Please give us any comments on using DealBench based 
on your experience. We will improve this instruction and send out to Phase II 
bidders next week. 

Regards,

Jinsung Myung

Hey Ben!? I just saw your message from 9/26. I  guess I'm one of those who is 
lazy about checking e-mails {or just not used to  it.}? It has been busy 
around here. The SNCARC dinner was a success, but  I'm glad it is over now.? 
Kara seems to be doing a bit better. I was there  today and we went out for a 
walk. It was good.? I think she has a ways to  go though.? I'm glad to hear 
that you are going to be staying in  Houston.? I'd like to hear more about 
how that all went. Well, I'd better  get dinner started.? Hope you had a good 
weekend.? Love ya!  "

Good to hear from you.  Yes, it was a wonderful weekend to work all weekend.  
Were very busy at work and will continue to be so through the rest of the 
year.  It is very upsetting to hear about Kara.  Seems like she has a long 
way to go to recovery, but I'm optimistic that she can get to where she needs 
to be.  I talked to her Sunday morning.  She seemed upbeat.  I hope the place 
she is staying at is giving her a glance at how bad it could be so that its 
kind of a wake up call.  Let me know how Megan and I can help.  Megan is 
going to get this really good book on Manic Depression.  Hope we can talk 
about this soon.
Love,
 Your Son  "

Dear Ben:

Its nice hearing that you are doing well and that you are taking MBA
finance classes --- are these at U. of Houston?

The admissions people mentioned that your GMAT score was too low when you
applied last year.  They said that if you had a higher GMAT score we could
consider you as a special case because of your background in energy
finance.  Basically, my impression was that you didn't need to have a score
close to the 660 median, but you need to improve a lot.  I would also
recommend that you work more on the quantitative sections, since it is
clear to me that your verbal skills are quite good.

Keep in touch.

regards,

Sheridan

 Thanks for your quick reply.  With regards to the classes, I looked into U 
of H for summer classes and they did not provide graduate level summer 
classes.  The only school that provided graduate level summer classes was the 
University of St. Thomas.  It would have been nice to take these classes at U 
of H, because our Chairman and CEO and my recommender to The Texas Business 
School, Ken Lay, received his PhD from there.  
 Thanks again for your response and advice and hope all is going well.

Regards,
Ben "

Ben,

Would you please forward to Dale copies of the CA's that were signed by those 
parties which will be given second round access to the LV CoGen docs?  His 
fax number is listed below. Many thanks.  

Stuart


By the way, I hope that you are continuing to obtain executed originals of 
the CA's (and sending them to Ed Hearn upon receipt thereof).

Dale,

I will follow up with Ed to be sure that he is able to get you the form (in 
electronic format) that we used.  Be advised, however, that many of the 
parties attempted to negotiate the form.  While I didn't let them get away 
with much, some concessions were made.  If you would like copies of the 
executed confidentiality agreements for certain parties, I can get those for 
you as well.

Ben,

I hope I passed the test........The retreat went very well.  I've been
thinking about your role at Cinergy and have concluded that involvement in
the DG area is the best place for you to grow and develop as an executive.
The assignment will be tough because you will be front running the market.
But, the opportunity to develop an expertise in marketing in this area will
be invaluable if the industry develops as I believe it will.  Let's talk.

Dad

This is a test to see if you are checking your e-mail these days.  I have a
feeling that you have not been, due to your board presentation last week.
Mike M. tells me he will be up there today - hope that goes well for you
guys.  I really think there could be something there.  Please give me a
call sometime soon.  Things are going well here and we have been quite
busy.  Give me a call sometime.  The number is (713) 853-7998. See ya!

Yes you have passed the test - Congratualations.  We have been working very 
hard on our sale and wanted to let you know that your guys came back with a 
very good bid.  We will inform you probably this afternoon or tomorrow that 
you will be making the short list.   We will probably have a short list of 
about 5-7 companies.   You guys are in the top three! I think you guys have a 
very good chance at getting these plants, which I think is an excellent 
opportunity.  Hope all is going well and your other talks are going in the 
right direction.  On a side note, from what I've heard from my parents in 
Boston, Kara seems to be doing pretty poorly.  She is clearly going through 
some very difficult times.  Talk to you soon.
Love,
Ben"

Dad:
The industry is getting beat up a little bit, but I hope this isn't slowing 
you guys down at all.  I talked with Mike M the yesterday, he said that his 
meetings with you guys seem to go well.  I think that doing that deal would 
be quite beneficial to both companies over all strategies, regarding power, 
gas and cash flow.  Megan and I will be in NYC this weekend for a wedding.  I 
would like to talk to you pretty soon anout a couple of things.  I have 
decided to stay at Enron at least till this project is over, which will be 
early next year.  The more experience I have with another company, like Enron 
the better.  I am also going to reapply to just The Texas Business School.  
Things are going well with my communication with them this year.  I have 
already talked to one of their professors that I talked to last year and have 
gotten an e-mail from the director of the admissions program.  The both feel 
I have and are currently doing the right things to get into the school next 
year.  So things are going well so far.  I am contining with my other class 
and going to take the GMAT one more time.  
I have said a little more than I would have liked but I just wanted to give 
you the laod down of what I have been thinking.

Ben"

Enclosed is a copy of the new certificate for the Oxy ERCs.

The certificate names ""Enron North American Corporation"" as the holder.
Barry and Joan, can you confirm this is not a problem.  Also, could you
please review the certificate to make sure it is otherwise OK (looks that
way to me).

The agreement with Oxy contemplated a live closing where we would swap wire
confirmation info for the original certificate.  Oxy is proposing Enron pay
first and they will then FedEx the certificate when the transfers have been
""verified.""  Sheila, is this OK?

The last day to pay is Monday October 9, which is Columbus day.  I have not
verified whether that is a bank holiday.  Perhaps the payment should be made
on Friday October 6 in any event.

We are waiting to get a file endorsed copy of a financing statement
termination from Chevron.  I will remind them of that.

I have been able to locate a copy of the Peoples Energy letter we were 
looking for last week.  I still need to obtain copies of the ""as built"" 
drawings for the pipeline lateral.  These drawings were in one of the last 
groups of documents which I sent to the data room.  

Please locate these drawings and have copies sent up to Stuart Zisman.  Aaron 
Roffwarg at Bracewell & Patterson will send these copies to ComEd so that 
they may record their easement and we can then obtain our title policy on the 
pipeline lateral (this is needed for sale purposes).

I will be in Chicago tomorrow and Friday.  I will be on vacation Monday and 
in Chicago Tuesday.  I will be back in the Houston office on Wednesday of 
next week.

Thanks for you attention to this matter.

Dave, we made a small change in the order of the presentation.  We swithched 
the next to last sections so Other Acquisition Issues is before California 
Power Market.  Also, the Labor Agreement slide has change based on my 
conversation with Rick Johnson.  

Sam and Dave, if you have notes you will follow, please forward them to 
Sheila and Karen to assist them in their review of your voice-over.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=

the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=

your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=
=20
http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20

Mr. Rogers,

As you may have noticed from the auto-reply to your email, Dr. Harris is
no longer with the University of Texas.  I have taken the position of
Interim Director until we find a permanent replacement.

While I do not know what conversations you have had with Dr. Harris, I
can assure you that the steps you are taking to improve your application
are the correct ones.  Congratulations on your class and I do hope that
you get a positive response from GMAC regarding the GMAT exam.

I am glad to hear that you are still interested in our program and we
look forward to receiving your new application.

Sincerely,

Jennifer Miller

Dr. Harris:
     I hope you had an enjoyable summer and it did not go too quickly,
as I
felt mine did.  I wanted to let you know that I am still very much
interested in attending the Business School.
     I took your advice this summer and took a graduate level finance
class
(Financial Management), which I received an A.  I was very pleased with
myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time.
I
have also decided to take another graduate level finance class
(Macroeconomics), which I am currently taking.
     I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into
GMAC
to try and receive a ""special testing status"" for the GMAT.   I am
currently waiting to hear back from them with their decision.  When I
hear
back from GMAC, I am planning on re-taking the GMAT to try and increase
my
score.
     As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the
Business School for next year and I'm in the process of doing whatever I
can to increase my application profile.
     Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do
to
enhance my application profile.   Again, I hope all is going well and I
look forward to hearing from you soon.

Regards,

Ben Rogers

Juan tells me that everything will be moved tomorrow sometime.  We want the 
cabinets to be locked for the move, so I'll lock them up tonight when I 
leave.  If you need to get in the files, grab the keys from my top drawer.  
Make sure to lock things up and replace the keys when you're done.  I'll 
unlock the stuff when it gets settled across the street tomorrow."

recommended by legal.  In the turbine contract slide I deleted the bullet 
that the contract is assignable.  

Don, please have this substituted for the last presentation

Oh fine day!

You have sent my heart soaring with news that you have agreed to receive
some of this Fool's earnestly penned electronic missives!

I hope you will find my correspondence entrancing but I shall be honest:
what these notes occasionally lack in charm they make up for in
convenience and persistence. The word passed along to me is that you have
elected to receive the following note(s):

FoolWatch
Breakfast with the Fool
Investing Basics
Fresh Stuff
Special Offers From The Motley Fool

I shall do my best to make sure the letters are dispatched with both
substance and speed. Shall you ever change your mind and decide to select
more notes or (gasp!) fewer, simply click the link below and you shall be
transported to a page where you can change your choices.

http://www.fool.com/community/freemail/emailenter.htm

Looking forward to our pen pal relationship. :-)

Foolishly,
Will Somers
Chief Jester-in-Residence

P.S. 'Twill be one day before your first letter arrives.

P.P.S. If you believe that this email was sent to you in error (perhaps
by someone with careless fingers?) and you don't wish to receive these
free newsletters, please drop a note to unsubscribe@fool.com."

SMITHKLINE TO BUY BLOCK DRUG
The big British drug maker bolsters its consumer business.

By Tom Jacobs

British-based drug producer SmithKline Beecham (NYSE: SBH)
announced today that it would swallow New Jersey's oral products
maker Block Drug (Nasdaq: BLOCA) for $1.24 billion. SmithKline
will pay $53 a share for Block, which closed Friday at $50.63,
up 0.75%. SmithKline ended the week at $67.44, a mere 5% under
its 52-week high.

SmithKline is expanding its consumer business while competitors
such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) are shedding theirs to
focus on drugs. SmithKline already earns one-third of its
revenues from consumer products, which include Aquafresh
toothpaste, and now adds Block's Sensodyne toothpaste and
Polident denture cleaner brands. Commentators speculate that
SmithKline is keeping a consumer division to better deliver
non-prescription versions of its own drugs that have lost patent
protection, or that the Block buyout better positions SmithKline
to spin off its consumer division.

At the same time, the British drug powerhouse is pushing into
genomics: It has joined a new public-private consortium to fund
efforts to decode mouse DNA within the next six months. The $53
million Mouse Sequencing Consortium includes SmithKline,
Affymetrix (Nasdaq: AFFX), the Merck Genome Research Institute,
the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and the British-based
Wellcome Trust. Like its sibling the SNP Consortium, the Mouse
confab hopes to speed genomic data into the public domain.
Celera Genomics (NYSE: CRA) and other companies are competing to
sequence the mouse genome and SNPs (single nucleotide
polymorphisms) to sell in proprietary databases.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=147835

Surrounding these events is the pending merger of SmithKline
with larger drug maker Glaxo Wellcome (NYSE: GLX). The two await
regulatory approval to create the world's second-largest
pharmaceutical firm with a $180 billion market cap. Perhaps
because of their experience -- the Federal Trade Commission has
delayed the merger twice and now won't rule until the end of the
year -- SmithKline hasn't announced a target date to close the
Block deal.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Reuters reports that General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Fiat are
joining forces for talks to purchase some or all of ailing South
Korean car maker Daewoo. Daewoo Motor is one of 12 units of
Daewoo Group, which creditors rescued in August and seek to
shore up. Ford beat out GM in June for exclusive talks with
Daewoo, but Ford ended negotiations in September. GM and Daewoo
Motors have been around the block before -- several times. Their
15-year alliance ended in 1992.

City delivery speedsters Kozmo.com and Urbanfetch.com are
talking a Kozmo buyout again, according to The New York Times.
Kozmo has not been the most ardent suitor: It sued Urbanfetch
before it opened last year and settled out of court. The parties
have bailed from previous talks at the last minute. The Times'
sources state that the new company would hope to go public in
the next year -- if the Internet IPO market turns up.

Facing tomorrow's announcement of latest quarter earnings,
biotech drug maker Biogen (Nasdaq: BGEN) licensed five new drug
targets from genomics drug discovery company CuraGen (Nasdaq:
CRGN). Biogen has been criticized for the weakness of its drug
development pipeline, and the CuraGen deal gives Biogen a jump
start at the early stages of the pipeline -- five targets
against which to test possible drug candidates. Biogen also
announced a management realignment Friday.

A new gene bank, the First Genetic Trust, will open to allay
people's reluctance to share their genetic data with
researchers. Arthur Holden, chair of the SNP Consortium and
Mouse Consortium (see lead story above), will form the bank with
David Wang, former head of genomics and bioinformatics at
Motorola (NYSE: MOT), and Andrea Califano, former computational
biology director at IBM (NYSE: IBM). The bank would perform two
main functions designed to keep individual information private,
assuage fears that information could be used to deny employment
or insurance, and increase efficiency. The bank would provide
analysis results to researchers, but not the individual genetic
data, and patients could authorize the bank to give their
doctors access to a patient's DNA account for prescription
purposes instead of having to test patients each time.

With regards to our conversation yesterday, I am loking for basic economics 
regarding GE 7FA's.  Such as, 1. output per turbine; 2. output for 4 7FA and 
2 steam turbines; 3.  Heat Rates; and 4. cost per turbine and steam turbine.  
Total plant output will need to be 1000 MW's and will be run as a combined 
cycle facility.  If you could get me these numbers by the end of the day or 
call me to discuss what you currently have that would be great.  This project 
is not due till Wednesday.  Thanks

This week I will be arranging site visits for the bidders of Pastoria and LV 
Cogen I and II.  There will be nine bidders for each but not all are the 
same.  Before the first visit, I want to remind you of the confidential 
nature of the process and send you the Site Visit Procedures.

Confidentiality

All aspects of the bidding process are to be kept confidential.  This means 
that you must not disclose to another bidder or any other person:

the name of any bidder, or
any questions asked, or comments made, by any bidder 

If you have any questions regarding a confidentiality issue, contact me and 
Karen Jones or Dale Rasmussen. 

Site Visit Procedures

The attached Site Visit Procedures were distributed to the Phase II bidders 
last week.  Please read them carefully and follow them.  Should you have any 
questions, please call me.

Our internal site visit procedures will be as follows.   As I receive site 
visit requests, I will notify the applicable Site Visit Coordinator - Bill 
WIlliams for LVI and LVII and Sam and Dean for Pastoria - to set the time.

I will receive from each bidder, and will forward to the Site VIsit 
Coordinators, a list of attendees (with a contact number for the bidder's 
site visit coordinator) and the hotel and travel information, as applicable.

Please call me should you have any questions.  Thanks.

Ben, I have a reference document called Gas Turbine World Handbook in which I 
look up these type of answers as well for ballpark info. They are the 
""preliminary answer"" to your question and should be treated as so. Please 
keep in mind that these are numbers from a magazine, not from our internal 
Performance/Cycles group under Gary Bush (within EECC). They are the dept 
that the Dev Engineer typically consults with to arrive at a project's 
capacity and efficiency, both from a new & clean standpoint and an average 
degradation standpoint. The depts within EECC/NEPCO also come up with the 
total installed costs. It is their numbers that are the ones that we 
typically bid in a proforma, as such, they are a part of the deal approval 
process (DASH). Their buy in is important because in addition to the numbers 
that OEM's provide us, they factor in experience, judgement, unique project 
characteristics, design basis, intake/exhaust losses, etc. They also look at 
the net power for the Plant, not just the equipment itself. Having caveat'ed 
these numbers, I would respond to your questions below as follows:

1. PG7241FA Capacity: 171,700 kW each @ generator terminals (ISO conditions, 
gas fired @ baseload) -- does not include auxiliaries usage, duct losses
2. 1,060 MW Net Plant @ ISO, gas fired
3. 6,040 Btu/kWh LHV @ ISO, gas fired
4. Plug figure for GTG may be $32,500,000 each. No idea on the ST, swag at 
$175/kW. Power island turnkey for 2x1 may be $375/kW (does not include alot 
of stuff such as add'l options, development costs, tie-ins, permitting, 
spares, etc, etc, etc)

Hope this is useful to you somehow, but please go to the source (described 
above) for anything that we are going to hang our hat on.

With regards to our conversation yesterday, I am loking for basic economics 
regarding GE 7FA's.  Such as, 1. output per turbine; 2. output for 4 7FA and 
2 steam turbines; 3.  Heat Rates; and 4. cost per turbine and steam turbine.  
Total plant output will need to be 1000 MW's and will be run as a combined 
cycle facility.  If you could get me these numbers by the end of the day or 
call me to discuss what you currently have that would be great.  This project 
is not due till Wednesday.  Thanks
Ben

Thanks again for your help with this critical part of the sales process.  We 
will begin the plant site visits this Thursday.  Ben Rogers (3-7998) is 
co-ordinating this and will be contacting you.

Confidentiality

I know it goes without saying,  but all aspects of the bidding process are to 
be kept confidential.  This means that no one can disclose to another bidder 
or any other person: the name of any bidder, the number of bidders, any 
questions asked, or comments made, by any bidder. 

If you have any questions regarding a confidentiality issue, or any other 
issue please contact me or Ben or Stuart Zisman.  Please highlight this with 
the plant managers as well

Site Visit Procedures

The attached Site Visit Procedures and cover letter were distributed to the 
Round II bidders last week.  Please read them carefully and to the extent a 
bidder moves outside of them, remind them of the procedures and have the 
bidder redirect the question to our banker, Credit Suisse First Boston.  
Should you have any questions, please call me.  

Also, you should have received a copy of the Information Memorandum that went 
out to all of the bidders.  If you don't have a copy, please call me and I 
will forward. I have also attached a copy of the presentation which each 
bidder will view online.  Please review both so that we can be consistent in 
our message.

Our internal site visit procedures will be as follows.   As Ben receives site 
visit requests, he will notify you all to establish the correct Site Visit 
Co-ordinator for the plant  and to set date and time of visit.

He will receive from each bidder, and will forward to the correct Site Visit 
Co-ordinator, a list of attendees (with a contact number for the bidder's 
site visit co-ordinator) and the hotel and travel information, as applicable.

Please call me should you have any questions.  I want you all to feel very 
comfortable in your role as Site Visit Co-ordinator  Please call me with any 
questions.

Thanks.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=

program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=

=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=

the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20

? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=

Stuart -

This is the finalized DRAFT agreement with Cinergy for the maintenance of the 
Wheatland switchyard.  I recommend including it and the e-mail below in the 
due diligence.  I'll hold off on signing until we know something more on the 
sale.

Larry, Attached is the revised proposal that you and I spoke about. We have
incorporated the adjustments for meter testing and have slightly adjusted
the proposal price. Please review the modifications and if acceptable I will
mail out the signed hard copies upon receipt of your approval. Thanks for
your patience and cooperation during this development period. Hopefully in
the future if the occasion arises for us to pursue these same services, we
will have the foundation for a quick agreement,
Thanks again,
Dale

I agree that this should be included in the due diligence files but only 
after the confidentiality issue is resolved.  The portion of the contract 
dealing with confidentiality states that information designated as 
""confidential"" must be safeguarded.  It is unclear whether the agreement 
itself constitutes ""confidential"" information and therefore I would suggest 
that the counterparty be contacted in order to obtain permission to disclose 
the draft agreement.  I am nearly certain that they will not have any problem 
as they are likely to want the business from the purchaser of the facility.

BIOGEN BEATS THE STREET
Biogen, the company known for the multiple sclerosis drug
Avonex, announced estimate-beating third-quarter results
yesterday after the bell.

By LouAnn Lofton

Biotech company Biogen (Nasdaq: BGEN) reported its third-quarter
(ended September 30) results yesterday after the bell. The
company's revenues climbed by 12% to $233.7 million. Net income
for the quarter was $68.3 million, or 10% higher than the $62
million Biogen earned in the year-ago period.

Earnings per share came in ahead of estimates by a penny at
$0.44. The consensus First Call/Thompson Financial estimate for
the company was $0.43. In its third quarter last year, Biogen
earned $0.39 a share.

Biogen's main revenue driver is Avonex, a drug used in the
treatment of multiple sclerosis. For its third quarter, sales of
Avonex rose 18% to $193 million. In fiscal 1999, Avonex sales
accounted for 78% of Biogen's revenues. The company said that
more than 93,000 patients worldwide are now using the drug. It
did acknowledge in a conference call, though, that the U.S.
market for Avonex is slowing.

Avonex also faces increased overseas competition in the multiple
sclerosis drug market. Here in the U.S., Avonex is protected
from competition until 2003. Biogen is working to develop
additional drugs (which it hopes will turn into additional
sources of revenue) through projects such as collaborations with
Irish drug company Elan (NYSE: ELN). The company also recently
licensed five new drug targets from CuraGen (Nasdaq: CRGN).

Biogen's president and chief executive officer, James C. Mullen,
said, ""We continue with aggressive development of our pipeline
products. During the past quarter, we intensified our investment
in the important new platform technology of genomics and
expanded our long-term pipeline capabilities and basic research
programs with several collaborative agreements.""

NEWS TO GO

Hard driver manufacturer Seagate Technology (NYSE: SEG)
announced its fiscal 2001 first-quarter earnings yesterday after
the close. Pro forma net income for the quarter was $62 million
on revenue of $1.748 billion. Pro forma diluted earnings per
share came in at $0.26, which bested the Street's expectations
by a nickel.

PacifiCare Health Systems (Nasdaq: PHSY), a provider of managed
healthcare, told the Street yesterday that it sees its
third-quarter results coming in significantly below
expectations. The company expects earnings per share for the
third quarter to come in between breakeven and a loss of as much
as $0.10 a share. Analysts were looking for PacifiCare to report
third-quarter earnings per share of $1.90, according to First
Call/Thompson Financial. The company blamed higher-than-expected
medical costs for its shortfall.

The on-again, off-again talks between online delivery service
companies Urbanfetch.com and Kozmo.com are off again.
Urbanfetch.com said yesterday that it's halted negotiations to
be acquired by competitor Kozmo.com. Ross Stevens, the chief
executive of Urbanfetch.com, said, ""We just didn't think Kozmo
had a profitable model, and we didn't think that Urbanfetch
Express would get the attention it needed.""

Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) says that an analysis of accidents
involving its Explorer sport utility vehicles was flawed,
according to The Washington Post. The analysis, which was
carried out by the Post and reported in Monday's edition of the
paper, found that Explorers have higher rates of tire-related
crashes even when the trucks are equipped with non-recalled
Goodyear tires. The analysis was carried out by looking at which
plants produced the Explorers, and what type of tire came on the
trucks from that particular plant. According to Ford, the plants
the company originally thought were putting just Goodyear tires
on Explorers were actually putting Firestone tires on about 4%
of the vehicles. Ford's vice president of communications, Jason
Vines, was quoted as saying that this new information
""repudiates the premise of the analysis.""

 Just wanted to give everyone a update on where we were with all the site 
visits to the plants.  As you already know, site visits begin this Thursday 
and runs through the 27th of October, so its a pretty tight schedule.  In 
terms of who will be specifically covering which plants, this is the 
following: Gleason will be Dave Kristich; Lincoln will be Fred Mitro; and 
Wheatland will be Ross Newlin.  These guys will cover the site visits the 
next two weeks, but everyone else may be asked to fill in for them if needed.
  While on the site visit, please make sure that the companies do not take 
any pictures and they are only allowed to talk to you or the plant manager.  
Most of the companies will probably be there for only a couple of hours per 
day.
 I hope all of this is clear and if you have any questions about scheduling 
please give me a call.  Again, thank you for your help with these issues.

Robbie:
I was in your class that you taught for the Princeton Review at Enron just 
recently.  What I'm looking for is a private Math tutor.  I wasn't sure if I 
had to go through the Princeton Review or if I could talk directly to you.  I 
liked the way you taught the class and wanted to see if you taught one on one 
sessions. If you could let me know, I would appreciate it.  Thanks!

Here are the contents of the damaged floppy disk.  It
looks like there are multiple indices for some of the
projects.  I have included all the files, so we can sort
through to see which are the correct ones to use.  I'm
assuming that these files are not corrupted.  My machine
is too old to be able to open them.  And yet it was
sophisticated enough to recover the files.

I can only attach 5 files to an e-mail, so I'll have to
send them in multiple batches.

REDBACK RAMPS UP
The network equipment maker quadruples revenues and reports its
first pro forma profit.

By Chris Rugaber

Network equipment maker Redback Networks (Nasdaq: RBAK) reported
third-quarter results after yesterday's market close, almost
quadrupling revenues to $80.6 million from last year's $20.6
million. On a pro forma basis, Redback eked out $3.2 million in
profit, or $0.02 per share, ahead of analysts' consensus
estimates of a $0.02 per share loss.

Including costs related to its acquisitions of Siara Systems and
Abatis Systems, as well as stock compensation expenses, the
company reported a loss of $308.1 million, or $2.50 per share.

Redback makes subscriber management systems that enable telecom
service providers to handle heavy traffic on high-speed
networks, including cable, DSL, and wireless connections. The
company also recently began ramping up sales of its optical
networking products, which are being used in regional fiber
optic networks.

The company, which was a Daily Double this spring, added 70 new
customers during the quarter, bringing its total to more than
300. This is particularly important for a company like Redback,
since many small networking equipment companies rely
inordinately on only a few customers, and can get slammed if
just one or two buyers delay or cancel a purchase. This may
still be an issue for Redback, however. While the company added
Qwest Communications' (NYSE: Q) U S West unit as a new customer,
the former Baby Bell accounted for 24% of the company's revenues
in the quarter.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=152397

Redback's CFO Craig Genter told analysts in a conference call
that revenues should hit $100 million next quarter, and continue
to grow 20% each quarter next year. As a result, the company
expects sales to hit $645 million in 2001. While such growth is
impressive, at a market cap of $19 billion, the market clearly
expects great things from the company.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Among the many companies reporting earnings last night was
Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD), which beat analysts'
consensus estimates by two pennies. The microprocessor and flash
memory maker reported net income (excluding onetime charges) of
$219 million, or $0.64 per share, and sales of $1.2 billion. For
more info, check out yesterday's news report.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=152398

Motorcycle maker Harley Davidson (NYSE: HDI) reported a solid
third quarter yesterday. Net income reached $83 million, or
$0.27 per share, a 27% increase over last year's $65.4 million,
or $0.21 per share. Sales were up 15% to $714.1 million. The
company, which makes over 25% of the heavyweight bikes sold
worldwide, shipped 48,077 motorcycles in the quarter, 13% more
than the year-earlier period, and expects to ship 203,000 this
year. However, sales did fall 38% in the company's Buell
division, which makes a lightweight bike called the Blast, and
which just maybe doesn't appeal to Harley's regular customers.
For more information on Harley Davidson, check out the Drip
Portfolio's recent analysis of the company.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=152399

Fiber optic cable and components maker Corning (NYSE: GLW)
announced yesterday that third-quarter earnings would beat
analysts' estimates, thanks to strong demand. The company
expects to report earnings per share (EPS) of $0.34-$0.35 for
the quarter, 75% above last year's figure and ahead of consensus
estimates of $0.30 per share. For more information on fiber
optics components, be sure to check out our new Internet Report
on the subject.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=152400

Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale (Nasdaq: COST) reported
a 9% increase in fourth-quarter profit yesterday. Earnings
reached $200.2 million, or $0.43 per share, 10% higher than the
$0.39 per share reached a year ago. Sales rose 20% to $10.6
billion for the quarter. Same-store sales -- sales at warehouses
open at least a year -- were up 9%.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=152401

Fast food company Tricon Global Restaurants (NYSE: YUM)
announced mixed third-quarter results last night, with net
income up 2.7% to $115 million, or $0.77 per share, ahead of
analysts' consensus estimates of $0.70. However, revenues
declined 8.5% to $1.66 billion from $1.81 billion in the
year-earlier period. The operator of Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and
KFC restaurants also reported that same-store sales rose 1% at
Pizza Hut, fell 2% at Taco Bell (probably thanks to all that
great publicity over recalled shells), and were ""little changed""
at KFC.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=152402

Finally, home improvement chain Home Depot (NYSE: HD) warned
today that third-quarter earnings will be below expectations,
thanks to lower prices for lumber and other building materials.
Profits should reach $0.28 per share, less than the $0.31 per
share expected by analysts. Same-store sales should increase 4%,
below the 5% to 7% the company previously forecasted.

Hey Mike:
Marlon and Marissa's wedding was alot of fun.  Megan and I sat at the married 
table, which had Pete and Amy Fullem, Kit and her husband, Marc, Sammy and 
her husband, Jon and Dana Corpina, Dana Schuster and her husband - so as you 
can see it was pretty interesting.  The other table was Mike, OB, Choby, 
Tina, and Patty Donahue.  Mike, OB, Choby, Patty, Megan and I took a limo 
from the city to the wedding and had the limo tell 12:00, then went out till 
5:00am.  I love going to that evil city, but I love leaving it even better.  
Overall, it was fun and seems like everyone is doing well.  Dana and Jon just 
had their baby, its a girl.  I also ended up seeing Alan Waugh and Tim 
Hurley.  Hurley has gained about 200 pounds - the man is huge.  Anyway, I 
hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.

Ben,

Thanks for the briefing.  We have your file here and I will add this
information so we have a complete ""story"".  Good luck with the GMAT and
keep in contact.

Jennifer:
     Thank you for the response and the update.  The news that Dr,
Harris
had left was news to me, since I had not received an auto-reply message.
Just to let you know, Dr Harris and I had talked quite a bit last year
about my application status.  I had also talked to many of the Finance
Professors, particularly Professor Sheridan Titman about the program and
my
application status.  Both Professor Titman and Dr Harris suggested that
I
take a finance class as well as retake the GMAT.  Due to my documented
learning disability, I am trying to receive a ""special testing status""
from
GMAC and then re-take the GMAT.
     I hope this brief ""download"" of my previous conversations with Dr.
Harris and others at the Business School has helped.   I hope all is
going
well with the new school year and I look forward to hearing from you in
the
near future.

Regards,

Ben Rogers"

Subject: Re:  

Ben, I have a reference document called Gas Turbine World Handbook in which I 
look up these type of answers as well for ballpark info. They are the 
""preliminary answer"" to your question and should be treated as so. Please 
keep in mind that these are numbers from a magazine, not from our internal 
Performance/Cycles group under Gary Bush (within EECC). They are the dept 
that the Dev Engineer typically consults with to arrive at a project's 
capacity and efficiency, both from a new & clean standpoint and an average 
degradation standpoint. The depts within EECC/NEPCO also come up with the 
total installed costs. It is their numbers that are the ones that we 
typically bid in a proforma, as such, they are a part of the deal approval 
process (DASH). Their buy in is important because in addition to the numbers 
that OEM's provide us, they factor in experience, judgement, unique project 
characteristics, design basis, intake/exhaust losses, etc. They also look at 
the net power for the Plant, not just the equipment itself. Having caveat'ed 
these numbers, I would respond to your questions below as follows:

1. PG7241FA Capacity: 171,700 kW each @ generator terminals (ISO conditions, 
gas fired @ baseload) -- does not include auxiliaries usage, duct losses
2. 1,060 MW Net Plant @ ISO, gas fired
3. 6,040 Btu/kWh LHV @ ISO, gas fired
4. Plug figure for GTG may be $32,500,000 each. No idea on the ST, swag at 
$175/kW. Power island turnkey for 2x1 may be $375/kW (does not include alot 
of stuff such as add'l options, development costs, tie-ins, permitting, 
spares, etc, etc, etc)

Hope this is useful to you somehow, but please go to the source (described 
above) for anything that we are going to hang our hat on.

With regards to our conversation yesterday, I am loking for basic economics 
regarding GE 7FA's.  Such as, 1. output per turbine; 2. output for 4 7FA and 
2 steam turbines; 3.  Heat Rates; and 4. cost per turbine and steam turbine.  
Total plant output will need to be 1000 MW's and will be run as a combined 
cycle facility.  If you could get me these numbers by the end of the day or 
call me to discuss what you currently have that would be great.  This project 
is not due till Wednesday.  Thanks
Ben

I wanted to reply, even though I have called recently.  Work has slowed down 
a little bit, but will probably pick up in a week or two.  I have traded 
calls with Kara the past two days, so I haven't talked to her in some time.  
Anyway, I hope your figuring out where we should go for a trip this sping.  
We will have to know whether Megan and I need to work on our golf games or 
not.  We have been thinking maybe you guys are thinking about going to 
Ireland or England to play some of the old courses of this world.  Or maybe 
you have been thinking about going to Paris to visit the city of love.   
Anyway, these are just some of the thinks we have been thinking about.  Talk 
to you soon.
Love 
Ben"

GATEWAY BUSTS OUT WITH STRONG Q3
The personal computer maker reported third-quarter earnings
after the close yesterday, reaffirming its beyond-the-box
strategy.

By Mike Trigg

Personal computer (PC) maker Gateway (NYSE: GTW) announced
earnings in line with Street expectations after the market's
close yesterday, citing strong consumer and small business sales
and continued growth in Europe. After warnings from stalwart
technology firms Intel (Nasdaq: INTC), Dell (Nasdaq: DELL), and
Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) sent PC stocks tumbling in recent weeks,
the news was an affirmation of the company's beyond-the-box
business strategy.

Gateway reported fiscal third-quarter (ended September 30) net
income of $152.6 million, or $0.46 per share, compared to $113.2
million, or $0.35 per share, one year ago. A quick look at
profits shows this was its third consecutive quarter of 30%-plus
net income growth.

On the revenue side, the San Diego, Ca. company reported sales
of $2.53 billion, an increase of 16% from $2.18 billion in the
same period a year ago. As a percentage of sales, gross margins
improved one percentage point from the year-ago period to 23.1%.
Here, we begin to see the effect of the company's strategy of
diversifying its product offering.

More than 50% of sales from the quarter came from hardware,
software, and services other than the PC. This exceeded company
expectations, which called for 45% by the end of the fourth
quarter. By gaining traction with its beyond-the-box strategy,
the company sets itself up for further margin expansion. Non-PC
products and services are high-margin businesses, thus allowing
a greater proportion of sales to trickle down to the bottom
line. CFO John Todd discussed this subject in the conference
call last night, noting the company sees a day when the majority
of revenues come from products and services outside the box.

Internationally, revenues in the Middle East, Europe, and Africa
increased 13%. The company indicated that, without currency
difficulties, top-line growth would have seen a 27%
year-over-year improvement. Moreover, Gateway's Asia Pacific arm
saw an 8% growth in revenue and was adversely affected by
problems with suppliers of disk drives, which have since been
solved.

This quarter was especially good for Gateway. Next quarter is
typically its strongest, and the company is comfortable with the
consensus estimate calling for 48% profit growth. The consumer
segment and software revenue related to the PC will continue to
drive growth in coming quarters
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Internet router provider Juniper Networks (Nasdaq: JNPR)
announced fiscal third-quarter net income of $58.2 million, or
$0.17 per share, compared to a loss of $1.6 million, or $0.01
per share, year-over-year. The Street consensus called for the
company to earn $0.09 per share. Revenue was $201.2 million, a
78% sequential increase. CEO Scott Kriens cited strong demand
among service providers to handle the increased amount of
Internet traffic. The company directly competes with Cisco
(Nasdaq: CSCO) and is gaining serious market traction in the
space, which apparently hasn't been affected by the technology
slowdown.

Data availability software provider Veritas (Nasdaq: VRTS)
reported better-than-expected earnings after the market's close
yesterday, citing continued international strength, steady
revenue, and market share growth in the Windows NT space, and
expansion of its Unix business. Veritas' fiscal third-quarter
net income excluding adjustments was $70.3 million, or $0.16 per
share, compared to $38.9 million, or $0.09 per share, a year
ago. The Street consensus called for the company to earn $0.14
per share. CFO Ken Lonchar added in a prepared release that the
company continues to see strong growth of its Hewlett-Packard
(NYSE: HWP) business.

Internet advertising company DoubleClick (Nasdaq: DCLK)
announced third-quarter earnings after the close yesterday in
line with Street expectations. The company's net income totaled
$3.7 million, or $0.03 per share, versus a loss of $3.8 million,
or $0.03 per share, in the year-ago period. Revenues were $135.2
million, compared to $75.3 million. Specifically, the media unit
reported revenue of $64.3 million, an 86% increase. The number
of advertisers fell 10% from the prior quarter. Moreover, it
maintained a bearish outlook for the rest of the year, adding
that current conditions likely won't change till the second
quarter of next year.

Communications chip maker PMC-Sierra (Nasdaq: PMCS) reported
that fiscal third-quarter profits had tripled, citing strong
sales to makers of computer networking gear. The company also
forecasted that sales would rise 15% in the next period. Net
income excluding onetime items was $56 million, or $0.31 per
share, compared to $18.7 million, or $0.11 per share,
year-over-year. The Street consensus called for $0.26 per share.
Revenue came in at $198.1 million versus the year-ago figure of
$82.5 million. The company added a number of acquisitions in
order to expand its broadband and communications expertise and
serve larger markets this quarter. Purchases include Malleable
Technologies, Quantum Effect Devices, and Datum Telegraphic.

2. The Management Presentations (with audio) have now been posted to

? The Associate/Analyst Participants have been selected this year to be the 
pilot group to utilize a new software package that Enron has purchased.  Your 
input and participation is important in piloting this new environment.  Your 
answers will be compiled with the rest of Enron.  In order to pilot the 
functionality of this new software, the Program Participants will be 
accessing the survey through a different URL, which will be distributed in an 
email message. 

Once again, it's time to find out what you think about your work experience 
at Enron and what we can do to help make it better.  That's why we want to 
check your pulse.  In fact, we've changed the name of last year's ""Excellence 
Through Communication"" employee survey to The Pulse.  We believe The Pulse 
more accurately captures the purpose of the survey.  Your diagnosis will help 
us correct problem areas so we can continue to make Enron a great place to 
work.

There are a few things we want you to remember about ""The Pulse.""

1. Your survey responses will be confidential.

2. We will respond actively to your comments.  We are going to do our best 
to  cure some of the current problems that exist and put into action 
preventative   processes that will help identify smaller problems before they 
become major ones.   We will be asking people for help in resolving some of 
the issues that are collected  in the survey - your active role will help us 
identify the best solutions.

So take a few minutes to check your pulse and tell us what you think and how 
you feel about your job and about Enron.

We look forward to hearing from you."

Tom Swank, the originator and I sat down with Bruce Golden and went through 
the porject cost numbers for the GE 7FA combined cycle facility.  At this 
point we need to claculate FOM and VOM and other operating expenses.  We feel 
pretty good about the project cost numbers.  Let me know if you need more

CHEVRON GUZZLES TEXACO
Two U.S. oil powers agreed this weekend to form the world's
fourth-largest oil and gas company.

By Tom Jacobs

The Texaco (NYSE: TX) board yesterday approved Chevron's (NYSE:
CHV) $35.1 billion stock purchase offer. The deal between the
No. 2 and No. 3 U.S. oil companies would create the
fourth-largest world oil and gas concern, Chevron Texaco, and
increase competition for world leader Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM).

Chevron will pay 0.77 of a share for each Texaco share and
assume $8 billion in debt, for a total of $45.4 billion. The
per-share price -- slightly higher than the 0.765 that Chevron
offered in 1999 talks that stalled -- values Texaco at $64.87,
an 18% premium to its Friday close of $55.13. Chevron
shareholders will have 61% control of Chevron Texaco and nine of
the 15 board seats.

Attention immediately focused on regulatory and political
obstacles to the marriage. The new company would have major
control of West Coast refining capacity and gas stations. Middle
East upheavals could bring political scrutiny as well. But the
new company's $85 billion market capitalization appears puny
compared to BP Amoco's (NYSE: BP) $207 billion, and the smaller
Chevron Texaco would arguably pose less of a threat to world gas
prices.

Texaco abruptly broke off prior merger talks in June 1999,
allegedly due to bad chemistry between former Chevron CEO
Kenneth Derr and Texaco Chairman Peter Bijur. Derr has since
retired. The new CEO, David O'Reilly, assumed command nine
months ago and reportedly has good relations with Bijur,
including several golf dates. Reilly would be CEO of the new
combined entity and Bijur would stay on as number two.

The deal came just days after Texaco purchased General Motors'
(NYSE: GM) interest in GM Ovonic, a joint venture between GM and
Ovonic Battery Company, a subsidiary of Energy Conversion
Devices (Nasdaq: ENER). Ovonic Battery was the originator of
nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries for electric and hybrid
vehicles. The joint venture develops production and
manufacturing processes to commercialize the NiMH battery
technology for use in 2003 model year cars. Texaco's share of
the joint venture is 50%, adding to its 20% ownership of Energy
Conversion Devices. There is no information whether the Chevron
purchase will affect this deal.

All told, the deal looks good for Texaco. Though both companies'
revenues are approximately $36 billion, Texaco's profits are 60%
of Chevron's. On Friday's huge up day, Texaco closed at $55.13,
off $1.88, while Chevron shed $3.06 to finish at $84.25.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

European regulators switched course Friday and approved
Vivendi's (NYSE: V) $34 billion acquisition of Canada's Seagram
(NYSE: VO), after the European Commission indicated it might
subject the deal to a time-consuming further investigation. The
key shift occurred when Vivendi agreed not to discriminate
against competitors seeking access to Seagram's Universal unit's
film and music libraries. Observers are surprised that this deal
practically flew by in comparison with the five-month probe of
the Time Warner (NYSE: TWX)-America Online (NYSE: AOL) deal.

Qualcomm's (Nasdaq: QCOM) on-again, off-again affair with China
Unicom over increased Chinese penetration of Qualcomm's CDMA
(code division multiple access) wireless technology is back on.
The companies announced that they will join Shenzhen Zhongxing
Telecom, the leading Chinese CDMA phone equipment manufacturer,
to produce a CDMA handset for sale in China. A cool feature is
that it allows users to remove subscriber identification module
cards and switch phones, and retain their number and service.
Would be a good idea for the U.S., wouldn't it? Dream on.

Continental Airlines (NYSE: CAL) announced today third-quarter
earnings of $2.24 a share, a 54% jump over last year. This
exceeded First Call consensus estimates of $2.19 a share (click
here for a Foolish take on earnings estimates). The company
trumpeted its 22nd consecutive profitable quarter. Passenger
revenue increased in every geographic market, ranging from 12.2%
domestically and 27.9% for transatlantic traffic.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=155936

Continental may be smiling, but Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL)
isn't. Its pilots' contract proposal seeks huge pay increases
and parity with pilots for United Airlines (NYSE: UAL). The
pilots agreed in 1996 to a 2% pay cut and other work concessions
to assist Delta's turnaround. They now want 30-49% raises over
three years, which would bring basic pay for a 777 captain with
12 years experience to $267,600. (Would we feel safer?) Gregg
Holm, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, called
this ""United [Airlines] plus.""

Good Morning!
Wanted to see how this quarters earnings report was going to look like.  Many 
of analyst are reporting that its going to be around $.57 for the qtr.  Hope 
you guys beat that estimate.  By the way, how did that deal go that you were 
working on with the company down here?  I saw that Convergent was bought by 
an independent oil and gas company from Houston.  It's up big today.  Hope 
all is going well and that you might give me a call before the end of the 
year.  Thanks!

Jinsung and Don,

We are continuing to have difficulties accessing data from DealBench.  The
response times from PECO, PricewaterhouseCoopers and other high speed
internet connections have been very slow (sometimes 5 minutes or more to
retrieve a single 10-15 page text document).  It would help us greatly in
our due diligence efforts if this material could be made available on CD
ROM as has often been done with other deals we have been involved with.
Please advise if this is possible and if so, when the CD's would be
available.

BROADVISION SAYS, ""THANK YOU, PAINEWEBBER""
BroadVision lands on the S&P 500. Index fund managers set
phasers to &""Buy.""

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

""Thank you, PaineWebber!""

That's the heartfelt gratitude coming from the BroadVision
(Nasdaq: BVSN) camp this morning after the e-commerce software
specialist was named the latest addition to the S&P 500.

The vacancy sign lit up after German financial titan UBS (NYSE:
UBS) agreed to acquire index member PaineWebber (NYSE: PWJ), the
fourth-largest domestic brokerage services company. The
transition will take place on Monday.

In a world where quality companies are acquired or fade away,
next week's index adjustment is hardly a rare event. Turnover
comes with the territory. There have been 178 company changes
within the S&P 500 over the pas five years, with no less than
two dozen switches in any given year during that time.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=157948

The process isn't that far removed from such events as getting
into a hot New York City nightspot during peak party hours or
landing Green Bay Packers season tickets. Someone has to bow out
first, by will or misconduct, and then the thorough selection
process begins. Making it to the end of the velvet rope or the
top of the waiting list is an honor. While BroadVision's shares
are nearly 75% off their March highs, the index inclusion
provides some sort of market validation.

Since the S&P 500 is a weighted index, BroadVision's new role
may seem inconsequential. The stock will make up just 0.05% (or
1/2,000th) of the index's total market capitalization. But the
numbers add up in a hurry. With speculators trying to jump the
gun before the index-based vehicles adjust their portfolios, the
buy orders should be streaming in this week. For instance, the
$105 billion Vanguard 500 Index Fund alone will have to buy up
at least a $50 million stake in BroadVision come Monday.

So PaineWebber, whose mutual funds were ranked 100 out of 101
fund families by SmartMoney this year, finally found a way to
enrich investors -- BroadVision's shareholders.

NEWS TO GO

Earning disappointments are a disease and McAfee (Nasdaq: MCAF)
has the cure. The anti-virus software company reported a
narrower loss than expected (before non-cash charges) on an 86%
spike in revenues. Users have taken to safe computing as a
result of well-publicized viral outbreaks such as the ""I Love
You"" virus earlier this year. Traffic at the McAfee site has now
grown to 400,000 daily, and the company has lined up 650,000
paying subscribers. McAfee is majority-owned by Network
Associates (Nasdaq: NETA), which also announced
better-than-expected earnings.

From a whisper number to a scream, shares of chip maker Altera
(Nasdaq: ALTR) should open lower this morning after the company
reported third-quarter results. While the $0.28-a-share showing
was in line with estimates, it came a penny shy of Wall Street's
whisper number. If no one wants to step in and pick up shares at
half the price they were fetching just last month, Altera will.
The company doubled its buyback plans from 24 million shares to
48 million. That means that as much as 9% of the outstanding
stock might be bought back in the open market.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=157950

Drive-in theaters might have become flea market stomping
grounds, but drive-in restaurants are motoring.
Burger-to-your-car chain Sonic (Nasdaq: SONC) closed out a
strong fiscal 2000 with earnings of $1.75 a share. The fast-food
firm earned $1.41 the year before. Unit production remains
lettuce-crisp. Sonic has grown same-store sales for 14
consecutive years now.

Merrill Lynch (NYSE: MER) reported analyst-topping earnings
despite a slowdown in its investment banking division. Earnings
climbed by 52% to $0.94 a share -- eight pennies above projections.
With tensions running high given recent market volatility, the
company was able to grow commissions to 26% of quarterly revenues.
In boxing terms, this is a TKO.

Historians marvel at Galileo, and now Marvell Tech (Nasdaq:
MRVL) wants Galileo Tech (Nasdaq: GALT). In a $2.7 billion
proposed stock swap, Marvell will offer 0.674 of a share for
each share of the Israeli semiconductor company. Though the
original Galileo -- 17th century Italian philosopher and
astronomer Galileo Galilei -- was an independent thinker,

Ben,
Are you loking more for focused refresher work?
I can certainly try and get something set up. The main problem I may have is
staffing.
I will send out an email to my GMAT instructors and find out if my really
good teachers have any time outside of their jobs and teaching. Evenings are
best? How about your weekends? When are you planning on re-testing?
I will return your call as soon as I can. We are a little short staffed so I
am on the phone a bit more than normal.
Thanks!
Amy

Amy:
I called a while back to get into the Enron class which you helped me get
into and I just recently left you a message to take private sessions from
the Princeton Review.  I have realized that I need  one on one  sessions to
help me really prepare for the GMAT.  If you can point me in the right
direction, I would greatly appreciate it.  I was looking to start sessions
as soon as possible. Again, thanks for your help with this issue.

Thanks for the reply.  I can understand your position.  I am looking more for 
a refresher course.  I am planning on taking it around mid December or as 
late as mid January.  I am beginning to start studying again on my own, but I 
wanted to get a little more help.  Thanks for your call!

Gentlemen,

Attached is a list of due diligence questions for the Enron generation
assets (Wheatland, Lincoln, Gleason and LV Cogen).  We would very much
appreciate your help is getting answers for by Friday, 10/20 if possible.

Unfortunately, we are still having significant difficulty in accessing
documents on DealBench.  The download time is usually several minutes to a
half hour per document and often the larger documents will not fully print
out on our systems.  Two of our consultants have experienced similar
difficulties which suggests that whatever problems we are facing are not
unique to systems at PECO.

We are concerned that the limited information will impact our ability to
bid on the assets.  Would it be possible to receive from you either a print
out of the documents or the documents on CD ROM?

Mike Cazaubon

How did you do on the test you took right after your class ended?
Because if you are interested in refreshing and are within the guarantee,
you can sit through again for free and get extra help from your instructor.
You have the right to re-take the course as long as you have taken all of
your practice tests, attended all classes or made up if you missed, done all
homework and took your actual exam within 30 days.
If you did all of that and are unhappy with your score for whatever
reason....you can repeat for free. I have classes starting Nov. 18 here at
the office that I can get you into and you could test either in late January
when they end or if you feel comfident before that then certainly
mid-January.
Let me know what you think.

Bruce did give us project cost numbers and I will have him e-mail them to 
you.  Also, you and I already went through the project eval. form on USEC.  
Tom and I were trying to get numbers by Wednesday, but give me a call once 
you get the project cost numbers.  Thanks for your help with this project.

This is to confirm that the engineering drawings on CD-ROM have been FedEx'ed 
to you for the Gleason and Wheatland plants.  We're hopeful to make the last

Charlie:
 It was a pleasure meeting you yesterday afternoon at the Columbia Business 
School information session.  As you probably noticed through my enthusiasm, I 
really enjoy working in the energy-finance industry, especially with Enron.  
Working in this sector, at this time, has created many new opportunities.  I 
am interested in talking with you to see if we can do some type of 
transaction with you guys.  It sounds like you have a lot going in areas that 
we might be interested in.  If you could send me a business proposal or 
summary of what your doing, that would be helpful.  
 With regards to Columbia Business School, I applied last year and did not 
get in due to my GMAT score.  I decided to take a graduate level finance 
class this summer, which I received an A.  I am currently taking another 
graduate finance class this semester.  I am also retaking the GMAT, with the 
hopes of increasing my quantitative score.  
 Last year, I was asked back for an interview, which I felt was a good sign.  
I heard from one of my recommenders that the only thing that I needed to 
improve on was my GMAT score.  Recently, I wrote a brief letter to the Dean 
of Admissions, Linda Meehan, informing her of my recent actions as well as my 
continued interest with Columbia.  I hope that these actions will help me get 
into Columbia this year.  My desire to go to Columbia, stems from their 
network, location, reputation and curriculum.  Since growing up in Pelham,  
it would be nice to get back to New York for a little while.
 As you can see, my desire to go to Columbia is very strong.  I hope this 
brief e-mail has provided some insight into what I'm doing to get into 
Columbia.  I hope we can meet for lunch sometime soon either up in the 
Woodlands or downtown.  Again, thank you for your interest and I look forward 
to talking with you about Columbia and future energy transactions.
Regards,

Ben Rogers"

COPPER MOUNTAIN GETS HALVED
Copper Mountain, the provider of digital subscriber line
solutions, reported its Q3 earnings yesterday, along with some
bad news about its Q4.

By LouAnn Lofton

Digital subscriber line (DSL) solutions provider Copper Mountain
Networks (Nasdaq: CMTN) announced its third-quarter results
yesterday after the bell. The company also provided some
guidance for its fourth quarter and for its next fiscal year
that sent its stock tumbling more than 50% to around $12 in
after-hours trading. Copper Mountain closed in regular trading
yesterday at $26.88, far below the 52-week high it reached back
in July of $125.72.

For its third quarter, Copper Mountain had revenues of $93.5
million, 192% ahead of the $32 million it earned in the same
quarter a year ago. Pro forma net income, which excludes two
charges, was $15.8 million. The company's net income last year
in the third quarter was $5.3 million.

Copper Mountain's pro forma earnings per diluted share came in a
penny ahead of the consensus estimate at $0.27. Third-quarter
earnings per share a year ago were $0.09.

Now, for the stuff that sent the company's stock plummeting in
after-hours trading. Rick Gilbert, Copper Mountain's president
and chief executive officer, said, ""In light of recent
reductions in capital expenditure forecasts from many of our
CLEC [Competitive Local Exchange Carriers] customers, we expect
revenue and earnings to decline in the fourth quarter of 2000 on
a sequential basis.""

Just how big will the ""decline"" be? Copper Mountain now expects
sales to be $60 million for the fourth quarter. It sees pro
forma earnings per share coming in between $0.04 and $0.06.
Analysts had been looking for $0.28 a share.

Gilbert went on to talk about his company's expected fiscal 2001
results. While pointing out that giving guidance that far out is
very difficult, he said he expects sales for fiscal 2001 to be
between $300 million and $330 million. Earnings per share should
be between $0.16 and $0.25. Street analysts were expecting $1.37
a share for Copper Mountain's fiscal 2001.

AFTER-HOURS COVERAGE

INTEL VS. ADVANCED MICRO
By Brian Lund
Intel's revenue warning in September turned out to be cosmetic.
Revenue growth was still strong, margins improved meaningfully,
and earnings came in at original expectations. Intel continues
to dominate its main competitor, AMD.
FULL STORY
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=159576
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

RF Micro Devices (Nasdaq: RFMD), the wireless communications
amplifying chip maker, announced its second-quarter earnings
yesterday, and also talked about its expected third-quarter
results. For its Q2, the company met estimates with $0.10 a
share. Net income was $17.7 million on revenues of $102.2
million. Last year in the second quarter, RF Micro Devices
earned $12.5 million on revenues of $68.9 million, or $0.07. The
company then said it was lowering expectations for the third
quarter because of low demand for its products, as well as
product delays. It expects earnings per share to be between
$0.04 and $0.05 a share. Analysts were looking for $0.11 a
share.

International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) reported its
third-quarter earnings after the market's close yesterday. Sales
grew by 3% to $21.8 billion. This wasn't enough to satisfy
analysts, who were looking for sales to come in at $22.4
billion. Net income for the quarter rose to $2 billion, from
$1.7 billion in the same quarter last year. Earnings per share
were $1.08, versus $0.90 a share last year. This EPS number met
the consensus estimate as reported by First Call/Thompson
Financial. IBM blamed at least some of the weak revenue growth
on an anemic euro. The company claimed its sales would have
risen 6% without those negative currency effects.

Chip maker Xilinx (Nasdaq: XLNX) announced its second-quarter
earnings yesterday after the bell. The company's revenues grew
83% to $437.4 million, from $238.8 million in its second quarter
last year. Net income was $114.1 million, compared to $59.2
million a year ago. Earnings per share beat the consensus
estimate by two cents, coming in at $0.32, versus $0.17 last
year.

Handspring (Nasdaq: HAND) reported its first-quarter results
yesterday afternoon. The company's loss was narrower than
expected. Excluding some deferred stock compensation costs,
Handspring lost $8 million, or $0.08 a share. Analysts polled by
First Call/Thompson Financial expected it to lose $0.12 a share.
Including those costs, the company lost $0.17 a share, or $16.4
million. Handspring's revenues for the quarter were $70.5
million.

Covad Communications Group (Nasdaq: COVD) announced its
third-quarter earnings results yesterday. Revenues were $66.7
million, compared to revenues in the year-ago period of $19.1
million. Covad's net loss was $189.9 million, versus a loss of
$54.1 million the year before. The company's net loss of $1.22
per share was greater than the consensus estimate of $1.18 per
share. In Covad's third quarter last year, it lost $0.47 a
share. Covad's chief executive officer, Robert Knowling, pointed
to his company's clients as the reason the shortfall. ""Due to
the weakness in the capital markets, nine of our channel
partners have experienced financing difficulties and have
slipped in their ability to stay current with their accounts
receivable. To conservatively account for this, despite billing
$78.1 million in revenue for the third quarter, only $66.7
million was recorded.""

Ben, When do you need an O&M estimate by and what are your accuracy 
requirements? I have a couple other projects in the hopper that I'm working 
on now. For an accuracy of +/- 25%, I can have you numbers by this 
Friday/Monday timeframe. If you require +/- 10% accuracy, I would need until 
next Thursday/Friday timeframe (2/18) assuming good information is available. 
For this type accuracy, we're also going to need to know about water 
source/treatment, plant design, etc. From talking with Bruce Golden, my guess 
is that we are not there yet on design so you may be looking for the +/- 25% 
accuracy estimate for now. FYI, Bruce Golden is also filling in an eval form. 
thanks and regards, Scot

Bruce did give us project cost numbers and I will have him e-mail them to 
you.  Also, you and I already went through the project eval. form on USEC.  
Tom and I were trying to get numbers by Wednesday, but give me a call once 
you get the project cost numbers.  Thanks for your help with this project.

Thanks for the quick reply.  I live within inside the loop on Buffalo 
Speedway near 59.  I think lunch next week sometime would be great.  I can 
come up to the Woodlands and we can meet up for lunch.  Let me check to see 
what day is best and I will send you an e-mail later today to confirm.  Hope 
that works and I'll talk to you soon.

ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. I've just learned that Levi Strauss is a private company,
so I can't buy shares of it. What other major companies are
privately held?

-- A. Take a gander at these biggies: Cargill, Mars, Bertelsmann
AG, Bechtel, Publix Supermarkets, IKEA International, Amway,
Penske, S.C. Johnson & Sons, Montgomery Ward Holding Co.,
Packard Bell NEC, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Hallmark Cards, Borden,
McCain Foods, Hyatt, Hechinger and Domino's Pizza. Some of these
firms offer shares to employees, but individual investors are
out of luck.

-- Q. I've noticed that stocks jump in price when they're added
to the S&P 500 Index. Why is this, and is there any way to learn
which companies will be added in the future?

-- A. You've noticed correctly. When it was announced recently
that America Online would be added to the S&P 500, its shares
quickly rose about 12 percent.

Stocks get added to these indexes to replace ones deemed no
longer worthy of being included, or ones that have merged with
other companies and therefore disappear. The announcements draw
the attention of investors, sending share prices up. And once
the companies are added, index funds that will have to own these
stocks begin snapping up shares.

Unfortunately, the stocks begin moving as soon as the
announcements are made, before they're even officially added. So
there's little time to sneak in and benefit. But if you've
invested in high-quality, growing companies, chances are you may
eventually see some of them added to important indexes.

_________________________________________________________________


INVESTING BASICS - STOCK SPLITS

Wondering whether to buy a stock before or after a split is like
asking, ""Should I eat this peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich
before or after Mom cuts it in half?

Stocks don't become more inexpensive when they split. True, you
get more shares. But each is worth less. Imagine you own 100
shares of Sisyphus Transport Corp. (ticker: UPDWN). They're
trading at $60 each and total $6,000. When Sisyphus splits
2-for-1, you'll own 200 shares, worth about $30 each. Total
value: (drum roll, please) $6,000. Yawn.

Some people drool over stocks about to split, thinking the price
will surge. Stock prices sometimes do pop a little on news of
splits. But these are artificial moves, sustainable only if the
businesses grow to justify them. The real reason to smile at a
split announcement is because it signals that management is
bullish. They're not likely to split their stock if they expect
the price to go down.

Splits come in many varieties, such as 3-for-2 or 4-for-1.
There's even a ""reverse split,"" when you end up with fewer
shares, with each worth more. Reverse splits are usually
employed by companies in trouble, to avoid looking like the
penny stocks they are. If a stock is trading at a
red-flag-raising $2 per share and it does a reverse 1-for-10
split, the price will rise to $20 and those who held 100 shares
will then own 10.

Companies often split their stock so that the price will remain
psychologically appealing. Sometimes, not splitting would mean
that few people could afford even a single share. If Microsoft
hadn't split seven times in the last decade, each share would be
worth more than $6,500.

With stocks, just as with any purchase, examine what you're
getting for the price. Study the company and compare the stock
price to other numbers, such as earnings. A low price might be
inviting, but a $200 stock can be much more of a bargain than a
$20 one. If your funds are limited, you can just buy fewer
shares.

It's always fun to suddenly own more shares, but splits are like
getting change for a dollar. They're not cause for celebration.

NOKIA TO THE RESCUE
The leading mobile phone maker reports estimate-beating earnings
and an optimistic outlook for sales of its mobile handsets.

By Chris Rugaber

Finnish mobile handset manufacturer and Rule Maker Nokia (NYSE:
NOK) reported third-quarter earnings this morning, coming in
significantly higher than analysts' expectations. The company
also issued positive forecasts for next quarter and for mobile
phone sales in 2001. Nokia was scheduled to report earnings next
week, but apparently decided to do so earlier in response to the
recent volatility in technology and telecom shares.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=161169

Sales rose 50% over last year's third quarter to 7.57 billion
euros ($6.38 billion), while net income jumped 40% to 892
million euros ($752.22 million), or 0.19 per share. Pretax
profit increased 43% to 1.34 billion euros ($1.13 billion),
ahead of analysts' forecasts of 1.06 billion.

Nokia's shares had declined about 40% since the company's July
warning that third-quarter profit would be lower than the second
quarter's, due to product delays. Today's report, and the
company's optimistic outlook, reversed that trend, with shares
up 18% in European trading.

Mobile phone sales, which account for almost three-quarters of
the company's revenues, increased 59%, while operating profits
for the division were up 42% to 1.07 billion euros ($900
million). Operating margin decreased to 19.6%, from 21.9%,
though the company remains far ahead of No. 2 mobile phone maker
Motorola (NYSE: MOT), which recently posted a 6% operating
margin for its cell phone division.

Nokia introduced seven new handset models in the third quarter,
and the company believes it increased its handset market share,
which stood at 27.5% at the end of the second quarter. Motorola
controlled 15.6% and Ericsson (Nasdaq: ERICY), which reports
earnings tomorrow, held 10.3%.

While other mobile phone companies, such as Motorola and
Matsushita, have reduced their projections for industrywide
handset sales, Nokia maintained a positive outlook. ""Our view of
the market development fundamentals remains unchanged, with more
than 400 million mobile phones estimated to be sold in 2000,""
said CEO Jorma Olilla in a prepared statement. ""For 2001 we
expect the mobile phone market to be in the region of 550
million units."" Olilla also stated that as a result of these
figures, the company expects there will be 1 billion mobile
phone users by 2002.

Sales in the company's wireless infrastructure unit were also
strong, with revenues up 34% to 1.92 billion euros and operating
margins improving to 18.1% from 17.3%. Overall, the company
expects ""record-breaking"" earnings per share (EPS) for the
fourth quarter, and 25-35% sales growth in 2001.

AFTER-HOURS COVERAGE

TECH HEAVIES REPORT EARNINGS
By The Motley Fool Staff
A number of top companies reported earnings last night after the
bell. Check out our after-hours coverage for news on Microsoft
(Nasdaq: MSFT), Akamai (Nasdaq: AKAM), America Online (NYSE:
AOL), Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), and several other companies, many
that don't begin with A.
FULL STORY>>

_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Network switch-maker Extreme Networks (Nasdaq: EXTR) announced
first-quarter fiscal 2001 earnings last night, clocking in with
net income (excluding amortization costs) of $9 million, or
$0.08 per share, ahead of analysts' estimates of $0.06 share,
and double the year-ago figure of $4 million, or $0.04 per
share. Sales were up 29% sequentially to $119.3 million, 153%
higher than last year's third-quarter revenue of $47.2 million.
Shares of the company fell initially in after-hours trading, but
rebounded after the company increased its earnings forecasts for
fiscal 2001 and 2002.

Communications chip designer Broadcom (Nasdaq: BRCM) joined the
earnings parade after yesterday's market close. Sales for the
company's third quarter more than doubled, to $319.6 million,
while earnings (excluding acquisition and other costs) jumped to
$78.7 million, or $0.30 per share, from last year's $28.7
million, or $0.12 per share. Consensus analysts' estimates were
for the company to earn $0.24 per share. Broadcom designs chips
for cable modems, digital set-top boxes, and other high-speed
networking equipment.

Wireless communications software company Phone.com (Nasdaq:
PHCM) also reported earnings last night, and the developer of
the Wireless Application Protocol, or WAP, increased revenues
62% sequentially, to $46.5 million. The company's net loss,
excluding amortization and other costs, was $10.4 million, or
$0.13 per diluted share, ahead of consensus estimates for a
$0.20 per share loss. Phone.com's new partner, Software.com
(Nasdaq: SWCM), with which it expects to merge next month, also
announced earnings. Sales reached $37.6 million, a 27%
sequential increase, and earnings before acquisition and other
costs were $7.4 million, or $0.13 per share, ahead of estimates
of $0.03 per share.

And now for some non-earnings news: According to a Bloomberg
report, telecom carrier WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOM) is planning to
create a tracking stock for its consumer long-distance business.
The company indicated during its July earnings conference call
that it was considering several options for its slow-growing
voice operation, including a tracking stock. While WorldCom did
not comment on yesterday's report, final word may come when the
company releases earnings on October 26. Like other
long-distance carriers, WorldCom is seeking to highlight the
healthy growth of its data and Internet services by separating
out the stagnant consumer long-distance unit, which grew
revenues by only 1% last quarter.

=09=09=09 1.  The correct answer is choice (B).  Statement (1) tells us how=
 many more=20
people were in City X than in City Y, but since we don't know the total=20
population of either, we can't definitively answer this question. We can=20

 about=20
Mormons and Buddhists, but in fact, this statement is sufficient. The 300,0=

Mormons make up 20% of the population of City X, meaning that we can comput=
e=20
the entire population (five times 300,000, not that we needed to know the=

Changes in Enron's business require us to reevaluate how we approach the 
engineering and construction function within Enron.  Specifically,  Enron 
Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires 
considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to 
develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.  
Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return 
on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction 
projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary 
focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following 
organizational changes concerning EECC:

EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of 
Enron Transportation Services.  
NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant 
construction services to Enron entities and third parties.
The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the 
EES Office of the Chairman.
 
 These changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth 
opportunities within Enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our 
employees.  Please join us in supporting and implementing these changes."

a diagram of the ramp-up sequence to include timing)
2) How much start up power is required?
3) Is start up power purchased from Cinergy &/or IPL?  At what tariff rate?
4) How many Mwh are produced during start up? (May include as part of #1)
5) How much fuel is burned (MMBTU's) during start up?(May include as part of

NOTE FROM MARK FREVERT

With the wide and varied activities of our three organizations, we created=
=20
this e-mail newsletter to keep everyone better informed about our various=
=20
businesses.  I hope you find it informative and more importantly, that you=
=20
will use this newsletter to help spread the word about the successes in you=
r=20
group.

To provide content for future e-mails, contact Michelle Vitrella in our=20
Public Relations group via e-mail or call her at ext. 3-9767.  Communicatio=
n=20
is one of the core Enron values and I believe this is a great way to improv=
e=20
communication across our wholesale businesses.

Additionally, I would like to again encourage everyone to take a few minute=
s=20
to complete =01&The Pulse=018 survey.  This annual survey regarding the wor=
k=20
experience at Enron and how we can make it better is an important part of t=
he=20
two-way communication process at Enron.  Please go to the Enron intranet an=
d=20
type survey.enron.com.  It only takes a few minutes, it=01,s confidential a=
nd=20
your comments will help make Enron a better place to work.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Natural Gas
Middle Marketing=01,s biggest trade of the year so far occurred this month.=
  The=20
significant transaction was a five year, multimillion dollar restructuring=
=20
with a subsidiary of Formosa Plastics, one of the world=01,s largest produc=
ers=20
of polyvinyl chloride.

Additionally, Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier, has hedge=
d=20
a considerable amount (1.2 million barrels/month) of crude oil.   Winter=20
Nymex hedges were put in place for the undisputed heavyweight chip champ of=
=20
the world, Frito Lay.

Pulp & Paper
With the acquisition of Garden State Paper and launch of Clickpaper.com,=20
Enron is creating an efficient spot physical market for pulp and paper=20
commodities.  Buyers and sellers will benefit from improved price=20
transparency and reliability and access to Enron=01,s online financial mark=
ets.

Improved price transparency and the ability to imbed financial derivatives=
=20
into physical trading flows will facilitate the growth of Enron=01,s tradin=
g=20
business.  To date, Clickpaper.com has traded over 1 millions tons of pulp=
=20
and paper product with a notional value of over $675 million.

Upstream Origination
Upstream Origination, headed by Julie Gomez and Jean Mrha, focuses on natur=
al=20
gas products to optimize commercial value associated with the natural gas=
=20
grid on the continent and in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM).  Through products su=
ch=20
as storage, electric compression and producer services & outsourcing, ENA=
=20
creates value for its customers and reconfigures the natural gas=20
infrastructure to be more efficient.  In addition, Upstream Origination=20
transactions exploit the unique relationship between development of strateg=
ic=20
assets through sophisticated financing structures and the utilization of th=
e=20
market information created by those assets.

=01&THE PULSE=018 SURVEY RESULTS

As of Wednesday, October 18, the total responses to =01&The Pulse=018 from=
=20
ENA/EGM/EIM are 689.  This is approximately 30% of all employees.  Since ou=
r=20

=20
minutes to log on and give Enron your thoughts.  The Pulse is located at=20

Ashley:
Thanks for sending this e-mail so quickly.  I would like to suggest a couple 
of changes to your resume just to ""tighten"" it up a little bit.  These are 
just minor changes that will make it look more consistent.  I also talked to 
a women who sits two seats down from me, who is a recruiter for another 
group.  She wanted to take a look at your resume once it was ready.  Let's 
try and talk about this later today or this weekend, so you can make these 
changes. Once we get things going internally, I know we can get you over here 
at Enron pretty quickly.  If I don't hear from you later today, please try me 
at home which is (713) 355-8738.  Talk to you soon.

Don,

As a result of our review of the information and documents on Lincoln we
are requesting additional documents which are not in the data room.

1.   Relating to the plant's PSD:

     The Mostardi & Platt emissions test protocol for the May 2000
     emissions test
      A report to Illlinois EPA containing the emission test data
     Continuous Emission Monitoring ("" CEM"") Data ( all data
     developed since start-up)
     Any reports to IEPA required under the permit pertaining to
     exceedances, or
     start-up, breakdown & malfunction ( we have internal memos indicating
     that there
     was a breakdown at # 7 on July 5,2000)

2. Also, we don't have any permits for wastewater discharge. We have been
told that there is no wastewater discharged except
sewage/office wastewater which is going to a septic field. But we have no
verification of this at this point.

Thank you for your attention to these items.

COMMERCE ONE REPORTS Q3
Internet B2B company Commerce One posted solid Q3 results after
the market's close yesterday and now forecasts profitability by
the second quarter of next fiscal year.

By Mike Trigg

Internet marketplace software provider Commerce One (Nasdaq:
CMRC) reported impressive third-quarter results after the
market's close yesterday, highlighted by new customer additions
and the signing of several global mega-exchanges. The
announcement came one day after business-to-business (B2B)
juggernaut Ariba (Nasdaq: ARBA) declared its own results,
becoming the first B2B company to report a breakeven quarter.

Commerce One's fiscal third quarter (ended September 30) net
loss, excluding charges, was $14.7 million, or $0.09 per share,
compared to $10.3 million, or $0.07 per share, in the same
period one year ago. The Street consensus called for a loss of
$0.12 per share. The positive results prompted management to
revise its initial projection, now calling for profitability by
next year's fiscal second quarter (ends June 30).

However, revenue figures tell the real story because B2B
companies are still in a stage of hypergrowth. Commerce One's
revenues increased from $62.7 million in the previous period to
$112.7 million. That's 80% sequential growth. The revenue mix
was 58% licenses (65% last quarter), with services accounting
for the remaining 42% (35% last quarter). Nevertheless, as I
mentioned earlier this week, deferred revenues and the amount of
network revenues within service revenues were two important
factors to track. Let's take a look at those quickly.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=162547

Commerce One reported network revenues of $10.1 million, a
sequential increase of $3 million. This number is important
because it represents the amount of revenue sharing that
occurred on active marketplaces and will substantially increase
as more exchanges go live. Moreover, it currently represents
mostly auction and subscription fees. However, as exchanges
mature, it will include a greater amount of value-added and
transaction-based revenue.

Deferred revenues took a jump from $62 million in the previous
period to $95 million. Deferred revenues are a good liability
because they represent cash that has been realized before at
least a portion of the services have been completed. It's an
important figure because it provides up-front investment capital
and signifies management isn't overstating business. This
quarter's increase can in part be attributed to the company's
partnership with SAP (NYSE: SAP); however, management would not
disclose to what amount.

The alliance with SAP continued to show major traction, despite
being just 90 days old. Through the joint partnership, the
company announced several mega-exchanges that include eHitex
(high tech), Enporion (utility), Quadrem (mining and metals),
and ForestExpress (paper and forest products). This gives the
company 60% market share for top vertical exchanges. To hear
Ariba CEO Keith Krach comment on the Commerce One and SAP
alliance, check out Paul Commins' recent Rule Breaker column.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=162548

Overall, the company posted a solid quarter and continued to
execute, growing its total of 72 marketplaces to 107. Meanwhile,
the number of live exchanges improved to 47, and the customer
count improved by 96 to 316. The quarter was particularly
impressive considering the acquisition of AppNet was only on the
books for two weeks, and significant contributions will be made
in the services portion of revenue upon a full quarter of
contribution.

NEWS TO GO

Fiber optic equipment maker Corvis Corp. (Nasdaq: CORV)
announced better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings
after the market's close yesterday. The company reported a pro
forma loss, excluding goodwill expense and equity-based pay, of
$23.9 million, or $0.07 per share. The Street consensus called
for a loss of $0.09 per share. Revenue came in at $22.9 million.
However, the company still relies heavily on Broadwing (NYSE:
BRW), which began commercial deployment of Corvis' suite of
optical products in the quarter. Corvis closed at $59.60 per
share in the regular session and jumped as high as $71 per share
in after-hours trading.

Internet auction company eBay Inc. (Nasdaq: EBAY) announced its
third-quarter earnings, exceeding Street expectations. The
company said its earnings, excluding charges, were $19.1
million, or $0.07 per share, compared to $3 million, or $0.01
per share, in the year-ago period. The Street consensus estimate
was $0.04 per share. Revenues improved year-over-year from $58.5
million to $113.4 million. In a conference call yesterday, eBay
management stated the positive results were due to increased
exposure in new geographic regions and additional product areas.
Also, it cited a shift toward higher-margin products, such as
cars.

Voice recognition software provider SpeechWorks (Nasdaq: SPWX)
reported third-quarter earnings after the market's close
yesterday, with revenues improving nearly threefold
year-over-year and earnings that exceeded Street expectations.
The Boston-based company reported a loss, excluding charges, of
$5.4 million, or $0.20 per share, compared to a pro forma loss
of $3.7 million, or $0.19 per share, in the same period last
year. The Street consensus forecasted a loss of $0.23 per share.
The company reported revenue of $8.6 million, a 237%
year-over-year increase.

The world's largest maker of cellular phones, Ericsson (Nasdaq:
ERICY), reported fiscal third-quarter earnings this morning and
cut sales forecasts and profit figures for full-year 2000. The
company attributed the revised outlook to losses in its mobile
phone division and will now place a greater emphasis on wireless
network equipment. The Swedish company is losing valuable market
share to Finnish phone maker Nokia (NYSE: NOK), which yesterday
predicted profitability in the fourth quarter. It also announced
that it would move Swedish and U.S. phone production to Asia,
Latin America, and Eastern Europe. Stay tuned for more on this
story.

Why???

Not trying to be difficult but really these conceptual numbers should have 
very limited distribution and use - I will call Scot and see how he can use 
them.

Mitch,

The attached files contain the info.  

For Gleason:  All I have is the water specs that Mike Wisdom placed in the 
RFQ that went to Ecolochem and US Filter; I do not have copies of the 
original source documentation.

Let me know if you need more.

Please refer to the attached powerpoint slide as part of the general 
explanation below.

The remote terminal unit (RTU) system monitors our high voltage equipment 
status.  This includes the telemetering and revenue equipment required to be 
a Control Area.  The RTU's provide information that is identical to both 
utilities (Control Areas).  We have used the L&G protocol on all of the RTU's 
to date.

The Scada Management Platform (SMP) is connected to the unit control system 
(DCS).  The SMP passes the setpoint that the Energy Management Systems, (EMS) 
Automatic Generation Control (AGC) application has calculated the required 
setpoint  ( dispatch) that is required to be meet by each unit. The local 
operator has to place each units local control system to the remote status 
for the setpoint to be accepted at the plant.  We have used the ESCA Inter 
Site Data (ISD) protocal on all of the SMP systems to date.

 The SMP  also provides us with an alternate data source which is required as 
a Control Area.  

Thanks.

Subject: Update - Responses to Wheatland Questions

Don,

For response #3, I have additional comments:

The ambient conditions were such that output was limited by the MW limiter in 
the WDPF.  Unit #3 was only operated at 96.2% of base load.  Since the 
guarantees were met during the test, no additional testing was done.

1.  The correction curves are not published with the Test Reports.  The 
calculations are given using the correction data only.  The curves and 
detailed explanations are located in the purchase contracts.

2. The run hours are estimated based on the emissions limits, the guaranteed 
emissions output of the equipment and average heat rates.   

 For example at Wheatland:

 The NOx cap is 249 tons/year * 2000 = 498,000 lbs./yr.  (permit limits)
 The NOx output of each unit is 0.092lbs /MMBtu  (Mfg. guarantee)
 The Fuel Use is 1,486 MMBtu/hr HHV   (Based on avg. heat rate)
 NOx /hr = 0.092 lbs/MMBtu * 1,486 MMBtu/hr
  = 136.7 lbs/hr. 

 Plant NOx = 136.7 lbs/hr * 4
      = 546.8 lbs/hr

 Run Hours = 498,000 lbs/hr / 546.8 lbs/hr
        = 911 hrs.
 These numbers are approximate and are conservative.

3. Regarding the performance issue with Wheatland Unit#3;    I did find a 
reference in the test report stating that units 3 & 4 were underfired due to 
the MW limiter in the WDPF.  Unit 3 was loaded at only 96.2% of base load and 
Unit 4 at 98.4%.  This along with Mitch's comments (The output guarantee was 
for the facility and each unit could have been fine tuned differently) more 
than likely contributed to the output differences.

4. The gas pressure issue at Wheatland in June was a one time excursion per 
Chris Norris.  There have been no pressure problems since then.

GENERAL ELECTRIC TO PURCHASE HONEYWELL
General Electric announced plans to buy Honeywell for nearly
$48.4 billion in stock and debt.

By Mike Trigg

Fairfield, Conn.-based General Electric (NYSE: GE) announced
plans to purchase aerospace systems company Honeywell (NYSE:
HON) for nearly $48.4 billion in stock and debt, GE's biggest
deal ever. In addition, General Electric Chairman and CEO Jack
Welch agreed to stay on through next year in order to see the
acquisition through.

Under terms of the agreement, General Electric will pay 1.005
shares for the automated controls maker, or about $55.12 per
share based on Honeywell's closing price Friday. The equity and
debt mix is about $45 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.
According to General Electric, the deal will add at least $0.10
per share in its first full year and is being accounted for as a
pooling of interest.

After planning to step down as chairman in April, it's a bonus
Welch will be staying on to supervise the transition, calming
Street concerns. He's been on the job for over two decades,
overseeing tremendous company success, and is considered a
top-notch corporate executive. The company still plans on going
through with earlier plans to name a successor, expected
sometime before the year's end. In European trading, General
Electric was up, while Honeywell traded down.

The announcement comes only days after aerospace parts company
United Technologies (NYSE: UTX) and Honeywell were in similar
talks for a deal reportedly worth $40 billion. It would have
created an aerospace parts company with over $48 billion in
annual sales based on last fiscal year's figures. According to
reports, United Technologies stepped away from the table,
unwilling to engage in a bidding war after learning General
Electric had entered the picture.

Likewise, this deal comes less than a year after AlligedSignal
bought Honeywell and became Honeywell International. Of course,
integration is always a concern with any acquisition, and this
one will have its fair share of changes, with surely more to
come. According to a Honeywell spokesperson, its headquarters in
Morristown, N.J. will be closed and about 500 employees will
potentially lose their jobs. Three Honeywell officials will be
added to GE's board, including CEO Michael Bonsignore.

Overall, the acquisition creates an industrial Goliath that
specializes in aerospace, chemicals, and plastics products and
systems, among others. According to Welch, Honeywell's core
businesses -- avionics, automated controls, performance
materials, and microturbine technology -- are a perfect fit with
four of General Electric's major business lines.

NEWS TO GO

Optical networking company Corning (NYSE: GLW) announced fiscal
third-quarter results this morning with profits more than
doubling. The company cited increased demand for optical fiber
and components used in communication networks. Corning reported
pro forma earnings of $317 million, or $0.35 per share, compared
to $148.1 million, or $0.17 per share, in the year-ago period.
The announcement was in line with the company's recently raised
forecast of $0.34 to $0.35 per share, with the Street consensus
calling for $0.34 per share. Revenues came in at $1.9 billion, a
54% increase from the year-ago figure of $1.25 billion.

Over the weekend, Lucent Technologies' (NYSE: LU) board of
directors named Henry Schacht the company's new chairman and
CEO. According to a press release, a need for a new set of
skills at this point in the company's life was the reason for
replacing existing Chairman and CEO Richard McGinn. Schacht is
returning to a position he held from 1995 to 1997. He will work
with senior management to run day-to-day operations and will
begin a search for his successor. The change could not come at a
better time, as Bill man recently commented. After yet another
earnings warning earlier this month, Lucent shareholders were
calling for the McGinn's removal. Hooray for them, I suppose.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=164345

According to The Wall Street Journal, AT&T (NYSE: T) is
contemplating a plan, ""Project Grand Slam"", that would split the
company into four businesses: consumer long distance, wireless,
business, and broadband. The Business Services division, its
largest and most profitable, would become the new AT&T. It would
create brand and licensing arrangements with the three other
businesses. That division generated 39% of the company's total
1999 revenue, or $25 billion. The proposal will be discussed at
the telecommunication provider's board meeting Monday and, if
approved, could be announced as soon as Wednesday.

Mr. Jemison:

My name is Ben Rogers and I am currently applying to The Texas Business
School for the Fall of 2000. I was referred to you by David Martin, graduate
of the Business School and the son of John Martin, former Finance Professor.
I have worked with David at Enron for a couple of years and have learned a
great deal about the School.  I was also referred to you by Kyle Kettler,
who graduated from the Business School in 1998 and who worked in the
investment fund. I have been working in several different finance positions
within Enron for the last two and a half years.  Before coming to Enron I
worked for three years in a portfolio management group with State Street
Bank in Boston. I am very interested in the combination of energy and
corporate finance and have the desire to continue working in these
industries after business school, specifically with an Investment Bank in
their M&A department. I am coming to visit the school on Friday, Feb. 18th
and was wondering if you had time to talk to me about the Business School.
I have also read  ""Managing Acquisitions""  and I am very interested in your
courses.  If you could please let me know if your available, I would greatly
appreciate it. If your not available that day, I would still like to talk
with you about the program and your courses. You can either e-mail me back
or you can reach me at Enron in Houston at (713) 853-7998. Please let me
know if you want me to send you my resume, so that you have a better
understanding of my background. The admissions office has my complete
application with my resume. Thanks in advance for taking the time to talk
with me. Hope to hear from you soon.

otto's - we never see each other there.  That was a joke.

Great luck with that marathon.  That will be awesome I am sure.  I am signed
up for austin in feb, so I am pretty excited about that one.

Let me know how it goes!  Talk to you later...

Hey Dan:
It was good to see you the other day.  It's funny because I had tried to
send you an e-mail, after talking to Andrew about the paper.  It's great
eveything is going well.  I'm running the NYC Marathon in two weeks so my
weekends are mostly about running, but after that I would like to get
together for some golf.  Talk to you soon.
Ben

Based on the plant design (not measured values), the Full Load Parasitic
would be about 4,600 kW, the ""Stand-By"" Parasitic load would be about 385 kW
(power backfed through GSU Transformers). If the plant is held in ""Stand-By""
without the GSU's energized, then the parasitic drops to about 85 kW.

Mike Connelly is expected back in Bothell tomorrow. He should be checking
his e-mail so you might want to sent him a message (if you haven't done so
already).

sender by replying to this message, and then delete it from your system.
Thank you.
_______________________________________________________________

Tom Irwin asked that we contact you each of you directly on behalf of
Allegheny to ask the following environmental due diligence questions that
we have not resolved based on our review of the Dealbench documents.
Please, however, feel free to reference specific documents on Dealbench if
you believe they would be useful.

Questions for All Facilities

1.  What are the limitations on the number of hours that each facility can
operate and what is the source of those limitations?

2.  We understand that there are tentative expansion plans for each
facility.  Were these future expansion plans disclosed to the regulating
agencies at the time that the air permits were applied for, particularly at
those facilities which did not undergo PSD review?

3.  Which facilities are required to perform continuous emissions
monitoring pursuant to its air permits?  For those facilities performing
CEM, please provide the last two years of data.

4.  Are the facilities FERC jurisdictional for environmental impact
statement purposes pursuant to 18 C.F.R. Part 380?  We noticed that the
only facility with information about this issue was the pipeline at
Lincoln, although the information seemed to suggest that only the pipeline
was subject to the EIS process.  See 2.02.12.G.  Was the rest of the
Lincoln facility subject to the EIS process?  What was the outcome of the
EIS process for the pipeline?

5.  What is Enron's understanding of the process required to transfer the
environmental permits for each facility in connection with the proposed
transaction?  For example, the 1995 stormwater permit for LV Cogen appears
to be triggered by a change in control of the facility.  See 6.02.03 at
page 16.  Do other permits have similar provisions?

6.  Will any environmental property transfer or comparable statutes (e.g.
the Illinois Responsible Property Transfer Act) be triggered by the
proposed transaction?

7. We have reviewed the United States Environmental Protection Agency
comments for the air permit at LV Cogen II, as discussed below.  Did U.S.
EPA provide any additional comments on the air permits for LV Cogen II or
any other facility?

Lincoln Facility

1.  Does the Lincoln facility have an air operating permit from the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency?  If so, please provide a copy.
If not, please explain status.

2.  Were any wetlands impacted by the construction of the facility and, if
so, what permits were obtained?  Will any wetlands be impacted by future
expansion plans?  ENSR's conclusion on this issue seemed unclear,
particularly with respect to the 30 acre parcel.  See 02.03.09C.

Gleason Facility

1.  Does the Gleason facility have an air operating permit from the
Tennessee Department of Environment & Conservation?  If so, please provide
a copy.  If not, please explain status.  We also noticed that the
construction permit expired on October 1, 2000.  See 02.01.02.  Was it
renewed?

2.  What is the status of the petition for variance to the Tennessee
Department of Environment & Conservation for alternative testing and
monitoring methods under NSPS Subpart GG dated April 17, 2000?  See
02.01.04B.  What is the status of the letter requesting a waiver of certain
source emission tests dated April 18, 2000?  See 02.01.04A.

3.  Is there enough water to support an expansion of the facility at
Gleason?  Please provide any testing/analysis that has been performed with
respect to this issue.

Wheatland Facility

1.  We understand that the Wheatland facility may seek a NPDES permit to
discharge wastewater directly to the White River.  How is this wastewater
currently managed?  Why is the facility considering changing the management
method to direct discharge under a NPDES permit?  If there are associated
cost savings with a NPDES permit, what are they estimated to be?  We
understand that the source of the water that is discharged is a pond
associated with mining operations.  Who is the owner of the pond?  Are any
water extraction permits needed to remove water from this pond and, if so,
have they been obtained?  We also understand that sampling was recently
performed of the water.  Please provide copies of this analysis and any
associated documentation.

LV Cogen

1.  The Industrial User Discharge Permit on Dealbench appears to have
expired on July 1, 2000.  See 6.02.02.  Was it renewed?  If so, please
provide copy.

2.  The stormwater discharge permit for LV Cogen appears to be expired.
See 06.02.03.  Was it renewed?  If so, please provide copy.

3.  Does Sunco hold any environmental permits in its own name?  If so,
please provide copies.

LV Cogen II

1.  EPA contends in its March 23, 1998 and March 24, 2000 letters that BACT
for LV Cogen II was SCONOx and/or XONON.  See 06.01.09.1.   How was this
issue resolved?  Can LV Cogen II meet the 2 ppm NOx limit in the draft
operating permit with the technology that has been proposed?  See 06.01.15.

2.  It appears that the State of Nevada has contended that certain
equipment replacement should have undergone new source review in their June
13, 2000 memo.  See 16.03.6.    How was this resolved?  What is EPA's view
on this issue?"

Mr.Jemison:
Thanks for the fast reply.  That time sounds great.  I have an information 
session at 1:00 pm and a meeting with someone in the Admissions office at 
3:00 pm, so that works out perfectly.  I'm really looking forward to coming

Gus -

Many of these are environmental in nature.  Can you take a first stab?

Ross, please review this answer.  I have not seen any cost analysis with the 
NPDES and water upgrade.  Cinergy is concerned as are most over the water 
cost issues.  Ben/Don, lake and property issues and permit issues should go 
to Keenan and Kellermeyer.

Ben:  

Here are my answers to the Allegheny Questions below.  Please confirm the 
details with Dave Kellermeyer where necessary.

Question 1:   Does the Lincoln facility have an air operating permit from the 
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency?  If so, please provide a copy. If 
not,    please explain status.

Answer:  I believe that the application for the Title V Operating Permit for 
the Lincoln Energy Center was submitted to the IEPA in the Spring of 2000.  
Dave   Kellermeyer can definitively answer whether this Operating Permit has 
been issued/received from the IEPA.

Question 2: Were any wetlands impacted by the construction of the facility 
and, if so, what permits were obtained?  Will any wetlands be impacted by 
future   expansion plans?  ENSR's conclusion on this issue seemed unclear, 
particularly with respect to the 30 acre parcel.  See 02.03.09C.

Answer:  The ENSR Wetlands Delineation activities conducted during the period 
of December 1998 through February 1999 determined the following:
   1.  No wetlands existed on the 50 acre parcel upon which the Lincoln 
Energy Center was ultimately constructed.
   2.  An agricultural wetland area existed within the parcel of land 
adjacent to the western boundary of the Lincoln Energy Center 50 acre    
parcel.
   3.  After reviewing the ENSR wetland delineation information, the Will 
County NRCS confirmed the existence and boundary location of the    
agricultural wetland and  concurred with the ENSR conclusion that the 
agricultural wetland boundary was completely contained within the    parcel 
of land adjacent to the western boundary of the Lincoln Energy Center 50 acre 
parcel.

With regard to wetlands impacted during construction of the Facility, the 
construction of the Facility's natural gas pipeline lateral was routed 
through several existing wetland areas.  The potential impact of this 
lateral's construction on existing wetlands was mitigated through a 
directional drilling program implemented during the pipeline construction 
activity.  The Site Development permits required for this pipeline 
construction activity were obtained from the Will County Land Use 
Department.  

With regard to future Facility expansion plans, no impact to wetlands is 
expected provided that such expansion occurs within the existing boundaries 
of the 50 acre Facility parcel.

As a note to Question 2 above, I could not locate a reference to a 30 acre 
parcel within the ENSR Wetland Investigation Report described as 02.03.09C.  
Perhaps this is a typo and should be 50 acres.

Call/see me to discuss this information.  I will be in the office tomorrow 
(10/24) until 2 pm and then in Chicago on Wed-Thursday.  I will access my 
email via laptop while I am out of the office.

Let me amend Fred's response to Question 1:

The Lincoln facility does not have an operating permit from Illinois EPA.  
Condition 10a of the construction permit allows operation of the facility up 
to the end of emission testing and Condition 10b allows continued operation 
after emission testing has been completed.  Also note that Condition 10c of 
the construction permit states that these conditions supercede Standard 
Condition 6, which requires the applicant to apply for a State operating 
permit.  In other words, the Lincoln facility does not need to hold a 
separate operating permit from the Illinois EPA.

""He that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.""

ACTIVISION LANDS HIGH SCORE
Activision tops estimates. Game on!

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

The game's afoot for software specialist Activision (Nasdaq:
ATVI). The popular video game maker trounced analyst estimates
like a Quake baddie in one of its console ports.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=165621

Earnings more than quadrupled to $0.17 a share, a stunning eight
cents above Wall Street projections. Revenues climbed by 25% to
$144.4 million with the peak holiday shopping season right
around the corner.

But, as we noted last week, delays in mass shipments of the
highly anticipated PlayStation 2 might hose down some of that
red-hot momentum with the video game powerhouses. Without enough
systems to meet seasonal demand, and few gamers willing to
stockpile games for platforms on the way out, how will
Activision perform?
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=165622

The company is now hiking its annual bottom-line forecast by
seven cents to $0.63 a share. The only problem is that the
company used up eight of those upwardly revised coppers this
past quarter. That means that the game maker is looking to fall
a penny short in either the December or March reporting period.

That might happen later rather than sooner. Since mid-September
the company's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 has been the top-selling
title for the top-selling PlayStation system. While we are now
just two days away from the PlayStation
2 launch, the extreme skating title should continue to roll
along nicely in the near term.

Activision -- the subject of StockTalk last April -- is the
country's second-largest developer of game console software,
behind only Electronic Arts (Nasdaq: ERTS). The company is
looking for flat growth over the year ahead but a 50% spike come
calendar year 2002.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=165623

So the past looks great. The long-term appears equally aglow.
It's the near-term that might have investors fumbling for the
pause button.

NEWS TO GO

Winning the battle but Lucent (NYSE: LU) the war, the
telecommunications titan reported earnings of $0.18 a share, a
penny above estimates. The problem? Analysts were looking for a
$0.29 showing before the company gave Wall Street downward
guidance due to soft equipment sales. That prompted the bar
being lowered to a height of $0.17 a share. Over the weekend,
the company's board of directors fired its CEO. Reserve the
right to do the same to anyone who naively tells you that Lucent
is back on track because it topped fourth-quarter projections.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=165624
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=165625

Twenty-five million Welcomes. This morning America Online (NYSE:
AOL) announced that it reached the 25 million subscriber mark
for its namesake online service. It was simply a matter of time
-- and of scatter software marketing -- since the company had
announced that it had 24.6 million users at the end of the
September quarter. On the merger front, today's Wall Street
Journal is reporting that the review deadline for its Time
Warner (NYSE: TWX) acquisition has been extended by two weeks.
The stateside antitrust authorities continue to ponder the
ramifications of the mega media merger.

National Semiconductor (NYSE: NSM) is laying its chips on the
table and the stock is falling as it may. The company has warned
that its second and third quarters might fall short of its
fiscal first-quarter showing. The company earned $0.76 a share
on $640 million in revenues for the period.

It was another ""pfine"" quarter for Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). The
pharmaceuticals powerhouse reported earnings of $0.27 a share on
revenues of $7.2 billion. The results came in two cents ahead of
expectations. For the year, the company is comfortable with
targets of $30 billion in revenue and $1.01 a share in earnings.

Subject: Re: Pipeline Capacity

Andy Johnson (Mgr Business Development)with El Paso is double/triple checking 
the max flow rate,
but it  is believed to be 190,000 mmbtu/day or 7,900 mmbtu/hr.
Currently at 500 Mw and 11.5 heat rate, our  flow rate is approx 5,750 
mmbtu/hr

I have calls into El Paso again today...Also John Hodge (from Stephanie 
Miller's group) has 
replaced the calls he made on Friday, at my request.  The only reference any 
documents that I have make is to the
current max flow rate of the plant.  However I am sure the interconnect was 
built larger than required.
I will for ward the respones ASAP.

Sorry for the delay with the e-mail, I just got back into the office from 
traveling.  We are working hard to sell these assets before year-end - 
they're a beast.  This Friday does not look good for lunch, but I think 
Tuesday or Wednesday of next week works.  I hope this works for you as well.  
Talk to you soon.

Ben-

Please adjust your models for the 99 Peakers to reflect the balances in the 
2/8 Weekly Cost Summary.  The changes that need to be made are as follows:

Brownsville:  Sales & Use Tax $33 Legal Expense $1,068      Total $128,001

Caledonia: Spare Parts $697 Legal Expense $883    Total $154,764

New Albany: Turbines $83,131 Spare Parts $748 Legal Expense $841 Total 
$148,836
 Also on New Albany, you are showing 367MW and my schedules show 360MW.  
Which is correct?



Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks!

With deep regret we announce that Joe Sutton, Vice Chairman of Enron, has 
decided to leave the company.  Joe has indicated his desire to pursue other 
opportunities in the energy asset development and operations business.

Joe has been instrumental in making Enron a global company.  We will miss his 
energy and enthusiasm.  We wish Joe the very best as he pursues new endeavors.

Ben:

As we have done with El Paso, Aquila and Duke; is it possible for us (Tax) to 
speak directly to the LG&E Tax Professionals.  We have found this to be the 
most efficient and effective means of handling the tax issues.  Please advise.

Thanks.

Ben,

I just wanted to follow up with you and see if there was any progress in 
updating the White Paper.  Also, please let me know if there is any way I can 
assist in developing the White Paper further.  We are still waiting to get 
some input from insurance players as to how to best address their needs and

The recruiting season has officially begun.  The first Super Saturday weeke=

is the weekend of October 27th and 28th.  We have undergone a rigorous=20

Saturday process that allows for consistent and meaningful hiring decisions=

while also allowing the candidates exposure to a greater number of Enron=20

Friday Evening Dinner.    The dinners will be held at the same restaurant. =

small tables of six individuals that will include two (2) Enron employees a=

before the dinner.  This will enable the Enron employees to meet and evalua=

more students.  It will also give the students broader exposure to Enron=20
employees.
Saturday Interviews.   Interviewers will receive their interview packages=
=20
(schedules and resumes) at breakfast on Saturday morning. This will=20
facilitate last minute cancellations of interviewers and/or candidates.  We=

NORTEL'S THIRD QUARTER
Nortel Networks reports its Q3 results, with revenues and
earnings both growing.

By LouAnn Lofton

Nortel Networks (NYSE: NT) announced third-quarter results
yesterday after the market's closing bell. The company met
earnings expectations, but perceived top-line growth weakness
sent shares of the Canadian telecommunications company
plummeting as much as 20% in after-hours trading.

Nortel's income from operations, which excludes certain
acquisition costs, was $574 million, or $0.18 a share. In last
year's third quarter, the company's operating income was $314
million, and earnings per share (EPS) was $0.11. Analysts as
polled by First Call/Thompson Financial were looking for $0.17 a
share.

Revenues for Nortel increased 42% over last year's $5.15 billion
to $7.31 billion. Many analysts, though, were looking for
Nortel's revenues to come in between $7.5 and $7.63 billion. It
was this ""shortfall"" that sent Nortel's shares down in
after-hours trading.

Nortel saw its strongest growth from its optical networking
business, where revenues grew by 90% compared to last year. Its
wireless Internet solutions business also did very well, with
revenues up 50% in this quarter versus the year-ago quarter.

The company reiterated that it sees its revenue growth for 2000
in the low-40% range. It raised its target for EPS from
operations growth to the same range as revenue growth, up from
the previously expected high-30% level.

John Roth, Nortel's president and chief executive officer, said,
""We are extremely pleased with the strong growth in the quarter,
which reflected our continued strength and leadership in the key
growth areas of Optical Internet, Wireless Internet, Local
Internet and eBusiness Solutions. Carriers and service providers
around the world continued the drive to provide a broad range of
wireless, internet and eBusiness services to their customers.""

AFTER-HOURS COVERAGE

AMAZON'S SOLID THIRD QUARTER
By LouAnn Lofton
E-commerce company Amazon.com reported its third-quarter results
today after the bell. Its pro forma net loss widened, but the
company's revenues and loss per share came in ahead of
expectations. Other positives included a growing gross margin,
key expenses shrinking, and an expanding customer base. The
company also used less cash in its operations for the quarter
than it did last year. This hurdle behind it, all eyes now turn
to the all-important holiday shopping season.

SIEBEL KEEPS ROCKIN'
By Mike Trigg
CRM juggernaut Siebel Systems announced great earnings tonight.
The results were a reflection of the company's dominance in the
fast-paced software space. Again, it showed excellent traction
in the middle-market and abroad, which will be major growth
drivers down the road.

EXCITE@HOME'S THIRD QUARTER
By Nico Detourn
The company added a record number of subscribers during the
quarter, which added plausibility to its ambitious year-end sub
target. But finding a new CEO, and its relationship with AT&T,
may have more influence on near-term perception of the company
than will the details its operational performance.

NEWS TO GO

Compaq Computer (NYSE: CPQ) reported third-quarter results
yesterday after the market's close. The computer maker said that
net income for the quarter, including an investment gain, was
$550 million, or $0.31 a share. Minus the gain, Compaq earned
$0.30 a share, which was ahead of analysts' expectations by a
penny. Sales grew 22% to $11.2 billion. Michael Capellas,
Compaq's chief executive officer, said, ""Our revenue was the
highest in Compaq's history."" In a conference call, Compaq CFO
Jesse Greene said that the weak euro will negatively impact
Compaq's fourth-quarter results by up to $100 million in pre-tax
profits. Compaq now expects earnings per share in the fourth
quarter to be about $0.37, below the current estimate of $0.41.

Chip maker LSI Logic (NYSE: LSI) announced third-quarter
earnings yesterday. Net income, excluding special items, more
than doubled to $114 million, from $55 million last year. On a
per-share basis, LSI Logic earned $0.33, compared to $0.17 in
the year-ago period. The consensus estimate according to First
Call/Thompson Financial for LSI Logic's third period was $0.32.
Revenues at the company increased 35% to $728 million. Wilfred
Corrigan, LSI's chief executive officer, said the company is
comfortable with fourth-quarter estimates of $0.36 a share.

Long-distance telephone company AT&T (NYSE: T) reported
third-quarter results this morning. Earnings, excluding onetime
items, fell 12% to $1.44 billion, or $0.38 a share, from $1.63
billion, or $0.50 a share, last year. Analysts were expecting
$0.36 a share. AT&T's sales rose 4% to $16.98 billion. Strong
wireless and data sales were overshadowed by AT&T's declining
sales of its long-distance services to residential customers.
Sales to consumers fell 11%, while corporate sales increased
2.5%. AT&T also announced that, as rumored, it will break up
into four smaller companies. The restructuring is expected to be
done in 2002.

Entertainment and media company Viacom (NYSE: VIA) announced
third-quarter earnings this morning. Viacom's net income was $33
million, down from last year's $97 million. On a per-share
basis, Viacom earned $0.02, compared to $0.14 in the year-ago
period. Analysts had expected Viacom to lose $0.02 a share.
Sales at the company grew 79% to $6 billion from $3.3 billion
last year. Higher taxes and costs associated with the company's
purchase of CBS affected results, though Viacom did see strong
advertising revenue growth.

Mr. Titman:
I have not heard back from Professor Ronn, so I am not sure as of now whether 
or not I can meet with him.  I will give him another call today to see if he 
is available.  Thanks

Regarding Question #8 on the Wheatland section...
 LMS-MA is a service we did not elect to participate in - therefore the 
number in the 'blank' that
was illegible was zero.  We keep all balances on OBA - which has no daily 
charges and a mth end cashout.

Regarding question #8:
   
   Wheatland has a zero for ""DDQ"" under our LMS-MA balancing agreement 
because Wheatland has elected not to have storage
  or ""swing"" rights associated with the LMS-MA service.   If Wheatland would 
have elected the storage option associated with the LMS-MA
  schedule, a number > zero would have been entered and would constitute the 
amount of ""swing"" in which variance charges would be 
  assessed.

Sections:

 2.11 last question: Yes plant can operate without a gas nomination in place 
for that day. As mentioned
     a gas nomination and a notice of flow to Gas Control are both requested 
by Midwestern
     but not required.

 2.12   Interruptible transport maximum under current contract is 125,000/day.
     First 85,000/day is at discounted rate.
     Physical capacity of interconnect is 190,000/day.

 2.15   As mentioned above the maximum physical capacity of the interconnect 
between the plant and
     Midwestern is 190,000 mmbtu/day or about 7900/hour.  Our current 
transportation contract 
     maximum is 125,000/day (first 85,000/day discounted) because with 
current plant size the
     maximum hourly flow rate is 5500/hour.  Additional Interruptible 
transport from Pipeline
     could easily be granted. 

 2.16   All daily imbalances hit the OBA (Operational Balancing Agreement) at 
the plant site.  There is
     no charge for the OBA, or for the daily imbalances.  Imbalances are 
cumulative for the month
     and are cashed-out at each month end in accordance to Midwestern tariff 
provisions.
      Per Midwestern, holder of OBA is asked to minimize  size of imbalance 
in accordance
      to integrity off Midwestern's system.  If a daily imbalance, or  
cumulative imbalance
     begins to threaten integrity of system, Midwestern can call and ask you 
to reduce imbalance.
     After that warning the pipe can issue a point specific OFO, which could 
lead to penalties
     for failure to minimize any imbalances. 
     Since inception of plant 5/00 -  we have never encountered any balancing 
problems/penalties.

Don - I will not be able to attend the meeting tomorrow at 1:30 PM because of 
a Dr.'s appointment. Between Dave and Chris, and all the written answers we 
provided, you should be covered on environmental. I will be glad to help out 
with any additional questions they may have.

Ben - The answer to the question you left me on voice mail is no. I have not 
yet received a written response from EPA approving the CEMS certification 
extension deadline until January 30, 2001. I was verbally told that our 
request was approved in a policy review committee held on October 12, 2000. 
DPL can verify this approval by calling my EPA Clean Air Markets Division 
Contact, Louis Nichols at (202) 564-0161.

Thanks.

for this outage can't be complete until the outage is over.  The outage

looking for then you have it.  I can send it electronic if you have microsoft

Ben,

I spoke to Ross Newlin regarding the vibration problems.  The Westinghouse 
engineers corrected the problem to the point that it was below alarm limits.  
There is no plan to repair the problem during the November outage since it 
requires significant run time and the economics are not there for a November 
run.  However, West. has committed to come back to the plant in January when 
we can schedule some run time.  Ross will try to track down the minutes of 
the outage planning meeting to document this.  I'll forward them to you when 
I get them.

ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. What's a mock portfolio?

-- A. Mock portfolios are a great tool for people new to
investing and for those trying out new investing methods. You
simply go through all the motions of investing, stopping short
of actually plunking down your hard-earned cash. Research some
companies, decide which ones you'd buy, and then set up a
pretend portfolio, either on paper or online. (Many websites
offer online portfolio tracking -- and we're one of them.) Keep
track of details such as when you ""bought"" the shares and at
what price. Then track your performance, aiming to beat the
market.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D168092

-- Q. I've heard you sing the praises of the Standard & Poor's
(S&P) 500 index fund on your radio show, but I'm wondering what
other indexes are out there.

-- A. A bunch of indexes exist, with each one representing a
particular group of companies. We'll highlight just a few. The
most famous one is the Dow Jones Industrial Index, which
includes 30 flagship American giants, such as Exxon, Wal-Mart,
Merck, Coca-Cola and Microsoft. The S&P 500 also focuses on
large companies, including 500 of America's biggest and best.

The Russell 3000 Index includes 3,000 of the largest U.S.
companies based on market capitalization (current share price
multiplied by number of shares outstanding). These 3,000
constitute about 98 percent of the U.S. market. For a measure of
small-cap companies, look to the Russell 2000. It's composed of
the 2,000 smallest companies in the Russell 3000. The Wilshire
5000 is just about the broadest index of American companies. It
began with 5,000 but now contains more than 7,000.

There are many more indexes. Some are for international regions
such as Latin America or the Far East. Others address sectors
such as utilities, semiconductors, the Internet and fried
chicken. (Just kidding about the chicken.)

INVESTING BASICS - RULES FOR REVOLUTIONARIES

In order to help readers find books that offer valuable business
insights coupled with sparkling writing, we launched a monthly
book award last year, called The Jester Award. The first winner
of the Jester was Guy Kawasaki's new book, ""Rules for
Revolutionaries"" (HarperBusiness, $15). In it, he lays out some
bold guidelines for those who want to bring about business
revolutions. Here are a few:
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D168095

1. ""Don't worry, be crappy."" Yes, you read that right. It's
Kawasaki's inimitable way of reminding us that it can take
almost forever to perfect something, and that it's often best to
release a not-quite-perfect product and then work on improving
its next generation. He illustrates this with the 1984 Macintosh
computer, which was shipped in a less-than-perfect
configuration: only 128K of RAM, no hard drive, no
documentation, and so on. Waiting to perfect the product would
have meant giving the competition an edge and losing the
confidence of software developers.

2. ""Eat your own dog food."" This sounds crazy, but think about
it. By using your own company's products or services, you'll
understand what the customer experience is like and you'll be
able to flag problems quickly. Forrest Mars Sr., the man who
built Mars Inc., did taste his own company's dog food
(literally), a practice that continues today at the company.
Kawasaki offers the example of Gillette, which maintains a
shaving laboratory where 300 employees per day come in unshaven
and test the company's and competitors' products. Similarly,
bicycle manufacturer Cannondale encourages its employees to
commute by Cannondale bikes, so that they can offer feedback on
products.

3. ""Eat like a bird, poop like an elephant."" (Really, we're not
making this stuff up!) Birds actually eat a lot -- sometimes 50
percent of their weight every day. And elephants can poop 165
pounds per day. The idea here is that you should soak up as much
information as you can find and then share it.

If you're looking for a well-written, engaging book to help you
stay on the cutting edge of the best thinking and writing on
personal finance and investing, keep an eye out for Jester Award
winners. To nominate any book for a Jester Award, drop an e-mail

The following questions were raised by our review of the draft
environmental schedules on Dealbench.

LV Cogen I and II

1.  Schedule 4.1(i) references an annual audit of the CEM system in May
2000.  Is this audit on Dealbench and/or can we get a copy of it?

2.  Please provide a copy and/or reference to a Dealbench document for the
Phase I referenced on Schedule 4.1(n).

3.  Please provide copies and/or references to Dealbench documents for the
items listed as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 on Schedule 4.1(u).  [Note that we have
reviewed the 1995 storm water permit, but did not see an indication that it
is automatically renewed.  Is this reflected elsewhere?]

Wheatland, Gleason and Lincoln

1.  We noticed that Schedule 4.1(u) for each facility indicates that an
SPCC is needed but not currently in place.  What is stored that triggers
the SPCC requirement?  How long have these materials been stored at the
facilities?

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions or if you would like
to discuss these issues in further detail.  Thanks.

To all

rough pass at EPC draw schedule in attached Excel for 2,3,4,5 and 6 unit 
plants - assumes two week spacing on start up - based on normal simple cycle 
deal. If we need to do major LM6000 payments up front then we should have a 
front end weighted curve (I will go ahead and generate a front-ended curve 
for each config) - depends on how we really extract each from WestLB deal - 
above my pay grade to know those lofty things.

Data is based on ElectriCities installation schedule from Nepco, we are 
working to see if we can compress actual time in field as part of reducing 
project anticipated cost so might be better once Mike Coleman and Bruce work 
our magic. % are from my vast experience and would be challenged and derided 
if a real cost engineer looks at them but at least they add to 100% (I hope) 
and sort of match our Hainan experience with three of these LM6000's.

His data was LHV. roughly multiply by 1.11 to get HHV. For some reason 
several of the ENA proposals used LHV, so I though that LHV maybe usual for 
ENA deals.

If you are modeling a long term Enron owned deal then we should model 
degradation on heat rate (Santee Cooper, ReBox). If it is a EPC directly to a 
host (ElectriCities, Springfield, City of Austin), the sale would be new & 
clean but we would model our three year power transaction with just the 
initial heat rate degradation. You and I ought to look at the degradation 
curve that most closely matches and eyeball the year 1, 2 and 3 average 
degradation.

How 'bout in the morning - you pick the time - I have an 11AM tech meeting.

Thanx Bruce

Subject: Heat rate and Capacity table

Bernstein's model has a table that provide the heat rate and capacity based 
on ISO/90 degrees, chiller/no chiller, gas compression, etc. I am not sure 
whether I should go with these numbers, but I know the heat rate is off 
because I heard that the heat rate is 10,300 HHV instead of 9,300 HHV (unless 
Bernstein's model is in HHV, which I was told was not).

I got your message about not modeling capacity degradation. Should we still 
model heat rate degradation?

Please tell me when you would be available to discuss further. Thanks.

INFOSPACE MAKES MONEY FROM WIRELESS
The company reported a tripling in sales and estimate-beating
earnings yesterday.

By Chris Rugaber

Internet content aggregator InfoSpace (Nasdaq: INSP) reported
third-quarter financial results after yesterday's market close.
The company almost tripled revenues, and posted operating
profits of $9.47 million, or $0.03 per share, up from $2.97
million, or $0.01 per share, in last year's third quarter.
Analysts expected the company to break even, before acquisition
and amortization costs. Including those expenses, InfoSpace lost
$48.7 million, or $0.17 per share.

Revenues jumped to $57.7 million, from $19.9 million in the
year-earlier period, thanks in part to increasing sales to
wireless service providers, such as Verizon (NYSE: VZ), Alltel
(NYSE: AT), and Cingular Wireless, the partnership between SBC
Communications (NYSE: SBC) and BellSouth (NYSE: BLS). InfoSpace
enables wireless carriers to provide content and services such
as news, maps, and email for their wireless Web offerings. The
company reported that it counts 20 wireless carriers worldwide
as its customers.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=169495

InfoSpace also provides broadband and wireline Internet
services, and the company recently expanded its reach with its
purchase of website operator Go2Net, which closed during the
quarter. ""InfoSpace is better positioned than ever to leverage
four parallel areas with massive promise: wireless, merchant,
broadband, and wireline consumer services,"" said CEO Arun Sarin
in a prepared statement.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=169496

After skyrocketing last winter, the company's stock fell almost
as swiftly, declining 62% so far this year. Nevertheless, shares
rose in overnight trading as high as $24.50, from yesterday's
close at $20.31.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Just as PlayStation 2 units go on sale in the U.S., Sony Corp.
(NYSE: SNE) reported a 57% drop in profits for its fiscal second
quarter. Net income was down to 19.8 billion yen ($183 million),
from 46.5 billion yen ($430 million) in the year-earlier period.
Analysts' estimates were for 26.6 billion yen in profit. Revenue
rose only 3.7% to 1.69 trillion yen. Sales of the company's
electronic products were strong, and accounted for 80% of sales
in the quarter, but were offset by a 17% drop in revenue from
game operations and an 18% drop in sales from the music
division.

Electronic manufacturing services company SCI Systems (NYSE:
SCI) announced a 22% increase in sales and a 24% jump in
earnings yesterday for its first quarter 2001 (ended September
24). Net income reached $50.5 million, or $0.34 per share,
compared to $0.28 in the year-ago period. ""Continued
telecommunication product diversification and a lower sales
concentration in PC finished products led to higher operating
margins in the quarter,"" CEO Gene Sapp noted in a prepared statement.

Biotech company Chiron Corp. (Nasdaq: CHIR) reported a 30% jump
in third-quarter profits after yesterday's market close. Net
income reached $43.1 million, or $0.23 per share, up from $33
million, or $0.17 per share, in the year-earlier period, and
ahead of analysts' estimates of $0.17 per share. Sales of the
company's vaccines rose 11% to $78 million, while the company's
lead drug, Proleukin, brought in $21 million in revenue,
compared to $19 million in last year's third quarter. Some
analysts expected sales of Proleukin to reach $30 million. The
company's shares dropped about $2, or 4%, in after-hours
trading.

Internet security and name-registration company VeriSign
(Nasdaq: VRSN) blew away third-quarter estimates, reporting an
operating profit last night (excluding acquisition costs) of
$38.4 million, or $0.18 per share, significantly higher than the
$0.06 per share analysts expected. Sales leapt to $173.1 million
from $22.8 million a year ago. The company benefited from a full
quarter of business from newly acquired domain registrar Network
Solutions, which VeriSign purchased in June. For more
information on VeriSign, check out our Network Security Internet Report.

First of all, our operations representative, Barry O'Brien, mentioned how
pleasant and congenial your employees are at the plant. Thank you for your
hospitality.

Don, we would like some additional information as follows:
Could you please provide a complete asset listing that will be conveyed to
the new owner (including spare parts).


Questions

* There are currently 12 permanent staff assigned to Wheatland. Is
this a requirement due to switchyard interconnects or any other contractual
requirements?

* Do we understand that you are entering into a switchyard maintenance
contract for five years? If so, may we have a copy and what is the annual
cost?

* Are you willing to enter into an agreement to provide turbine
maintenance after the warranty?

JDS UNIPHASE'S WHITE-HOT Q1
The optical networking component maker's fiscal Q1 earnings came
in looking strong. Will they be enough to reverse this week's
mass sell-off in the sector?


By Dave Marino-Nachison

An upbeat fiscal first-quarter earnings report from fiber optic
components leader JDS Uniphase (Nasdaq: JSDU) following last
night's bell perked up investors in after-hours trading, pumping
the stock 12%, after a 25% plummet on Wednesday. JDSU and other
fiber optics companies, such as Sycamore Networks (Nasdaq: SCMR)
and Ciena (Nasdaq: CIEN), have been capsized by the wake of
Nortel's (NYSE: NT) earnings report from earlier in the week.
(Nortel is a major customer of JDSU.)

Nortel's optical networking division didn't grow as quickly as
some analysts hoped, which compounded another recent
disappointment from Lucent (NYSE: LU). But Rule Maker JDSU's
results sparkled: Revenues rose 171% year-over-year and, at $785
million, overcame the projections of market watchers. Pro forma
net income rose 29% to $0.18 per share, beating Street forecasts
by two pennies.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171083
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171084

Now JDSU expects to earn $0.80 per share -- a dime better than
expected -- for the fiscal year, CFO Tony Muller reportedly said
on a conference call. He also pointed investors toward top-line
growth of between 115% and 120%. ""Optical demand is good and
healthy,"" a Robertson Stephens analyst told Bloomberg.

""We believe demand remains strong,'' COO Charles Abbe was quoted
as saying. He maintains the company isn't seeing the inventory
channel grow fat at the expense of future sales: ""We can't find
any meaningful evidence of an industry slowdown.'' Look for Q2
pro forma earnings of $0.19 or $0.20 per share, execs said,
compared with $0.17 as projected by Wall Street.

While short-term market movements are of little interest to
Fools, today's trading should prove interesting as investors
work to make sense of the recent rash of seemingly conflicting
indications. While some might say the fiber optic sector was
merely due for a ""correction"" of sorts, of greater importance
are clues about the sort of demand that lies ahead to justify or
confound even today's damaged -- but still extremely high --
valuations.

Demand for the components that speed data transmissions and
fatten networks to meet skyrocketing bandwidth needs isn't
expected to slow significantly for the next several years. For
more information, check out a column Richard McCaffery wrote
back in July.

NEWS TO GO

Kellogg (NYSE: K) agreed to buy Keebler Foods (NYSE: KBL) for
$3.86 billion, or $42 a share, a 4.4% premium over Keebler's
$40.44 close yesterday. Kellogg will triple its debt load to
swallow Keebler, but buying the No. 2 cookie and cracker maker
helps it diversify its core breakfast cereals business, which
has seen no growth for a decade. Keebler and No. 1 snack maker
Nabisco Holdings Corp. (NYSE: NA) compete in a market growing at
4% a year. Philip Morris (NYSE: MO) will join its Kraft division
with its planned purchase of Nabisco Holdings, not to be
confused with Nabisco Group Holdings (NYSE: NGH), to be
purchased by R.J. Reynolds (NYSE: RJR).

Leading biopharmaceutical company Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN) reported
a pro forma 12% increase in revenues and an 18% increase in
earnings for the quarter ending September 30. However, the
company forecasted slower sales for its two main revenue
producers, Epogen and Neupogen, and said that approval of its
Kineret rheumatoid arthritis treatment could be delayed until
the second half of next year. Amgen's shares dropped to $59.50
in after-market trading, from $68.50 at the day's close.

Big-shot hedge fund manager Jeffrey Vinik announced that he was
returning most of the $4.2 billion in assets of Vinik Asset
Management so he can spend more time with his family. Most
investors remember Vinik, 41, as the manager appointed to
replace legendary Peter Lynch at Fidelity's Magellan Fund. Vinik
Asset Management reportedly turned in a four-year 645% return to
investors, 440% after fees.

Beleaguered Belgian voice recognition software maker Lernout &
Hauspie Speech Products (Nasdaq: LHSP) announced it would
resolve confidentiality agreements and release to Securities and
Exchange Commission and European Easdaq exchange investigators
the names of 30 investors in closely held companies that Lernout
says are customers. These Belgian and Singaporean companies
figure prominently into accusations of impropriety concerning
Lernout's Asian divisions' revenues. The Wall Street Journal has
run several stories hitting the company hard for alleged
questionable accounting, but the company has maintained that its
practices are legal and common in Europe, but misunderstood by
Americans. The disclosure news sank the stock price another 35%.

Don, a couple of questions.

2) Can I get a copy of the completed real estate purchase contracts and

Subject: Follow Up Items for DPL

Don,

The following are responses to items that I didn't have answers to during our 
meeting with DPL the other day.  I am not sure whether you would prefer to 
package them with your follow up items or send them independently.  Bracketed 
items require attention.


1)  Both the Remote Control Operation Agreement and the Interconnection 
Agreement with IPL were filed with the FERC.  [File stamped copies were sent 
to Hoff (and you) and should be incorporated into DealBench.];

2)  Regarding the question concerning document number 02.03.13 (Indiana 
Utility Regulatory Commission (""IURC"") Petition and Approval) - According to 
our local counsel (Parvin Price at Bose McKinney), no approval or other 
authorization from the IURC is required in connection with a change in 
ownership.  If our transaction was structured as a disposition of assets, 
however, IURC consent would be required.  [He also mentioned that: (i) the 
new buyer should contact the IURC (if they were ""smart"") to notify them of 
the change in control following closing (this may have been his pitch for 
further business) and (ii) pursuant to the IURC Order dated 8/99 West Fork 
has certain on-going reporting requirements (he wondered whether we had 
delivered these reports - this is probably a Gus or Dave question).];

3)  Regarding any obligation or covenant of West Fork under the PILOT 
Agreement, I have exchanged voicemails with John Gregg (our local counsel in 
Indiana).  He briefly indicated that there is some ""local expectation.""  But 
said that he wanted to check into it further.  [I will provide an update 
Monday.]; and

4)  A question was raised with respect to the use of the easement from 
Carnanhan to West Fork dated 11/30/99  (Recorded in DR 271, P 688).  [Keenan 
will need to provide an answer on this one.]  I sent him an email requesting 
a response on this one.

These were the only outstanding DPL items that were on my list.  I would 
expect that Keenan, Kellermeyer and Eghneim will be able to provide answers 
to questions 4 and 2, respectively, no later than noon on Monday.  I will 
endeavour to meet the same time schedule on question 3.  Please feel free to 
call with any questions.

Stuart

Don:

To confirm that we have scheduled a nominal two hour call on Monday (10/30)
at 1:30 CST to warp up the Peaker operational due diligence.  Duke has
arranged for a call in number  800/473-8492.  The conference host is Joe
Synnott.

Our focus on this call will be to review the status of our outstanding
requests and open questions.  An example of the former category are the
inspection reports at Gleason and the gas questions.  In the latter
category we still have some confusion about the units actual vs. guaranteed
performance data, status of the warranty items, historic transmission
performance, and relationship between the facility operations team and the
asset management function in Houston.    In addition our insurance staff
will be participating and will have some questions about the casualty loss
histories at the facilities.

Organizationally: please make available people on your team knowledgeable
in the operation and asset management of the facilities.  I would suggest
Ross, the plant managers, Mitch, and your environmental team.

Any questions, please don't hesitate to give me a call at 713-627-6579.

SHELL INKS $4.05 BILLION CHINA DEAL
After 12 years of talks, Shell and China National Offshore Oil
Corp. agreed to the largest Sino-foreign pact yet.

By Tom Jacobs

Patience is a virtue -- especially for foreign businesses in
China. According to Reuters, Shell Chemicals topped off 12 years
of negotiations with China National Offshore Oil Corp. by
signing a $4.05 billion petrochemical contract over the weekend.
The Chinese Xinhua news agency heralded the deal as the largest
joint venture yet between China and a foreign partner. Shell is
majority-owned by Netherlands-based energy powerhouse Royal
Dutch Petroleum (NYSE: RD), now facing increased worldwide
competition from the proposed merger between Chevron (NYSE: CHV)
and Texaco (NYSE: TX).
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=172918

The companies will build a petrochemical complex in the southern
city of Huizhou, Guangdong province, which will at first produce
ethylene and petrochemical products. Reuters reports Xinhua's
assertion that the new project brings technology for China to
make low-end chemical products. The $4.05 billion involves only
the Huizhou complex, for which construction will begin in 2003.
More cash will be pumped into a subsequent phase involving oil
refineries, according to Xinhua.

The deal supports one view that foreign business deals with
China and many Asian nations require years of relationship
development. Shell already operates more than 20 oil and
chemical projects in China, but even after talks extended from
1988 to an agreed-upon framework in 1997, it took until this
weekend to ink the final details.

Xinhua reports $330 billion in foreign direct investment in
China since economic liberalization began in the 1970s.
Front-page placement on the People's Daily showcases China's
current commitment to foreign deals. Others this year include
Motorola's (NYSE: MOT) $1.9 billion chip-making complex
contract, announced in August, and the on-again, off-again CDMA
phone deal with Qualcomm (Nasdaq: QCOM).
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Publishers Reed Elsevier (47% owned by Elsevier (NYSE: ENL)) and
Thomson Corp. announced a $4.45 billion cash purchase of rival
educational publisher Harcourt General (NYSE: H) on Friday. Reed
plans to keep Harcourt's medical, scientific, and technical
businesses. It will also retain the elementary and secondary
school textbook operations, but sell Harcourt's higher-education
and professional businesses to Thomson for $2.06 billion.
Harcourt closed Friday up 9.05% to $56.81.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=172919

The Wall Street Journal reports that Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT)
and News Corp. (NYSE: NWS) are in talks over a possible
Microsoft $1 billion investment in Sky Global, News Corp.'s
global satellite TV asset and investment arm. News Corp. had
hoped to spin off Sky Global this year, but the move has been
reportedly postponed until next year due to the softening market
for public offerings.

DaimlerChrysler (NYSE: DCX) said it would shut down seven North
American manufacturing plants for a week -- four in the U.S. and
three in Canada. Spokesman Juergen Wittman told Reuters: ""We
want to catch up with demand. We need to balance our inventory.""
Wittman also said the action has nothing do with earnings or
Friday's 1.4 million unit Dodge, Chrysler, and Plymouth minivan
recall due to seal leaks.

The Wall Street Journal reports that Loral Space &
Communications (NYSE: LOR) CEO Bernard Schwartz is in talks with
Societe Europeene des Satellites about injecting cash or
partnering with the weakened company. Loral has been hit by
stumbles of its 40%-owned low-earth orbit satellite venture,
Globalstar (Nasdaq: GSTRF) -- whose satellite communications
system has seen a slower subscriber ramp -- and the hangover
from the failed Iridium satellite telephony venture. The Journal
reported that Schwartz promises not to put more cash into
Globalstar unless it makes sense compared to other stand-alone
investments. Loral has already pumped in $1 billion of the $4.3
billion Globalstar cash diet, and is slated to assume $500
million in debt by the end of the year. Loral's share price
closed Friday at $5.19 -- less than Globalstar's finish at $6.

Enjoy Friday's Foolish market wrap-up with a swift click!

Thank you.
_______________________________________________________________

We appreciate your assistance in providing the responses to the
environmental questions regarding Gleason and the SPCC issue referenced on
the draft schedules.  The following questions are still outstanding,
however, from October 23 and October 25 despite your indication that the
responses to at least the October 23 questions would be available last
week.   Given the fast approaching bid deadline and the importance of the
responses to our due diligence review, we would appreciate receiving the
responses as quickly as possible.  For your convenience, the following is
the list of our outstanding questions:

Questions for All Facilities

1.  What are the limitations on the number of hours that each facility can
operate and what is the source of those limitations?

2.  We understand that there are tentative expansion plans for each
facility.  Were these future expansion plans disclosed to the regulating
agencies at the time that the air permits were applied for, particularly at
those facilities which did not undergo PSD review?

3.  Which facilities are required to perform continuous emissions
monitoring pursuant to its air permits?  For those facilities performing
CEM, please provide the last two years of data.

4.  Are the facilities FERC jurisdictional for environmental impact
statement purposes pursuant to 18 C.F.R. Part 380?  We noticed that the
only facility with information about this issue was the pipeline at
Lincoln, although the information seemed to suggest that only the pipeline
was subject to the EIS process.  See 2.02.12.G.  Was the rest of the
Lincoln facility subject to the EIS process?  What was the outcome of the
EIS process for the pipeline?

5.  What is Enron's understanding of the process required to transfer the
environmental permits for each facility in connection with the proposed
transaction?  For example, the 1995 stormwater permit for LV Cogen appears
to be triggered by a change in control of the facility.  See 6.02.03 at
page 16.  Do other permits have similar provisions?

6.  Will any environmental property transfer or comparable statutes (e.g.
the Illinois Responsible Property Transfer Act) be triggered by the
proposed transaction?

7. We have reviewed the United States Environmental Protection Agency
comments for the air permit at LV Cogen II, as discussed below.  Did U.S.
EPA provide any additional comments on the air permits for LV Cogen II or
any other facility?

Lincoln Facility

1.  Does the Lincoln facility have an air operating permit from the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency?  If so, please provide a copy.
If not, please explain status.

2.  Were any wetlands impacted by the construction of the facility and, if
so, what permits were obtained?  Will any wetlands be impacted by future
expansion plans?  ENSR's conclusion on this issue seemed unclear,
particularly with respect to the 30 acre parcel.  See 02.03.09C.

Wheatland Facility

1.  We understand that the Wheatland facility may seek a NPDES permit to
discharge wastewater directly to the White River.  How is this wastewater
currently managed?  Why is the facility considering changing the management
method to direct discharge under a NPDES permit?  If there are associated
cost savings with a NPDES permit, what are they estimated to be?  We
understand that the source of the water that is discharged is a pond
associated with mining operations.  Who is the owner of the pond?  Are any
water extraction permits needed to remove water from this pond and, if so,
have they been obtained?  We also understand that sampling was recently
performed of the water.  Please provide copies of this analysis and any
associated documentation.

LV Cogen

1.  The Industrial User Discharge Permit on Dealbench appears to have
expired on July 1, 2000.  See 6.02.02.  Was it renewed?  If so, please
provide copy.

2.  The stormwater discharge permit for LV Cogen appears to be expired.
See 06.02.03.  Was it renewed?  If so, please provide copy.

3.  Does Sunco hold any environmental permits in its own name?  If so,
please provide copies.

LV Cogen II

1.  EPA contends in its March 23, 1998 and March 24, 2000 letters that BACT
for LV Cogen II was SCONOx and/or XONON.  See 06.01.09.1.   How was this
issue resolved?  Can LV Cogen II meet the 2 ppm NOx limit in the draft
operating permit with the technology that has been proposed?  See 06.01.15.

2.  It appears that the State of Nevada has contended that certain
equipment replacement should have undergone new source review in their June
13, 2000 memo.  See 16.03.6.    How was this resolved?  What is EPA's view
on this issue?

Schedules for LV Cogen I and II

1.  Schedule 4.1(i) references an annual audit of the CEM system in May
2000.  Is this audit on Dealbench and/or can we get a copy of it?

2.  Please provide a copy and/or reference to a Dealbench document for the
Phase I referenced on Schedule 4.1(n).

3.  Please provide copies and/or references to Dealbench documents for the
items listed as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 on Schedule 4.1(u).  [Note that we have
reviewed the 1995 storm water permit, but did not see an indication that it
is automatically renewed.  Is this reflected elsewhere?]

Thanks for the response.  We had previously received the response regarding
the SPCC plan issue but I had not seen the responses for the Lincoln
facility (although I had received Gleason last week).  Just to confirm what
is outstanding:  The questions relating to all facilities sent on 10/23,
the questions relating to Wheatland sent on 10/23, the questions relating
to LV Cogen I and II sent on 10/23, and the questions relating to the LV
Cogen I and II schedules sent on 10/25.  Please let me know if this is not
consistent with your understanding of what is outstanding.  Thanks.

P.S.  You had also indicated in your 10/25 email that the letter from TDEC
regarding the Subpart GG variance would be faxed to me.  To date, I have
not yet received it.  Thanks.

Just wanted to let you know that the Gleason SOP is on DealBench - Doc. # 
04.01.09.  This was a question that I don't think we had previously 
answered.  Also, question #4 of this attachment, which I sent to you earlier 
today, will be answered tomorrow.  Here is also the '01 O&M Budgets.  Thanks!

Thanks for the response.  We had previously received the response regarding
the SPCC plan issue but I had not seen the responses for the Lincoln
facility (although I had received Gleason last week).  Just to confirm what
is outstanding:  The questions relating to all facilities sent on 10/23,
the questions relating to Wheatland sent on 10/23, the questions relating
to LV Cogen I and II sent on 10/23, and the questions relating to the LV
Cogen I and II schedules sent on 10/25.  Please let me know if this is not
consistent with your understanding of what is outstanding.  Thanks.

P.S.  You had also indicated in your 10/25 email that the letter from TDEC
regarding the Subpart GG variance would be faxed to me.  To date, I have
not yet received it.  Thanks.

I believe we have already sent you the answers to these questions.  They
were sent to Tom Irwin.  Here are some of them again.  The rest of the
answers for the peakers will follow shortly - we are cleaning them up a
little.

Don:

To confirm that we have scheduled a nominal two hour call on Monday (10/30)
at 1:30 CST to warp up the Peaker operational due diligence.  Duke has
arranged for a call in number  800/473-8492.  The conference host is Joe
Synnott.

Our focus on this call will be to review the status of our outstanding
requests and open questions.  An example of the former category are the
inspection reports at Gleason and the gas questions.  In the latter
category we still have some confusion about the units actual vs. guaranteed
performance data, status of the warranty items, historic transmission
performance, and relationship between the facility operations team and the
asset management function in Houston.    In addition our insurance staff
will be participating and will have some questions about the casualty loss
histories at the facilities.

Organizationally: please make available people on your team knowledgeable
in the operation and asset management of the facilities.  I would suggest
Ross, the plant managers, Mitch, and your environmental team.

Any questions, please don't hesitate to give me a call at 713-627-6579.

Margaret,

I graduated with my MBA in 1998 from UT and am participating in the Graduate
Business Network prospective student recruiting effort.  I currently work at
Enron Corporation in Houston.  A fellow colleague of mine at Enron has
applied for the full-time MBA program for Fall 2000.  The applicant's name
is Ben Rogers and I believe that he would be an outstanding contribution to
the program.  He is very well respected at Enron from a commercial
perspective as well as analytically.

He is planning to be in Austin on February 18 to attend the Q&A session and
will also be meeting with several professors.  I think that it would also be
helpful for him to meet with you or another member of the admissions
committee.  In case you need to contact Ben directly, his office phone
number is (713) 853-7998 and email is brogers2@enron.com.

Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Thank you,

Paul Burkhart

LIFTOFF AT EXPEDIA
Expedia tops estimates. Is the flight plan due north?

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

Online travel specialist Expedia (Nasdaq: EXPE) has been cleared
for takeoff this morning after stellar fiscal first-quarter
results. Revenues soared 115% to $76.5 million on $467 million
in gross travel bookings.

Even more impressive was the fact that the company generated
positive operating cash flow. That may not last in the near term
as the company expects to ramp up marketing efforts that will
bulk up operating expenses. However, Expedia is still on track
to be profitable on an earnings basis by the summer of 2002.

The quarterly loss absent noncash charges was just $1.6 million,
or $0.04 a share. That was substantially better than
projections, which were calling for a deficit between $0.25 and
$0.27 a share.

The analyst-besting results continue the e-travel trend set by
Travelocity.com (Nasdaq: TVLY) two weeks ago. But probably the
most encouraging metric for the online travel industry as a
whole -- a gauge that seems to be buried deep in the data -- is
the rising conversion rate, or what Travelocity calls the
""lookers-to-bookers"" ratio.

On a sequential basis, Expedia's conversion rate climbed from
4.1% to 4.6%. Over the past year, Travelocity users have gone
from a 3.8% conversion ratio to a stunning 6.8%.

Why is this so important? It vindicates the industry. While
jaded cybersurfers seem less willing to click on banner ads or
fall for spam, they have clearly embraced the notion of booking
travel online in growing numbers. Since e-travel is fully
scalable and information-intensive (not inventory
warehouse-based) the incremental growth is the best way to
assure a smooth flight to eventual profitability.

Expedia closed out the quarter with $122.3 million in cash. Half
of that came from recent financing that included the deep
pockets of Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), which still owns 70% of the
company after a November 1999 spin-off. The greenbacks? Well,
that just makes for a bigger seat cushion for the company as it
glides past the next few quarters. And you know what they say
about airline seat cushions, don't you? In case of emergency,
they can be used as a flotation device.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Santa Claus isn't the only one decked out in red this time of
year. Leading playthings online retailer eToys (Nasdaq: ETYS)
reported wider losses for the September quarter. However, the
company expects the deficit to narrow for the critical December
period with improving results next year en route to breaking
even come 2002. Like Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN) last week, eToys
will be mailing out a print catalog this season to lure holiday
shoppers online.

All's well that's Alcatel (NYSE: ALA). Europe's second-leading
telecommunications equipment maker bucked the trend set earlier
by companies such as Lucent (NYSE: LU) and Nortel (NYSE: NT) and
reported stronger-than-projected results. Profits more than
tripled as the French company upgraded its sales outlook for the
year.

Are HMO stocks feeling better? Quarterly profits rose at Humana
(NYSE: HUM) while analysts expected bottom-line results to be in
line with last year's showing. The company credits its tighter
cost controls and the flexibility to raise premiums as the
catalysts for the healthy showing.

HEALTHSOUTH (NYSE: HRC) also came in for its quarterly checkup
and reported record revenues and profits of $0.18 a share -- in
line with analyst expectations. Like Humana, HEALTHSOUTH was
also encouraged by favorable pricing trends. Hey! That means
we're paying more for HMO service, doesn't it? I thought so.
Stay healthy and avoid eating any unwrapped candy tonight.

Subject: Wheatland Information Needed


Don, based on our conference call last week and the fax sent to me, I am
still in need of the following:
* The air permit to construct application as submitted to IDEM and any
correspondence related to the application.  I do not need the actual permit
as issued by IDEM.
* Petition for Alternate testing.  The cover page was faxed.  Dave
Kellermeyer was to Fed Ex the remainder.  If this has been done, let me
know.  I will have to track it down.
* Determination of EPCRA reporting requirements for lead acid
batteries.

Additionally, we discussed yesterday a request for any analytical data
associated with the Lake Acquisition property, particularly sediment samples
from the lake bottom.

Thanks for your help.

Don:

I looked into the EPCRA reporting requirements for Sulfuric acid and lead in 
batteries. This is a one time report to the State's emergency planning 
committee, the local emergency response department, and the local fire 
department declaring the presence of sulfuric acid and lead in quantities 
greater than 500 lb and 10,000 lb, respectively.  These notifications are 
being mailed out today. I have not had a chance to do a detailed calculation 
of the amounts. I will do an analysis over the next few months to determine 
if we are required to also annually report by March 1st every year.

Dave will answer the first two issues below.

Thanks.

Gus

One minor follow-up question: the stormwater permit for LV Cogen at
Dealbench expired on May 14, 1998 (see 6.2.3).  The Notice of Intent to
continue coverage is dated May 4, 2000 (see 6.2.3.1).  Was there coverage
under a stormwater permit between 1998 and 2000?  Thanks.

With regards to the Demin water system, there are no capitalized charges in 
these cost figures - everything is expensed.  With respects to the 
Electricity, there is a Demand Charge included in this numer, which makes up 
approximately 50% of the cost.  The rest is attributable to energy costs.  
These costs are levelized for the full 12 months of the year.  Please let me 
know if you have any other comments.  Thanks!

With regards to the air permit to construct application, Jinsung will send it

The Petition for Alternate testing, has been sent to you;
3.     This is a one time report to the State's emergency planning committee, 
the local emergency response department, and the local fire department 
declaring the presence of sulfuric acid and lead in quantities greater than 
500 lb and 10,000 lb, respectively.  These notifications are being mailed out

4.     We are in the process of tracking down the analytical data associated 
with the Lake Acquisition property and will hopefully have that to you later 
today.

I hope this helps and please give us a call if you have any more questions.

Subject: Re: Lincoln - EIS issue REVISED ANSWER  

4.  Are the facilities FERC jurisdictional for environmental impact statement 
purposes pursuant to 18 C.F.R. Part 380?
  Assuming the ""facilities"" are the lateral and interconnect, the answer is 
no.

We noticed that the only facility with information about this issue was the 
pipeline at Lincoln, although the information seemed to suggest that only the 
pipeline was subject to the EIS process.  See 2.02.12.G.  Was the rest of the 
Lincoln facility subject to the EIS process?

 Fred - someone other than me will have to answer this question as I assume 
the ""Lincoln facility"" refers to the plant.
 I also need to see document 2.02.12G in order to see why they believe the 
pipeline was subject to the EIS process.

 What was the outcome of the EIS process for the pipeline?

 The interconnect facilities upstream of the intersection of the lateral and 
N. Border's Manhattan Station are subject to FERC jurisdiction.  N. Border 
completed the hot tap and interconnect facilities ( the permanent will be 
finished by December 1) under its blanket authorization and in compliance 
with any notice and/or permitting requirements.  As for the lateral, this was 
handled by Peoples.  Fred or Dave may be in a better position to ascertain 
any EIS process completed by Peoples.

Don:

The questions that I was unable to answer for Excelon (PECO) during the 
Lincoln site visit are as follows:

1.  What is the gas consumption per unit during start-up?

2.  What is the reference # for the 2nd ComEd Interconnection Feasibility 
Study?  Is this document on deal bench?

3.  Do any other parties have a right to interconnect to the Project's gas 
pipeline lateral?


My input to these questions is:

1.  None.  I am not familiar with this area.

2.  I saw this 2nd study is out on deal bench at least a week ago.  As long 
as it wasn't removed, it should be there.   I do not know the reference #.

3.  I do not believe that any other parties have a right to connect to the 
gas lateral owned by Des Plaines LLC.  (In fact,  I believe that we are 
statutorily prevented from supplying gas to other end users - Des Plaines LLC 
is neither an interstate pipeline nor a gas LDC).  Please confirm my opinion 
with Stuart/Chris Meyer to make sure that we have not granted any 
interconnection rights to Northern Border/Peoples.

Call me to discuss.

Subject: Excelon questions - Lincoln

Don:

The questions that I was unable to answer for Excelon (PECO) during the 
Lincoln site visit are as follows:

1.  What is the gas consumption per unit during start-up?

2.  What is the reference # for the 2nd ComEd Interconnection Feasibility 
Study?  Is this document on deal bench?

3.  Do any other parties have a right to interconnect to the Project's gas 
pipeline lateral?


My input to these questions is:

1.  None.  I am not familiar with this area.

2.  I saw this 2nd study is out on deal bench at least a week ago.  As long 
as it wasn't removed, it should be there.   I do not know the reference #.

3.  I do not believe that any other parties have a right to connect to the 
gas lateral owned by Des Plaines LLC.  (In fact,  I believe that we are 
statutorily prevented from supplying gas to other end users - Des Plaines LLC 
is neither an interstate pipeline nor a gas LDC).  Please confirm my opinion 
with Stuart/Chris Meyer to make sure that we have not granted any 
interconnection rights to Northern Border/Peoples.

Call me to discuss.

Fred

Thanks for the fast reply.  I changed it online, but I wanted to make sure I 
wasn't booked for two different times.  Also, are you able to tell me who I 
will be meeting with?  I am meeting with a couple professors before my 
Admissions Visit and just wanted to know who I was going to meet with from 
your office.  Thanks!

Subject: Re: Lincoln - EIS issue REVISED ANSWER  

4.  Are the facilities FERC jurisdictional for environmental impact statement 
purposes pursuant to 18 C.F.R. Part 380?
  Assuming the ""facilities"" are the lateral and interconnect, the answer is 
no.

We noticed that the only facility with information about this issue was the 
pipeline at Lincoln, although the information seemed to suggest that only the 
pipeline was subject to the EIS process.  See 2.02.12.G.  Was the rest of the 
Lincoln facility subject to the EIS process?

 Fred - someone other than me will have to answer this question as I assume 
the ""Lincoln facility"" refers to the plant.
 I also need to see document 2.02.12G in order to see why they believe the 
pipeline was subject to the EIS process.

 I am not aware of an EIS being prepared for the Lincoln Energy Center 
project.  I talked with Dave Kellermeyer and he was not aware of an EIS 
being   prepared for Lincoln.  I have sent an email to Dave Lazzaro at 
Peoples Energy to determine if an EIS was completed for the pipeline.  I will 
forward you his  response.

 What was the outcome of the EIS process for the pipeline?

 The interconnect facilities upstream of the intersection of the lateral and 
N. Border's Manhattan Station are subject to FERC jurisdiction.  N. Border 
completed the hot tap and interconnect facilities ( the permanent will be 
finished by December 1) under its blanket authorization and in compliance 
with any notice and/or permitting requirements.  As for the lateral, this was 
handled by Peoples.  Fred or Dave may be in a better position to ascertain 
any EIS process completed by Peoples. 

 My request to Peoples is in progress (see comment above).

_______________________________________________________________

Thanks for the response.  According to my records, the outstanding
questions are as follows:

Wheatland

We understand that the Wheatland facility may seek a NPDES permit to
discharge wastewater directly to the White River.  How is this wastewater
currently managed?  Why is the facility considering changing the management
method to direct discharge under a NPDES permit?  If there are associated
cost savings with a NPDES permit, what are they estimated to be?  We
understand that the source of the water that is discharged is a pond
associated with mining operations.  Who is the owner of the pond?  Are any
water extraction permits needed to remove water from this pond and, if so,
have they been obtained?  We also understand that sampling was recently
performed of the water.  Please provide copies of this analysis and any
associated documentation.

Gleason

You indicated in the response to the Gleason questions that the variance
request for Subpart GG had been approved by TDEC and the approval would be
faxed to me.  To date, I have not received it.

LV Cogen

Earlier today, I asked a follow-up question on the coverage under the storm
water permit from 1998 to 2000.  I did not see an explanation of this gap
in the attached responses.


Given the approaching bid deadline, we would appreciate receiving this
information as soon as possible.

PRC Representatives
Thank you for your participation in the year-end 2000 PRC.  Listed below are 
the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:



As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts) 
and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is 
essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduct 
a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The 
pre-ratings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and 
available for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a 
secondary supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts 
feedback.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or 
Associates/Analysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.  
The Associate and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the 
completed feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system 
is closed.  The more information that you can secure regarding your 
Associates/Analysts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated 
correctly at the final PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are 
unsure of the process, please contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or 
Shelly Butler at x3-4584 with any questions.

Supervisors
You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the 
Associates/Analysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate 
this feedback including your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at 
your business unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not 
conducting a pre-rating meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the 
rating you provide is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.  
Please contact the PEP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at 
x3-5230 if you are unable to load this data yourself.  You should wait to 
provide feedback to your Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have 
been made to avoid any confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final 
cross-calibration and may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are 
responsible for contacting the PRC Representative listed above whom will be 
representing your Associates/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind 
that the more information you can provide, either verbal or written, will 
ensure that the final PRC is a success.

Associates/Analysts
You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received 
your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received this, 
please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the system 
and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how many 
people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving your 
reviewers.  Remember that it is important to select a broad range of 
reviewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will 
also be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the 
opportunity to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you 
have added value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may 
hear from your PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do 
not, we suggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing.  

An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 2000 
at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and 
Analysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be 
communicated to the Supervisor by 12/31/00.  The feedback should be 
communicated to the Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.  If the 
Associates/Analysts have not received feedback by the deadline, they should 
contact their Career Development Manager (Jana Giovannini x3-9233 or Shelly 
Butler x3-4584).  Thank you for your cooperation and we look forward to a 
successful final PRC

WORLDCOM TO SPLIT INTO TWO
Telecom company WorldCom is going to create a tracking stock for
its MCI division.

By LouAnn Lofton

In an effort to boost its sagging stock price, and unlock
greater opportunities for the parts of its business that are
growing the quickest, telecommunications company WorldCom
(Nasdaq: WCOM) announced restructuring plans this morning. The
company, which has seen its stock tumble from a 52-week high in
November 1999 of $61.33 to its current price of around $23, will
create a tracking stock for its MCI business. The ticker for the
new stock will be MCIT.

WorldCom shareholders will receive one share of MCI for every 25
shares of WorldCom they own. The distribution of MCI stock is
expected to happen by the end of the first half of 2001.

Tracked under the new MCIT ticker will be WorldCom's
slowest-growing divisions. The bulk of the operations that will
be reflected with the tracking stock are WorldCom's
long-distance and dial-up Internet services for consumers and
small businesses. These parts of WorldCom's business generate
about $16 billion in annual revenues.

The split leaves WorldCom with the best-performing and
highest-growth businesses. That includes its Internet and data
businesses, its international business, and its wireless
business. These divisions of WorldCom contribute annual revenues
of around $23 billion, with $16 billion coming from the
company's data, Internet, and international operations.

WorldCom also issued earnings guidance this morning. The company
said it sees fourth-quarter earnings per share coming in between
$0.34 and $0.37. Analysts as polled by First Call/Thompson
Financial were looking for $0.49 a share. The company pointed to
""intense pricing pressures, unfavorable foreign exchange rates
and the shift of consumer voice to wireless technologies"" as the
reasons for the shortfall. It also lowered expectations for its
next fiscal year.

WorldCom's decision to split its businesses comes not long after
a similar move from competitor AT&T (NYSE: T), which announced
last week that it will split itself into four parts.

NEWS TO GO

Health insurance company Aetna (NYSE: AET) announced
third-quarter earnings this morning. Operating earnings,
excluding onetime items, dropped to $158.1 million from $184.1
million last year. On a per-share basis, that translates into
$1.10 a share, versus $1.21 a year ago. Analysts were expecting
$0.90 a share. Revenues climbed 15% to $8.1 billion. In last
year's third quarter, Aetna's revenues were $7.1 billion.

Airborne Freight (NYSE: ABF) reported a third-quarter loss last
night that was greater than had been expected. The company lost
$5.5 million in the quarter, or $0.11 a share. It warned
analysts in September to look for a loss of between $0.05 and
$0.10 a share. Previously, analysts had expected a profit of
$0.28 a share. After the September warning, the consensus
estimate fell to a loss of $0.07 a share. Airborne Freight
blamed high fuel costs and softness in its core domestic
business for the shortfall. In last year's third quarter,
Airborne Freight earned $21.6 million, or $0.44 a share.

Broadband company Covered Communications (Nasdaq: COVD)
acknowledged today that CEO Robert Knowling will resign. This
comes just two weeks after Covad reported a wider-than-expected
loss for the third quarter. The company's stock has been pounded
this year, falling from a high of $66.63 to around $5 a share.
Frank Marshall, one of Covad's directors, has been named interim
CEO. Former chief and founder Charles McMinn will assume the
role of chairman.

Computer Sciences (NYSE: CSC), the information technology
services company, announced that it's inked a $2.2 billion
agreement with British defense contractor BAE Systems. The
agreement is for six years and replaces a current agreement
between the two which expires in March 2004. Under the deal,
Computer Sciences will manage BAE's IT infrastructure in the
United Kingdom and here in the states.

Here's our local counsel's response on the Duke question relating any 
contractual obligations (in Indiana) to retain a certain minimum number of 
employees.  His answer relates specifically to the tax abatement that we 
received.  In his memo, he suggests that we speak with John Gregg (which as 
you both know I have already done).  He mentioned that going below nine 
employees would likely ruffle some political feathers.  If I am not mistaken, 
however, I believe that we have more than nine people and therefore there 
might be some economies that are achievable by a potential buyer.

ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. I'm interested in REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts),
but I don't understand what ""FFO"" refers to. Can you explain?

-- A. REITs look and act much like ordinary stocks, but peek
under their hoods and you'll see a different kind of company.
REITs typically own many properties, such as offices, hotels or
apartments. With most companies, net income is a useful number
to evaluate, reflecting the profits left over from sales after
all expenses have been subtracted. With REITs, though, net
income isn't as meaningful.

According to accounting rules, the value of REIT properties is
decreased over time, with depreciation charged against net
income, reducing it. In reality, however, these properties are
probably not falling in value and may even be appreciating. So a
REIT's net income tends to understate its health. This is why,
with REITs, you should look at the ""funds from operation,"" or
FFO, instead. They ignore the effect of depreciation and other
non-cash charges to help you see a REIT's true performance.

-- Q. I often see S&P futures referred to on CNBC. Can you
explain what futures are and why they're important?

-- A. Futures are typically for commodities like lumber,
soybeans and orange juice. They represent contracts between two
parties to buy or sell a certain amount for a specified price at
a set future date. (Fail to pay attention, and you risk having
to take delivery of truckloads of pork bellies!)

With S&P 500 futures, each day the party who bet wrong is
obligated to pony up cash based on the price of the S&P 500.
Futures are bought by some investors to protect themselves
against unfavorable price swings or by speculators betting on
where the market is going. They can be very risky.

Un-Foolish short-term investors pay a lot of attention to S&P
futures, as they can indicate the market's likely moves before
trading begins for the day. We don't fret about futures, though,
remembering that for most of this century, the S&P 500 has
advanced about 11 percent per year, on average.

_________________________________________________________________


INVESTING BASICS - DEBATING DEBT

Many investors think that debt on a company's balance sheet is a
red flag. In truth, though, debt can be both bad and good.

First, the bad. If a company is saddled with a lot of debt, it's
locked into interest payments that it must make. If it doesn't
have the cash to cover these at any point, it's in deep doodoo.
Many individuals can probably relate to this, having experienced
the dark side of debt when racking up charges on credit cards.

Now, the good. Consider that most people would never be able to
buy their homes without debt. Without car and school loans, many
of us would probably be driving used cars and taking
correspondence courses we found on matchbook covers.

Debt can be a boon for businesses, too. Many great companies,
such as Federal Express and the Walt Disney Co., came to life
because of early loans to their founders. Established companies
can make good use of debt, as well, borrowing to expand
operations and grow business. Interest payments also decrease a
company's taxable income, as they're deductible. Investors
willing to consider companies with debt need to evaluate whether
the debt taken on is manageable and whether the capital raised
and invested is earning more than it costs.

Perhaps you're worried about the debt load of
Fingernail-on-Blackboard Car Alarm Co. (ticker: AIEEE). Glance
at the notes in the annual report and you may find that the
effective interest rate for its debt is just 5 percent. If AIEEE
is putting the borrowed funds to work earning say, 8 percent,
then things aren't so bad.

When companies need money, they typically have two main choices:
They can issue more stock or debt. Issuing stock can dilute the
value of existing shares. Issuing debt can sometimes be more
efficient, as its after-tax cost can be much cheaper than
equity. All things being equal, though, we prefer to see little
debt on a balance sheet.

Companies that can grow without using debt or issuing extra
stock are in a more powerful position than other firms. Still,
you needn't balk at the first sight of debt. Just evaluate it
carefully.

The document indicates that EPA will not object to the State approving the

have a copy of that approval or a reference to where it is on Dealbench?
Thanks.

 Thanks for the informative infomation session this past Friday.  Also, thank 
you for taking the time to listen to my situation regarding my application 
and talking to Dr. Harris for me.  After meeting with many of the faculty and 
staff (Professors Brown, Titman, Jemison & Ronn) at the School, my desire to 
attend the School is quite strong.  The School is a perfect fit for the 
career I am trying to pursue in energy and is a institution where I would be 
able to contribute to and learn from the energy-finance program due to my 
experiences with Enron.  Eventhough I have tested poorly on tests such as the 
GMAT, I feel that the rest of my application is quite strong and that I have 
proven that I can successfully compete in a competitive environment (ie. 
Enron).  I excel in environments (team-oriented) such as described by the 
many people I talked with at the Texas B-School.  
 Again, thanks for taking the time to talk with me about my application and 
it was good to see someone from Boston, who lived in DC and was now living in 
Texas, such as myself.  

Regards,

Ben Rogers"

""Only a fool holds out for the top dollar."" -- Joseph Kennedy


AUTO SALES SLOWDOWN
After a bang-up year, car companies report slow sales in October.

By Chris Rugaber

To the surprise of some observers, many U.S. and international
automakers reported sales declines for the month of October,
with the exception of General Motors (NYSE: GM), which benefited
from heavy discounts. Figures from Autodata Corp. show that
industrywide sales fell 0.9% from October of last year, while
forecasts were for a 3.6% increase, according to a Bloomberg
report.

Sales of Ford's (NYSE: F) North American-built vehicles dropped
6.3%, partly due to a 16% decline in sales of its Explorer
model. Ford cut production of the Explorer in September in order
to redirect tires to the company's Explorer recall effort. The
Chrysler arm of DaimlerChrysler (NYSE: DCX) reported an 8.4%
drop, while Honda's (NYSE: HMC) sales fell 5.6% and Toyota
(NYSE: TM) experienced a 5.7% downturn. The monthly sales
decline was Honda's first since August 1998, and Toyota's first
since December 1999.

GM bucked the trend, reporting a 7% increase in sales. The
world's largest automaker increased its U.S. market share to
30.3%, up 2.1% since last October. What effect this will have on
the company's bottom line is unclear, given that the company
aggressively utilized cash-back incentives and low-rate loans,
partly in response to similar efforts from Chrysler. Yesterday,
GM announced new promotions for its full-size pickups, while
Chrysler said earlier this week that it would offer new
discounts for its 2001 minivans.

October's slowdown comes after robust sales earlier this year,
and the industry is still on track to beat last year's sales
record. Nevertheless, according to a Wall Street Journal report,
industry observers now forecast a decline next year, from an
estimated 17.2 million units in 2000 to 16.5 million in 2001,
and a 5% decline in production from the ""Big Three"" U.S.
automakers.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Media conglomerate Seagram (NYSE: VO) benefited from strong
music and film sales in its fiscal first quarter (ended
September 30), with profit from operations reaching $21 million,
or $0.05 per share, beating analysts' estimates of $0.03 per
share. Revenues dipped 2.9%, however, to $5.34 billion, which
the company attributed to the strong dollar and the sales of
several businesses. Paris-based Vivendi (NYSE: V) plans to
purchase Seagram and this may be the company's last report as an
independent entity. Shareholders for Seagram and Vivendi are
scheduled to vote on the transaction on December 5, with the
acquisition expected to close several days later.

Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) reported another decline in same-store
sales yesterday. The largest U.S. clothing chain announced that
October same-store sales dropped 2%, thanks to discounts on
back-to-school merchandise. CFO Heidi Kunz said that the company
expects a ""significant"" decline in gross margin for the third
quarter (ended October 28), according to a Bloomberg report, and
that earnings will be between $0.20 and $0.22 per share, below
current estimates of $0.23 per share. Prior to lowering
expectations in August, estimates were for the company to earn
$0.41 per share.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=179470

Domestic queen Martha Stewart Omnimedia (NYSE: MSO) reported
strong revenue and earnings growth this morning, thanks to sales
increases in the company's publishing, television, and
Internet/direct commerce divisions. Net income more than doubled
from the year-ago period to $3.8 million, or $0.08 per share,
handily beating analysts' estimates of $0.01 per share. Revenue
increased 24.2% to $61.9 million, from $49.8 million in last
year's third quarter.

Laser-maker Coherent (Nasdaq: COHR) cut through fourth-quarter
analysts' estimates last night, reporting strong sales and
earnings growth and sending the company's shares up in
after-hours trading. Sales jumped 18% over last year's fourth
quarter to $155 million, and net income, excluding an
extraordinary gain, was up 56% to $11.4 million, or $0.45 per
share. The company was expected to earn $0.36 per share.
Revenues for the full year were up 21% to $568.3 million, and
earnings were up 61% to $36.3 million. Coherent also reported an
after-tax gain of $32.3 million from its 60% ownership in a
German subsidiary that went public in September.

Well,

Laurel told me you are interested in crewing in the upcoming Circuit race
(11th & 12th).  Sounds good.  How much experience to you have on the pointy
end of the boat??

I have a tentative crew but he would like to do middle and tactics.  He was
supposed to get back with me over the weekend but has not done so yet.

Laurel mentioned that you know someone else.  They have any experience??

How are you on tactics??

Greg

PRICELINE THINS ITS RANKS
The Internet discount company announced a third-quarter loss,
the resignation of its CFO, and a restructuring plan.

By Mike Trigg

Embattled name-your-price Internet discount company
priceline.com (Nasdaq: PCLN) announced a third-quarter loss
after the market's close yesterday that met lowered Street
expectations. In addition, the company announced the resignation
of CFO Heidi Miller and a restructuring plan that includes
cutting 16% of its workforce.

Priceline posted a fiscal third-quarter (ended September 30) net
loss of $2 million, or $0.01 per share, compared to a lose of
$11.9 million, or $0.08 per share, a year ago. Revenue came in
at $341 million, slightly below expectations. Moreover, the
company forecasts a sequential revenue decline for the fourth
quarter, continuing to see signs of weak demand.

President and CEO Daniel Schulman blamed the revenue shortfall
on negative publicity and problems with its airline ticket
business. Priceline continues to be dogged by consumer
complaints, highlighted by the revelation that popular company
spokesman William Shatner has never used the services himself.
In the airline business, the company has experienced adverse
effects from rising fuel prices and airlines' own discounts.

Looking to perform some damage control, the company also
announced a number of restructuring moves. Priceline announced
it would fire 87 of its 535 employees, forcing it to take a
charge for an undisclosed amount that will hurt fourth-quarter
results. Also, the company will take a $9 million non-cash
charge due to a change in a warrant held by Delta Air Lines
(NYSE: DAL).

The company finished the quarter with $131 million in cash and
short-term investments, not all that bad depending on the burn
rate, although no guidance has been given. Nevertheless, the
debate still wages on with this company regarding the
survivability of is business model. With 80% of its revenues
derived from airline ticket sales, it comes as no surprise that
even the slightest misstep can cause damage. Of course, shutting
different business lines down, such as Priceline WebHouse Club,
only makes matters worse and leads many to question whether this
notion of diversification is fact or fiction. At this point, we
can only wait and see.

NEWS TO GO

Mobile phone equipment company Qualcomm (Nasdaq: QCOM) reported
better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results after the
market's close yesterday. However, revenues fell short of
expectations because of slow demand in its largest market, South
Korea. The San Diego-based company reported net income of $200.8
million, or $0.25 per share, compared to $182.9 million, or
$0.24 per share, in the same period last year. That beat the
Street consensus estimate by a penny. Revenues fell to $635
million from the year-ago figure of $716 million, a decrease of
11%. The revenue shortfall was caused by the South Korean
government, which banned mobile phone discounts, cutting demand.
Chairman and CEO Irwin Jacobs reiterated that CDMA-based
wireless data and Internet access applications would fuel
industry growth.

Information technology and consulting company Computer Sciences
(NYSE: CSC) reported second-quarter earnings that met Street
expectations, citing strong U.S. and international sales despite
difficult conditions in Australia and Europe. The company
reported earnings of $109 million, or $0.64 per share, compared
to $93.1 million, or $0.55 per share, a year ago. While
suffering from a weak euro, revenue still came in at $2.5
billion, a 12% increase from the year-ago period. Key
announcements in the quarter include a $3 billion contract from
Nortel Networks (NYSE: NT)

During an investors conference in Atlanta, United Parcel Service
(NYSE: UPS) discussed the company's current performance and
outlook. It noted that it's in-line to meet Street expectations
for the fourth quarter, but that there could be a slowdown in
the growth rate. For the coming year, company goals include
revenue growth of 10%, earnings per share growth in the
mid-teens, and a return on equity of about 30%. The world's
largest express carrier is also expecting a strong holiday
season with peak day deliveries of 19 million or greater.

The number three media company, Viacom (NYSE: VIA), announced
today it has agreed to acquire privately held BET Holding II,
the parent company of Black Entertainment Television. The deal
is valued at $3 billion in stock and debt. BET Chairman and
majority owner Robert Johnson will remain chairman and CEO of
the cable channel geared to African Americans. It joins a Viacom
portfolio that includes CBS, MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, Paramount
films, Infinity Broadcasting Corp., and King World Productions.
Viacom Chairman and CEO Sumner Redstone noted regarding the
purchase that the addition of Robert Johnson, Black
Entertainment Television, and other holdings would contribute
significantly to the company's existing brands and management
expertise.

Charlie:
I just got back from NYC - I ran in the NYC Marathon yesterday.  It was a lot 
of fun and pretty good weather, but my time was a little slower than I would 
have wanted (4:27).  If Wednesday or Thursday works for you, I would like to 
come up to the Woodlands and meet with you over lunch.  I hope all is going 
well and I'll talk to you soon.

CONTINENTAL, NORTHWEST DEAL DURING TRIAL
With their federal court trial at hand, the two major air
carriers do a deal.

By Tom Jacobs

Feeling the heat of the Department of Justice's (DOJ) antitrust
trial against them, defendants Northwest Airlines (Nasdaq: NWAC)
and Continental Airlines (NYSE: CAL) announced today an
agreement intended to end the dispute. The DOJ sued the airlines
in 1998 over a deal giving Northwest 54% voting control over
Continental -- preventing Continental's takeover by Delta Air
Lines (NYSE: DAL). Under the deal, Continental would buy back
Northwest's common stock. The parties will ask the federal judge
to delay the trial, which started last week, while the carriers
work out the details.

A CAREFUL DEAL
The deal has two goals: to address the DOJ's belief that the
Northwest-Continental combination would lead to higher prices
for consumers, and to retain the benefits of the two air powers'
alliance.

The pact extends the alliance through 2025 and changes the
Northwest-Continental relationship. According to the deal,
Northwest will pay $450 million for 6.69 million Continental
Class A shares, and hold on to 2.6 million Class B shares.
Continental will recapitalize, reclassifying each Class A share
into 1.32 shares of Class B common stock. Continental will issue
Northwest a special series of preferred stock, which will give
Northwest blocking rights over certain Continental business
combinations and change of control between Continental and a
third party. Continental can redeem its preferred stock under
certain conditions, such as a change of control at Northwest.

A DELICATE BALANCE
The industry and the government are groping in the
post-deregulation era to weigh the needs of consumers against
cutthroat worldwide airline competition. For example, the DOJ is
separately reviewing United Airlines' (NYSE: UAL) $4.3 billion
purchase of US Airways Group (NYSE: U). All the airlines have
formed alliances similar to Northwest's and Continental's,
involving the now-common practice of code-sharing, which means
putting customers who buy tickets with one airline on the other
airline's flights, and offering reciprocal frequent-flyer
programs and airport lounge rights.

The trial began last week after a week's delay, during which
settlement talks continued. But the trial pressure ultimately
caused a change at Northwest, which rejected earlier this year
Continental's buyback offer. At that time the two agreed to
reduce Northwest's power over Continental's daily operations --
but it apparently didn't satisfy the DOJ.

Pending the judge's decision on the seven-day delay, Continental
and Northwest plan to execute the agreement in one week. They
expect it will take two months to close the deal, which would be
subject to settlement of the litigation with the DOJ.

NEWS TO GO

The Wall Street Journal reported that tobacco companies
Lorillard Tobacco, owned by Loews Corp. (NYSE: LTR), and Liggett
Group, owned by Miami's Vector Group (NYSE: VGR), will announce
a $8 billion settlement in federal court tobacco litigation in
Brooklyn. The move is said to include a 30-year payment
schedule, with Lorillard paying the bulk -- $7.5 billion. The
Journal reports that the parties hope to insulate themselves
from liability from the Florida state court $144.87 billion
judgment. The two tobacco companies split from their colleagues
after the Florida verdict and have been negotiating with other
plaintiffs' groups seeking a class action before U.S. Judge Jack
Weinstein of Brooklyn, famed for his handling of mass tort
litigation cases such as the Agent Orange and asbestos
class-action lawsuits.

Santa Clara, Calif. computer chip maker Transmeta reportedly
plans to hold its initial public offering this week. Transmeta
makes microprocessors said to use less power and extend battery
life in PC notebooks and Internet appliances. Expected investor
demand led Transmeta last Friday to raise its projected IPO
share price range to $16-$18 from $11-$13. Apparently, interest
remains high despite last week's big news that IBM (NYSE: IBM)
canceled plans to use a Transmeta chip in a new laptop computer.

Computer networking product maker 3Com (Nasdaq: COMS) agreed to
settle shareholder lawsuits related to its 1997 $8.5 billion
merger with U.S. Robotics. The settlement will be for $259
million. Shareholders alleged that 3Com inflated its stock price
by giving rosy financial projections and delaying -- or hiding
-- the news of a huge backlog of unsold U.S. Robotics modems,
while executives of both companies sold 4 million shares with
3Com stock at its peak. Those who bought 3Com stock between
April 23 and November 5, 1997, are eligible to share in the settlement.

After last week's decision by media giant Bertelsmann AG to ally
with Napster and finance its move to a royalty-paying music
service, two top executives of Bertelsmann's BMG Entertainment
unit quit. Chairman Michael Dornemann and President Strauss
Zelnick said they would depart, reportedly unhappy with new
directions at Bertelsmann and BMG's reduced role in television
and the Internet. Under Zelnick, BMG's album market share
increased 50%, from 13% to 20%, and the company grew to own more
than 200 record labels in 54 countries. Zelnick exits with a
sweet severance package estimated at between $20 million and $50
million.

ADOBE SWEET ADOBE
The publishing giant sees higher margins ahead. Solid 2001 in
store?

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

When is less, more? For publishing software leader Adobe
(Nasdaq: ADBE) it means growing operating profits next year by
scaling back on research and development. The company announced
its guidance at yesterday's 2000 Fall Financial Analyst Meeting.

The logic may seem absurd in this era of perpetual obsolescence.
The failure to plant seeds today means less of a harvest to reap
tomorrow. But Adobe feels that it can still seize the future by
trimming research expenditures from 20% to just 19% of projected
sales.

""Our R&D investment is larger than the annual revenues of most
of our competitors, and we do think that gives us a competitive
advantage,"" Adobe President Bruce Chizen told Fool analyst Zeke
Ashton back in September. So even if the company does hold back
on research, it should still remain ahead of the pack.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=184234

Like hue-tinkering on Adobe Photoshop, it appears that the
prospects are brighter than the 20% growth analysts were
projecting. The company expects revenue growth of at least 25%
next year. With operating margins now set to climb from 31% to
32%, estimates are now poised to be revised about a dime above
the $2.56 consensus.

In the meeting -- which ran just over two hours long -- the
company shared its enthusiasm over its role in the new economy.
Adobe has gone from a leader in the realm of desktop publishing
for print media to serving as the software backbone for online
and network publishing. Its ePaper Solutions segment is expected
to provide a 65% growth spurt in sales next year. That's a stark
contrast to the print publishing side. There the company is
looking for just a 10% hike in revenue. Adobe has always known
how to touch up a picture, and this horizon seems to have a
crusty glow.

NEWS TO GO

It's election day. Time to voice your vote. Like, what matters
more, the top or the bottom line? VoiceStream Wireless (Nasdaq:
VSTR) reported revenue of $562.2 million, well ahead of analyst
expectations and 317% higher than last year's $134.9 million
showing. Strong subscriber growth led the way. But bloated
expenses found the company also producing a much wider loss than
was projected. The company is in the process of being acquired
by Germany's Deutsche Telekom (NYSE: DT).

Knocking chips off the global building blocks, two sources
abroad warned of lower chip prices earlier today. First it was
Douglas Lee, an executive director at Goldman Sachs in Asia,
predicting that DRAM prices will continue to fall well into next
year. Then Germany's largest semiconductor maker, Infineon
Technologies (NYSE: IFX), warned of weaker demand and
consequently lower prices in its memory business during the
current quarter. However, Infineon reported a strong close to
its fiscal year and maintains a positive outlook through the
next three years thanks to growth in other high-margin
businesses.

General Electric (NYSE: GE)? No. Not quite. But Dollar General
(NYSE: DG) and Emerson Electric (NYSE: EMR) reported earnings
this morning. Both companies held their ground with results that
were in-line with analyst expectations.

Casino gaming equipment maker International Game Technology
(NYSE: IGT) has beaten the house. The company trumped the
quarterly estimate of $0.63 a share by reporting earnings of
$0.66 before charges. The strong hand was there for the taking.
All one had to do is count cards. Two weeks ago Anchor Gaming
(Nasdaq: SLOT) also topped projections on the hot demand for its
video gaming machines themed to television shows such as
Jeopardy! and I Dream of Jeanie. Those devices are being rolled
out as a joint venture involving both companies. How popular are
IGT's slots and video-gaming machines? The company topped the
billion-dollar mark in revenue this year.

Mike:
Just wanted to let you know how everything went with the Marathon if you 
haven't heard already.  My time was a little slower (4:27: 53), but I 
finished and my goal of not walking was kept.  I now want you to focus in on 
is the MS150 in April.  We are both doing it and yes, I will give you your 
bike back to do it.  I think this would be something really fun to train for 
and to participate in.  Talk to you soon.

HUMAN GENOME'S Q3
Biotech company Human Genome Sciences announced a cash-rich Q3
yesterday.

By LouAnn Lofton

Rule Breaking biotechnology company Human Genome Sciences
(Nasdaq: HGSI) reported third-quarter (ended September 30)
earnings yesterday after the market's close. Revenues climbed
for the drug development company, while losses widened.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=185959

Human Genome's third-quarter revenues increased to $8.1 million,
compared to $7.4 million in last year's third quarter. Included
in this amount is a licensing fee the company received from
MedImmune (Nadaq: MEDI), related to a SmithKline Beecham (NYSE:
SBH) vaccine development deal.

The company lost $147 million in the quarter, including a
onetime write-off related to the $134.1 million acquisition of
Principia Pharmaceutical. Excluding this charge, Human Genome
lost $13 million, or $0.12 a share. In the year-ago period, it
lost $9.7 million, or $0.11 per share. Analysts as polled by
First Call/Thompson Financial had expected Human Genome to lose
$0.13 a share, excluding charges, so the company beat that by a
penny.

Human Genome Sciences had $849.5 million in cash and short-term
investments as of the close of the quarter. This compares to the
$466.2 million it had in cash and short-term investments at the
end of December 1999.

After the end of the third quarter, the company sold more stock
to the public and raised an additional $950 million in cash.
Counting that amount, Human Genome's current amount of cash and
short-term investments is about $1.8 billion. The company now
has about 124.8 million shares of outstanding common stock,
compared to 112.1 million at the close of the third quarter.

William A. Haseltine, Human Genome's chairman and chief
executive officer, said in a statement, ""We are pleased that our
recent efforts have brought several HGS drugs closer to the
patients who need them. At the same time, we focused on enabling
scientists at HGS and our partners to discover and develop
additional drugs that may aid more patients to lead healthier,
more active lives.""

NEWS TO GO

Online auction house eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) is cutting some of its
offline workers. About 15% of the employees at the eBay-owned
Butterfields fine-art auction company will be losing their jobs.
That equals about 32 people. eBay cut 13 jobs at the Chicago
Butterfields office back in July. eBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove
said, ""The management team at Butterfields came to the
conclusion that they will continue to move the business to the
online area.""

Good-bye, MotherNature.com (Nasdaq: MTHR). Just after we lost
Pets.com (Nasdaq: IPET) and that annoyingly cute little sock
puppet, MotherNature.com announced that it, too, is shutting its
doors. MotherNature.com is the second venture backed by CMGI
(Nasdaq: CMGI) to go belly-up this week. The other, online
furniture retailer Furniture.com, announced that it's closing on
Monday. MotherNature.com spent time looking for a buyer for its
online vitamins and health products business, but could find no
takers. The company's board of directors approved a plan to
liquidate and dissolve the company on Tuesday.

Preppy-chic designer and retailer Polo Ralph Lauren (NYSE: RL)
announced second-quarter results this morning. The company's
sales grew by 8% to $586.2 million, compared to $543.9 million
last year. Net income, before restructuring and other special
charges, was $48.8 million, versus $55.3 million in the year-ago
period. Earnings per diluted share on this basis were $0.50,
down from last year's $0.56. The company said the reduction in
net income and earnings per share was expected because of a
delay in recognizing some European sales results, as well as a
shift with the timing of some of its shipments.

AOL Latin America (Nasdaq: AOLA) reported first-quarter results
yesterday. The Internet services provider, which is a joint
venture between America Online (NYSE: AOL) and the Cisneros
Group of Companies, lost $0.36 a share, or $98.1 million.
Analysts had expected a loss of $0.37 a share. Revenues in the
quarter were $4.6 million. AOL Latin America said it added
191,000 users in the quarter, bringing its total number of
members to 314,000.

it could be today, but with the nasty weather it is probably better to
postpone, as for tomorrow i have a meeting all morning and then we could
meet for a late afternoon lunch or even early evening happy hour to
celebrate bush's victory. so let me know if sometime late tomorrow works,
otherwise possibly friday. although i may be down in houston since i need to
go to a pool table place off of the southwest freeway near Gessner and then
in town to meet a buddy from el paso.

ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. I'm embarrassed to ask such a basic question, but here
goes. What does it mean when I hear, ""AT&T is up 2 1/2 today""?
Is that dollars per share, or what?

-- A. Don't be embarrassed. Most of us were never taught these
things in school. Asking about them is the only way to learn.

Prices of stocks are always in dollars per share. They're not
always in whole numbers, though. The world of stock prices is
full of fractions, all the way down to 64ths and occasionally
even smaller ones. So if the film editing firm Splice Girls Inc.
(ticker: SPLIC) is listed at 28, that means it last traded at
$28 per share. Similarly, 15 17/32 means 15.53125 or $15.53 per
share.

Another way to think of it is to consider how much total market
value the company has gained or lost with each price move. Find
how many shares outstanding the company has. (Do this via online
stock research tools, your newspaper or the firm's financial
statements.) Multiply that number by the share price. If SPLIC
has 200 million shares outstanding and drops by $2 per share,
the company has lost $400 million in market value.

-- Q. What are buy-side and sell-side analysts?

-- A. Buy-side analysts work in-house for institutions such as
mutual funds or pension funds. They study possible investments
and recommend which securities the institutions should buy or
sell. Sell-side analysts work for brokerages, trying to sell
their ideas to institutions. If an institution likes a
brokerage's research, it might do business (placing trades)
through that brokerage.

The research of sell-side analysts also makes its way to
individual investors, through brokerages.

_________________________________________________________________


INVESTING BASICS - THE EARNINGS YIELD

One way to think about what you're paying for a company is to
consider its price-to-earnings ratio, or ""P/E."" Another way is
to calculate its inverse, which is its ""earnings yield.""

Consider the example of Fryyndar and Ulf Scandinavian
Pharmaceuticals (ticker: FANDU), whose motto is ""Vars+god och
sv,lj!"" (That's Swedish for ""Here, swallow this pill!"") To
calculate its P/E ratio, you simply divide the current stock
price by the annual earnings per share (EPS). If its current
annual EPS is $3 and the stock is trading for $111 per share,
the P/E is $111 divided by $3, or 37. While 37 might seem steep,
it's not meaningful until you compare it with the P/E ratios of
industry peers and consider its growth prospects. A high P/E
means the market is assuming rapid growth. (Is that assumption
reasonable?)

To calculate Fryyndar and Ulf's earnings yield, just reverse the
P/E ratio, dividing the annual EPS by the current stock price.
$3 divided by $111 equals 0.027, or 2.7 percent. Compared to
risk-free Treasury bond rates of roughly 5 percent, this doesn't
appear to be a bargain. But remember: Whereas bond rates are
fixed, earnings typically grow. Imagine that FANDU is expected
to increase earnings by 10 percent per year. If so, in 10 years
EPS should grow to $7.78. Assuming we bought shares when they
were at $111, the earnings yield for us has now become 7
percent, considerably better. ($7.78 divided by $111 is 0.07.)

It can be instructive to see how long it takes for the growing
earnings yield to pass the current 30-year bond rate, which is
now about 5.5 percent. FANDU passes it in six years.

If your desired rate of return on your invested dollars is 15
percent, it will take FANDU 18 years to reach that target -- if
earnings actually grow at the estimated pace, that is. Perhaps
you can find another investment that will get you there more
quickly. With riskier companies, you might look for them to pass
your target rate sooner rather than later.

The earnings yield is just one of many investor tools. It can
help you think more effectively about your expectations for
investments.

Subject: Organizational Changes

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=

d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=

new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=

America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=

will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =

the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.

Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=

at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=

equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=

Commercial Support for EWS

Here is one version of the Doyle model.  There is an earlier version which 
has a simpler IDC calculation (based on percentage draws), I can send that

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

AND ENRON WIND

around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=

f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=

be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=

the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20

NEWS CORP. REPORTS DROP IN EARNINGS
The company's profits decline due to a ratings downturn at the
Fox TV network.

By Chris Rugaber

Multinational media conglomerate News Corp. (NYSE: NWS) reported
a decline in profits for its fiscal first quarter last night,
thanks to an accounting change and reduced ad revenues from its
Fox TV network.

After-tax operating profit fell to $149 million, or $0.14 per
American depositary receipt (ADR), from $165 million, or $0.16
per ADR, in the year-earlier period. (Like most other non-U.S.
based companies, News Corp. shares trade as ADRs.) The reduced
profits did meet average analysts' estimates. Revenues rose 2.6%
to $3.24 billion.

Thanks to a change in accounting for the company's film
business, News Corp. took a non-cash charge of $417 million,
resulting in a net loss for the quarter of $268 million, or
$0.27 per ADR. All Hollywood studios have been adjusting their
finances to reflect new accounting standards, which affect
marketing and development costs, among other things.

The decline in News Corp.'s operating profits was primarily a
result of lower ratings and advertising revenue for the Fox TV
network, which suffered from the success of CBS's Survivor and
the Olympics on NBC. The No. 4 U.S. network posted an operating
loss of $31 million, compared to $20 million in operating
earnings a year earlier. The network also reported higher
production and marketing costs, which may explain all those
promotions for the new series Dark Angel.

As a result, News Corp.'s separately traded U.S. media
subsidiary, the Fox Entertainment Group (NYSE: FOX), which owns
the television network and the 20th Century Fox film studio,
reported a 16% drop in fiscal first-quarter operating profit.
While the film studio's cash flow almost doubled to $119
million, from $62 million a year ago -- thanks largely to the
success of the movie X-Men -- this did not offset the declines
in television ad revenues.

Overall, profits declined in three of the six operating
divisions of the company -- television, magazines, and newspapers
-- while earnings improved for the movie studio, cable, and publishing
businesses. CEO Rupert Murdoch noted in a conference call that the company
planned to proceed with an IPO of its satellite unit, Sky Global
Networks, in the first calendar quarter of next year.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

The tougher climate for online businesses claimed more
casualties yesterday, as B2B holding company Internet Capital
Group (Nasdaq: ICGE) announced that it would cut 50 jobs, or 35%
of its workforce, and take a charge of $25 million to $30
million to pay for the cuts. The company's shares fell $3.50 in
after-hours trading to $12.75, on top of a 90% drop so far this
year. Investors in the company may be relieved to know that,
according to CEO Walter Buckley, ""We're very much moving from a
land grab area to an execution area.""

The drama continues at speech-recognition company Lernout &
Hauspie (Nasdaq: LHSP), makers of Dragon and Dictaphone
software, as the company's co-founders stepped down from their
executive positions today. The company will also delay its 10-Q
filing as it restates results for 1998, 1999, and the first half
of this year due to errors the company found in an internal
audit. But wait, there's more bad news: The company also said
that third-quarter revenue would fall short of previous
forecasts by about 24%.

ABC's hit show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? continues to
reward parent company Disney (NYSE: DIS), which today reported a
fiscal fourth-quarter profit of $167 million, or $0.11 per
share, thanks in part to increased ad sales at ABC. Excluding
the company's Internet properties, Disney earned $0.20 per
share, $0.02 ahead of consensus estimates. The company lost $126
million, or $0.02 per share, in last year's fiscal fourth
quarter. Revenues rose 5.8% to $6.12 billion. For the full year,
the company reported revenue growth of 9% to $25 billion, and
net income of $1.9 billion, or $1.92 per share.

Warren Buffett's holding company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:
BRK.A) announced last night that it will purchase paint maker
Benjamin Moore for about $1 billion in cash. Berkshire will pay
$37.82 per share for the company, a 51% premium to yesterday's
closing price. New Jersey-based Benjamin Moore makes home
exterior and interior paints, and is the second housing-related
acquisition for Berkshire in recent months. The company
purchased carpet-maker Shaw Industries in September.

Margaret,

My name David Martin.  I graduated from the MBA/MPA program at UT in May 1998 
and I am currently a Manager at Enron North America in the Restructuring 
Group.  I am writing to you in reference to a Fall 2000 MBA candidate named 
Benjamin Rogers.  He is an Associate here at Enron and in my opinion an 
excellent candidate for the UT MBA program.  He has already submitted his 
application and is anxiously awaiting a response.  Ben came to Enron as an 
Analyst and was recently promoted to an Associate, something not many 
Analysts are able to do.  He has worked in several groups throughout Enron 
and is very serious about the possibility of attending UT.  Please take my 
highest of recommendations into consideration when you assess his entrance 
into the program.  Thank you.

Regards,
David Martin"

NVIDIA KEEPS CHIPPIN'
Nvidia has overtaken ATI Technologies as the largest maker of
graphic-enhancing chips for desktop computers.

By Mike Trigg

Computer graphic chip maker Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) reported
better-than-expected third-quarter results after the market's
close yesterday, citing market share gains attributable to
original equipment manufacturers' (OEM) and system builders'
rapid adoption of its GPU technologies. The company maintained a
robust growth outlook, expanding out of its core desktop
business.

Nvidia's fiscal third-quarter (ended October 31) net income was
$28.1 million, or $0.35 per share, compared to $10.6 million, or
$0.15 per share, in the comparable period a year ago. The Street
consensus estimate called for the company to earn $0.32 per
share. Moreover, revenues came in at $198.2 million, more than
doubling year-over-year from $97 million. And operating income
grew 142% to $36.6 million.

According to a new study this week by Mercury Research, Nvidia
has overtaken ATI Technologies (Nasdaq: ATYT) as the largest
maker of graphic-enhancing chips for desktop computers. For the
third quarter, Nvidia chips were in 48% of all desktop
computers, increasing more than twofold from a year ago.

Meanwhile, ATI's desktop market share slipped five percentage
points to 34%. However, in the laptop market, ATI expanded its
market share from 29% in the same period a year ago to 57%,
highlighted by new contracts with IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Dell
(Nasdaq: DELL). Despite losing money in the last two quarters,
ATI expects to re-enter the black in the current quarter (ends
November 30). Nevertheless, Nvidia's gains continue to look
impressive in comparison to the competition.

The Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia has made significant gains
winning over longtime ATI customers, including Compaq Computer
(NYSE: CPQ) and Gateway (NYSE: GTW). According to the Street,
the shift has occurred because Nvidia has been more successful
at rolling out improved chips every six months. In a press
release yesterday, CEO and President Jen-Hsun Huang cited its
newest GeForce chip, the GeForce2 Ultra, as cause for its
expanding leadership position.

The other competitive force, 3Dfx Interactive (Nasdaq: TDFX), is
coming off a disappointing July quarter when revenue was less
than half of what the Street expected. The company attributed
the shortfall to component shortages and ""competitive and retail
seasonality factors."" Similarly, the company announced it would
report disappointing results for the quarter ending in October.

AFTER-HOURS COVERAGE

DELL ANNOUNCES Q3

Direct PC seller Dell announced third-quarter results after the
market's close today, in line with the consensus Street
expectation. With speculation throughout the day looming that
Dell had ""juiced"" revenue numbers at quarter's end, shares
traded down roughly 6% to close at $28.38. The company also
reconfirmed earlier guidance that called for sales to rise 27%
year-over-year, slightly below the 30% growth the company was
expecting earlier in the year.

_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Guess what? Sexy jeans retailer Guess (NYSE: GES) announced
third-quarter profits after the market's close well below Street
expectations, citing excess inventory and a difficult retail
environment. Guess reported third-quarter profits of $5.6
million, or $0.13 per share, compared to $14.2 million, or $0.33
per share, in the year-ago period. That's well below the Street
consensus expecting $0.36 per share. Inventory levels at
quarter's end were $164.2 million, up from $94.2 million last
year. Total revenue increased 39% year-over-year to $216.4
million. Guess also revised its fourth-quarter outlook, now
calling for earnings to be $0.08 per share to $0.10 per share.
The Street estimate called for $0.36 per share.

Construction and industrial supplies distributor Hughes Supply
(NYSE: HUG) reported that it would miss third-quarter and
full-year estimates. The company expects earnings between $0.75
per share and $0.79 per share, down from $0.87 per share in the
same period last year. The consensus Street estimate had called
for $0.93 per share. Sales for the quarter should come in at
$860 million, about 10% lower than expected. The company expects
full-year sales growth of 9% to 11%, and full-year earnings
between $2.75 per share and $2.80 per share. The
slower-than-expected growth was attributed to commodity pricing
exposure for many plumbing and building materials products.

You learn real good! Computer training company Learning Tree
International (Nasdaq: LTRE) posted solid fourth-quarter and
full-year results after the market's close yesterday. Learning
Tree reported earnings of $9.1 million, or $0.40 per share,
compared to $5.7 million, or $0.26 per share, one year ago.
That's well ahead of the Street consensus of $0.36 per share.
Moreover, the Orlando, Florida-based company pulled in $56
million in sales, increasing 21% from $48.5 million in the same
period last year. For the entire fiscal year, Learning Tree
earned $50.4 million, or $1.65 per share, compared to $14.7
million, or $0.57 per share, last year.

Managed healthcare service provider PacifiCare Health Systems
(Nasdaq: PHSY) reported a significant drop in third-quarter net
income, citing rising medical costs related to the company's
transition from capitated contracts to per-diem, fee-for-service
or shared-risk arrangements with hospitals. The Santa Ana,
Calif.-based company turned in earnings of $5.2 million, or
$0.15 per share, compared to $69.3 million, or $1.54 per share,
in the year-ago period. The Street consensus called for a
$0.07-per-share loss. Results reported for the quarter include a
$3.8 million credit, or $0.11 per share, related to the early
termination of a license agreement. Results for the same period
last year reflected a $1.7 million net charge, or a
$0.04-per-share loss, for impairment and disposition activities.
Revenue were $2.87 billion, increasing 14% from $2.52 billion.

DO YOU THINK HE WOULD??
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
 Al Gore and 
Constitution 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
, 2000 WorldNetDaily.com 

Ever since I saw Al Gore give that uncharacteristically statesman-like speech 
defending the integrity of the Electoral College system under the 
Constitution of the United States, I've been scratching my head trying to 
figure it out. 

Who was this guy? Was this the same Al Gore who has demonstrated -- time and 
time again -- so little respect for the Constitution during the last eight 
years? Why was he giving up on the idea of a challenge to the Electoral 
College, when it seemed many in his camp were banking on that as their last 
line of defense? 

Well, I think I have figured it out. Actually, there are two possibilities. 

The first thought that came to me was that this was Al Gore's 
""Don't-watch-the-man-behind-the-curtain speech."" While he was extolling the 
virtues of the Constitution, his minions in Florida -- from Bill Daley to 
Jesse Jackson -- were busy subverting it by any means necessary. It was Al 
Gore's way of establishing public plausible deniability. He stood above the 
fray, while his cohorts did the dirty work. 

But, more recently, another thought has occurred to me -- a darker, more 
sinister thought. I hope I am wrong. I pray that, this time, I am 
overestimating the deviousness of Al Gore. But that, of course, is always a 
difficult task. 

Think, for a moment, why Al Gore would suddenly be reading and citing the 
Constitution. 

The answer is that, in this instance, it gives him all the power. What do I 
mean? 

Who is it, under the Constitution, that is specifically charged with 
certifying the Electoral College votes of each state? You guessed it. The 
president of the U.S. Senate, which also happens to be the vice president of 
the United States. That's right. The day those Electoral College votes go to 
the Senate to be counted and certified to choose the next president of these 
United States, Al Gore will be holding all the cards. 

""Oh, Farah,"" you say, ""you don't think Al Gore would tamper with the results 
in any way with the whole world watching, do you?"" 

Well, let's think about what has been happening in Florida for the last 
several days. Al Gore's campaign managers have been whipping up hysteria 
stating that the will of the people in that state is being subverted. 

They are filing lawsuits. They are organizing marches. They are all but 
accusing the Bush campaign of voter fraud. 

Listen to what Bill Daley has to say: ""More than 100 million Americans voted 
on Tuesday and more voted for Al Gore than George Bush. Here in Florida it 
also seems very likely that more voters went to the polls believing that they 
were voting for Al Gore than for George Bush. If the will of the people is to 
prevail Al Gore should be awarded a victory in Florida, and be our next 
president of the United States."" 

They've decided that no matter what the actual vote count shows, Gore wins. 

Now, all Gore has to do on that fateful day in the U.S. Senate is reject for 
certification the Electoral College votes of Florida, and he wins the 
majority and becomes president. Sorry, Bush fans. I don't think there's a 
thing you can do about it other than protest, complain and stomp your feet. 
Better start planning your legal strategy now. I'll bet Al Gore's transition 
team is already hard at work. Barbra Streisand is probably making plans to 
sing at the Inauguration. Alec Baldwin is unpacking his bags. This could be a 
fait accompli. I guarantee you a counter to this bold move is not in the Bush 
campaign's playbook. 

The Gore campaign, still working overtime, has laid the groundwork for the 
challenge. The Florida vote is tainted, they say. It's too close to call. Too 
many irregularities. The vote can simply be dismissed by the constitutional 
authority -- Vice President Al Gore. 

Would you put it past him? I sure wouldn't.

BUFFETT'S BERKSHIRE BAGS BETTER Q3
Holding company Berkshire Hathaway bests last year and moves
farther into household names.

By Tom Jacobs

Holding company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) announced Q3
earnings Friday of $523 per Class A share, 90% over last year's
$276. While earnings from operations jumped from last year's
$103 to $197, Berkshire also reaped substantial investment
gains. Class A shares closed Friday unchanged at $62,200, while
the Class B shares (non-voting shares worth 1/30th of each Class
A) for the commoners finished up $11 at $2043.

Warren Buffett and Charles Munger steer Berkshire, whose wholly
owned businesses include insurance, aviation, newspaper, candy,
shoe, jewelry, and home furnishing companies. Berkshire also
maintains large stock holdings in energy and name-brand U.S.
stocks, such as Gillette (NYSE: G) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).
Because of Berkshire's holdings and insurance business, not many
analysts follow the company -- The Motley Fool has one -- and
the quarterly numbers are not as simple as they seem. For one
thing, Berkshire's numbers vary considerably quarter-to-quarter,
and much of the insurance business action occurs in the fourth
quarter.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=191757
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=191758

A big factor for an insurance business is float -- money paid in
premiums that the insurer invests in hopes of a greater gain
against future payout for claims. Berkshire's float increased by
a healthy $1.3 billion in Q3. But underwriting losses at its
General Re unit -- which have plagued Berkshire in the last
several years --continued, with another $135 million loss on a
contract there. However, Buffett believes that the loss will
mean future investment benefits, stating, ""From time to time we
will have such transactions in the future and we will post you
of their effects upon our current earnings. When priced
properly, this pain-today, gain-tomorrow business is welcomed by
us and benefits our shareholders."" I'm one of those, and you
gotta love words like that from a CEO.

Buffett observed that advertising spent for Berkshire's GEICO
insurance unit has not realized more than a nominal gain in
policyholders. GEICO plans to cut back advertising for now, and
Buffett believes that increased rates will lead to some
improvement in profitability next year.

The quarter saw more Berkshire moves into home furnishings, with
proposed purchases of Shaw Industries (NYSE: SHX) and Benjamin
Moore Paint. Berkshire shareholders tend to be rabid about their
company and are already debating the numbers.

NEWS TO GO

Fresh pork and processed meat producer and marketer Smithfield
Foods (NYSE: SFD) offered to acquire all outstanding stock of
No. 1 U.S. beef producer IBP (NYSE: IBP). The other white meat
maker would pay $4.1 billion in stock and assumed debt for
what's for dinner. This means Smithfield pays $25 per IBP share,
20% above IBP's Friday close of $20.88.

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers meets
this week in Marina del Rey, California, with its 800 members
leading up to adding as many as 14 new domain names to join
existing Internet suffixes .org, .com, .net, .edu, and .gov. New
names would mean competition for VeriSign (Nasdaq: VRSN) ) whose
Network Solutions purchase gave it control over the database for
.com, .org, and .net. -- with full pricing and registration
power. ICANN received 44 complete applications at $50,000 a
crack. Some names reported include .web, .biz, .ecom, and .info
for general topics; .nom, .per, and .i for personal home pages;
and .health, .museum, and .union for specific content. (And
.tom9 for -- just kidding!) ICANN has taken some heat for
rejecting .kids and .xxx for porn sites, but ICANN staff held
firm, saying that defining kids' sites would be problematic, and
that porn sites couldn't be forced to take an .xxx suffix. The
board's 19 members will act Thursday and it's reported that the
new domains will be operational in Q2 2001.

Netpliance (Nasdaq: NPLI) announced Sunday it would cut 38% of
its workforce and refocus its business away from its
poor-selling I-Opener Internet appliance, which combined the
device with Internet access and Netpliance's consumer portal.
Netpliance reported Friday a $41.9 million loss, or $0.69 per
share, versus a loss of $6.5 million, or $0.20 per share, a year
ago. The company intends to reorganize into two business units:
Netpliance.net, offering next-generation services and hosted
applications to broadband service providers, and Netpliance IPG,
which will develop core infrastructure products to be installed
in data centers, points-of-presence, and residential access
devices. Though the company had $76.6 million in cash at the end
of the September quarter, it's hard to see how it can expect to
make headway in this area already filled with cash-rich competitors.

A federal court in Delaware has ruled against GeneChip DNA array
maker Affymetrix (Nasdaq: AFFX) in favor of the U.K.'s Oxford
Gene Technology in a patent infringement case involving
technology fundamental to Affymetrix's product technology. Two
weeks ago a British appeals court ruled in favor of Affymetrix
that it had a license when it purchased part of Beckman Coulter
(NYSE: BEC) in 1999. According to reports, the U.S. court agreed
with the British court on the Beckman Coulter-Affymetrix license
transfer, so the sole issue is a 17-month period when Affymetrix
paid no royalties to Oxford. Oxford sought $40 million -- which
will not be tripled because the court reportedly found that
Affymetrix did not willfully or knowingly infringe the patents.
Affymetrix expects about $190 million in revenues from its
GeneChip arrays and related equipment this year. CEO Stephen
Fodor stated that ""We don't think [the decision] will have a
long-term effect. Our future is secure. So we're now talking
about the past -- of about 17 months at the most and no trebling
of damages.''

Reuters reports that chip giant Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) will
announce two new Celeron processors chips, running at 733
megahertz and 766 megahertz, to further its hold on the
sub-$1,000 PC market in the face of stiffening competition from
Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD). AMD currently has the
speediest chip on the market and is said to be undercutting
Intel on price by 25%. The 766 will cost $170 per thousand and
the 733 will cost $112 per thousand, giving you a pretty good
idea of where the prices are in a low-cost PC box. Intel said
that Compaq (NYSE: CPQ) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HWP) will
introduce systems using the chips.

DO YOU THINK HE WOULD??
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
 Al Gore and 
Constitution 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
, 2000 WorldNetDaily.com 

Ever since I saw Al Gore give that uncharacteristically statesman-like speech 
defending the integrity of the Electoral College system under the 
Constitution of the United States, I've been scratching my head trying to 
figure it out. 

Who was this guy? Was this the same Al Gore who has demonstrated -- time and 
time again -- so little respect for the Constitution during the last eight 
years? Why was he giving up on the idea of a challenge to the Electoral 
College, when it seemed many in his camp were banking on that as their last 
line of defense? 

Well, I think I have figured it out. Actually, there are two possibilities. 

The first thought that came to me was that this was Al Gore's 
""Don't-watch-the-man-behind-the-curtain speech."" While he was extolling the 
virtues of the Constitution, his minions in Florida -- from Bill Daley to 
Jesse Jackson -- were busy subverting it by any means necessary. It was Al 
Gore's way of establishing public plausible deniability. He stood above the 
fray, while his cohorts did the dirty work. 

But, more recently, another thought has occurred to me -- a darker, more 
sinister thought. I hope I am wrong. I pray that, this time, I am 
overestimating the deviousness of Al Gore. But that, of course, is always a 
difficult task. 

Think, for a moment, why Al Gore would suddenly be reading and citing the 
Constitution. 

The answer is that, in this instance, it gives him all the power. What do I 
mean? 

Who is it, under the Constitution, that is specifically charged with 
certifying the Electoral College votes of each state? You guessed it. The 
president of the U.S. Senate, which also happens to be the vice president of 
the United States. That's right. The day those Electoral College votes go to 
the Senate to be counted and certified to choose the next president of these 
United States, Al Gore will be holding all the cards. 

""Oh, Farah,"" you say, ""you don't think Al Gore would tamper with the results 
in any way with the whole world watching, do you?"" 

Well, let's think about what has been happening in Florida for the last 
several days. Al Gore's campaign managers have been whipping up hysteria 
stating that the will of the people in that state is being subverted. 

They are filing lawsuits. They are organizing marches. They are all but 
accusing the Bush campaign of voter fraud. 

Listen to what Bill Daley has to say: ""More than 100 million Americans voted 
on Tuesday and more voted for Al Gore than George Bush. Here in Florida it 
also seems very likely that more voters went to the polls believing that they 
were voting for Al Gore than for George Bush. If the will of the people is to 
prevail Al Gore should be awarded a victory in Florida, and be our next 
president of the United States."" 

They've decided that no matter what the actual vote count shows, Gore wins. 

Now, all Gore has to do on that fateful day in the U.S. Senate is reject for 
certification the Electoral College votes of Florida, and he wins the 
majority and becomes president. Sorry, Bush fans. I don't think there's a 
thing you can do about it other than protest, complain and stomp your feet. 
Better start planning your legal strategy now. I'll bet Al Gore's transition 
team is already hard at work. Barbra Streisand is probably making plans to 
sing at the Inauguration. Alec Baldwin is unpacking his bags. This could be a 
fait accompli. I guarantee you a counter to this bold move is not in the Bush 
campaign's playbook. 

The Gore campaign, still working overtime, has laid the groundwork for the 
challenge. The Florida vote is tainted, they say. It's too close to call. Too 
many irregularities. The vote can simply be dismissed by the constitutional 
authority -- Vice President Al Gore. 

Would you put it past him? I sure wouldn't.

Subject: MBA Candidate



Margaret,

My name David Martin.  I graduated from the MBA/MPA program at UT in May
1998
and I am currently a Manager at Enron North America in the Restructuring
Group.
I am writing to you in reference to a Fall 2000 MBA candidate named Benjamin
Rogers.  He is an Associate here at Enron and in my opinion an excellent
candidate for the UT MBA program.  He has already submitted his application
and
is anxiously awaiting a response.  Ben came to Enron as an Analyst and was
recently promoted to an Associate, something not many Analysts are able to
do.
He has worked in several groups throughout Enron and is very serious about
the
possibility of attending UT.  Please take my highest of recommendations into
consideration when you assess his entrance into the program.  Thank you.

Regards,
David Martin

3M ADDS ANOTHER M
3M Post-It Note reads, ""Reach out and MicroTouch someone.""

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

4M? Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing (NYSE: MMM) will add
touchscreen specialist MicroTouch (Nasdaq: MTSI) to its
conglomerate in a $160 million acquisition.

For MicroTouch shareholders, the $21-a-share cash buyout price
finds the stock fetching levels it hasn't seen since 1997. The
landscape was much kinder then. Demand for the company's
touchscreen offerings ran high. Through 1998, sales growth was
running at an annualized clip of 35% over the five previous
years.

Then the fundamentals went insane in the resistive membrane. So
far this year the company has had to close down its Australian
office and look into fiduciary improprieties in Taiwan. The
company has divested itself of its once-promising Ibid digital
whiteboards and its Factura high-tech kiosks. The touchscreen
operations that remain have grown the top line by a paltry 5%
over the first nine months of the year.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=193903
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=193904
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=193905

Last week the company reported that it was engaged in sale
negotiations. 3M was a logical suitor since the company had
entered into the touchscreen market with its acquisition of
Dynapro Systems over the summer.

Dow component 3M trades at two times trailing revenues and it is
buying out MicroTouch at roughly the total sales over the past
year. But will the deal be accretive to the bottom line?
MicroTouch is struggling with profitability right now. But if 3M
is able to steer MicroTouch back into the operating groove the
company mastered in 1998, then, yes, definitely. The Post-It
reminder to pick up MicroTouch in order to become the top dog in
the touchscreen space will be worth it.

NEWS TO GO

Super Selection at Everyday Low Gross Margins! That's not the
official Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) slogan, but the company that Sam
Walton founded on producing financial results through whirlwind
inventory turnover on meager markups reported earnings in-line
with projections this morning. Sales climbed by 13% to $45.7
billion while earnings per share rose two pennies to $0.31 a
share -- a 6% gain. Uh-oh. That's falling net margins. However,
same-store sales climbed by 5% and the company's international
sales shot up 26%.

It's a big day for other retailers too. Home Depot (NYSE: HD) is
set to erect its quarterly report while Target (NYSE: TGT) has
its earnings conference call slated for 10:30 a.m. ET. After
yesterday's close, Too (NYSE: TOO) reported earnings that came
in a penny ahead of estimates. The specialty retailer that was
spun off by Limited (NYSE: LTD) also expressed comfort with the
December quarter forecasts.

Meanwhile, the investing community is fumbling for a Staples
(Nasdaq: SPLS) remover after the company reported earnings that
came in below analyst projections. The office supply superstore
chain also said that profits would fall short of expectations
for the current quarter. However, it does see growth of at least
30% next year.

Medic! The bleeding at WebMD (Nasdaq: HLTH) is running more
profuse than once feared. The company reported a
wider-than-expected loss for its quarterly checkup. As the
company begins to digest recent acquisitions, WebMD is looking
at a deficit next year of between $75 million and $100 million.
The prognosis calls for massive restructuring that finds the
company having to reduce previous revenue guidance for 2001.
Thankfully the company is cash-rich and debt-free. No one is
calling Dr. Koop for a second opinion, yet.

Stop the presses -- Cisco (Nasdaq: CSCO) is buying a company.
OK, keep the presses rolling, the networking titan does this all
the time. The target of Cisco's affections is Australian
high-speed chipset developer Radiata in a $295 million
transaction. Onward.

There has been a change in the PRC Representative for your group.  Andy 
Zipper is now your PRC Rep, his extension is:  3-6994.  Please see the 
spreadsheet below.  Thanks.

PRC Representatives
Thank you for your participation in the year-end 2000 PRC.  Listed below are 
the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:



As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts) 
and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is 
essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduct 
a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The 
pre-ratings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and 
available for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a 
secondary supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts 
feedback.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or 
Associates/Analysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.  
The Associate and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the 
completed feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system 
is closed.  The more information that you can secure regarding your 
Associates/Analysts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated 
correctly at the final PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are 
unsure of the process, please contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or 
Shelly Butler at x3-4584 with any questions.

Supervisors
You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the 
Associates/Analysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate 
this feedback including your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at 
your business unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not 
conducting a pre-rating meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the 
rating you provide is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.  
Please contact the PEP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at 
x3-5230 if you are unable to load this data yourself.  You should wait to 
provide feedback to your Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have 
been made to avoid any confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final 
cross-calibration and may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are 
responsible for contacting the PRC Representative listed above whom will be 
representing your Associates/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind 
that the more information you can provide, either verbal or written, will 
ensure that the final PRC is a success.

Associates/Analysts
You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received 
your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received this, 
please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the system 
and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how many 
people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving your 
reviewers.  Remember that it is important to select a broad range of 
reviewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will 
also be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the 
opportunity to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you 
have added value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may 
hear from your PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do 
not, we suggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing.  

An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 2000 
at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and 
Analysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be 
communicated to the Supervisor by 12/31/00.  The feedback should be 
communicated to the Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.  If the 
Associates/Analysts have not received feedback by the deadline, they should 
contact their Career Development Manager (Jana Giovannini x3-9233 or Shelly 
Butler x3-4584).  Thank you for your cooperation and we look forward to a 
successful final PRC"

Ben,

How was the wedding? Homecoming was pretty lame.  I hung out with people
that live in DC, Stanton, etc.  I did see Dave Crocini and Melanie and Kerry
and her husband.  JV did make it down, we got pretty smashed and went to Old
Glory or course.

Ken and Theo were in town this past weekend.  We all went out for dinner
with the Penney's and their new baby. Scary to see JP holding a baby.

How is Texas? I'm sick of the election thing, what's the attitude down
there.

Hey:
Sorry about not getting back sooner - I have been traveling and was away for 
Thanksgiving.  Megan and I went up to Chicago to visit one of her 5 sisters.  
M&M's wedding was fun, saw some people I haven't seen since college - pretty 
scary.  If ""W"" wins this election Megan and I are coming to DC to watch the 
Inaugeration and maybe go to a ball or two, so we should diffinently get 
together.  I will work on that when the time comes.  Besides, this election 
is absolutely crazy - Gore he working himself into complete retirement with 
all this contesting.  How is everything going?  What are you guys doing for 
the holiday?  Megan and I are going out west to do some skiing in Beaver 
Creek - I'm praying for powder.  Again, I hope all is going well and I'll be 
better next time about getting back to you.  Good to hear from you!

ANALOG DEVICES' STRONG Q4
Circuit maker Analog Devices reported estimate-beating Q4
results yesterday.

By LouAnn Lofton

Integrated circuit maker Analog Devices (NYSE: ADI) reported
fourth-quarter and fiscal year-end results yesterday after the
bell. The company earned $0.54 a share in the fourth quarter,
ahead of the First Call/Thompson Financial consensus estimate by
$0.04. In last year's fourth quarter, Analog Devices earned
$0.20.

Sales for the quarter were up 87% to $806 million from $431
million in the year-ago period. Net income increased to $206.5
million, compared to $73.2 million last year. The company's
gross margin improved during the quarter to 58.6% from 52.2%.

For the fiscal year, Analog Devices earned $588.8 million on
sales of $2.58 billion. In the previous fiscal year, the
company's sales were $1.45 billion, and its net income was
$204.8 million. On a per-share basis, Analog Devices earned
$1.54 a share in fiscal 2000, versus $0.57 in fiscal 1999.

The company also announced yesterday that it will be
repurchasing up to 15 million shares of its common stock.
Currently, there are about 356 million shares of Analog Devices
common stock outstanding. The shares are being bought back for
use in the company's stock option plans, as well as other
employee stock-based benefit plans.

Looking ahead to the first quarter of its new fiscal year,
Analog Devices expects 7-10% sequential revenue growth. The
company sees first-quarter earnings per share to come in between
$0.58 and $0.60 a share. The current consensus estimate for
Analog Devices' first quarter is $0.54. The company says it
believes its revenue growth will be constrained by supply, not
demand.

Analog Devices' President and CEO Jerald G. Fishman said, ""Our
first look for the entire year of fiscal 2001 is also very
encouraging. We currently believe that fiscal 2001's revenues
could exceed fiscal 2000's by more than 50%, which would result
in fiscal 2001 revenues of more than $3.8 billion.""
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

In an SEC filing yesterday, it was disclosed that the man who
has for so long believed in Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) also apparently
believes at least a little in Pepsi (NYSE: PEP). Warren
Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) has acquired
about a 1% stake in Tricon Global Restaurants (NYSE: YUM), the
Pepsi spin-off that includes fast-food restaurants Pizza Hut,
Taco Bell, and KFC. Close to 98% of those restaurants serve
Pepsi products. Buffett owns 8.1% of Coca-Cola and is also a
director for the company.

Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) said yesterday that it will allow
customers ordering new 2001 Explorers to elect to have Goodyear
tires on their vehicles over the standard Firestones. This move
formally allows customers to have the new Explorers delivered
with Goodyear tires, as opposed to switching off the Firestones
for the Goodyears before the purchase. It's estimated that
between 5-10% of Explorer customers have been asking dealers to
change the tires on their new trucks before driving them off of
the lot, thanks to the Firestone recall of 6.5 million tires. In
states where the tire problems were the worst, up to 40% of
customers have been asking for the switch.

E-commerce software company BEA Systems (Nasdaq: BEAS) reported
third-quarter earnings yesterday after the bell. The company's
pro forma net income was $31.3 million, or $0.07 a share. Last
year, the company's pro forma net income was $10.4 million, or
$0.03 a share. BEA beat the consensus estimate according to
First Call/Thompson Financial by a penny. Revenues grew 77% to
$244 million, from last year's $126.5 million.

Optical networking company Sycamore Networks (Nasdaq: SCMR)
announced fiscal first-quarter results after the market's close
yesterday. Sycamore's pro forma net income was $6 million, or
$0.02 a diluted share, for the quarter. Last year, it lost $4.1
million, or $0.02 a share, in the first quarter. The company
earned a penny more than analysts had expected. Revenues grew by
517% to $120.4 million, compared to the year-ago period's $19.5
million.

 Hey Fool! Want to know the SECRET to long-term investing?
 Compounding and dollar-cost averaging! Start investing with
 as little as $20! Just $2.99 per order.
 http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196113


ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. I want to open a brokerage account, but the firms I called
require between $1,000 and $5,000 upfront, just to open an
account. What can I do?

-- A. Many brokerages don't have minimums. Details about and
ratings for scores of discount brokerages, both traditional and
online, can be found in SmartMoney magazine, the American
Association of Individual Investors Journal and other
periodicals. Online brokerages are also reviewed and rated at
gomez.com.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196114

Note that commissions for discount brokerages have fallen to as
low as $5 or $10 per trade. (And some of them are offering free
trades to those with certain minimum balances.) This is a far
cry from the typical discount commission of $30 to $50 a few
years ago and the hundreds of dollars that some full-service
brokerages will still charge you today.

-- Q. I'm 14 years old. How much risk should I apply to what I'm
investing?

-- A. We love questions like this! If only all 14-year olds were
learning about investing.

Anyone can afford to take on some risk by investing in stocks --
as long as the money won't be withdrawn within the next five or
more years. If the money you're investing is for college, stocks
aren't a good idea, as the market could drop in the short term.
Those investing for the long haul can patiently ride out
downturns. Short-term investors should stick to safer plays,
like money market funds.

You're smart to start young. Let's say you invest $500 and it
earns the average annual market rate of 11 percent. In 30 years,
when you're only 44, it'll become $11,446. Sock it away until
retirement at 65 and it'll be nearly $100,000. Add to it over
the years and you're looking at early retirement!

INVESTING BASICS - CALLING ALL WOMEN

If you know a woman who isn't yet investing, clip out this
article and pass it on to her. She may thank you one day from
the bottom of her wallet.

Many women (and men, too) are steering clear of the stock
market, and they're paying a high price for it. Consider these
facts. Wives tend to be less involved than husbands in household
investing and retirement planning. Most married women outlive
their husbands. Fully 80 percent of all widows in poverty became
poor only after the death of their husbands. In 1992, 87 percent
of the elderly poor in America were women.

If we've now depressed you, hold on. There's good news, too.
More women are investing today than in the past. A 1997 study
commissioned by the National Association of Securities Dealers
found that 47 percent of investors were women, up from 37
percent in 1990.

When women invest, they can do very well. According to recent
National Association of Investors Corp. (NAIC) statistics, the
average annual lifetime return for all-women investment clubs
was 17.9 percent, compared with 15.6 percent for all-men clubs
(in 1997). Brad Barber and Terrance Odean, professors at the
University of California at Davis business school, offer an
explanation. In a 1998 study, they found that men are more
likely than women to be overconfident and to trade frequently.
Single men, for example, traded 67 percent more than single
women, reaping lower returns.

Here are some guidelines for women -- and heck, men --
interested in getting started:

1. Take the time to learn first. Don't jump into any investment
without understanding it and being comfortable with it. Read
""One Up on Wall Street"" by Peter Lynch or our ""You Have More
Than You Think.""
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196117
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196118

2. Don't be afraid to take on some risk. Sticking to low-risk
choices like bonds or money market funds dooms you to lower
returns. As long as you're investing for five to ten or more
years, you can afford to ride out any short-term market
downturns.

3. Consider forming an investment club. Learn how with the NAIC
at better-investing.org.

""The scalded cat fears even cold water."" -- Thomas Fuller


MIXED NEWS FROM APPLIED MATERIALS
The company reports a strong fourth quarter, but warns that next
quarter's earnings will miss expectations.

By Chris Rugaber

Leading semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials (Nasdaq:
AMAT) reported strong fourth-quarter results after the closing
bell yesterday, doubling profits on an 81% increase in sales.
However, the company also warned that fiscal first-quarter
earnings would miss current forecasts.

Nevertheless, the company's fourth quarter (ended October 29)
was solid, to say the least. Net income jumped to $663.8
million, or $0.77 per share, from $303.8 million, or $0.37 per
share, in last year's fourth quarter. Analysts expected the
company to earn $0.76 per share. Sales reached $2.92 billion, up
from $1.61 billion, while new orders more than doubled to $3.6
billion and backlog increased to $4.38 billion, from $3.69
billion last year. Margins also improved, with gross margin
increasing to 51.7%, up from 49.6% in the year-earlier period,
and net margin rising to 22.7%, 3.9 points higher than the
year-earlier figure.

Despite the strong showing, the company is cautious about future
results, which is not too surprising given the cyclical nature
of the semiconductor industry. While Applied Materials benefited
from capacity increases at many chipmakers earlier this year,
concerns over slowing mobile phone and PC sales have muddied the
waters regarding revenue and earnings for the second half of
next year. ""Conditions in our industry have become more complex
and uncertain,"" Chief Financial Officer Joseph Bronson told
Bloomberg News. ""It is unclear what the impact of this
uncertainty will be on our markets.""

For next quarter, the company stated that earnings per share
(EPS) were likely to come in between $0.75 and $0.78, below
current analysts' estimates of $0.80. Revenue should be between
$2.9 billion and $2.95 billion, below previous expectations of
$3.12 billion.

Investors that have held on through Applied Materials' ups and
downs have done pretty well over the years, though recent times
have been tougher. For more information about the company, check
out a Daily Double from Rick Munarriz this past spring.

NEWS TO GO

In a long-expected move, AT&T (NYSE: T) announced yesterday that
it would spin off cable TV programming division Liberty Media
(NYSE: LMG.A), which it received as part of its purchase of
cable giant Tele-Communications, Inc. last year. While the
decision is dependent on a favorable tax ruling, AT&T plans to
convert the company's tracking stock to an asset-based equity
and distribute shares to holders of the tracking stock in the
second quarter of 2001. By selling Liberty, which owns stakes in
the E! Entertainment Network and Courtroom Television Network,
AT&T may satisfy regulatory conditions placed on it for the
approval of its purchase of cable operator MediaOne Group.

The mega-merger between America Online (NYSE: AOL) and Time
Warner (NYSE: TWX) may be delayed past the two companies'
self-imposed deadline of December 21, according to a report in
today's Wall Street Journal. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
wants the two companies to strike a cable-access deal with an
Internet service provider (ISP) as a condition of the merger,
and last week the FTC delayed a vote on the merger until
November 30 to give the two companies time to strike a deal with
an ISP. Nevertheless, the FTC would have to approve a
cable-access deal before the merger vote, and may not be able to
do so in time. The Journal also reported that the two companies
disagreed on strategy, as Time Warner wanted last week's vote to
proceed, while AOL did not. An AOL vice president denied that
there were any disagreements.

Retailer Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN) reported dismal third-quarter
earnings after yesterday's market close. The company, under new
management led by Nordstrom family members, saw profit from
operations drop 41% to $23.4 million, or $0.18 per share, from
$39.7 million, or $0.29 per share, in the year-earlier period.
Sales rose 13%, to $1.25 billion, from $1.11 billion. The
company used steep price markdowns to clear out summer and fall
merchandise, and also saw an increase in operating expenses,
with sales, general and administrative (SG&A) costs jumping to
34.8% of revenue from 31.7% a year earlier.

The world's second-largest auction house, Sotheby's (NYSE: BID),
reported a disappointing third quarter and warned that
fourth-quarter and fiscal 2000 earnings would be below last
year's. Third-quarter sales dropped 6%, from $45.3 million last
year to $42.6 million, and losses from operations increased to
$0.45 per share, from $0.41. In addition, the company took a
pre-tax charge of $184.8 million, or $2.68 per share, as a
result of its settlement of shareholder lawsuits and an
antitrust investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice. The
company pleaded guilty last month to conspiring with its rival
Christie's on auction commission fees.

Ben, 
Attached is the latest draft of the Beck report. I'm attaching a list that I 
prepared that generally has the items that are outstanding; however, the 
priority items are the back up information on performance testing (& curves) 
of the inlet fogging system and the peaking testing (output) of the three 
units and the confirmation of the data in table 5 (long term performance of 
the projects).
I have the O&M contracts, the monthly reports, and the contracts between OEC 
and Caldwell for the inlet fogging system, but these do not contain what 
Conrad (RW Beck) is looking for. My understanding from the operations guys is 
that there is data for the above items.
As discussed, Conrad will be here Monday morning, so if we could have the 
back up information for these items by then, it would expedite the process 
tremendously.
You can reach me at 54426 if you have any questions.
Thanks for your help.
Joana

VA LINUX DOWN, BUT NOT OUT
Open-source software provider VA Linux reported first-quarter
results, meeting revised expectations.

By Mike Trigg

VA Linux (Nasdaq: LNUX), which makes software and computers
using the Linux operating system, reported its first-quarter
outcome after the market's close yesterday, in-line with revised
estimates. It was less than two weeks ago when the Freemont,
California-based company warned results would fall short of
expectations, citing slow sales growth from dot-com customers.
The market reacted harshly from that news with shares plummeting
42% in one day.

Excluding non-cash items, VA Linux's fiscal first-quarter (ended
October 27) net loss was $7 million, or $0.15 per share,
compared to a net loss of $7.2 million, or $0.27 per share, in
the year-ago period. The Street had expected a loss of $0.09 per
share prior to the warning. On the top line, the open-source
software provider reported $56.1 million in revenues, compared
to $14.8 million in the same period last year.

""While top and bottom-line results did not meet our expectations
for the quarter, we remain optimistic about our prospects for
growth in the future. We remain committed to profitability,
excluding non-cash charges, no later than the end of calendar
2001, and we anticipate revenue for fiscal 2001 to be
approximately 2.25 times fiscal 2000 revenue,'' said President
and CEO Dr. Larry M. Augustin.

VA Linux's stock, which closed last night at $12, is down
significantly from its 52-week high of $320. Clearly, the days
of unabashed enthusiasm for Linux stocks are gone. However,
investors continue to keep companies like VA Linux on the radar,
and being profitable one year from now would help the company's
prospects.

Management's ability to control costs while growing revenues is
critical. The other key to success will be monitoring the
commercial acceptance of Linux-based products, particularly
among Fortune 1000 companies. The fact remains that Linux
products are still something that appeal more to techies, and
until that changes investors will continue to have doubts about
VA Linux's ability to succeed

NEWS TO GO

Caffeine haven Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) announced fourth-quarter
earnings after the market's close yesterday. The company
(excluding non-cash items) reported income of $43.8 million, or
$0.22 per share, compared to $32.4 million, or $0.17 per share,
a year ago. That's a 35% increase. The Street consensus called
for the company to earn $0.22 per share. Revenues for the
quarter were $582 million, compared to $475 million a year ago.
Including non-cash charges to write down Internet investments,
Starbucks' profit was $0.01 per share. Same-sales stores grew
10%.

Southeastern U.S. local-phone company BellSouth Corp. (NYSE:
BLS) announced it expects earnings per share to grow between 7%
and 9% next year. The company previously forecasted 13% to 15%
growth. According to a spokesperson, the new estimate includes
the cost of entering Colombia and adding more customers for
digital subscriber line (DSL) Internet access, which was not
factored into the original forecast. BellSouth expects customers
for DSL service to expand threefold to 600,000 next year,
reducing earnings by $0.07 per share. Colombian acquisitions are
expected to cut earnings another $0.06 per share for the year.

Computer networking chipmaker Marvell Technology Group (Nasdaq:
MRVL) reported third-quarter results after the market's close
last night, exceeding Street expectations. Marvell's net income
was $1.8 million, or $0.02 per share. Excluding stock
compensation costs, profit was $3.4 million, or $0.04 per share,
compared to $5.5 million, or $0.07 per share, a year ago,
exceeding Street expectations by a penny. Revenue came in at
$36.2 million, a 54% year-over-year increase.

Semiconductor company Dallas Semiconductor (NYSE: DS) announced
that Chairman, CEO, and President Vin Prothro died yesterday
after suffering a heart attack. Prothro founded the company in
1984 and had served in his current duties since its inception.
The company announced its board would meet soon to start the
process of naming a successor. The 58-year-old Prothro had no
history of heart problems. Before trading was halted, Dallas
Semiconductor shares dropped $1.19 to $36.88.

I spoke with Gavin Gaul just now about the GA drawings for the 99 peakers.  
He said that he would have to do some poking around, because those drawings 
would have been archived a year ago.  But he thought he could get me the 
as-built site layout drawings for the plants.  The version of the Brownsville 
layout from the CD-ROM is not as-built, so maybe we should hold off on the 
layouts until we get the as-builts from Gavin.  I'll let you know as soon as 
I hear back from him."

COKE MAY BE SOWING OATS
Coke makes $16 billion bid for Quaker Oats and its Gatorade
brand.

By Tom Jacobs

Reuters reports that soft drink giant Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO)
has offered $16 billion for Quaker Oats Co. (NYSE: OAT), eyeing
its powerful Gatorade brand sports drink. Coke's offer tops
PepsiCo's (NYSE: PEP) $14.8 billion proposed purchase, which
Quaker rebuffed earlier this month.

Coke is believed to be offering 1.9 shares per Quaker share, or
about $116.70. France's Groupe Danone (NYSE: DA) has reportedly
made an offer as well, and the Quaker board is probably prepared
to hear from PepsiCo again -- or even another possible suitor,
such as Nestle.

Coke is currently trying to regain investor confidence after
shaky times. The deal would give Coke a lock on the sport drink
market, which Quaker's Gatorade currently dominates with an 84%
market share, compared to 11% held by Coke's PowerAde and 3.1%
for PepsiCo's All-Sport. Industry analysts note that the
non-carbonated beverage market is growing faster than the bubbly
kind, and Gatorade is the solid-gold brand. The appeal of the
Gatorade label explains why other suitors may appear once they
know Gatorade's in play. But any buyer would have to deal with
Quaker's cereal business, and there's only so much you can do
with oats after you toast them or sugar them up in breakfast
bars.

Any deal for Quaker would join a gaggle of recent food world
acquisitions: Philip Morris (NYSE: MO) purchased Nabisco
Holdings (NYSE: NGH) in June; Unilever -- Anglo-Dutch parent of
Unilever PLC (NYSE: UL) and Unilever N.V. (NYSE: UN) -- acquired
Bestfoods Oct. 5; and Keebler Foods Co. (NYSE: KBL) combined with
Kellogg Co. (NYSE: K) on Oct. 26.

Coke closed Friday at $61.83, down $0.50, while Quaker finished
off $0.19 to $90.31, just shy of its 52-week high of $92. Quaker
has jumped 13% since its suitors appeared, while Coke stock
currently sells for 1997 prices.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Agilent Technologies (NYSE: A) is selling its medical products
business to Dutch electronics whiz Philips Electronics for $1.7
billion, capping Philips' two-year, $4 billion buying spree in
the industry. The deal leaves Philips the number three medical
equipment maker, behind General Electric (NYSE: GE) and Siemens.
This is an interesting move for Agilent, which apparently views
its dragging medical equipment business separately from its
booming life science manufacturing biz, growing through
partnerships with such biotechs as Caliper Technologies (Nasdaq:
CALP) and Rosetta Inpharmatics (Nasdaq: RSTA).

Programmable logic company Xilinx (Nasdaq: XLNX) won its
seven-year-old patent infringement suit Friday against
competitor Altera (Nasdaq: ALTR) and said it would seek an
immediate injunction against the loser. Back atcha, Altera
promised an immediate appeal of the jury verdict. Altera sought
to minimize the damage, asserting that the verdict covers only
Flex 8000 product sales, representing just 2%, or $30 million,
of its annual revenues. Xilinx is a favorite of telecom guru
George Gilder.

Alas, still darker days for Sunbeam (NYSE: SOC). The Securities
and Exchange Commission has recommended enforcement action
against the company and individual officers -- including former
Chairman and CEO ""Chainsaw"" Al Dunlap -- for alleged accounting
irregularities that created a sunny picture of actual cloudy
days for the camping goods and appliance manufacturer. Sunbeam
limped home Friday to $0.68.

Online auto dealer Autoweb.com (Nasdaq: AWEB) is laying off 25%
of its staff in an effort to save $10 million a year and become
profitable. The company's difficulty in attracting buyers to
online car showrooms joins priceline.com's (Nasdaq: PCLN)
similar woes. Autoweb's chart since its March 1999 IPO is an
emblem for the dot-com debacle. The company squeaked home to
$0.53 on Friday, a true penny stock.

Do you actually have the Henwood report.  It looks like you sent me the RW

Subject: 99 Peakers

Ben, 
Attached is the latest draft of the Beck report. I'm attaching a list that I 
prepared that generally has the items that are outstanding; however, the 
priority items are the back up information on performance testing (& curves) 
of the inlet fogging system and the peaking testing (output) of the three 
units and the confirmation of the data in table 5 (long term performance of 
the projects).
I have the O&M contracts, the monthly reports, and the contracts between OEC 
and Caldwell for the inlet fogging system, but these do not contain what 
Conrad (RW Beck) is looking for. My understanding from the operations guys is 
that there is data for the above items.
As discussed, Conrad will be here Monday morning, so if we could have the 
back up information for these items by then, it would expedite the process 
tremendously.
You can reach me at 54426 if you have any questions.
Thanks for your help.
Joana

Tuesday, the 21st,  at 1:00 pm we will have a meeting in 2988 for 
approximately one hour to discuss the schedules to the Purchase and Sale 
Agreements for the 1999 Peakers.  We will have copies of the schedules 
available for your review.  We need everyone's participation, particularly if 
you have any knowledge of the 1999 assets, and any contractual arrangements 
that may exist with the assets. We will be making reps and warranties as to 
the completeness of the schedules.  We can't afford to over look anything.  
If by chance we have excluded someone from the list of attendees that should 
be at the meeting, please forward this email to them.

We also have a call-in number for those outside the office 1-877-331-6867, 
code: 965303.

I apologize for planning this during what is typically a down week, however, 
we are on a tight timeline with the 1999s.

FYI: The potential sale of the 1999s has not been broadly distributed.  We 
are trying to limit this information to a fairly tight group.  Please keep 
this to yourself. 

Please email me back if you will not be attending.

Thanks,

Don

""It is human nature to think wisely and to act in an absurd
fashion."" -- Anatole France


AGILENT EARNS ITS ""A""
Agilent tops estimates and moves to the head of the class.

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

If there were truth in ticker symbols, Agilent (NYSE: A) would
be holding up its ""A"" report card proudly. With quarterly
estimates pegged at $0.53 a share, the electronics testing
equipment maker powered up expectations with a $0.69-a-share showing.

That was a 77% surge in bottom-line growth before charges on
$3.4 billion in revenues for the September period. That's
welcome news for a company that has seen its shares fall sharply
since peaking at $162 back in March.

However, a slowdown in microchip testing equipment as well as
weakness in the wireless market has the company warning of
slower growth ahead. With a healthy backlog of orders, Agilent
still expects to meet estimates of $0.45 for the current
quarter.

Spun off by Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HWP) last year, Agilent will
be deploying new capital into areas where it sees higher growth:
communications and life sciences. I guess that gives the company
an ""A"" for effort too.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Chipped off the old block, semiconductor distributor Avnet
(NYSE: AVT) announced that earnings for the current quarter
would come in between a nickel to a dime below the $0.85-a-share
forecast. While acknowledging the cyclical ways of the chip
industry, the company believes that earnings for the rest of the
year will remain on track.

Attention holiday shoppers, Nieman Marcus (NYSE: NMG.A) reported
stronger-than-expected profits but warned of slow action at the
registers so far this month. That's critical as the upscale
department store chain heads into the important buying season.
Nobody wants to see the Grinch steal Christmas (well, OK, it did
top the box office this past weekend, but that's another story).

EDGAR Hoovered? The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC)
site for electronic financial filing and data retrieval will go
down on Friday for a ""major upgrade."" The Electronic Data
Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system -- thankfully better
known as EDGAR -- will be back up on Monday morning.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=205554

Has Ozzy Osbourne bitten off more than he can chew -- again? The
legendary showman is suing Hughes Electronics (NYSE: GMH) and
MCY.com (Nasdaq: MCYC) for broadcasting an Ozzfest 2000 concert
tour stop to Hughes' DirecTV subscribers. Osbourne claims that
tour sponsor MCY.com only had rights to a Web cast of the rock
event. Mr. Crowley will not be his legal counsel.

Deere (NYSE: DE) John? An epic Novell (Nasdaq: NOVL)? Hit the
Fluor (NYSE: FLR)? These questions and more will be answered as
the companies get set to release earnings today.

""Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it."" --- Lewis
Carroll


COKE LOSES ITS FIZZ FOR QUAKER
Coke's board says ""no thanks"" to the Quaker Oats deal. Who's
next in line?

By LouAnn Lofton

First it was PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP). Then it was Coca-Cola (NYSE:
KO). Now it looks like it's the French food company Groupe
Danone (NYSE: DA). What am I talking about? The latest bidder
for cereal company and Gatorade-owner Quaker Oats (NYSE: OAT),
of course.

Talks between Coke and Quaker are over. Coke's board of
directors met yesterday to discuss the potential $15.75 billion
stock acquisition of Quaker. Coca-Cola wanted Quaker for the
same reason that Pepsi did -- the Gatorade sports drink.
Gatorade controls about 80% of the sports drink market, with
Coke's Powerade coming in second. Coke would have been saddled,
though, with those parts of Quaker's business that make up the
majority of its revenues and are growing the slowest -- its
cereal and oatmeal operations.

It's likely that several factors led to the decision by Coke's
board not to proceed with the Quaker acquisition. First, with
value guru Warren Buffett as a director, you better believe that
the price Coke was going to pay for Quaker was a very important
consideration. Coke's shares had been driven down 10% since the
potential deal was announced Monday, as many thought Coke would
be paying too much for Quaker.

Another factor that likely caused the board to reject the
acquisition was the potential for antitrust hang-ups with the
deal, given that Coke's sports drink Powerade controls the
largest part of the market after Gatorade. A third contributing
factor was probably one of focus. Coke refocused itself on its
core beverages business in the late 1980s, and buying Quaker --
with its Cap'n Crunch and Rice-A-Roni, among other brands --
would have moved it beyond the beverage business once again. The
company doesn't appear to want to take that route.

So, Pepsi's out, Coke's out, and already, another company has
announced that it's pulling a chair up to the bidding table.
Danone issued a statement confirming that it is considering a
bid for Quaker. The bottled water, dairy products, and biscuits
company wants to develop its business to become ""a world leader
in focused, growth oriented, healthy nutrition and beverage
business."" Perhaps Quaker can help it get there.

NEWS TO GO

NTT DoCoMo, a subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corporation (NYSE: NTT), is rumored to be interested in buying a
20% stake in AT&T Wireless (NYSE: AWE). The investment would be
about $9 billion. A deal like this would give DoCoMo a presence
in the strong U.S. wireless communications market. Currently,
AT&T Wireless is a tracking stock of AT&T (NYSE: T). Once AT&T
splits into four separate businesses, AT&T Wireless will become
an independent company.

Software company Novell (Nasdaq: NOVL) announced fourth-quarter
and fiscal year-end earnings yesterday. Sales in the fourth
quarter fell 21% to $273 million from last year's $344.5
million. A decline in sales of the company's packaged software
to small businesses impacted results. On a diluted per share
basis, Novell broke even in the fourth quarter, matching
analysts' expectations. It earned $0.17 a share in the fourth
quarter last year. For the fiscal year, net income dropped to
$49 million, or $0.15 a diluted share, compared to $191 million,
or $0.55 per share the year before.

CacheFlow (Nasdaq: CFLO) reported second-quarter results
yesterday. The company, which makes technology that improves the
flow of content over the Internet, lost $0.09 a share on a pro
forma basis. Analysts had expected a loss of $0.11 a share.
CacheFlow's revenues grew to $32.55 million from last year's
$22.45 million. This sales increase of 45% was below the 55%
increase expected by some analysts, and shares traded down
after-hours despite the company's smaller-than-expected loss.

The president of fashion designer and retailer Liz Claiborne
(NYSE: LIZ) resigned. Denise V. Seegal, whose last day is
December 8, has been president of Liz Claiborne since 1996. Liz
Claiborne's Chairman and CEO Paul Charron said that there are no
plans to replace her, and that he'll be taking over her duties.
Charron said, ""We had different approaches. I wanted to get
closer to the managers running the business units.""

ASK THE FOOL

This weekly e-mail offers answers to questions that perplex most
beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an
investing-related lesson, as well. Enjoy!

-- What causes mortgage rates to rise and fall?

-- A. They fluctuate along with other interest rates. Interest
rates are affected chiefly by inflation and the market for debt
(notes, bills, and bonds, among other instruments). With
inflation extremely low in recent years, we've enjoyed low
interest rates. But if signs of inflation begin to pop up, it's
expected that the Federal Reserve, led by Alan Greenspan, will
hike up short-term interest rates via an adjustment in the rate
of interest on ""federal funds."" The ""fed funds"" rate is the rate
of interest a bank can charge another bank for use of its excess
money. The Fed can also change the ""discount rate,"" or the rate
paid by a bank to borrow short-term funds from the Fed. The
prime rate and other rates (such as mortgage rates) are based
primarily on these two interest rates.

The Fed raises these interest rates when the economy appears to
be growing too briskly, which can spur inflation. When the
economy is sluggish, it might cut these rates in order to give
American enterprise a boost. Lower rates give companies and
people (including house-shoppers) an incentive to borrow money.
However, remember that the money markets themselves (basic
supply and demand for money at each price point) exert the
biggest influence over interest rates, though the Fed is a big
influence on market expectations.

-- Q. Where online can I access earnings reports that companies
file with the SEC?

-- A. Many Web sites, such as ours, include access to these
filings in their stock data offerings. But you can also go right
to the source at sec.gov or freeEdgar.com.

INVESTING BASICS - GATHERING COMPANY INFORMATION

You're intrigued by Wookie Cookies Inc. (ticker: CHEWY) and
being a good Foolish investor, you want to research it. Simply
give the firm a jingle and ask the investor relations department
to send you an investor information package. (They're free!)
Tell them you'd like to receive the most recent annual report,
the latest 10-K and 10-Q reports, any recent press releases, and
any available analyst reports. Alternatively, you can save a few
trees by gathering the information immediately online at
freeEdgar.com.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D207902

The annual report will probably feature glossy photos of smiling
customers (or assorted alien life forms) chomping on cookies.
But look to the back of the report where the numbers will tell
you the real story about the business. There are three main
financial statements there. The income statement shows the
company's sales and profits. The balance sheet lists assets and
liabilities, such as cash, inventories and debt. The statement
of cash flows reveals where cash is coming from and going to.

These statements also appear in the 10-Q and 10-K reports. The
10-K is issued once a year, along with the annual report, and
10-Qs are issued thrice a year, at the end of the intervening
quarters. The 10-Q summarizes quarterly performance, while the
10-K features a lengthy discussion of the firm's operations and
challenges.

Financial statements reveal how quickly sales are growing, how
the company is financing its growth, how much profit it's
making, and much more. Pay attention to trends, to see if the
firm's financial health is improving or declining. Compare the
company with its industry peers, to see how it stacks up.

Remember that you can improve your chances for success if you're
actually a consumer of Wookie Cookies and are familiar with the
company's offerings. Also, talk about the business with other
investors, perhaps in an investment club.

Don't neglect online resources. Most company Web sites feature
an investor information section, with press releases, financial
statements, annual reports, and answers to frequently-asked
questions. Investor information sites like ours at fool.com
also offer a wealth of information on companies and communities
of investors sharing information.

Ben:

Thanks for the e-mail message.  I'm sorry for the delayed response, but I've 
been out of the country for over a week.

I will be in the office on Friday morning at about 9:00 am.  Unfortunately, I 
have a seminar to attend later in the morning and then I have to teach all 
afternoon so my time is a little tight.  If that is convenient for your 
schedule, however, please stop by my office.

Regards,

Keith

Mr. Brown: 
My name is Ben Rogers and I am currently applying to The Texas Business 
School for enrollment in the Fall of 2000.  I was referred to you by David 
Martin, graduate of the Business School and the son of John Martin, former 
Finance Professor.  I have worked with David at Enron for a couple of years 
and have learned a lot about the School.  I also was referred to you by Kyle 
Kettler, who graduated from the Business School in 1998 and who worked in the 
investment fund.  I have been working in several different finance positions 
within Enron for the last two and a half years. Before coming to Enron I 
worked for three years in a portfolio management group with State Street Bank 
in Boston. I am very interested in the combination of energy and corporate 
finance and have the desire to continue working in these industries after 
business school. I am also very interested in the investment fund.  I feel 
that with my prior experience with State Street Bank, I could contribute a 
great deal to the fund.  I am coming to visit the school on Friday, Feb. 18th 
and was wondering if you had time to talk to me about the Investment Fund.  
If you could please let me know if your available, I would greatly appreciate 
it.  If your not available that day, I would still like to talk with you 
about the program.  You can either e-mail me back or you can reach me at 
Enron in Houston at (713) 853-7998.  Please let me know if you want me to 
send you my resume, so that you have a better understanding of my background. 
The admissions office has my complete application with my resume.  Thanks in 
advance for taking the time to talk with me. Hope to hear from you soon. 

Ben Rogers

HEWLETT-PACKARD SETTLES GERMAN COPYRIGHT SUIT
The computer giant will pay for each past and future CD burner
sale.

By Tom Jacobs

Computer behemoth Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HWP) settled German
copyright test case litigation Thursday. The company agreed to
pay GEMA, Germany's top licensing entity, $1.54 for each compact
disc (CD) burner sold since February 1998 and $5.16 for each
future sale. A CD burner allows illegal copying of music off the
Web and onto a personal CD. Industry experts estimate that $500
million is lost annually to CD pirating, with a total of 25
million pirated music files available online. Hewlett-Packard
closed at $35.56 Friday, up 5.57% and 10% above its 52-week low
of $32.63.

GEMA sued Hewlett-Packard in May because it's the German market
leader in CD burners. GEMA initially sought up to $12.90 per CD
burner, now often available for under $200. Hewlett-Packard
spokesperson Jeannette Weisschuh wouldn't estimate the cost to
the company, but she noted that foreign online retailers would
gain an advantage by selling cheaper CD burners -- without
having to pay the fees. ""This was a trial to send an example for
the whole market,"" she said. ""It's unfair to the consumers who
have to pay more and unfair to the manufactures because it gives
us a competitive disadvantage.""

Most countries have agencies similar to GEMA (the U.S. has ASCAP
and BMI, for example), which collect license fees and pay them
to copyright owners through recording houses and music
distributors. Pre-digital-age copyright laws zapped makers of
equipment such as tape recorders and video players that could be
used to violate copyright laws, but now those laws have been
expanded into a world of CD burners, computer printers, hard
drives, and high-speed modems.

With music industry estimates of $5 billion a year lost through
bootlegging, other countries' licensing bodies are likely
watching Germany and making their own plans. Last Friday, Rex
Moore (TMF Orangeblood) covered developments in the U.S. with
online music file-sharing company Napster, now in cahoots with
-- get this -- German's media giant Bertelsmann.

NEWS TO GO

General Electric (NYSE: GE) ended speculation this morning by
naming Jeffrey R. Immelt, currently president and CEO of GE Medical
Systems, to succeed CEO Jack Welch when he retires at the end of 2001.
Effective immediately, Immelt is GE's president and chairman-elect,
and will serve on the GE board of directors and join Mr. Welch and
Vice Chairmen Dennis D. Dammerman and Robert C. Wright as a member
of the corporate executive office.

E-tailer Amazon.com's (Nasdaq: AMZN) website was down for 30
minutes the Friday after Thanksgiving, traditionally the busiest
shopping day of the year. Amazon spokesman Bill Curry said, ""It
was totally internal, it was a bug in the system that is now
exterminated. It had nothing to do with holiday traffic."" The
system was back up by 9:30 am.

After denying a possible merger with Gemstar-TV Guide (Nasdaq:
GMST) last Tuesday, bookseller Barnes & Noble (NYSE: BKS)
spokesperson Mary Ellen Keating on Friday would not rule it out,
saying that talks between the two companies spanned a wide range
of options.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=212089

Troubled cable and telecom giant AT&T (NYSE: T) stated it will
purchase no more equipment for cable upgrades from Antec Corp.
(Nasdaq: ANTC) or CommScope Inc. (NYSE: CTV) before next year.
The two companies' shares plummeted more than 20 % Friday on the
news. Shares of Scientific-Atlanta Inc. (NYSE: SFA), C-Cor.net
Corp. (Nasdaq: CCBL), and Harmonic (Nasdaq: HLIT), which also
sell cable TV equipment to AT&T, dropped on news they stopped
shipments. AT&T is Harmonic's biggest customer, and its shares
trade near a 52-week low due to continued losses and investor
concerns over AT&T's health.

Bloomberg reports that Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (NYSE: MWD)
has abandoned plans to buy Japan's Nippon Global Securities, and
instead will pursue its own retail offices in Japan. Many
international banks and brokerage firms have targeted Japan,
where most married households -- traditionally through the wives
-- maintained their savings in low or negative interest Post
Office accounts. Financial market liberalization -- the
so-called Big Bang -- has allowed foreign companies recently to
attack the Japanese securities market, known for requiring years
of building personal relationships to achieve business success.

Hi everyone.  Hope you all had a great Thanksgiving.
We had a great time in Chicago and are waiting to see
if it will happen again next year :-)  Just kidding
Michaela!

Okay, we need everyone to put in their wish lists so
some of us can start our shopping.  Please try and
give a couple of suggestions for yourselves-not just
one-in case we can't get something!  Also, I don't
think all adults have put in suggestions for their
children.

Once again, is it $125.00 per couple and $30.00 for
children??????  Also, what about the gift for Mom and
Dad??  Hope to hear from you all soon!
Megan

By the way, some suggestions for Ben and I---
anything we registered for that we didn't get
(Ross-Simons)
Any Spode stuff (except glasses)
I'll think of some other stuff

Ben,

Went up to Philly for the holiday. Jeanne and I hung out at Gioffre's on
Sunday for the Eagles-Redskins game.  He is doing well. Spoke with JV, he is
still enjoying being single and grabbing everything he can.

We are going skiing in PA in January, and we hope to go out west sometime
this ski season.  Actually, McGrath and Dolan are living in San Fran and
they said they might get a house for the ski season somewhere.  Sounds like
a good time.

I think 'W' will pull it off.  This whole thing is a crazy mess and I can't
wait for it to be done.  Gore was actually scary last night on TV.  I can't
believe the D's nominated him as their candidate.

Let us know if you are coming to DC. Talk to you later.

Luke

Hey:
Sorry about not getting back sooner - I have been traveling and was away
for Thanksgiving.  Megan and I went up to Chicago to visit one of her 5
sisters.  M&M's wedding was fun, saw some people I haven't seen since
college - pretty scary.  If ""W"" wins this election Megan and I are coming
to DC to watch the Inaugeration and maybe go to a ball or two, so we should
diffinently get together.  I will work on that when the time comes.
Besides, this election is absolutely crazy - Gore he working himself into
complete retirement with all this contesting.  How is everything going?
What are you guys doing for the holiday?  Megan and I are going out west to
do some skiing in Beaver Creek - I'm praying for powder.  Again, I hope all
is going well and I'll be better next time about getting back to you.  Good
to hear from you!
Ben

Richard,
Pat just informed me that you need numbers for starts and hours on Unit 3. 
Unit 3 had MarkV problems in the past that needed to be corrected by shutting 
down the system.  This erased any historical information that the machine had 
stored.  Unit 4 and 3 were started up within one or two days apart. There 
should be minimal difference between the two of them. We ran units 3&4 as 
brother and sister during the first year of operation, so I would feel very 
confident with the following numbers.
Fired Hours- 738
Fired Starts- 105
Emergency Stops- 5
Peak Fired Hours-8
Total Starts- 123
If you need further assistance please let me know. Ron D.

""Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding in which you put your money in

BASSETT HOUNDS
The furniture specialist barks -- and it bites.

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

Bad news is like sandpaper -- it can wear you down until you're
dull and finished. Bassett Furniture (Nasdaq: BSET) becomes the
latest home furnishings specialist to send out pink slips and
warn of reupholstered financials. Earlier this month,
Furniture.com discontinued operations.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=214564

However, unlike Furniture.com's inability to secure financing to
subsidize losses, Bassett remains profitable despite trying
times in the furniture industry. Higher oil prices make shipping
bulky pieces as costly as it is cumbersome. Even worse, rising
interest rates have slowed the housing market to a crawl.
Without new homes to stock up with new furniture, the industry
becomes as attractive as that hideous barcolounger collecting
dust in your attic. The soft demand now finds Bassett expecting
fourth-quarter earnings per share to come in as much as a dime
below the $0.42 consensus estimate.

To offset the cyclical weakness, the company also announced a
consolidation of its domestic wood manufacturing operations.
Ultimately, 280 workers will be displaced. However, the wood
chuck won't disrupt the company's modest growth plans. The
company is still on track to open 52-65 new Bassett Furniture
Direct and At Home retail stores a year over the long term.

Bassett also won't reduce its dividend. That's welcome news to
yield investors who are drawn to the $0.20 quarterly dividend.
The company's hefty payout -- a 6.8% yield based on yesterday's
close -- will keep the stock from falling too far down.

Selling at just 8-9 times this year's freshly revised earnings
and with savings looking to beef up the bottom line in years
ahead, maybe Bassett isn't howling at the moon. Lowering costs
in domestic production in the face of cheaper Asian imports is a
painful yet necessary step. Like the company itself, the move
will pay nice dividends when housewarming gifts once again line
the porches of suburbia.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

High fiber? Communications infrastructure heavyweight Dycom
(NYSE: DY) reported better-than-expected earnings on a 46% spurt
in profits. The $0.51-a-share showing was seven cents ahead of
analyst estimates. Total contract revenue climbed by 32% for the
quarter. Dycom also named President and CEO Steven Nielsen as
its Chairman, succeeding the retired Thomas Pledger. Nielsen
will wear all three hats. He will also preside over the
company's acquisition of privately held Point to Point
Communications.

Is it Kevorkian or Kerkorian? Billionaire investor Kirk
Kerkorian, DaimlerChrysler's (NYSE: DCX) fifth-largest
shareholder, is suing the car maker for $9 billion. Kerkorian is
all revved up over his claim that the 1998 merger between
Daimler Benz and Chrysler was sold to him as a marriage of
equals. In his view, the European Mercedes Benz parent is
clearly in the driver's seat now. He'd rather play shotgun than
ride shotgun. According to Kerkorian, it was deception that
caused him to submit his 14% stake in Chrysler in favor of the
union.

The good, the bad, and the Covad (Nasdaq: COVD). The struggling
DSL provider has announced layoffs and will be scaling back its
marketing and network expansion costs. The expense reductions
should amount to 20-30% in annual savings beyond the onetime
charge, but that alone won't vault the company to profitability.
Many of the high-speed connection purveyors have had to temper
their expectations in recent months. Earlier, Covad had to
restate third-quarter results when it was having trouble
collecting from deadbeat cash-strapped ISP customers.

Like country, like company. Altera (Nasdaq: ALTR) and AT&T
(NYSE: T) have announced new presidents. There were no dimpled
chads in the board room.

H & R Block (NYSE: HRB) ahead? Pall (NYSE: PLL) bearer? Is ADC
Telecommunications (Nasdaq: ADCT) OK? These are just some of the
questions the market will answer when the companies report
quarterly results today.

Thanks for the reply!  I will be driving to Austin Friday morning and 9:00 am 
looks like a good time to meet.  My afternoon (1:00-5:00) is full with a 
information session, meeting with other Professors (Titman, Ronn and Jemison) 
and an Admissions interview.  I would appreciate it if you could send me your 
office location, so I can meet you at 9:00am on Friday.  Thanks again for 
taking the time to meet with me.  Look forward to meeting you.

ADC'S SOLID Q4
Broadband equipment company ADC reported strong growth in Q4.

By LouAnn Lofton

Broadband networking equipment maker ADC (Nasdaq: ADCT) reported
fourth-quarter and fiscal year-end results yesterday after the
market's close. Strong broadband connectivity sales led to net
income growth (excluding charges) of 94%, beating estimates.

ADC's sales for the fourth quarter were $1.03 billion, ahead of
last year's $634 million by 63%. Pro forma operating income
increased 121% to $206 million, from $93 million. Pro forma net
income for the quarter was $138 million versus the year-ago $71
million. On a per-share basis, ADC earned $0.18. Analysts as
polled by First Call/Thompson Financial expected $0.17 a share.

ADC's broadband connectivity sales grew 102% compared to last
year. The company's international sales increased 63% to $227
million. North America and Europe continue to be ADC's largest
sales regions.

Looking ahead to the next fiscal year, ADC expects full-year
earnings per share to be between $0.68 and $0.70, which is
in-line with current estimates. The company sees its sales for
the year coming in between $4.15 billion and $4.30 billion. ADC
does expect first-quarter earnings to come in shy of current
estimates by a penny. The company pointed to seasonal trends as
the reason for this.

ADC's chairman and CEO, William J. Cadogan, said of the results,
""We were firing on all cylinders as each of our three major
business groups and international hit all-time high sales in the
quarter. Our outstanding employees were key contributors in ADC
surpassing the significant milestone of one billion dollars in
sales for the first time in a quarter."" News to Go
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Argentinians won't be getting any more Wendy's (NYSE: WEN) Spicy
Chicken Sandwiches starting soon. The fast-food company said
yesterday that it is immediately closing all 18 of its
restaurants in Argentina. They've been unprofitable for more
than a year. The company will take a onetime charge in the
fourth quarter of between $17 million and $22 million, or
$0.08-0.11 a share. CEO Jack Schuessler said, ""The economic and
competitive conditions we faced in Argentina were just too
difficult to overcome, despite the efforts of our management
team and a dedicated crew at the stores.""

Internet consulting company iXL (Nasdaq: IIXL) said on Tuesday
that it will lay off 850 employees and close seven offices. iXL
cut 350 jobs back in September. The latest round of job cuts
represent about 35% of iXL's staff. iXL will take a charge in
the fourth quarter for the restructuring, and expects to be
profitable by early 2001. The company has about 300 clients, and
says it plans to start focusing heavily on its top 75 clients.
Bill Getch, an iXL spokesman, said, ""Our larger clients, they
want deeper engagements.... But they're taking much more time to
select and contract a lot of that work. So the sales cycle has
extended. If you've built a large infrastructure and the sales
cycle has lengthened... then you either increase the pipeline
fast enough to sustain that infrastructure or you reduce that
infrastructure.""

Pork processor Smithfield Foods (NYSE: SFD) reported
second-quarter earnings yesterday. The company's net income
doubled to $44.6 million, or $0.81 a share, from last year's
$22.2 million, or $0.48 a share. Smithfield, therefore, beat the
consensus estimate of $0.77 a share. The company's results were
driven by live hog prices that were 20% higher in the second
quarter than they were in the previous second quarter. Sales
increased to $1.4 billion from $1.2 billion in the year-ago
period.

BFGoodrich (NYSE: GR) is selling its performance materials
division to an investor group for $1.4 billion, the company said
today. This completes BFGoodrich's move from a tire and chemical
company to an industrial products and aerospace company.
BFGoodrich will get $1.2 billion in cash and $200 million in
debt securities for the business. Possible uses for the proceeds
from the sale are debt repayment, acquisitions, and share
repurchases, according to the company.

ASK THE FOOL

This weekly e-mail offers answers to questions that perplex most
beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an
investing-related lesson, as well. Enjoy!

-- Q.  What do you think of viaticals as investments?

-- A. Viatical settlements have grown in popularity in recent
years. But they're not without risk and they may make some
people uncomfortable.

Viatical settlements are when a terminally ill person sells his
or her life insurance policy to someone else. Imagine John,
stricken with a fatal form of cancer. He's 36 and is expected to
live only three more years. If he needs cash to pay for medical
bills or just to spend and enjoy, he might sell his life
insurance policy to Jane. If it's set to pay $100,000 on his
death, Jane might pay $66,000 for it. That way he gets a lot of
cash now and Jane expects to get the $100,000 in about three
years. At that rate, she'd be earning roughly a 15 percent
annual return.

There are many risks, though. John may hang on for seven years,
significantly reducing Jane's return. Indeed, a cure for his
cancer might be discovered. John may even outlive Jane! It's
true that these settlements can provide a service for sick
people, but they're not necessarily win-win. The middlemen
arranging these settlements take cuts. Also, if John lives, he's
without his life insurance policy and few insurers will want to
insure him, as he's been so sick recently.

We're uneasy about investing in something that has us rooting
for speedy deaths and against medical breakthroughs. Also, there
have been many instances of fraud with viaticals.

-- Q. What does ""shrinkage"" mean in the business world?

-- A. It refers to the loss of inventory that happens through
usual ways, such as accidental breakage, theft, weather damage,
etc.

INVESTING BASICS - IN THE MARGINS

If you're new to investing, you've probably stared at an income
statement (sometimes called a statement of operations) and
scratched your head, wondering what it's telling you. Let us
help.

First, understand that the income statement summarizes sales and
profits over a period of time. It might cover three months or a
year, for example. It will usually offer information for the
year-ago period as well, so you can compare the two and spot
trends.

Here's a slightly dated but nevertheless interesting example.
Let's look at Eskimo Pie Corp.'s income statement for fiscal
year 1998. At the top, as with every income statement, you'll
find net sales (sometimes called revenues). For Eskimo Pie,
they're $63.5 million.

From now on, as we work down the income statement, various costs
will be subtracted from the revenues, leaving different levels
of profit. The item you'll find just under revenues is ""cost of
goods sold"" (abbreviated as COGS and sometimes called cost of
sales), which represents the cost of producing the products or
services sold. For Eskimo Pie it's $37.4 million. Subtract the
COGS from revenues, and you'll get a gross profit of $26.1
million.

To find the gross profit margin, simply divide the gross profit
by revenues. $26.1 million divided by $63.5 million yields a
gross margin of 41 percent. (Compare results with industry
peers. For example, at a similar time, gross margin was 35
percent for Ben & Jerry's, which has a somewhat different
business model.)

Next, the remaining costs involved in operating the business,
such as support staff salaries, utility bills and advertising
expenses, are subtracted, leaving the operating profit. Eskimo
Pie's operating profit is $1.8 million. Divide this by revenues,
and you get a slim operating margin of 2.8 percent. This reveals
the profitability of the company's principal business. (Ben &
Jerry's: 4.3 percent.)

Finally, after items such as taxes and interest payments are
accounted for, we come to net income, near the bottom of the
statement. Eskimo Pie's is $0.8 million. Divide that by revenues
and you get a net profit margin of 1.3 percent. (Ben & Jerry's:
3 percent.) The last part of the income statement is where the
company divides its net income by shares outstanding, to arrive
at earnings per share (EPS).

That's it!

Don,

The following questions/requests came out of our visit yesterday:

1.  Provide forecast for the overhaul budget.
2.  Provide forced outage (trips) reports since inception which should
include details of hours out, reasons, etc.  From the limited info we have,
we are surprised by the higher than expected trips, at least at one of the
units.  Any proposed solutions?
3.  What is the latest info on complaints on noise from neighbors?  New
petitions; responses; etc.
4.  What were the hours of operation in 1999 and 2000?  There were some
conflicts in the various info provided.
5.  Was PSD every applied for?
6.  Unit #4 seems to be running right at the 25 ppm for NOx.  If it does go
over 25 ppm, does it violate any regulations, permits, promises, etc.?
7.  The actual O&M numbers are higher than budget (almost twice the budgeted
number).  What cause this?
8.  High bearing temperatures have cause trips.  We understand that Enron
recommended this to be considered a Warranty Item.  Was it ever resolved
under warranty.
9.  Why was utilization much higher with unit 1?

Thanks.

David

Who ever has Cliff and Deirdre should get the kind of VCR that marks the
commercials and when you play back the recorded TV show, it SKIPS the
commercials.  Yes, technology is a wonderful thing.  Everyone witnessed it
here when we watched a taped episode of the West Wing.  It's a little extra,
but well worth it.

Dear Ben,
Its been a long time. I hope you have been well.
In case you do not remember me, we have met on the Super Saturday Dinner and 
we had an interesting conversation before heading the tables.

I am participating tomorrow of the Sell Weekend and I have arranged my 
traveling to Houston for early in the morning.
As you may remeber, I am very interested in the Corporate Developmet Group 
and it would great if we could meet tomorrow for 15 minutes or so in the 
early afternoon. Your advice would be extremely helpful.
Please let me know, so we can coordinate the time.
Thanks for all.

""No man is great by imitation."" -- Samuel Johnson


BROCADE COMMUNICATIONS FACES A TOUGH MARKET
The company's solid earnings report yesterday may not be
rewarded by increasingly skittish investors.

By Chris Rugaber

Storage network infrastructure company Brocade Communications
(Nasdaq: BRCD) reported a fourfold increase in revenues after
yesterday's market close, and beat analysts' earnings estimates,
but the company's shares declined in after-hours trading anyway.

Sales for the company's fiscal fourth quarter, which ended
October 28, rocketed upward to $132.1 million, from $30.1
million in the year-earlier period. Net income increased to
$27.2 million, from only $3.9 million a year ago. Earnings per
share jumped to $0.22, from last year's $0.03 per share, ahead
of consensus estimates of $0.20 per share. The company also
announced a 2-for-1 stock split that will take effect on
December 22, its third split since it became a public company in
May 1999.

Brocade makes switches and other equipment for data storage
networks, and has rapidly increased its market share, from about
30% a year ago to almost 60% today. The company's stock has
grown almost as quickly, up about 75% for the year as of
yesterday's close. The shares have declined in recent weeks,
along with several other data storage companies, due to concerns
over valuation, slowing economic growth, and increasing
competition in the data storage market.

Nevertheless, Brocade is quite bullish about its future. The
company projects revenue will grow 150% to $830 million in
fiscal 2001, and that gross margins will remain at 60%. The
company's CEO, Greg Reyes, noted that ""We just happen to be
serving a market segment that is one of the fastest-growing
market segments on the face of the planet and what I think will
emerge as the next major networking category.""

Despite the positive results, the company's shares, which fell
4.5% yesterday in advance of the earnings report, traded down
further in after-hours activity, as investors become
increasingly nervous about richly valued technology stocks. As
one analyst told Reuters, ""I would think [the stock price] would
go up, but oh well.... The market environment we are in is not
normal.''

Fool's computer hardware sector page. In addition, data storage
software companies are analyzed in this year's Industry Focus.

AFTER-HOURS COVERAGE
GATEWAY WARNS OF DOWNBEAT Q4, 2001
By David Marino-Nachison
PC direct seller Gateway (NYSE: GTW) has historically looked
forward to a strong start to the holiday selling season, but
that didn't happen this year. Now the company not only forecasts
a disappointing fourth quarter but upcoming year as well. FULL STORY>>>
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=220745
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Telecom giants AT&T (NYSE: T) and NTT DoCoMo officially
announced their widely rumored partnership today, with the
Japanese mobile communications services provider agreeing to
purchase 16% of AT&T Wireless (NYSE: AWE) for $9.8 billion. AT&T
Wireless, currently a tracking stock, will receive $6.2 billion
and AT&T will receive $3.6 billion in cash. The purchase values
AT&T Wireless at $23.50 per share, a 31% premium over
yesterday's closing price. DoCoMo, which means ""everywhere"" in
Japanese, has been taking minority stakes in wireless service
providers around the world as part of its strategy to extend its
services internationally. The two companies also announced that
AT&T Wireless would form a wholly owned subsidiary to develop
mobile data and multimedia services similar to DoCoMo's wildly
successful i-mode service. AT&T Wireless, the third-largest
wireless service provider in the U.S., also said it would
introduce third-generation (3G) data services in 2002, using the
same W-CDMA standard that DoCoMo is planning to use.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=220746

Leading local phone company Verizon (NYSE: VZ) yesterday
announced that it has canceled plans to buy a majority stake in
floundering DSL provider NorthPoint Communications (Nasdaq:
NPNT), after NorthPoint restated third-quarter financial results
on November 20, lowering sales by about 20%. Like its fellow DSL
provider Covad Communications (Nasdaq: COVD), which also reduced
previously announced sales earlier this month, NorthPoint blamed
the restatement on non-payment from financially strapped
customers. Nevertheless, Verizon believes it can terminate the
deal as a result of the changes in NorthPoint's business and
financial condition. NorthPoint's CEO said that she may seek
""legal remedies.""

Struggling retailer Gap (NYSE: GPS) fell in after-hours trading
upon reporting a 1% same-store sales drop for the month of
November, thanks largely to declines in its Banana Republic and
Old Navy stores. The company also said that it is ""cautious"" in
its outlook about next quarter's sales and earnings. Gap's
earnings have fallen for the past two quarters.

Programmable computer chip maker Altera (Nasdaq: ALTR) yesterday
warned for the second time this month that revenues would slow
in upcoming quarters, causing the company's shares to fall
sharply in after-hours trading. The company said in a conference
call that sales for the fiscal fourth quarter would be flat
sequentially, and that first-quarter 2001 sales would increase
less than 5%, down from an 84% revenue increase in the third
quarter. Overall, the company estimates that revenues for fiscal
2001 will grow 35%, below current estimates for 49% growth for
the year. The company blamed inventory buildup at contract
manufacturers for the slowdown. ""November was an awful month,""
said CEO Rodney Smith.

PEPSI COURTING QUAKER, AGAIN
Quaker Oats and Pepsi are talking once more, but will the
outcome be the same?

By Mike Trigg

The Quaker Oats (NYSE: OAT) story took another spin yesterday,
when the world's second-largest soft drink company, PepsiCo
(NYSE: PEP), resumed talks to purchase the maker of Gatorade for
$14.3 billion. Not long ago, similar discussions were brought to
a halt after Quaker rejected Pepsi's offer, citing a dispute in
price.

The story with Quaker is an interesting one. After similar talks
with Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and French food conglomerate Groupe
Danone (NSYE: DA) failed to materialize, investors are left to
ask: Is this time for real?
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D223139

According to The Wall Street Journal, the two sides appear close
to agreement, with the deal potentially wrapping up in the next
couple of days. If the two sides in fact do reach agreement, an
announcement would be made Monday morning. Both companies have
planned board meetings for this Saturday.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D223140

Apparently, the proposed deal is no different than the last.
Quaker Oats shareholders would receive 2.3 shares of Pepsi
stock, valued at $104.36, based on Pepsi's closing price of
$43.38 yesterday. That's a 27% premium to Quaker Oats=01, stock
price as of November 2, the day original talks were made public.
Pepsi hasn't offered a ""collar"" -- the original deal breaker --
to Quaker, which is a form of price protection that fixes a
price within a set limit of how far the buyer's shares can rise
or fall. The same Wall Street Journal article reports that an
arrangement is being negotiated that would allow Quaker to
abandon the deal if the value provided to Quaker shareholders
became less than $90 per share upon closing.

If the deal does go through this time around Pepsi would surpass
Coca-Cola as the leader in the non-carbonated U.S drinks market,
holding nearly one-third of the market, compared to Coca-Cola's
21%. According to the Street, Pepsi would also be able to jump
start sales of Quaker Chewy Granola bars, selling them through
its Frito-Lay food division.

NEWS TO GO

Information transfer device maker Crossroads Systems (Nasdaq:
CRDS) announced better-than-expected third-quarter results after
the market's close yesterday, reporting a net loss (excluding
goodwill and stock compensation) of $4.8 million, or $0.18 per
share, compared to a loss of $870,000, or $0.04 per share, in
the year-ago period. The Street consensus called for the company
to lose $0.21 per share. Crossroads=01, top line came in at $8.4
million, an 18% increase year-over-year.

Discount airline company Cheap Tickets (Nasdaq: CTIX) announced
that CFO Dale Jorgensen plans on retiring in February. Jorgenson
will remain with the company after his retirement to aid in the
transition and provide assistance on certain projects. ``While
my time with Cheap Tickets has been very rewarding, I have
decided to devote more time to my family and other personal
interests. I am very pleased to have been part of the progress
the company has made moving into the public market and see a
great future for Cheap Tickets' unique multi-channel revenue and
distribution model,'' said Jorgensen.

Carbon dioxide seller Kinder Morgan Energy Partners (NYSE: KMP)
announced a deal with GATX Corp. (NYSE: GMT) to purchase two oil
product pipelines and 12 storage terminals for $1.15 billion in
cash and debt. Kinder Morgan Partners Chairman and CEO Richard
Kinder estimated the deal would increase earnings per share
between $1.62 and $1.75 in 2001, with the Street consensus
calling for the company to earn between $1.50 and $1.62 a share
in the coming year. The deal is expected to close in the first
quarter of next year.

Heating and cooling products provider Modine Manufacturing
(Nasdaq: MODI) announced that it was revising earnings and sales
forecasts for its third quarter and the full fiscal year (ends
March 31, 2001). The Racine, Wisconsin-based company expects
third-quarter revenue to be down 10% to 13% and earnings 55% to
65%. For the full year, sales should be down 7% to 10% with
earnings dropping between 25% and 30%. The company cited a weak
euro and lower sales in the heavy-truck and light-vehicle
markets. Modine earned $2.20 per share in the previous year.

Steel processing company Worthington Industries (NYSE: WOR)
announced that its second-quarter (ended yesterday) earnings
would fall short of expectations and that it had halted its
proposed $300 million acquisition of three Pennsylvania limited
partnerships: MetalTech, NexTech, and GalvTech. The company said
earnings would be substantially lower than the $0.15 per share
it posted in the previous quarter and that the full-year Street
earnings expectation of $1.07 was unrealistic. The Street
consensus called for the company to earn $0.22 per share in the
second quarter. The company cited the weakness in several of its
business, including its steel-processed products operations.

Subject: Additional information for Rochester

We can respond outside of the formal RFP if we get something to them soon.  
They want to see if we have anything to offer.  In the meantime, they will go 
forward with their RFP.

Do not factor in any cost for the gas pipeline.  The local distribution 
company will absorbe the cost and go at risk for new incremental load.

The cost to go through the LDC is 15 cents/mmbtu on a variable or usage 
basis.  10 cents for transport and 5 cents for service fee.  Peoples gas 
aggregates gas purchases for a number of customers in the region and 
purchases gas month to month.  RPU pays a fixed gas price that changes month 
to month.

We would need to add 15 cents/mmbtu to gas price from our curves.

Substation work should be approximately $5.8MM and no higher than $6mm.

As a point of reference, RPU's estimate for a fully installed LM-2500 is 
$17MM.  They break this out to $11.8MM for turbine and generator, $1.2 MM 
engineering cost, $400k winter package and $3.6MM other stuff.

RPU will have a gas pressure guarantee of 300# so we need to have a 
calculation done on the cost of compression to step up from 300 to 600.  My 
guess is that it will be around $1mm.

I would like to have something to Rochester by mid next week.  We can use the 
routine 2 page proposal format.

Yes, those are the numbers I have gone by and I have
already done my shopping!!! :-)  Anyway, we really
have to get going on MOm and Dad's gift so I can feel
like I am getting somewhere.  Anyone interested in
taking responsibility for the shopping around????
Speak up now!  Also, did I hear besides shopping for
the kiddie KK, we can/should shop for our
godchildren???  Someone please let me know.

Where should adult KK gifts be sent??  To the couples
home or if they live in NY, to Mom and Dads???

Ben and I got our first tree this year--how exciting!!
 We got it and put it up today.  It looks beautiful if
I do say so myself.  Here is a new list for Ben and I
since Maeve doesn't think it is appropriate for me to
ask for china and things Ben probably doesn't want---
Ben-- a BROWN snap on Tiffany belt (for the silver
buckle)  they will know what you mean.  Dee-maybe your
friend can get this at a discount???  Any Beatles
CD's--  I think one is called Beatles One--  or a
Beatles box set (if there is one)---or camel color
cordeuroy's from POLO (don't know how much they are)
in a 38 X 32--
Now for ME--spode china 5 PPS,  anything from Tiffany
(if you are going there for Ben's gift) again,
Dee-maybe you can get at a discount???-- earrings
(silver balls) or bracelet (silver balls),  tiffany
heart necklace, etc., I also saw at POLO (if you go
there for Ben's gift) a tea pot to go with our
everyday Claire Pattern,  there are these miniature
stand up figures called ""The Carolers"" (I know Talbots
has some), that I am collecting (department stores may
have them also) about a foot tall--they all look like
they are singing.
Anyway, I hope this gives some more ideas for our
KK's.  Hope you all had a great weekend!  Oh, I have
our address for Colorado (but please send to arrive
after the 16th)
Rogers
114 Bermuda Drive
Edwards, CO  81632
Thanks so much!!  Meg and Ben

PEPSI FINALLY WINS QUAKER
PepsiCo will wed Quaker for $13.4 billion in stock.

By Tom Jacobs

Ending weeks of maneuvering and speculation, PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP)
has agreed to buy Quaker Oats (NYSE: OAT) for $13.4 billion in
stock. Pepsi matched its deal of one month ago of 2.3 shares per
Quaker share, valuing Quaker at $97.46 per share, based on
Pepsi's Friday close at $42.38. Quaker ended Friday at $88.63.

The deal follows weeks of machinations that began with a
rejected Pepsi bid for Quaker, followed by interest from
Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and France's Groupe Danone (NYSE: DA) --
reportedly at a price more than $14 billion. With the departure
of Coke and Groupe Danone from negotiations, attention returned
to Pepsi,whose original lower offer now looked darn good to
almost-left-at-the-altar Quaker.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=225166
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=225167

The pact creates a food and beverage powerhouse with $25 billion
in revenues and an expected $80 billion market cap. The deal
gives Pepsi three key advantages: 1) Pepsi swigs Quaker Oats'
Gatorade sports drink, which is tops in its market and carries a
huge distribution and warehouse system that Pepsi hopes will
increase efficiency and reach for its Tropicana brand; 2)
Quaker's fruit, oatmeal, and granola bar and other snack
products will spice Pepsi's Frito-Lay and other snack foods; 3)
highly profitable Quaker brands such as Quaker Oatmeal, Life and
Cap'n Crunch Cereals, Rice-A-Roni (""the San Francisco treat!""),
and Aunt Jemima syrup provide hefty free cash flow.

Pepsi's CEO and Chairman Robert Enrico had planned to retire,
and will now speed up his move. Current President Steve
Reinemund will become CEO, and Enrico will remain on the board
as vice chairman. Quaker's CEO Robert Morrison, credited with
Quaker's turnaround, committed to stay on for 18 months and will
join Enrico on the board as a vice chairman. Indra Nooyi,
Pepsi's CFO, becomes president, increasing the ranks of
big-company top-level women executives.

The fianc,s agreed to two price conditions: If Pepsi stock drops
under $40 for 10 days in the month before closing, valuing
Quaker at $92 a share, Quaker may walk unless Pepsi commits to
$92 a share. On the flip side, Pepsi pays no more than $105 a
share, even if its stock climbs over $45.65 a share. Pepsi will
issue 315 million shares to pay for the purchase, which the
parties expect to be completed in the first half of 2001 --
depending on antitrust scrutiny.

NEWS TO GO

Bloomberg reports the network storage giant EMC (NYSE: EMC) will
introduce a product, code-named Chameleon, to compete against
Network Appliance (Nasdaq: NTAP) in the small to medium-size
business market for network attached storage (NAS). EMC already
competes in the market for large corporation NAS, and holds 30%
of the overall NAS market compared to Network Appliance's 40%,
according to information technology market researcher IDC. IDC
estimates that the NAS market will reach $7 billion by 2003. EMC
closed Friday at $78.25, off a 52-week high of $103.94, while
Network Appliance finished at $53.94, from a 52-week top of
$152.75.

Barron's reported in its December 4 edition that eBay (Nasdaq:
EBAY) was in talks to buy uBid, a unit of CMGI (Nasdaq: CMGI).
Reuters reported that an eBay source denied the story, though
eBay declined official comment. According to Barron's, UBid
plans to pop the champagne this week on a new
consumer-to-consumer auction site, Auction Exchange, to compete
with eBay. UBid has 1.5 million registered users, and its
current online auction site sells mostly refurbished and
closed-out consumer electronics.

Bad news keeps copying at Xerox (NYSE: XRX). After Moody
downgraded Xerox debt to junk-bond status on Friday, the company
announced it would lay off 200 production workers -- the first
time in more than a year that the company has fired union
workers. The laid-off employees must work until December 22 but
will receive pay and benefits through January 26. This action
follows November's decision to pink-slip 350 white-collar U.S.
workers, and both are separate from last March's decision to lay
off 5,200 workers by April 2001. Xerox shares closed Friday at
$6.25, down 56.3 cents, or 8%.

Swiss drug giant Novartis (NYSE: NVS) announced positive Phase
II results from its developmental leukemia drug, Glivec.
Leukemia involves uncontrolled proliferation of white blood
cells. Glivec selectively targets a key protein involved in
leukemia, and Novartis hopes the drug will be used instead of
painful bone marrow transplants or more toxic alpha interferon
treatment. Significant response rates varied according to the
disease stage, and ranged from 33% to 78%, with 30% showing
normal blood counts. Glivec is still several years from the
pharmacy shelves because it faces larger Phase III studies and
application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
marketing approval.

I thought I sent this earlier, but there are some problems with the system so 
here it is again.  This is the deal sheet for the week of Monday Feb. 14th.  
I will go through it with Ben and show him how to track the deals and update 
the deal sheet on a weekly basis.  If you have any questions, please give me 
a call.

Ben

Here is some information I put together when I was working on the coal 
presentation.  The preliminary ecomonics tab looks at the dispatch spread 
between coal and natural gas and the difference in variable O&M for coal and 
natural gas plants.  

If you need a model for a coal plant, I would suggest talking to the 
Generation Investments group.  They are working on a deal where they are 
buying some coal plants (the Allstrom Deal) and have created models for coal 
plant ecomomics.  I believe Chuck Ward and Bill Keeney are spear-heading that 
effort.   

Please let me know if you have any questions about what I've sent you or if I 
can help you with anything else.



Thanks,
Rebecca

Subject: Question 2


More Questions:

Both Plants

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

Start-up emissions vary and can not accurately be measured due to the 
inherent delay time in the CEMS system.  Additionally, start-up emissions are 
not required to be and in fact were not measured during the stack testing.  
There are no limitations on emissions during start-up evolutions, since the 
permits at both plants allow exceptions to exceedences during start-ups and 
shutdowns.

2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?


Caledonia

3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

Normally, there is a short period during startup when the NOx goes to 
approximately 35 ppm.  This is very short in duration and occurs while the 
gas turbine is loading.  Our site is permitted to normally operate between 
70-100% turbine load.  These emissions have subsided within the few minutes 
required to attain 70% load.  Our permit constraints require that we do not 
exceed our emissions limits on a 3 hour rolling avarage.  Therefore these 
short-term startup emissions are not an issue.  

CO is a calculated value.  I do not have short-term CO2 numbers at present.  
However, I don't believe they are at issue since they are related to excess 
air which is pretty high during startup.

There is a condition called lean-lean firing which can and has occured from 
time to time.  A transition takes place above 40MW when the nozzle gas 
arrangement normally goes to a firing state called ""premix steady state.""  If 
this transition fails for some reason, the machine goes into a lean-lean 
state and the NOx level can rise to 40-50 ppm.  The turbine activates and 
operator alarm when this happens.  We can count the number of occurances that 
this has happened on one hand at Caledonia.  When this conditions occurs, the 
operators correct the condition by reducing the load to about 35MW and then 
increase the load again.  Typically this resolves the faulty transition and 
it configures the nozzles correctly on the second attempt.



2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?

No industrial stormwater permit is required at Caledonia.



3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

The fuel sampling schedule for both sulphur content and heating value at 
Caledonia is once per month.

Pat Cathers

There is only one quarterly report required for Brownsville. This is the EPA 
electronic data report (EDR) which we generate from the CEMS system and 
submit electronically to the EPA. 

Mitchell - Since you are generating the 3rd quarter reports to the EPA today, 
would you please copy Ben on the submittal. Thanks.

Ben,

As requested I have attached BPI's 2nd QTR EDR reports for your review, 
comment and record.  I do not have a ""Final"" or accepted 3rd QTR EDR from the 
EPA yet.

Mitch,

I spoke with Chris Meyer.  He said that hey should have asked for more 
detail, but only asked for total gas volumes moved.  As a first cut, let's go 
back with total volumes in 1999 and 2000 (broken out separately).  They may 
come back wanting more detail, but this will serve as a start.

Thanks,

Don"

Charlie:
I got your message this morning.  Since we were so successful in selling some 
of our peaking plant last time, we have decided to some some more - so we are 
running like crazy to close these deals this year.  I want to let you know 
that I talked to both people at KinderMorgan and Cinergy about your company 
and the types of transactions that you guys are doing.  I have not had the 
chance to follow up, but plan to real soon.  I just tried to call you about 
10 minutes ago, thus the e-mail response.  I will try again in a little bit.  
Hope all is going well and I'll talk to you soon.

On second thought, please forward this, along with the gas volume info., to 
the appropriate parties at Cinergy.  Please send the below as opposed to the 
previous version.  I've made changes pursuant to my conversation with Zisman.

Responses to Cinergy's Gas Transport Questions

Brownsville
1)  Verify Type of Transportation Service and Identify location of 2 hour 
notice.
Transportation is provided  under  ITS Service Agreement Contract No. 10290 
.  This contract  is ANR's  pro forma ITS Agreement from its FERC Gas 
Tariff.  Changes to the pro forma  are included in the various rate letters 
(most recent dated September 20, 2000), the Operating Agreement (dated March 
31, 1999) and the Additional ANR Transportation Service letter (dated March 
30, 1999).  These three agreements were assigned to Brownsville Power I, LLC 
per the Assignment Agreement dated December 1, 1999.  

Specific to the question of the two hour notice, Brownsville's rights are 
identified in the Operating Agreement under Article 1 on page 2 of the 
agreement (See Articles 1.01, 1.02 and 1.03).  ANR's two hour notice rights 
are also identified under Article 1 (See 1.05).  Please note that ANR's two 
hour notice right is subject to the plant having taken delivery of gas 
volumes per Articles 1.01, 1.02 and 1.03.

2)  On ETS Conversion right, is ETS service seasonal or annual?
The seasonality of the conversion is not addressed under the Additional 
Transportation Letter dated March 30, 1999.  ANR's FERC Gas Tariff does not 
preclude a seasonal application of the ETS service.  
3)  Provided gas volumes burned at plant.
To be provided under separate cover.

Caledonia
1) Identify location of FT-BH rights in transaction documents (FT-A Contract).
Transportation is provided  under  Gas Transportation Agreement Service 
Package No. 29230.  This contract  is TGP's  pro forma Agreement from its 
FERC Gas Tariff.  Changes to the pro forma  are included in the Firm 
Transportation Discount Letter dated April 7, 1999.  Additional 
transportation rights negotiated by Caledonia, such as FT-BH (page 4) and the 
FT-A replacement contract (page 5), are included in a letter dated March 31, 
1999 titled ""Commercial agreement with:  CALEDONIA POWER I, L.L.C., Natural 
Gas Transportation"". 
2) Identify location of 4.5 Bcf/yr obligation in transaction documents (FT-A 
Contract).
This provision is included in the  Firm Transportation Discount Letter dated 
April 7, 1999 (See page 2 and 3, Article 3).
3) Provide gas volumes burned at the plant.
To be provided under separate cover.

Answers to your Questions:

Both Plants

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

See answers provided by Mitch and Pat. In addition, I offer the following:

Caledonia - There is no specific exemption in the permit for startup and 
shutdown. We tried to request one when we modified the permit for peak firing 
in May. The state told us however, that there is no need to provide a 
specific exemption in the permit and that we can rely on the exemption 
provided in the general rules under (APC-S-1, Section 10.2)

Brownsville - Again, there is no specific exemption for startup and shutdown. 
We are relying on the exemption provided in the general rules under 
regulation 1200-3-20-0.02 which calls for implementation of good management 
practice to minimize emissions during startup and shutdown.

2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?

No. There is no wastewater discharge at either site

Caledonia

3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

We are implementing the recommended EPA protocol for natural gas sampling 
which calls for twice per month the first six months, then once per quarter 
the first six quarters, then semi-annually thereafter. However, since we are 
also required under Part 75 to analyze for the natural gas heat content on a 
monthly basis, I have asked the plant managers to analyze for the sulfur

Brownsville

4.  What is the agency's response to the Enron letter regarding the 2nd
stormwater NOV?

We have not received any written correspondence from the agency following the 
second NOV. However, the site was inspected after completion of the 
corrective measures (around June 15) and the state inspector was satisfied 
with the progress made to bring the site into compliance with the stormwater 
construction permit.

5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwater
NOV was never responded to?

I am not aware of any action

6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was that
during construction only or is it ongoing?

I am not aware of anything existing. I believe that this is during 
construction.
Mitchell -- any thoughts on that?

7.  Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping
issue?

Mitchell - Please respond to this question"

""One hundred thousand lemmings can't be wrong."" -- Graffito


3COM DISAPPOINTS
Can a cash-rich balance sheet offset a slowdown in orders?

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

There was a time when 3Com (Nasdaq: COMS) networking equipment
and U.S. Robotics modems meant techie heaven. That time has long
since gone. Citing a shortage of parts and a slowdown in orders
from telco carriers, the company warned that third-quarter
results would come in softer than expected.

3Com is now projecting revenues for the period to come in
between $765 million and $780 million -- more than $100 million
below analyst estimates. A loss of $0.19 to $0.23 a share is
also nearly three times as wide as Wall Street's forecast for an
$0.08 deficit.

3Com had already begun to fade away from the investing community
radar. Once the company completed its spin-off of personal
desktop assistant maker Palm (Nasdaq: PALM) back in July, growth
investors had little reason to stick around. Standard & Poor's
felt the same way. It ditched the company in favor of its Palm
sprout for its S&P 500 Index.

While there are no guarantees, shareholders might take solace in
knowing that 3Com remains cash-rich. With $2.7 billion in cash
and short-term investments, the company is stacked with $7.75 a
share in greenbacks. In theory that should help limit the
downside not much farther below the $9.50 the stock was fetching
in after-hours trading yesterday. But even that may prove to be
knobby-kneed shelter if losses continue to widen. However, 3Com
believes that the carrier orders have simply been put on hold --
not hung up on the receiver. Shareholders better hope that 3Com
is making the right call this time.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

A slowdown in orders will also be taking a toll on Xilinx
(Nasdaq: XLNX) this quarter. The specialty chip maker warned
that it too would be reporting revenues short of analyst
expectations. Like its rival Altera (Nasdaq: ALTR), who had
warned just last week, an inventory backlog will not be a
painless fix.

It's time to pay for play at MP3.com (Nasdaq: MPPP). The popular
digital music site has now unveiled a ""Premier Service"" upgrade
to its existing My.MP3.com listening solution. For $49.95 a
year, users can beam up to 500 CDs to their account and stream
as many as 300 songs in a row without interruption. While the
free service never capped the allowable discs, it did have to be
restarted after playing every 50 selections. So much for the
free music revolution -- though the free basic My.MP3.com
service seems set to continue.

http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=227744

Finland's Nokia (NYSE: NOK) should give the wireless sector a
roaming charge this morning after the top dog announced that it
expects revenues to grow in the 25-35% range through at least
2003. Nokia controls nearly a third of the global wireless
handset market.

While weakness in online advertising is certainly not news
anymore, industry leader DoubleClick (Nasdaq: DCLK) confirmed
the malaise by sending out pink slips yesterday. The layoffs are
minor relative to other realignment sackings -- less than 10% of
its workforce -- but it does confirm the hard times in the realm of
Internet marketing. Brother, can you spare a banner ad click?

The thong throng? According to Bloomberg.com, News Corp. (NYSE:
NWS) and Disney (NYSE: DIS) have received European Council
approval to team up with Brazil's Globosat Programadora for a
joint venture in the latter's home turf. So an Australian media
giant teams up with a stateside titan and a local behemoth to
produce Brazilian television programming -- and Europe nods?
It's a small world after all.

I would add only one thing to the response from Gus.

In regards to #2, neither plant meets the definition of ""industrial activity"" 
under 40 CFR 122.  As a result, neither plant needs an industrial stormwater 
permit.  Both plants were required to obtain construction stormwater permits.

Answers to your Questions:

Both Plants

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

See answers provided by Mitch and Pat. In addition, I offer the following:

Caledonia - There is no specific exemption in the permit for startup and 
shutdown. We tried to request one when we modified the permit for peak firing 
in May. The state told us however, that there is no need to provide a 
specific exemption in the permit and that we can rely on the exemption 
provided in the general rules under (APC-S-1, Section 10.2)

Brownsville - Again, there is no specific exemption for startup and shutdown. 
We are relying on the exemption provided in the general rules under 
regulation 1200-3-20-0.02 which calls for implementation of good management 
practice to minimize emissions during startup and shutdown.

2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?

No. There is no wastewater discharge at either site

Caledonia

3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

We are implementing the recommended EPA protocol for natural gas sampling 
which calls for twice per month the first six months, then once per quarter 
the first six quarters, then semi-annually thereafter. However, since we are 
also required under Part 75 to analyze for the natural gas heat content on a 
monthly basis, I have asked the plant managers to analyze for the sulfur 
content monthly. 

Brownsville

4.  What is the agency's response to the Enron letter regarding the 2nd
stormwater NOV?

We have not received any written correspondence from the agency following the 
second NOV. However, the site was inspected after completion of the 
corrective measures (around June 15) and the state inspector was satisfied 
with the progress made to bring the site into compliance with the stormwater 
construction permit.

5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwater
NOV was never responded to?

I am not aware of any action

6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was that
during construction only or is it ongoing?

I am not aware of anything existing. I believe that this is during 
construction.
Mitchell -- any thoughts on that?

7.  Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping
issue?

Mitchell - Please respond to this question

Some revisions.  Gus, please verify, paying particular attention to the 
changes I made in #1.  I want to make sure I've referenced the correct 
portion of the federal code.

Mitch - I took out the first sentence from your answer to question #1. The 
CFR you wanted to refer to is part 60 and not part 75. In any case, I really 
do not think that the part 60 NSPS Subpart GG  limit of 98 ppm applies during 
startup and shut down. I believe that we are covered by the provisions of 
part 60 Subchapter A, Section 60.11(d) which calls only for good air 
pollution control practice to minimize emissions during startup and shutdown.

No short term emission limits apply during startup and shutdown. The only 
issue with startup and shut down emissions is that they get counted toward 
your total emissions for the year, and you certainly covered this issue in 
your last paragraph to question #1.

The revised file is attached.

Doc 01.07.02  - Talks about a 15% assessment for as valorem taxes.
Doc 01.07.02.01 - Property tax estimates - estimates from 2001-2019  (tax +
pilot payments) are $1M a year till 2009 and then to ~$1.4 M for next few
years beg 2010, dropping back down to $700K level.

In 2000, the property tax was just $500K, as there seems to be no pilot
payment until Jan 2001.

My questions are -
   Confirm that the 15% assessment in first doc is included in the estimate
   The schdule of estimated payments is all inclusive of the payments
   relating to property taxes
   Refer me to doc that talks about the pilot agreement or any other tax
   abatement docs

Thanks.

Subject:  Property tax - Caledonia

Doc 01.07.02  - Talks about a 15% assessment for as valorem taxes.
Doc 01.07.02.01 - Property tax estimates - estimates from 2001-2019  (tax +
pilot payments) are $1M a year till 2009 and then to ~$1.4 M for next few
years beg 2010, dropping back down to $700K level.

In 2000, the property tax was just $500K, as there seems to be no pilot
payment until Jan 2001.

My questions are -
   Confirm that the 15% assessment in first doc is included in the estimate
   The schdule of estimated payments is all inclusive of the payments
   relating to property taxes
   Refer me to doc that talks about the pilot agreement or any other tax
   abatement docs

Thanks.

Swati

Ben:

I am not sure that Swati from Duke understands what the payment schedule 
represents.  First of all, the property tax payments for assessment years 
2000 - 2009 range from a high of $590K to $490K and are not close to the 
numbers he feels are reflected by the schedule. 

 Property tax payments for any given assessment year in Mississippi are paid 
in January of the year following the year of assessment.  For example, the 
property taxes for the 2000 year assessment year are paid in January 2001 and 
the payment schedule reflects that ($591,200).  The other figure that shows 
in the column are property taxes for that year to be paid in the following 
year.

The 15% ratio of assessment has been taken into account in the calculation 
and the payments for the year are total estimated taxes for the year 
including the payment-in-lieu-of taxes payment (""PILOT"").

The document for the PILOT agreement has been supplied to the Duke Property 
Tax Department.  Have Swati contact Kelly Voelkel for any information he 
needs.

If additional information is necessary please contact me at X-30689.

Warren

when they were on-site yesterday.
Annual Emissions Report (condition #11)  - We submitted two semi-annual 
reports for the site so far, one on January 31, 2000 and another on July 31, 
2000. Mitchell will provide copy of the July report and the January report if 
available. The January report covers emissions for the third and fourth 
quarters of 1999.  This is really the annual report for 1999 because we did 
not operate in the first and second quarters of 1999. Duke already saw the 
July report covering January through June 2000.

COMVERSE NETWORKS A GOOD QUARTER
Comverse Technology reported estimate-beating third-quarter
results after the bell yesterday.

By LouAnn Lofton

Comverse Technology (Nasdaq: CMVT) reported third-quarter
earnings yesterday after the bell. The company, which makes
systems and software for telecommunications, had an increase in
revenues of 37% and net income growth of 52% when compared to
the third quarter last year.

Comverse's sales improved to $317.97 million versus $232.89
million in the year-ago period. Comverse earned $68.41 million,
excluding one-time charges for acquisitions, up from last year's
$44.96 million. The company beat the consensus estimate
according to First Call by two cents with earnings per share of
$0.38. Comverse had earnings per share in last year's third
quarter of $0.28.

In the third quarter, Comverse acquired Exalink and Gaya
Software. The company took an after-tax charge of $4 million for
costs related to the purchases of those businesses.

Comverse improved gross margins to 62.6% from 61.4% in last
year's third quarter. The company also increased its net margins
from 19.3% to 21.5%.

Driving the results for Comverse was strong demand for the
company's products from wireless providers. A majority of
Comverse's sales are to wireless network operators.

WORMS IN APPLE'S HOLIDAY QUARTER
By John Del Vecchio and Dave Marino-Nachison
With Gateway warning of a poor start to the holiday season less
than a week ago, there was definitely reason to figure that
Apple wouldn't be far behind in warning about near-term profits.
But in its most-recent quarter, Apple was the victim of its own
poor execution. How low can this cash-rich company's shares go?

GREENSPAN SPEAKS, STOCKS ROCKET
By Bill Mann
In a New York speech, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
said he is convinced that the torrid pace of economic growth
fueled by access to easy money has slowed. Greenspan remarked on
the fact that technology advancements have given the country
nearly unprecedented ability to gain efficiency -- but many
players in the high-tech market got to the game too late. Should
the economy slow too much, the Fed may just drop rates next
year. For now, though, the tightening bias is a thing of the
past. FULL STORY>>

NEWS TO GO

Home Depot (NYSE: HD) and 3M (NYSE: MM) have new chiefs and
they're both from General Electric (NYSE: GE). Home Depot named
Robert L. Nardelli its new president and CEO effective
immediately. 3M picked W. James McNerney Jr. as the company's
new chairman and CEO. Nardelli had been president and CEO of GE
Power Systems, and McNerney was head of GE Aircraft Engines.
Both men were being considered as replacements for GE's chairman
Jack Welsh, but were passed over in favor of fellow GE-er
Jeffrey Immelt.

Car parts retailer AutoZone (NYSE: AZO) reported a drop in
first-quarter earnings yesterday. The company's net income was
$53.8 million, down from last year's $56 million. Sales grew 6%
to $1.06 billion. Buoyed by share repurchases, AutoZone
increased earnings per share to $0.46 from the year-ago period's
$0.40. The company blamed the net income shortfall on ""a
difficult sales environment.""

Data storage company EMC (NYSE: EMC) said this morning that it
expects fourth-quarter earnings to increase by at least 55% over
last year's Q4 results. The company also thinks revenues will
grow to $12 billion in 2001. CEO Michael Ruettgers said in an
interview with Reuters that his company is ""very comfortable""
with the current 2001 revenue projections, which are almost
double the company's 1999 levels.

Lante Group (Nasdaq: LNTE), an Internet consulting business, is
cutting its staff by 19%. This translates to about 120 jobs, and
the closure of the company's Singapore and Delhi offices. After
the cut-backs, Lante will have around 500 employees. Lante hopes
to save around $4 million with the reductions, starting in the
first quarter of 2001. The company is trying to become ""cash
break-even"" during the first half of 2001. Lante's president and
CEO, Rudy Puryear, said, ""We did not react as quickly as we
should have to the speed and magnitude of this dramatically
changing environment. As a result, we are disappointed with our
recent financial results. Moreover, the decision to reduce our
workforce was very difficult, but necessary. We are implementing
several steps to reposition the business to grow revenue and
achieve profitability in the coming year.""

ASK THE FOOL

This weekly e-mail offers answers to questions that perplex most
beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an
investing-related lesson, as well. Enjoy!

-- Q. What does it mean when a company is said to be ""stuffing
the channel""? A company I was interested in has been accused of
this.

-- A. When a company stuffs the channel, it ships inventory
ahead of schedule, filling its distribution channels with more
product than is needed. Since companies often record sales as
soon as they ship products, channel stuffing can make it appear
that business is booming. In reality, the products not sold may
well be returned to the manufacturer. This means sales already
claimed may never occur. In a sense, sales from past quarters
are made at the expense of sales in future quarters.

See if accounts receivable growth is outpacing sales growth. If
so, that's a red flag. Alternatively, calculate ""days sales
outstanding"" (DSO). First, divide the last four quarters'
revenues by 365. Then divide accounts receivable by that number.
This reveals how many days' worth of sales the current accounts
receivable represents. Between 30 and 45 days is typical. You
can also follow the same process for the last quarter, dividing
last quarter's revenues by 91.25 (days in a quarter, on
average).

A company with a low DSO is getting its cash back quicker and,
ideally, putting it immediately to use, getting an edge on the
competition. Rising numbers can signify channel stuffing.
Remember this isn't useful for all companies. Restaurants and
cash-based businesses, for example, aren't going to have much,
if any, receivables.

-- Q. What's a holding company?

-- A. Holding companies own the securities of other firms. They
usually maintain voting control of these companies, as well. A
good example is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which owns
GEICO, See's candy and Dexter shoes.

INVESTING BASICS - ONLINE ATTRACTIONS

We're probably preaching to the choir here. Odds are you're a
somewhat seasoned computer user. Even so, though, you might do a
friend a favor by printing out the following article and
offering it to an offline friend, along with a little discussion
about why you find the Internet so darn useful.

Online. There's no place like it. Each day, more and more people
are using the Internet to find information, jobs, homes and
apartments, and friends. You've heard us sing of the way that
cyberspace is revolutionizing investing. It's got a lot to offer
you in many other arenas, as well.

Take shopping. You probably already know that you can buy books
and music online, at sites such as amazon.com and half.com. But
you can also head to wal-mart.com and buy an outdoor grill
without leaving your house. Visit 1800flowers.com and choose a
bouquet of flowers to be sent to your sweetie from the comfort
of your desk at work. Find items you collect, such as comic
books or antiques, on sale at auction sites like ebay.com. Apply
for and get a mortgage for your new home at eloan.com.

If you're interested in health and medicine, visit medscape.com
or thriveonline.com. Medical news and advice awaits you. Want
recipes? Visit epicurious.com and you'll soon be whipping up an
asparagus omelet or a country beet salad. Investigating travel
options? Check out travel.yahoo.com or travelocity.com. You can
scan for the flights you want and make reservations, get weather
forecasts and driving directions.

And of course, there's investing. Thanks to the Internet, you're
only a few clicks away from information that used to require a
lot of time and money to get. Many sites, such as fool.com and
marketguide.com, offer much data and information -- for free. At
the Fool, for example, you can scour our message boards for
opinions on companies, read through our news and portfolio
reports, and set up and track your portfolio's progress. Visit
excite.transium.com and you can read articles from a company's
industry trade journals.

The Internet has much to offer just about anyone, from kids
(agirllikeu.com and nick.com) to seniors (thirdage.com and
aarp.com). Besides Web sites, there's e-mail, which allows you
to communicate instantly and inexpensively with friends around
the world. You owe it to yourself to explore cyberspace at least
a little. If you don't have a computer, ask a friend with one to
give you an online tour. Many public libraries offer computer
access, as well.

Subject: Question 2


More Questions:

Both Plants

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

Start-up emissions vary and can not accurately be measured due to the 
inherent delay time in the CEMS system.  Additionally, start-up emissions are 
not required to be and in fact were not measured during the stack testing.  
There are no limitations on emissions during start-up evolutions, since the 
permits at both plants allow exceptions to exceedences during start-ups and 
shutdowns.

Short term NOx emissions due to start ups are as follows:

Unit #1 = 78.95 ppmc
Unit #2 = 79.49 ppmc
Unit #3 = 87.58 ppmc
Unit #4 = 89.48 ppmc

TDEC Operating Permit #950748F special condition #5 requires that Brownsville 
Power 1 L.L.C. (BPI) operate at 0.057 #/MMBtu and 0.090 #/MMBtu for units 
#1-2 and #3-4 respectively, with a total NOx emission limit of 249 Total Tons 
per Year.  The TDEC Division of Air Pollution Control regulation chapter 
1200-3-20-.02 (1) regulates the reasonable measures required to keep emission 
to a minimum during startups, shutdowns and malfuntions.  There is no Special 
Condition outling rolling averages or compliance with a certain time limit 
for NOx emissions otherthan ""Reasonable Measures Required.""

2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?

Brownsville Power was issued a Tennesse Multi-Sector General Permit (TMGP) 
#TNR05XXX for Storm Water Discharges associated with Industrial Activity. Mr. 
Jacke Wade, TDEC Division of Water Pollution stated that if the NOV's were 
not satisfied after July 1, 2000 a new TDEC rule was being promulgated to 
convert the TMGP back into a Storm Water permit during construction.  I 
believe the NOV's have been satisified and can therefore request TDEC to 
terminate the TMGP.  Due to BPI's sic code of 4911, it is my understanding 
that we are not required to maintain an Industrial storm water permit or 
SPDES permit.  

Caledonia

3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

The fuel monitoring schedule has been monthly from Comercial Operation 6-7-00 
through 4-00.  Then in accordance with the TDEC letter dated 9-10-99 
Brownsville Power was granted a custom fuel monitoring schedule.  The 
schedule consists of sulfur monitoring conducted twice monthly for six 
months; then sulfur monitoring conducted once per quarter for six quarters;if 
fuel analyses show little variability the samples will be conducted twice 
annually during the first and third quarters of each calendar year.

Brownsville

4.  What is the agency's response to the Enron letter regarding the 2nd
stormwater NOV?

I spoke with Mr. Jacke Wade on 6-14-00 and requested he visit the site to 
inspect the work completed.  His response was "" I will inspect the facility 
as time permits and if I do not show up on your door step your o.k.""  I have 
not heard from him to date.

5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwater
NOV was never responded to?

Not to my knowledge other than issuance of the 2nd NOV dated 5-1-00.

6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was that
during construction only or is it ongoing?

I do not recall specifically wetland being mentioned, but the TDEC letter 
dated 2-22-99 and 5-1-00 refers to the ""sediment retention basin"".  In my 
internal memo to Mitch Robinson dated 9-14-00 I outlined the corrective 
measures which included the excavation of the holding pond (sediment 
retention pond) and build a spillway for sediment retention.

7.  Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping
issue?

It appears that we did not cancel the second station service contract with 
Monroe County.  This second contract was for construction power supply, and 
is now used as an emergency source of power for hotel loads, etc.  Note that 
it is not sufficient to start up the plant.  We spend approximately $9,000 
per month in demand charges for this emergency hotel load capability; 
however, the contract can be canceled by Caledonia Power I, LLC with 90 days' 
prior written notice.

Bottom line:  Both contracts belong on DealBench.  Both contracts are still 
in force.  Next time we talk with the bidders, I will describe this 
capability.

Don, for labeling purposes on DealBench, the one labeled ""Power Supply 
Contract"" is the 480V supply and is not sufficient for starting the plant; 
the one labeled ""Industrial Power Contract"" is at 500kV, and is sufficient 
for starting the plant.  I would label them ""480V Power Supply Contract"" and 
""500kV Industrial Power Contract"", respectively.

In addition, you can forward this e-mail on to potential bidders.

BANK OF AMERICA TIGHTENS CREDIT
The company also issued a fourth-quarter profit warning
yesterday.

By Chris Rugaber

Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) lowered its earnings guidance for
the fourth quarter yesterday, due to increased write-offs of bad
loans. The company also announced that it would not renew $20
billion in corporate loans over the next two years. It is the
second time in the past month that the company has reduced its
fourth-quarter profit projections.

The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank now expects
fourth-quarter profits of about $1.4 billion, or $0.85 to $0.90
per share, down from last year's $1.23 per share and below
estimates of $1.17. As recently as September, estimates for the
fourth quarter were $1.35 per share. Earnings projections were
also reduced for next year, from $5.46 to $5.10 per share. The
company plans to write off between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion
in bad debt this quarter, almost triple the third quarter's
total of $435 million. Bank of America's shares fell about 10%
yesterday, and other bank stocks declined as well, including
Citigroup (NYSE: C), Chase Manhattan (NYSE: CMB), First Union
(NYSE: FTU), and Bank One (NYSE: ONE).

Last month, the company indicated that a loan of $500 million --
widely believed to be held by the Sunbeam Corporation (NYSE:
SOC) -- is ""nonperforming,"" meaning it is not paying interest.
In addition, Bank of America holds loans to companies such as
Owens Corning (NYSE: OWC), which filed for bankruptcy October 5
as a result of asbestos litigation, and ICG Communications
(Nasdaq: ICGXQ), which filed for bankruptcy on November 14. The
company also lent to Regal Cinemas, which defaulted on its bank
debt last month and is considering filing for bankruptcy.

Bank of America seems to have a negative outlook at this point.
""We're pessimistic about the economy, we're pessimistic about
the capital markets and the ability of companies to refinance,
and it's very easy for companies to throw in the towel,'' said
Chief Financial Officer James Hance at an investors' conference
yesterday. ""We're taking a very conservative outlook.''

Part of that conservative outlook was announced later yesterday
when the company said it would not renew about $20 billion in
loans over the next two years. CFO Hance noted that ""We are not
interested in renting out our balance sheet to clients who are
not delivering us additional fee-based business."" The move comes
after Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan urged banks on
Tuesday not to overly tighten their credit standards.

NEWS TO GO

Motorola (NYSE: MOT) greeted investors this morning with an
earnings warning, stating that it will not meet earlier revenue
and earnings guidance. The company blamed delays in cost-cutting
measures in its personal communications segment and ""slowing
market conditions"" for its semiconductor products. Motorola now
expects fourth-quarter sales of $10 billion and earnings per
share of $0.15, down from earlier guidance of $10.5 billion and
$0.27, respectively. In a press release the company stated that
it ""continues to expect robust growth in the global wireless
telephone market, with unit sales in the range of 525-575
million in 2001, up from an estimated 420 million units this
year, and expects to fully participate in that growth."" The
company announced additional manufacturing outsourcing
yesterday.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=232133

Hasbro (NYSE: HAS) may soon be a has-been (sorry). The company
warned last night that it will at best break even this year, and
may post a loss of $0.10 to $0.20 per share, thanks to slowing
sales, particularly in trading-card games. Hasbro also said it
will sell its Hasbro Interactive and Games.com divisions to
French company Infogrames Entertainment for $100 million in cash
and stock. The company was expected to earn $0.43 per share this
year, and pulled in $1.42 per share last year.

Internet-commerce consultant Scient (Nasdaq: SCNT) announced
last night that its fiscal third-quarter earnings would come in
below expectations, and that it would cut 460 jobs. The company
cited slowing spending among its clients -- which included AT&T
(NYSE: T) and Chase Manhattan (NYSE: CMB) -- on Web services and
growing competition from management consulting firms as the culprits.

The world's fifth-largest media company, News Corp. (NYSE: NWS),
said that it has initiated a hiring freeze in order to control
costs as advertising revenue growth slows. President Peter
Chernin said he expects the U.S. ad market to be ""tough"" over
the next couple of quarters. Yesterday, other news organizations
such as Dow Jones Inc. (NYSE: DJ) and Knight-Ridder (NYSE: KRI)
also cited slowing ad sales as a reason behind their negative
announcements. Dow Jones reduced earnings projections for its
fourth quarter, while Knight Ridder said it would lay off as
much as 2% of its workforce.

Let us wait until Mitchell signs and sends out the letter. Then, we can get 
them a copy of the signed letter. As far as the info in Mitchell's e-mail, I 
do not see any problem in sharing this with them. It certainly helps make our 
case that the NOV issue is resolved.

Subject: Brownsville Storm Water Permit

Gus,

I spoke with Mr. Jack Wade, TDEC concerning the Multi-Sector General Permit 
for Construction, New Storm Water Permit and NOV Status at Brownsville Power..
 
The Multi-Sector General Permit was issued for construction in lieu of Storm 
Water Permit by TDEC direction on August 7, 1998
If by July 1, 2000 the construction activities were not complete, BPI would 
have had to transfer the TMGP to a new Storm Water Permit for Construction 
that was promulgated this summer.  
 The soil erosion control & countermeasures taken and completed by BPI on 
June 15, 2000 has completely satisfied TDEC  concerns outlined in the NOV's 
dated 2-28-99 and 5-1-00.   Mr. Wade asked my opinion of vegetative 
stablization, which was the last condition by TDEC before allowing BPI to 
terminate the construction permit,  I responded that, in my opinion, the 
stablization throughout the facility was excellent.


I have attached a ""Draft"" letter to TDEC requesting the termination of the 
TMGP.  Please review and comment at your earliest convenience.

Respectfully Mitchell

Ben - did I correctly read the last transitional heading ""Deal Maker"".  
Further, did I correctly not see my name listed in BOLD next to this item.  
For shame.  For your info, PRC is over.....you can stop kissing Don's butt.

Jennifer,
A couple of Allegheny gas folks will be in Houston this Wednesday to meet 
with Chris Meyer and Mitch Robinson. We are still trying to get the key 
members from Enron up to Greensburg but no definitive plans have been 
reached. I will keep you in the loop as things progress.

Just wanted to let you know that I just talked to Don Miller, the lead guy 
from our side, regarding a different matter, but he mentioned to me that 
things seemed to be not going so well in the PSA discussions.  I didn't have 
time to see what the issues were, but I will when he calls back.  As you 
already know, these assets are yours to lose and I would hate to see you guys 
lose these assets to legal issues.  I know we both can come to some middle 
ground before people lose their patience.  My only advice, for what its 
worth, is to keep talking with Delainey and to make sure the lawyers don't 
run away with the issues and forget whats at stake on the commercial side.  
Hope this helps.

If you can let me know when you have talked with Dave, that would be great.  
I am trying to talk with Don Miller and wanted to make sure that you had 
already talked with Dave.  Enron's PRC is going on and I am trying to get 
promoted to manager and this deal should enable me to do just that.  Thanks

All,

This morning I provided the following info and documents.  I will correspond 
with all of you but am sending the documents to Mitch Robinson's fax machine 
unless requested to do otherwise by Mitch.

1.  I fax'd to Mitch and Stuart Zisman the results of the ""Personal Property"" 
inventory.
2.  I fax'd Mitch the most recent water bill.  To the best of my knowledge 
there is no contract with the Town of Caledonia for water.  We utilize an 
industrial user account.  The account number (14670) is on the bill. 
3.  I fax'd Mitch the Emergency Action Plan.  This plan is under revision.  I 
sent the existing plan as well as the portion of the plan where revisions are 
complete.
4.  I also sent the Semi-Annual Excess Emissions Report.

After lunch I will send the CEMs QA/QC documents and CEMs data which has been 
requested.

Site personnel, under my direction conducted a spot check of spare parts 
utilizing the most recent inventory list provided by Jim Meyer.  I certify 
that the spare parts inventory, based upon this spot check, is substantially 
complete including the high-dollar components.

Regards,
Pat Cathers

Mitch,

This afternoon we have forwarded to your fax machine copies of the requested 
operational data as well as the CEMs Monitoring Plan.  Regarding the 
Monitoring Plan, Ron sent you via email the updates to that plan necessitated 
by the EDR version 2.1 upgrade.  Included in that email are the 6 upgrade 
attachments - one for each unit.

As I send you this note the CEMs Quality Assurance Plan is being scanned and 
sent via fax machine.

Therefore, I believe I have provided all the info indicated on Gus's reply 
below.

Regards,
-Pat

Michael:
Duke is presenting their final bid this Sunday, so I think its even more 
important to get the PSA signed by tomorrow, so that there is no chance to 
try and retrade the deal.  I don't know how things ended up yesterday, but I 
think things need to come together very fast.

neck out."" --James Bryant Conant


QUESTIONS LEFT FOR ASK JEEVES TO ANSWER
The Internet search engine issued a waning yesterday, proving it
doesn't have all the answers.

By Mike Trigg

Internet know-it-all Ask Jeeves (Nasdaq: ASKJ), the provider of
a search engine that answers all our questions, issued an
earnings warning after the market's close yesterday. The company
attributed the shortfall to a slowing economy and reluctance
among companies to make additional outlays on online
advertisements. What's more, CEO Rob Wrubel also stepped down.

The Emeryville, California-based company, which makes money
through advertising and licensing, expects revenues of $25
million for the fourth quarter, about $10 million, or 30%, less
than the Street was expecting. Ask Jeeves also expects to post a
pro forma net loss of $18 million, or $0.50 per share, well
below the Street consensus of a $0.33-per-share loss. In the
previous quarter, the company posted a smaller-than-expected
loss of $12.6 million, or $0.36 per share.

""The broad-based economic slowdown has caused weakness in the
online advertising market, advertising pricing pressure, and a
decreased sense of urgency among Fortune 1000 companies to
implement their online initiatives,"" President Adam Klein said.
""Amongst this and other factors, we have experienced
weaker-than-anticipated demand for our solutions, however our
relationships with existing customers remain strong.""

In other news, after more than two years on the job, CEO Rob
Wrubel will be stepping down from his board and CEO positions,
and assuming the role of executive vice president of market
development. (The Motley Fool interviewed Rubel back in
December.) Current board member George Battle will assume the
CEO position on an interim basis, while the company looks for a
replacement.

After becoming a Street favorite, even receiving Motley Fool
Daily Double recognition, and hitting its 52-week high of $144,
the stock was punished along with the rest of the e-commerce
sector at the beginning of the year. The recent shortfall
shouldn't come as a complete shock. Advertising makes up a great
deal of the company's revenues and, with the dot-com demise,
demand for online advertising has diminished. Even Rule Maker
Yahoo! (Nasdaq: YHOO) has been hurt this year, in part, over
similar concerns.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=234496
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=234497

Despite the unfortunate news, the company still remains
optimistic. Regarding 2001 revenue and earnings guidance, the
company for once wasn't giving all the answers, saying that it
was reviewing growth targets. Nevertheless, Ask Jeeves maintains
it has enough cash in the ""engine"" to keep answering questions
until reaching expected profitability in the fourth quarter of
2001. Whether that's the case will be the biggest question left
for the company to answer.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Not long ago, a 23-year-old former employee of Internet Wire
produced a phony press release, falsely reporting that the CEO
of Emulex (Nasdaq: EMLX) had resigned, the company was restating
earnings, and there was a pending investigation by the SEC. The
hoax resulted in Emulex shares tumbling nearly 60% in one day.
It appears the maker of computer cards that increase data
transmission has moved beyond all that, announcing an agreement
to acquire closely held computer-networking company Giganet for
$645 million in stock. Emulex announced that it would issue
about 4 million shares and assumed options for Giganet. The
price was based on yesterday's closing price for Emulex shares,
$155.75. While not expected to reduce per-share profits for the
fiscal year (ending July 1), upon completing the acquisition,
the company plans on taking a non-cash charge of $10 million.

According to a statement published on the Standard & Poor's
website, copyright protection solutions provider Macrovision
(Nasdaq: MVSN) will be added to the Standard & Poor's MidCap 400
Index after the market's close on December 8. It will replace energy
services holding company LG&E Energy Corp. (NYSE: LGE).

Microwave telecommunications products maker California Amplifier
(Nasdaq: CAMP) issued a fourth-quarter earnings warning and
reported third-quarter results. The company expects earnings of
$0.08 or $0.09 per share and revenues between $29 million and
$31 million in the fourth quarter. The Street consensus estimate
called for the company to earn $0.17 per share. Moreover,
California Amplifier also reported third-quarter earnings of
$2.29 million, or $0.16 a share, meeting the Streets
expectations. Sales climbed to $32.6 million compared to $26.3
million in the same period last year.

Computer products seller CDW Computer Centers Inc. (Nasdaq:
CDWC) announced in a press release that it expects earnings
between $0.40 per share and $0.42 per share in the fourth
quarter. That's below the Street consensus expectation of $0.50
per share. The company also expects revenue to be between $990
million and $1.1 billion, representing year-over-year sales
growth between 34% and 36%. ""Currently, we are facing
slower-than-expected demand due to economic uncertainties, which
we believe is an industry-wide phenomenon,"" CEO Michael Krasny
said in a statement. ""These economic uncertainties make us
cautious about 2001, when we believe CDW will continue to
increase market share, but grow sales at lower rates than recent
quarters.""

Maker of liquid crystal displays for mobile phones Three-Five
Systems Inc. (NYSE: TFS) announced that it expects a
fourth-quarter profit between $0.08 and $0.10 per share, well
below earlier profit guidance of $0.19 to $0.20 per share. The
Street consensus expectation called for the company to earn
$0.20 per share. The company also informed investors that it was
expecting sales between $36 million and $38 million. It had been
expecting $45 million in revenues. Commenting on the coming
year, President and CEO Jack L. Saltich remarked, ""Our guidance
for 2001 remains unchanged. On a relative basis, sequential
revenue growth in the first quarter is expected, and that growth
should be in the range of 8% to 10%.""

We can respond outside of the formal RFP if we get something to them soon.  
They want to see if we have anything to offer.  In the meantime, they will go 
forward with their RFP.

Do not factor in any cost for the gas pipeline.  The local distribution 
company will absorbe the cost and go at risk for new incremental load.

The cost to go through the LDC is 15 cents/mmbtu on a variable or usage 
basis.  10 cents for transport and 5 cents for service fee.  Peoples gas 
aggregates gas purchases for a number of customers in the region and 
purchases gas month to month.  RPU pays a fixed gas price that changes month 
to month.

We would need to add 15 cents/mmbtu to gas price from our curves.

Substation work should be approximately $5.8MM and no higher than $6mm.

As a point of reference, RPU's estimate for a fully installed LM-2500 is 
$17MM.  They break this out to $11.8MM for turbine and generator, $1.2 MM 
engineering cost, $400k winter package and $3.6MM other stuff.

RPU will have a gas pressure guarantee of 300# so we need to have a 
calculation done on the cost of compression to step up from 300 to 600.  My 
guess is that it will be around $1mm.

I would like to have something to Rochester by mid next week.  We can use the 
routine 2 page proposal format.

""To be an adult is to disappoint others."" -- Unknown


IBM, INTEL ANNOUNCE CHIP ADVANCES
HOW SMALL AND FAST CAN THEY GO? VERY AND VERY.
Intel's transistors will be three atoms thick.

By Tom Jacobs

Chip giants IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) both
announced breakthrough chip technologies. IBM has started using
a new manufacturing technology, while Intel promises transistors
as small as three atoms thick, making chips almost seven times
faster than its recently released Pentium 4.

IBM's new manufacturing technique, named CMOS-9S, showcases
advances in copper wiring, silicon-on-insulator transistors, and
better insulation so that chip circuits can be as small as 0.13
microns -- 800 times thinner than a human hair. IBM is making a
variety of chips with this technique, and customers should
receive their first shipments in early 2001.

But Intel now plans the world's smallest and fastest CMOS
transistor. At 30 nanometers thick, the Santa Clara gorilla
could fit 400 million of them on a chip, which is just shy of 10
times the number on a Pentium 4. Intel says that it will be
possible to build chips by 2005 that run 10 billion operations a
second, compared to the Pentium 4's 1.5 billion a second. Dr.
Sunlin Chu, vice president and general manager of Intel's
Technology and Manufacturing Group, said that new processors
using the transistors not only would be smaller and faster, but
use less power. He said, ""It's one thing to achieve a great
technological breakthrough. It's another to have one that is
practical and will change everyone's lives. With Intel's 30
nanometer transistor, we have both.""
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D237380

While industry observers believe that this advance approaches
the limit on thickness, Jim Hardy, an analyst at Dataquest, says
that ""This is proving there's no reason the normal growth of the
semiconductor industry can't continue on for probably another 10
years."" If so, that's good news for Intel investors, who have
endured recent Intel revenue warnings and stock price
cliff-drops. Fools recently dueled over its future.

http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D237382

Intel closed at $34.00 Friday, down from a 52-week high of
$75.81, while IBM finished at $97.00, off its year high of
$134.94.

NEWS TO GO

U.K. drug maker Shire Pharmaceuticals Group PLC (Nasdaq: SHPGY)
will buy Canadian biotech pharmaceutical company BioChem Pharma
Inc. (Nasdaq: BCHE) for $4 billion in stock. Shire will pay $37
a BioChem share, a 40% premium over the company=01,s $26.50 Friday
close. Shire looks to expand beyond its key niche in
hyperactivity drugs, which comprise half of Shire's revenues but
face increasing competition. Shire will pick up BioChem's
successful Epivir AIDS treatment, marketed by Glaxo Wellcome
(NYSE: GLX), but also BioChem=01,s Zeffix Hepatitis B treatment,
which has been disappointing.

All eyes watch tomorrow's start of the U.S. wireless spectrum
auction, with pessimists observing the big telecom lemming march
over the cliff into Debt Sea. To improve its chances, AT&T
Wireless (NYSE: AWE) has partnered with three Native Alaskan
corporations so it can bid for ""closed"" frequencies set aside
solely for small companies. Created in 1971 to settle Alaska
natives' land claims, the corporations -- whose phenomenal
success was portrayed popularly on TV=01,s Northern Exposure --
operate with little oversight and invest in natural resources,
tourism, and other businesses in Alaska and throughout the lower
48 states. The companies, together with AT&T, paid $240 million
to participate in the auction, 13% of the $1.8 billion paid for
the chance to seek more licenses. Cingular Wireless and Verizon
(NYSE: VZ) also partnered with small companies for the same
reason. The FCC will auction 422 licenses in 195 markets, and
estimates of the auction's take range from $10 billion to $18
billion.

Morgan Stanley Capital International, a division of Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter (NYSE: MWD), said Sunday that it would
change the weighting it gives companies in its benchmark
indices. MSCI plans to weigh stocks in its indices according to
market cap based on free float -- shares actually available for
sale -- not total shares outstanding. This is expected to hurt
companies that have a high percentage of shares owned by
families, government, management, or other restricted company
holdings. With an estimated $200 billion in sales and purchases
expected when the indices change beginning November 30, 2001 and
ending May 31, 2002, analysts expect U.S. and U.K companies to
benefit, with Japanese, German, and French companies to suffer.
MSCI will exclude any company whose free float is less than 15%
of its total.

Bloomberg reports that the Federal Government's Copyright
Office, part of the Library of Congress, will publish a final
executive branch administrative rule today requiring that U.S.
radio stations pay royalties to record companies when the
stations broadcast on the Internet. About 4,000 of 14,000 U.S.
radio stations rebroadcast, or Web cast, on the Internet.
Spokespersons for the National Association of Broadcasters
decried the decision, which they say will add ""tens of millions
of dollars"" to the already $300 million in fees paid to
composers and publishers. Websites also assert that a related
Copyright Office decision allows them to negotiate blanket
licenses without having to negotiate with each record company,
as can radio stations that have limited customer involvement but
not individualized programming. The record industry disputes the
distinction between consumer-influenced (""play my fave song"")
versus individualized programming, and promises to fight.

Benjamin,

Hopefully, you will get credit or at least some recognition for the
important role you played. But you shouldn't be terribly disappointed if you
don't.  I have found in business that you don't always get credit for the
things that you truly achieved and yet sometimes you get more credit for
things than you believe that you deserved.  The relationship between
contribution and credit is often difficult to predict and sometimes defies
logic.

I believe you stepped in and made a meaningful difference in this deal.

Dad

Thanks for talking to Cyrus for me.  I hope that will be enough to get Dave
and Don to promote me to manager, since I clearly deserve it with this
transaction. I don't think there as been a manager, much less an Associate
(my level)  has done a deal like this and that is exactly what I am going
to tell Don Miller and Dave Delainey.  Our PRC meetings our going on right
now and I trying to get this done right away.  Thanks again for taking the

Was that your harse realities of life speech.  I thought you were aa optimist 
just like myself.  I belive I actually should get a lot of credit and not 
just contribution for this deal.  It's not often an Associate helps crate 
$200 MM of value.  Have you checked out how much snow B.C. has gotten 
recently and how much there about to get - its incredible.  This is going to 
be a great ski season.

Vince - 

I certainly appreciate the opportunity to have our group attend
a session given by Enron Research.  While afternoons are typically
the best time to meet, we do have a trader's meeting each Mon & Wed
at 3:30.  If we can accomodate this regular meeting either by scheduling
an earlier meeting on Monday or going for Tue/Thurs, that would be 
great.  Otherwise we can go ahead with the Mon @ 3:30 with an audience
that might be a bit smaller.

Thanks again

""The shopping bag ladies -- it's hard to believe, but once they
were children."" -- Dean Friedman


DOUBLECLICK'S DOUBLE TAKE
Online advertising powerhouse DoubleClick warns. Figures.

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

It was simply a matter of when. DoubleClick (Nasdaq: DCLK),
along with fellow online marketers Engage (Nasdaq: ENGA) and
24/7 Media (Nasdaq: TFSM), had already announced layoffs over
the past few weeks. Clearly the once-hot Internet advertising
niche had run ice-cold. Pink slips and economic booms rarely go hand-in-hand.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=239420

So when DoubleClick set up a conference call yesterday after the
market's close, it didn't take much of a guess to know what the
company had to say. It wasn't even a matter of when anymore.
DoubleClick lowered projections for both the December and
January quarters.

Surprised? Not really. It's like pulling up to your house on
your birthday to find a dozen cars parked on your front lawn and
a chorus of hushes as you approach the door.

This surprise party might only startle the Rip Van Winkle who
had last checked DoubleClick's pulse after its September quarter
performance. The company had reported its first profit at the
time and expected similar bottom-line results this quarter. Now
fourth-quarter revenues are expected to come in between $126
million and $129 million -- well off the $140 million previously
projected. Earnings will be breakeven at best.

A wider loss than expected will follow in March. However,
DoubleClick still believes that 2001 will be a profitable year.

Surprised at the long-term stroke of optimism? You shouldn't be.
True, nearly half of DoubleClick's revenues come from dot-com
companies. In many cases, today's clients will line the
corporate obituaries tomorrow as they struggle with cash burn
rates in non-profitable enterprises that the market is no longer
interested in subsidizing. However, one can't deny the lure of
online marketing in the bricks-and-mortar world.

Internet usage is still growing by leaps and bounds. That is
something that can't be said of traditional advertising channels
such as print, television and billboards. The online medium also
provides a more effective way to target an ad recipient.
Probably even more important, in leaner economic times where ad
budgets need to be justified, the success of an Internet
marketing campaign can be effectively measured.

So, sure, these are dark times right now. But for investors
willing to turn the key and step inside, bright lights,
welcoming smiles, and wrapped gifts might be waiting on the
other side.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Gamblers know to fold 'em when the chips are down. Well,
gamblers, the chips are down. Dallas Semiconductor (NYSE: DS),
Microchip Technology (Nasdaq: MCHP), and Advanced Micro Devices
(NYSE: AMD) reported that quarterly results will come in below
analyst estimates. The chipmakers are blaming a softness in
sales for the shortcoming.

The same can't be said for General Electric (NYSE: GE) and Sonic
(Nasdaq: SONC). Both companies reassured investors that earnings
are on track. GE is comfortable with the year ahead. The
burgermeisters at Sonic are comfortable with first-quarter
estimates despite a slowdown in traffic at the drive-in units.

According to this morning's Washington Post, struggling Internet
service provider PSINet (Nasdaq: PSIX) will be laying off 300
employees. Fittingly pronounced ""sigh Net,"" the struggling
provider has seen its shares crash to under $2 from a high just
above $60 a share back in March. Growing revenues at the expense
of mounting losses just doesn't cut it nowadays.

Take a picture, it'll last longer. For the second time this
quarter, Eastman Kodak (NYSE: EK) has had to reduce profit
forecasts. The photography giant is now expecting full-year
profits to come in lower than the year before. Hoping to shred
the negatives, the company is embarking on a cost-cutting
crusade that will reduce capital spending, SKUs, and inventory
levels. No enlargements.

Hi Ben!

Version 2 includes alot of data that wasn't used but you might find 
interesting.  It was gathered from a number of parties.  Version 3B is the 
last version I have, if Corp made changes, I don't have them.  

As you know the generation slide (slide 13) contains sensitive information, 
so please don't forward the file, or if you do, simple delete it from the 
presentation.

Thanks again for your help!
Tammy

Dave.  Yesterday he was in the PRC meetings all day and today is the Enron

Ben,
I would appreciate if you could forward my resume to Tim Detmering, just in 
case he has not received it already from Jeff.
I have tried to reach him but he was in a meeting, so I left a message in his 
voice mail.

Thanks for everything.

Dear Ben,
I want to thank you for receiving me, for all your time and suggestions, and 
for arranging me a meeting with Jeff Donahue.
I am very anxious to see what happens. He told me that he was going to 
discuss it with Tim Detmering.

As we agreed, I am attaching my resume.

I will call you soon.

Ben, its all been moved to one sheet and is available in the naes directory 
as well. It's password protected so just view at it read-only. If you see 
anything that needs to change let me know. By the way, when you open it up 
sometimes it can look kind of psychadelic - just zoom in or out and it fixes 
itself. Thanks.

""The good people sleep much better at night than the bad people.
Of course, the bad people enjoy the waking hours much more.""
-- Woody Allen


COMPAQ UNSURPRISINGLY WARNS
Computer maker Compaq became a member of the warnings club
yesterday.

By LouAnn Lofton

Compaq Computer (NYSE: CPQ) joined its PC-related brethren
yesterday on the warning train. Gateway Computer (NYSE: GTW),
Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), Intel (Nasdaq: INTC), and Advanced Micro
Devices (NYSE: AMD) have all warned the Street recently that
sales and earnings in their fourth quarters would be below expectations.

Compaq lowered guidance for the fourth quarter and for its next
fiscal year after the close of market yesterday. It also
announced that it will take a non-cash charge in the fourth
quarter related to the decline in value of some of its investments.

Compaq's revenues for the fourth quarter will now be between
$11.2 billion and $11.4 billion. That's below the expected $12.3
billion, but still above last year's $10.4 billion. Compaq
expects earnings, minus charges, to be in the range of
$0.28-$0.30 a share. Analysts were looking for $0.36 a share.
Compaq earned $0.19 a share last year.

The company blamed weak sales of its computers to U.S. consumers
and businesses, and softness in the demand for its servers.
Compaq is optimistic about the next fiscal year, but did lower
its guidance for results.

Chairman and CEO Michael Capellas said, ""Our current 2001 plan
calls for 10% revenue growth and 25% growth in earnings per
share over the revised estimates for the fiscal year 2000.
Although this is lower than our previous guidance, it still
reflects strong year-over-year improvement."" According to First
Call/Thompson Financial, analysts expected earnings to grow
about 40% in the next fiscal year.

Compaq also said that it will take a non-operating, non-cash
charge in the fourth quarter, related to the decline of some of
its investments. Internet incubator CMGI (Nasdaq: CMGI) and its
related assets are the main holdings that are causing this move.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Biotech company Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN) announced share repurchase
plans yesterday after the bell. The company plans to buy back up
to $2 billion in common stock between January 1, 2001 and
December 2002. Amgen also said that President and CEO Kevin
Sharer will be adding chairman to his title. The current
chairman, Gordon Binder, will retire December 31, as previously
announced.

Retailer Claire's Stores (NYSE: CLE) will miss fourth-quarter
earnings estimates. The company said yesterday that it sees
earnings per share for the fourth quarter of between $0.70 and
$0.80. Analysts had expected $1.12 a share. The company blamed
slow sales for the disappointing results.

Embedded computer maker Radisys (Nasdaq: RSYS) warned yesterday
that it will not meet current earnings and sales expectations.
Radisys is looking for fourth-quarter revenue of around $83
million, versus the $90.7 million it originally predicted.
Earnings per share for the fourth quarter will be between $0.20
and $0.24. Analysts, and the company itself, expected $0.41 a
share. The company also said that the first quarter of its new
fiscal year should return results about flat with the
fourth-quarter results. Analysts had expected Radisys to have
earnings per share in the first quarter of $0.42.

Internet consulting firm Razorfish (Nasdaq: RAZF) cut its
fourth-quarter outlook yesterday. This is the second time the
company has done so. Razorfish now expects to post a loss of
between $0.17 and $0.22 a share for the quarter, excluding
certain charges. Analysts were expecting a profit of $0.02 a
share.

ASK THE FOOL

This weekly e-mail offers answers to questions that perplex most
beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an
investing-related lesson, as well. Enjoy!

-- Q. Tell me about this firm I've heard of, Kleiner Perkins
Caufield & Byers. Does it underwrite initial public offerings
(IPOs)?

-- A. It's one of the top venture capital firms, based in
Silicon Valley. Its partners pool their money and invest in
fledgling companies, specializing in computer-related technology
and life sciences firms.

Venture capitalists typically enter the scene well before a
company gets to the IPO stage. They pony up a lot of money to
help the firm grow, usually in exchange for a large percentage
of the company. They offer guidance, as well. The expectation is
that once the company grows to a certain point, it will go
public and the venture capitalists can cash out, making a very
tidy profit.

Kleiner Perkins has funded many companies, such as Amazon.com
and Netscape, in their infancy.

-- Q. What's a company's ""payout ratio""?

-- A. It's the percentage of net income the firm pays out to
shareholders as a dividend. If Buzzy's Broccoli Beer (ticker:
BROCB) pays $1.00 per year in dividends and earns $4.00 per
share, its payout ratio is 25 percent.

This shows what the company is doing with its money. If much of
its earnings are being returned to shareholders, then little is
being reinvested in operations. That can be OK, as sometimes
reinvested earnings would return less than shareholders could
get investing the payout on their own.

INVESTING BASICS - MARKS OF GREAT COMPANIES

In this space, we've discussed many aspects of evaluating
companies, honing in on measures such as earnings yield, return
on assets and so on. It's vital, though, to also evaluate the
big picture, to make sure that the company you're looking at is
a first-class operation and one you'd be proud to own in your
portfolio. Here are some marks of great companies.

*Powerful brands.* Think of names well known in the United
States, or better yet, around the world. Brands like McDonald's,
Gucci, Campbell Soup, and IBM fit the bill. If most people don't
yet know a company's name, then it still has a lot of work to
do.

*Significant products or services.* Look for a company that's
selling its customers something they really need or really want.
Pharmaceutical companies, for example manufacture products that
people will buy whether they're flush with funds or strapped.
Firms like Ben & Jerry's and Starbucks offer consumers things
they love. We often look for products that people buy over and
over, like cheeseburgers and shampoo, instead of items bought
only sporadically, like cars.

*Consistent, reliable earnings and sales growth -- and robust
margins.* Track how sales and earnings have increased over past
years. An upward-sloping line suggests that management is
planning and executing well, encountering few surprises. Stack
your company's gross, operating and net profit margins up
against its competitors to see which one is wringing the most
value out of each dollar of sales.

*Lots of potential.* See what the company's growth prospects
are. Is it expanding abroad? Is it coming out with exciting new
products or services? Are its offerings taking the country by
storm? Is it trouncing its competition?

A final consideration when qualifying companies for further
research is how well you know the company and industry, and how
much you'd enjoy keeping up with its developments. A company
might have enormous potential, but if reading about it puts you
to sleep, it might not be the best addition to your portfolio.

I know the following goes without saying, but I wanted to highlight a few 
specific points relevant to this transaction.

As all of you know, the sale of Brownsville and Caledonia to Cinergy was 
recently announced.  As the press release indicated, the terms of the 
transaction were not released.  While Allegheny (with the sale of the 2000s) 
took the same position in its announcement, the purchase price was 
subsequently released to the market (by Allegheny).  Cinergy and Enron both 
agreed in the Purchase and Sale Agreement, to not release the price and terms 
without the other's consent (i.e. THE PRICE AND TERMS WILL REMAIN 
CONFIDENTIAL). 

To the extent legally permitted, Cinergy will not release the price as part 
of its regulatory filings, and in fact, will redact the price from all of its 
filings.  If, through your involvement in this process, you inadvertently 
learned the price, you must keep it to yourself.  As we all know, information 
moves around this organization very quickly.  With two deals on very similar 
assets in the market at once (Allegheny and Cinergy), it only makes sense to 
contain the external flow of information.

By the way, both transactions should close March/April 2001.

Thanks for your help in this process, and your co-operation in keeping this 
information confidential.

Regards,

Don

Ben:

Let me start by thanking you for keeping the Everest II CAs in such an 
organized manner.

I delivered copies of the available agreements to Kay Young for safe keeping 
in the 

Legal Department's Confidentiality Agreement Database.   I've also given your 
CA files to Stuart

for  his E2 records.   Unfortunately, a little clean up remains on E2.  Your 
files included five empty folders, 

no CA, for the following entities:

1. AEP;
2. Ameren;
3. Diamond Generating;
4. Orion Power; and
5. Tenaska.

Please see what you can do to pull these agreements together for Stu's 
records.  If I can help you out in anyway, please give me a call.

Take care,

Ed

Lou,

OK...I've decided to skip the formal presentation tomorrow but I do suggest 
we publish an agenda.  I do have to prepare something for the rating agencies 
Monday but those are entirely different meetings.  Proposed agenda:

Concepts behind development of Enron's product
Questions regarding Enron term sheet
Integration of Enron into CCC's financing
Preliminary Enron due diligence discussion
Rating agency strategy
Timeline and decision points
Next steps and deliverables

I would like to send this around so please comment this AM.  I quite sure 
you'll have some constructive criticism.

regards,

Don"

regarding the Midyear Performance Review Process, please read below.




The mid-year Performance Management cycle will begin on May 15 with the=20
opening of the PEP system (the online ""Performance Evaluation Process""=20
feedback system).  You will be receiving your password for this system in a=
=20
note to go out later from PEP.  In preparation for the cycle, four training=
=20
classes will be offered to all new employees and to those employees who hav=
e=20
not previously attended training.  Enrollment for these classes will be=20
offered through the Development Center ""Ernie"" system.  For employees who a=
re=20
outside the Houston area, please contact your HR Representative for more=20
information. =20

These sessions will be held on :

Wednesday, May 10 from 9:00-10:00 a.m.,  and three sessions to be held on=
=20
Thursday, May 11 from 9:00-10:00 a.m.; 1:30-2:30 p.m.; and 3:00-4:00 p.m. =

For those of you who have attended the training before and who are familiar=
=20
with the past Performance Management Process, there have been some=20
modifications:

1.  The Performance Management Process is now Enron wide.  All Enron feedba=
ck=20
forms have been reduced to three (Vice President (VP)/Managing Director=20
(MD);  Management/Professional; and Administration/Support), which all use=
=20
the following criteria:
? Innovation/Entrepreneurship
? Communication/Setting Direction
? Teamwork/Interpersonal
? Leadership/Vision/Values
? Business Instinct
? Analytical/Technical

2.  The following six performance ratings will be used consistently on the=
=20
final feedback forms across Enron:=20

 Issues

3.  There will be four recognized peer groups across the company for purpos=
es=20
of the PRC (formerly the Business Review Meetings) meeting.=20
? Commercial
? Commercial Support
? Technical
? Specialized Technical

4.  The Performance Review Process will continue to be used to facilitate:
? Promotions - up to Director level only. There will be no officer promotio=
ns=20
to VP/MD at Mid-year
? Feedback to employee
? Compensation decisions
? Sharing of performance rating at Manager=01,s discretion

5.  PRC meetings will be reviewed by both functional area & business units
Both functional areas and business units will participate in the rating of=
=20
employees to cover both solid and dotted line reporting relationships. =20
Functional PRC meetings will take place first, followed by the final busine=
ss=20
unit meetings.  Difference in views on an individual employee=01,s rating s=
hould=20
be discussed and consensus should be reached. The functional area meetings=
=20
are:

- Accounting
- Human Resources
- Government Affairs
- RAC
- Global Finance

6.  The PEP system is now available via the Intranet to allow greater acces=
s=20
from global locations and remotely. The functionality is essentially the=20
same. If you would like further information on how to use this system you m=
ay=20
gain access to the quick reference guide by clicking  on the attached=20

Quick Reference does not display correctly on your PC, call your Help Desk=
=20
for assistance, or  Irma Alvarez at 713-853-1543 to get a hard copy.

7.  The general responsibilities remain the same regarding the overall=20

George and Webb, please find attached revision one to the Santee Cooper O&M 
cost estimate. It is for mobilization and operating period O&M services for 
one gas fired, 5 x LM6000 simple cycle peaking facility located at the 
Georgia and South Carolina border. 


The revision made adjustments to the following:
      Rev 0   Rev 1
Mobilization fee     $90,000   $200,000
Annual Operating fee    $160,000  $250,000
Annual Maintenance cost Estimate  $405,000  $593,000
Mobilization Labor cost (adjusted benefits) $175,000  $193,000
Annual Labor cost (adjusted benefits)  $406,000  $450,000
Initial Spare Parts    $1,320,000  $1,300,000

My reasoning is this:
1. After consulting with OEC, the previous fees were not believed to be at 
""market"".
2. Annual Maintenance was recalculated after having more time to do a bottom 
up estimate.
3. Mob and annual labor costs changed due to a change in OEC benefits 
calculations.
4. Initial spares rounded down.

As we discussed, the GT major maintenance is scheduled to occur in year 18 of 
an 18 year term. 

Please provide your comments.

regards, Scot"

Subject: 


As a follow up to our conversation yesterday, I need indicative pricing for a 
three (3) year and a five (5) year tolling option for a peaking plant to be 
located in eastern PJM, which would utilize 4 (four) LM-6000 turbines.  
Assume a 6/1/2001 start date and a location near Parlin New Jersey.  The 
structure of the transaction would be as follows:

1.  ENA would sell four (4) LM-6000s to Calpine.
2.  ENA would permit, construct, own and operate the project.
3.  ENA would take back a short-term tolling agreement for the project.

I would like to send Calpine a brief proposal in the net couple of weeks.  
How quickly can you come up with indicative pricing for me?

Mr. Rogers,
Just to quickly address your questions in advance of our call in the
morning, I offer the following:

1.  The debt amount contemplated was based on assumptions given by Enron.
The rate given was $375 /kW or $120MM in debt.  This would be obtained via
a 144A Bond offering without any subdebt.

2.  There are three operating fees listed in the proforma currently:
Management fee ($600k/yr) to the Owners as contracted, O&M Fee ($300k/yr)
to the Operator contemplated to be TECO Power Services (""TPS"") and the TPS
Parts Company for a spare engine.  The TPS Spare engine may be eliminated
provided we can get comfort via other methods.  The financing fees were
estimates based on discussions with Enron and our engaging CSFB.

3.  The Maintenance Reserve account is accrued based on operating hours of
the plant and planned major maintenance, as estimated by TPS (the O&M
Operator).  This reserve may be eliminated as we currently are estimating
that this plant will never reach a major outage.

I look forward to discussing these issues with you in the morning.

Regards,
Patrick Smith

Ben -

We need to talk this morning about RPU.  I am not sure you have recieved this 
e-mail.  If you have not it is my fault.  We need to forward this information 
to structuring to evaluate the plant.  Sorry and thanks for the help.

Subject: Additional information for Rochester

We can respond outside of the formal RFP if we get something to them soon.  
They want to see if we have anything to offer.  In the meantime, they will go 
forward with their RFP.

Do not factor in any cost for the gas pipeline.  The local distribution 
company will absorbe the cost and go at risk for new incremental load.

The cost to go through the LDC is 15 cents/mmbtu on a variable or usage 
basis.  10 cents for transport and 5 cents for service fee.  Peoples gas 
aggregates gas purchases for a number of customers in the region and 
purchases gas month to month.  RPU pays a fixed gas price that changes month 
to month.

We would need to add 15 cents/mmbtu to gas price from our curves.

Substation work should be approximately $5.8MM and no higher than $6mm.

As a point of reference, RPU's estimate for a fully installed LM-2500 is 
$17MM.  They break this out to $11.8MM for turbine and generator, $1.2 MM 
engineering cost, $400k winter package and $3.6MM other stuff.

RPU will have a gas pressure guarantee of 300# so we need to have a 
calculation done on the cost of compression to step up from 300 to 600.  My 
guess is that it will be around $1mm.

I would like to have something to Rochester by mid next week.  We can use the 
routine 2 page proposal format.

Folks,

Attached is a listing of retail shorts accrued to date.  The idea is to use 
our LM6000's, 6B's or Italian turbines to cover these positions.  Maybe we 
could sell the combination of shorts and machines to an IPP such as Calpine 
or AES who should be looking for earnings.  I would like to meet Friday at 
10:30 to plot out strategy and discuss the required analysis.  In the 
interim, please familiarise yourself with the data.

regards,

Ben, please find attached below the preliminary O&M cost estimate for O&M 
services to mobilize and operate the 4 x LM6000 peaking facility to be 
situated at an existing UAE cogen plant in Lowell, Mass.   It assumes some 
allocated costs for common facilities, operating/admin expenses and staff at 
the UAE plant to be added to the incremental expenses that are estimated to 
occur as a result of the plant addition. Please review it and consider its 
accuracy to be +/- 25%. Call if you have any questions.

Subject: Lowell, MA O&M Estimate

Please review the attached O&M estimate for the Lowell, Massachusetts 4 x 
LM6000 peaking facility to be situated at an existing UAE cogen plant. UAE 
will own and operate the plant and ENA will have option on the output for 
about 3 to 5 years. The O&M cost estimate shown assumes the hire of 2 O&M 
techs to cover the LM6000 plant for the 2 peak period shifts. Current staff 
at UAE plant is reported as 7 total (including admin) which seems low for a 
cogen, so I've shown the addition of 2 techs. It assumes an allocation of 
some existing labor and admin/operating costs from the existing plant, but in 
no case is the ""annual total"" for the fixed costs more than 1/2 of what we 
could do it for ourselves if it was ""stand alone"". Maintenance and chemicals 
are shown as variable. The fees are shown for what we used for the Wilton 
Center Expansion ($40M - Mob; $80M - Annual Ops).



thanks, Scot

Ben, please find attached below the preliminary O&M cost estimate for RPU's 
O&M services to mobilize and operate the 1 x LM6000 peaking facility to be 
situated in Rochester, Minnesota.   As we discussed, it assumes that 
Rochester Public Utilities has no existing staff and infrastructure in the 
area, but if this assumption should change, then Mobilization and annual 
Operating fixed O&M could be reduced as a result of leveraging existing RPU 
staff and facilities. Please review it and consider its accuracy to be +/- 
25%. Call if you have any questions. "

Just to give you an update, I reeived an e-mail from Dr. Carl Harris, who is 
currently in charge of my application in the admission's office.  He wants me 
to answer a few questions to make sure I can handle the coursework.  That is 
why I wanted to meet with you and Professors' Titman and Brown, to discuss 
the coursework and to talk to you about my strengths and weaknesses.  I know 
that with my financial modeling and accounting skills, energy-finance 
background, and the Business' School's team-oriented approach to learning, 
that I will excel in this type of learning environment.  I hope things work

Professor Ronn: 
 I would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the MBA 
Program.  In the end, the results were not favorable.  I understand that it 
is a competitive process, but I felt that with my work experiences, 
recommendations, extracurricular activities, etc., that this would help my 
chances and possibly compensate for my disability.  After talking with you 
and Professors Titman, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that UT was the right 
place to continue learning about energy-finance.  
  I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent 
graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do 
whatever it takes to get in next year.  I plan on taking two or three 
graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and 
Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this 
level. I also plan on trying to retake the GMAT test.  Due to my disability, 
this will be a monumental task, but I am determined to prove to the 
Admissions commitee that I can excel with the work at The Texas University 
Graduate School of Business.  
 Thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me.  It has been a 
pleasure meeting you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and 
finance in the future.  Also, if you can think of anything else I can do to 
strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know.  
Take care and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,

Ben Rogers

Mr. Rogers,
Just to quickly address your questions in advance of our call in the
morning, I offer the following:

1.  The debt amount contemplated was based on assumptions given by Enron.
The rate given was $375 /kW or $120MM in debt.  This would be obtained via
a 144A Bond offering without any subdebt.

2.  There are three operating fees listed in the proforma currently:
Management fee ($600k/yr) to the Owners as contracted, O&M Fee ($300k/yr)
to the Operator contemplated to be TECO Power Services (""TPS"") and the TPS
Parts Company for a spare engine.  The TPS Spare engine may be eliminated
provided we can get comfort via other methods.  The financing fees were
estimates based on discussions with Enron and our engaging CSFB.

3.  The Maintenance Reserve account is accrued based on operating hours of
the plant and planned major maintenance, as estimated by TPS (the O&M
Operator).  This reserve may be eliminated as we currently are estimating
that this plant will never reach a major outage.

I look forward to discussing these issues with you in the morning.

Regards,
Patrick Smith
TM Power Ventures

As Enron's broadband services business grows, we will continue to position 
the company to take advantage of the significant opportunities in this market 
and meet the needs of our global customers.  With that in mind, we've made a 
number of changes within the Office of the Chairman of Enron Broadband 
Services aimed at providing a better focus on the key objectives of the 
organization.  

Joe Hirko and Ken Rice, previously co-CEOs of Enron Broadband Services, will 
continue to jointly manage the strategic direction of the company.  Joe will 
continue as CEO and will be responsible for the primary executive management 
of EBS as well as network build-out, BOS development, cross-market 
capabilities and staff functions.  Ken will assume the role of chief 
commercial officer and will be responsible for developing the commercial 
functions of the organization.
  
In addition, Kevin Hannon has been named chief operating officer and will be 
responsible for the day-to-day operations of EBS.  Kevin was most recently 
CEO of Global Risk Management and, prior to that position, he was president 
and COO of Enron North America, where he has been instrumental in developing 
Enron's trading and risk management business in gas, electricity and other 
emerging markets.  Greg Whalley, president and COO of ENA, will again assume 
his responsibilities for Global Risk Management.

Please join us in congratulating Joe, Ken, Kevin and Greg in their new roles. "

Thomas,

Here is a quick update for Calpine project.

1. Ben and I had a meeting with Scott this morning. Basic idea is to have 3 
and 5 year tolling agreement with Calpine and sell to the market after the 
expiration of the  agreement.

2. Ben prepared a preliminary model. Scott's target unlevered equity IRR is 
8.5% ~ 9%. Key value driver will be a capacity payment ($/kw/month) for 3 or 
5 years, which we will charge to Calpine. As soon as we get VOM from EE&CC, 
we will ask Structuring group to get the capacity payment for 3 and 5 years.

3. Things to be done
 - 3 and 5 year capacity payment to get 8.5% ~ 9% IRR of unlevered equity
 - 20 year power curve (capacity and energy) for Eastern PJM. We got gas 
curve.
 - VOM

I think this idea could be good if Calpine is willing to pay more than what 
we see for next 3 or 5 year Eastern PJM pool price, and/or we can leverage up 
more by taking advantage of 3 or 5 year tolling agreement. This is just my 
thought. Please correct me, if I am wrong. I will continue to work on the 
model with Ben and I will talk to Scott to find out more. Thank you.

all is going well and talk to you soon.  See ya

Team,

We've done a lot of good work lately on the evaluation models and I think we 
are converging on a platform that accurately models the product, the project 
and my structure's risk.  The only remaining issues when we're done will 
relate to the curves.

Just so we're all on the same page, I thought I would lay out the base 
scenario:

Hourly vols
Mid power and oil curves
Beginning debt of $375/kw amortising mortgage style over 20-years
Debt interest rates of T+225
Plant residual value of $100/kw
Enron will own a 50 MW call from 5/2001 to 12/31/2020.  Strike prices will be 
$50/mwh for years 1-5, $75/mwh for years 6-10, and $100/mwh for the balance 
of the term.
The basic put or no put trigger algorithm is (plant value + put option value 
>= par amount of bonds outstanding).  As the model calculates equity's 
decision whether or not to put the plant to Enron, we should reduce each 
years par amount of bonds outstanding by the debt service reserve fund.  This 
proxy's the fact that equity will consider when making their put decision 
each year that there are moneys in the DSRF, working capital reserves and 
equity sweep accounts.
Whatever power/oil correlation's structuring thinks are appropriate.

I hope to see results Monday.  If there are any questions, please call me at 
3-4750.

regards,

Don Black"

Rochester was interested in our proposal.  As such, they want to do a 
conference call and meeting as follows:


1.  Conference call on Thursday 2/24 at 9:00 a.m. (their general manager will 
be involved)
2.  Depending on the conference call, Rochester will want us to come up for 
another face to face meeting on Tuesday, 2/29


Some of Rochester's key questions are as follows:

1.  Whats our PPA value?  I asked them to name it and they said they would 
want enough to cove their debt service...Also, they said they are fair and 
they are not greedy.

2.  Rochester wants to verify scope.  Are we offering turnkey?  I told them 
yes...they want to discuss details.  Where did we price the electric 
interconnect.  To the busbar or to inlet of step up transformer?

3.  Rochester has the ability to individually negotiate with us as long as we 
respond to their bid on time and provide a bid bond.  If we do not respond, 
then they have to get city council approval to negotiate directly.  
Basically, we need to complete some of the bid form to get us in the door.

4.  Bids are open on 3/10/00

ACTION ITEMS

1.  Russ, Ben, Oscar and Ozzie to participate in conference call on 2/24.

2.  Russ, Ben and Ozzie to go to Rochester if warranted.  ( I am unable to 
travel during that week)

3.  Determine if other Enron participants need to be involved (Mike Nanney, 
etc....Mike went on the first site visit with me)

4.  Respond to Rochester in bid format and look into getting a bid bond.

4.  Russ, Ben and Oscar work together to come up with a PPA value

5.  Verify whether we  want a second merchant unit at the site.

SUMMARY

Rocheste seems to be very open and agreeable to doing business with Enron.  I 
feel we need to push this one.

My name is Ben Rogers and I am currently applying to The Texas Business 
School for enrollment in the Fall of 2000. I was referred to you by David 
Martin, graduate of the Business School and the son of John Martin, former 
Finance Professor. I have worked with David at Enron for a couple of years 
and have learned a great deal about the School. I was also referred to you by 
Paul Burkhart, who graduated from the Business School in 1998 and who worked 
in the investment fund. I have been working in several different finance 
positions within Enron for the last two and a half years. Before coming to 
Enron I worked for three years in a portfolio management group with State 
Street Bank in Boston. I am very interested in the combination of energy and 
corporate finance and have the desire to continue working in these industries 
after business school, specifically with an Investment Bank.   I am coming to 
visit the school on Friday, Feb. 18th and was wondering if you had time to 
talk to me about the Business School.  If you could please let me know if 
your available, I would greatly appreciate it. If your not available that 
day, I would still like to talk with you about the program and the venture 
capital fund that you are heading up.   Please let me know if you want me to 
send you my resume, so that you have a better understanding of my background. 
The admissions office has my complete application with my resume. Thanks in 
advance for taking the time to talk with me. Hope to hear from you soon.

Ben-

It was good to see you- I'll give you a buzz next time I'm in Houston.

Let me know if you have any questions about UT, BSchool, app process, etc...

I gave your email to Loncto-

Here's to a lot of golf next year if you decide to come to Austin!

It was good to see a fellow Yankee down in these here parts.  I got some 
really good feedback from all the people I talked with.  I think that UT 
would be a good fit for what I'm trying to do afterwards - with there 
energy-finance concentration and investment fund.  Plus it would be fun 
living in Austin for a couple of years.  When your in Houston next time wh 
can grab some drinks and go to dinner.  Talk to you soon.

Dear Ben:

I enjoyed meeting with you.  I sent a letter recommending you to our Dean
in charge of the MBA program.  Let me know if you hear anything from the
people in the admissions office.

I hope things work out and I have the opportunity to have you participate
in our energy finance program.

By the way, I like the idea of bringing in various industry leaders.  I
currently do this in my class, but it might make sense to consider ways to
get first year students involved in this activity.

regards,

It was really nice meeting you.  I'm glad that you enjoyed your visit.  I
apologize that you didn't get a chance to talk with Dr. Harris, but it
sounds like you have addressed that issue in your essays.  Best of luck

Regards
Meg

     Thanks for the informative infomation session this past Friday.  Also,
thank you for taking the time to listen to my situation regarding my
application and talking to Dr. Harris for me.  After meeting with many of
the faculty and staff (Professors Brown, Titman, Jemison & Ronn) at the
School, my desire to attend the School is quite strong.  The School is a
perfect fit for the career I am trying to pursue in energy and is a
institution where I would be able to contribute to and learn from the
energy-finance program due to my experiences with Enron.  Eventhough I have
tested poorly on tests such as the GMAT, I feel that the rest of my
application is quite strong and that I have proven that I can successfully
compete in a competitive environment (ie. Enron).  I excel in environments
(team-oriented) such as described by the many people I talked with at the
Texas B-School.
     Again, thanks for taking the time to talk with me about my application
and it was good to see someone from Boston, who lived in DC and was now
living in Texas, such as myself.

Regards,

Ben Rogers"

Ben, would appreciate if I could get a copy of your model to make sure the 
assumptions captured in your model are consistent with the one's I will use 
in pricing the deal.

Subject: UAE - LM6000 deal

Gautam and Elizabeth-

Perhaps you can work on this together, so that you get familiar with these 
LM6000 projects...there are only going to be more of them.  


Here is the info I just got from Ben about pricing up a new LM6000 project 
for UAE

4 LM 6000's in Lowell, MA (near Boston)

45 MW per turbine
Use:       Nepool Power Curve
 Transco Z 6 Gas Curve

5 year deal starting 5/01

Variable O&M :  $2.25/MWh
Heat Rate:  (Ben will send us)
Per Start cost:  (Ben will send us)

ENA would build the plant for UAE - and we would enter into a PPA with them 
to receive power from that plant (so we would want to get a $/kW-mo number 
somewhere between the desk's mid and bid price)

Ben has put togethe ra model that does not include our curves, but he is 
looking at projects costs given a 70/30 debt/equity ratio, at 8.5%.  The 
target return is 12%

Ben would like to see our estimates of $/kW-mo on a yearly basis 

So, run this through Jim's dispatch model (in userpub/todd/jhs/sprd opt 
dispatch model 021800) - to calculate yearly $/kW-month numbers then we'll 
show the desk to get their estimates of $/kW-mo

Thanks for your time!

Don,

As we discussed last Friday, I prepared some analyses as follows:

If I correctly read your idea, ENA would sell to an IPP a combination of EES 
short position and peaking turbines.
ENA would make money from;
 1. spread between buying power from the IPP and selling it to EES at premium
 2. fees from EES or/and IPP for providing/arranging capacity/off-taker
 3. better project financing by leveraging up more and having lower debt 
cost, which would be possible by having off-taker (EES)

Regarding our starting point of NY East, EES has short position ranging from 
0 MW to 126 MW in NY East region for next 11 years. I attached Excel file 
which shows an analysis of NY East including load graph.
To read EES data correctly, see the below definition.
 - WD: weekdays, WE: weekends.
 - Each 4 hour block number shows average load for 4 hour block, so actual 
peak load is higher than that.

Please correct me, if I am wrong. See you at 4:00. Thank you.

Thomas,

Here is a Calpine deal summary.

ENA would sell four LM-6000 turbines to Calpine.
Calpine would be responsible for permitting, constructing, financing and 
operating the peaking power plant in Eastern PJM.
ENA would enter into a short-terrm tolling agreement to buy power from 
Calpine for 3 or 5 years.
Work needed to be done :
 - getting VOM for LM-6000 from EE&CC.
 - getting flat capacity payment ($/kw/month) for 3 and 5 years from 
Structuring group, based on VOM, dispatch, and cite of the plant.
 - building 20 year economic model to understand Calpine position. 

Money making scenario: We buy power from Calpine at lower price than that of 
ENA curve.

I think it will be helpful if Scott or Thomas call EE&CC to get VOM ASAP, so 
that we can talk to Structuring group. If someone just needs to have Eastern 
PJM curve, we can try to get from Structuring group. Thank you.

Thomas,

Here is a Calpine deal summary. 

ENA would sell four LM-6000 turbines to Calpine.
Calpine would be responsible for permitting, constructing, financing and 
operating the peaking power plant in Eastern PJM.
ENA would enter into a short-terrm tolling agreement to buy power from 
Calpine for 3 or 5 years.
Work needed to be done :
 - getting VOM for LM-6000 from EE&CC.
 - getting flat capacity payment ($/kw-mo period) for 3 and 5 years from 
Structuring group, based on VOM, Heat rate, dispatch, and location of the 
plant.
 - building 20 year economic model to understand Calpine position. 

Profit generator: We buy power from Calpine at lower price than that of ENA 
bid curve.

I think it will be helpful if Thomas call EE&CC to get VOM ASAP, so that we 
can talk to Structuring group. Please review and let me know if it makes 
sense, and then I will send you, Scott, Richard Park, and Tom Swank.

If someone needs to have just Eastern PJM curve, we can try to get from 
Structuring group tomorrow. Richard Park told me about PJM curve but I am not 
sure what exactly this is for. Thank you.

Thomas,

Ben and I had a meeting with Don on Tuesday. Please see below for the summary 
of meeting:

ENA would sell to an IPP (AES or Calpine) a combination of EES short position 
and peaking turbines.

ENA would generate profit from;
 1. spread between buying power from the IPP and selling it to EES at premium 
- will be very thin
 2. having a call option on the peaking plant for the portion of excess 
capacity of the plant
 3. fees from EES or/and IPP for providing/arranging capacity/off-taker
 4. better project financing by leveraging up more and having lower debt 
cost, which would be possible by having off-taker (EES) - Not quite sure yet.

Next steps/Assumptions;
 1. Assume equity IRR of 12% after tax
 2. Match assets to EES load curve
 3. Dispatch assets into market when not to meet load @ENA curve (""RevenueM"")
 4. Calculate transfer price to meet load (""RevenueL"") to meet equity return 
objectives of 12%
 5. Compare ""RevenueL"" to EES's market position
 6. Find Scaler value (option value from volatility)
 7. Calculate book earning for bid package
 --> We try to have work of 1 to 4 done by Thursday (2/24). Next meeting with 
Don is scheduled on Thursday.

Regarding our starting point of NY East, EES has short position ranging from 
0 MW to 126 MW in NY East region for next 11 years. I attached Excel file 
which shows an analysis of NY East including load graph.

To read EES data correctly, see the below definition.
 - WD: weekdays, WE: weekends.
 - Each 4 hour block number shows average load for 4 hour block, so actual 
peak load is higher than that.

Idea of sharing data with East Coast Power: Don does not mind if we 
distribute EES data internally within Enron, but he does not want data to go 
to Elpaso. He does not know Brad Alford.

Ben, please find attached a summary of the spread option value for 4 LM 
6000's for UAE deal.ts. Implicit in the valuation is complete flexibility in 
dispatching the plant in 8-hour blocks. The power price curve used is the bid 
curve (these are only indicative prices and not the actual prices at which 
traders would trade). We used the Mid curve for Gas. The gas pricing includes 
NYMEX + Tennessee Z6 Basis + Tennessee Z6 Index. The heat rates were based on 
your input. If you have any questions you could call me up at x30678.

Thanks

Scott,

Here is a Calpine update. 

Deal summary:
 - ENA would sell four LM-6000 turbines to Calpine.
 - Calpine would be responsible for permitting, constructing, financing and 
operating the peaking power plant in Eastern PJM.
 - ENA would enter into a short-terrm tolling agreement to buy power from 
Calpine for 3 or 5 years.
 - Profit generator: We buy power from Calpine at lower price than that of 
ENA bid curve.

Work needed to be done :
 - getting VOM for LM-6000 from Scot Chambers.
 - getting flat capacity payment ($/kw-mo period) for 3 and 5 years from 
Structuring group, based on VOM, heat rate, gas curve, dispatch, and location 
of the plant.
 - building 20 year economic model to understand Calpine position. 

While we are waiting for VOM from Scot Chambers, we will use VOM number from 
other LM-6000 deal (please see attached email sent to Structuring group by 
Ben). As soon as we hear from Structuring group, I will give you indicative 
numbers. Sorry for the delay. Thank you.

Jinsung Myung
(Ext: 37330)

PS: If someone needs to have just Eastern PJM curve, we can try to get from 
Structuring group. Richard Park told me about PJM curve but I am not sure 
what exactly this is for.

Downstream Coverage/Origination

As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha=

2) Commercial Transactions:=20

The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20
Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of=
=20
transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex=
ecuting=20
transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity=
=20
of client coverage.  CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20
Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20
Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical=
=20
Analysis and Upstream Asset Management.

The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,=
=20
execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction=
=20
with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of=
=20
which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.  This=
=20
dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service=
=20
and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20
resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to=
=20
the highest value transactions across the coverage functions:

a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and=
=20
Western Coverage/Origination Groups.  The senior members of this group=20
include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy=

Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is=

established.  The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay=
=20
Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.  We anticipate announcing=
=20
two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks.
c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant=

d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20

de=20
Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.  We hope to announce the addition=

of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.

Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and=

together.

Subject: Calpine update/status

Scott,

Here is a Calpine update. 

Deal summary:
 - ENA would sell four LM-6000 turbines to Calpine.
 - Calpine would be responsible for permitting, constructing, financing and 
operating the peaking power plant in Eastern PJM.
 - ENA would enter into a short-terrm tolling agreement to buy power from 
Calpine for 3 or 5 years.
 - Profit generator: We buy power from Calpine at lower price than that of 
ENA bid curve.

Work needed to be done :
 - getting VOM for LM-6000 from Scot Chambers.
 - getting flat capacity payment ($/kw-mo period) for 3 and 5 years from 
Structuring group, based on VOM, heat rate, gas curve, dispatch, and location 
of the plant.
 - building 20 year economic model to understand Calpine position. 

While we are waiting for VOM from Scot Chambers, we will use VOM number from 
other LM-6000 deal (please see attached email sent to Structuring group by 
Ben). As soon as we hear from Structuring group, I will give you indicative 
numbers. Sorry for the delay. Thank you.

Jinsung Myung
(Ext: 37330)

PS: If someone needs to have just Eastern PJM curve, we can try to get from 
Structuring group. Richard Park told me about PJM curve but I am not sure 
what exactly this is for.

Scott,

Structuring got back to us with some issues we need to clarify to get the 
pricing from a trader.

Capacity
 - Will Calpine be able to get manufacturer's guarantee for net capacity (or 
can we re-sell turbines to third party?)
 - Is it ""unit contingent call"" or there will be a kind of ""liquidated damage 
protection"" within the tolling agreement?

Nodal pricing
 - What is the exact name of substation in eastern PJM? Structuring could not 
find ""Parlin"" (even within eastern PJM, there will a substantial pricing 
differential among different bus points).

Gas delivery point

Actually, it is really hard to get the number by today since a trader who 
will give pricing is not here today and such a short period of notice. If we 
don't hear from you or/and if you don't decide yet, we will make assumption 
as follows;

- Capacity: 180 MW out of 4 LM-6000 turbine with manufacturer's guarantee and 
with term of liquidated damage protection included.
- Exact substation: East Hub in PJM
- Gas delivery point: Transco Zone 6

We will try to get the pricing hopefully by tomorrow. Please call me at 
713-853-7330, if you have any question. Thank you.

Were all set.  You and your dad should fly into Indianapolis Saturday morning 
or early afternoon.  You need to look on a Website for when the games begin 
that day.  We are actually flying into Cinci and driving over.   Again, look 
at a website to see what time the Final game is on Monday night.  Give me a 
call so when can go over meeting before the game to get you the tickets.  
Talk to you soon.  Work number is (713) 853-7998.

Yvon,

Please run the sensitivities and present results using a table incorporating 
the following categories listed vertically down the page.  The results will 
be tabulated in columns.  The first column will be the base case.  The base 
case will always reflect the power and vol. curves at mid as of the run date 
which will be indicated on the report.  A second page should graph the power 
and oil curves used in the base case.

curve shift
power vol.
oil vol.
correlation oil/power
residual value
Debt shape (all initial runs will be $375 mortgage)
Plant value (all your prior runs called this ""Spread"")
Call option (this is the value of the call we will own.  You should footnote 
a description of the call)
Plant value (in prior reports you called this spread)
Fee (this will be 5% of par amount outstanding, 315 MW x $375/kw x 5% = $5.9 
million)
Put premium
Net profit (9 + 10 - 11)

Items 1 - 4 should be shifted +/- 5%, 10%.  That should make 16 runs in 
total.  We'll build from there.

regards,

Don Black"

Carl,

Berney just gave my your name. I am in Generation Transaction Group, working 
for Thomas Suffield. I would like to sit down with you sometime today (if 
possible) to talk about ""Retail Short"" project. Please let me know when can I 
meet you. Please see below email for the summary of the project. Thank you.

Subject: Retail Short update

Thomas,

Ben and I had a meeting with Don on Tuesday. Please see below for the summary 
of meeting:

ENA would sell to an IPP (AES or Calpine) a combination of EES short position 
and peaking turbines.

ENA would generate profit from;
 1. spread between buying power from the IPP and selling it to EES at premium 
- will be very thin
 2. having a call option on the peaking plant for the portion of excess 
capacity of the plant
 3. fees from EES or/and IPP for providing/arranging capacity/off-taker
 4. better project financing by leveraging up more and having lower debt 
cost, which would be possible by having off-taker (EES) - Not quite sure yet.

Next steps/Assumptions;
 1. Assume equity IRR of 12% after tax
 2. Match assets to EES load curve
 3. Dispatch assets into market when not to meet load @ENA curve (""RevenueM"")
 4. Calculate transfer price to meet load (""RevenueL"") to meet equity return 
objectives of 12%
 5. Compare ""RevenueL"" to EES's market position
 6. Find Scaler value (option value from volatility)
 7. Calculate book earning for bid package
 --> We try to have work of 1 to 4 done by Thursday (2/24). Next meeting with 
Don is scheduled on Thursday.

Regarding our starting point of NY East, EES has short position ranging from 
0 MW to 126 MW in NY East region for next 11 years. I attached Excel file 
which shows an analysis of NY East including load graph.

To read EES data correctly, see the below definition.
 - WD: weekdays, WE: weekends.
 - Each 4 hour block number shows average load for 4 hour block, so actual 
peak load is higher than that.

Idea of sharing data with East Coast Power: Don does not mind if we 
distribute EES data internally within Enron, but he does not want data to go 
to Elpaso. He does not know Brad Alford.

Ben and Jinsung,

We have not had time to pass this information by the traders.  If we resolve 
the issues regarding location, unit contingency, etc., we can get a better 
number from the traders.  For now, these are indicative prices only.  Once we 
understand the deal better, we can talk to the traders and get a firmer 
price.  Also, Jim Fallon has requested that his traders receive a term sheet 
prior to agreeing to a price.

Here is the information you requested, based on the assumptions sent in the 
e-mail below:

Further assumptions:
180 MW
Priced at PJM East hub, no cost is added for any transmission
Must be called in 16 hour blocks
Total start costs: $1200 per start ($300 per turbine)
No escalation in VOM
95% availability

3 year capacity:  $3.80 kw/mo
5 year capacity:  $3.74 kw/mo

Edith,

- Substation location: Sayerville
- Gas: Transco Zone 6 (no additional cost for LDC)
- Unit contingent call
- 97% availability: It should be OK since we can assume 97% during summer 
time and 90~93% during non-summer time, for example.

Could you get the pricing for following scenario based on above assumption?

Flat and annual capacity payment for 3 and 5 year
With 16 hour block and 4 hour block

Please call me, if it doesn't make sense.

I will have property taxes for Gleason tomorrow and I will be talking with 
Jody Pierce regarding the Fixed Operating #'s and cost numbers as well.  When 
I talked with Kevin Presto he thought that trying to use the 99 actual 
numbers and then escalting them was NOT a good idea, due to the fact that 
these are not ""normal"" operating assumptions.  Please give me a call if you

Carl,

Don want to have following assumptions:

- ENA deals with just energy piece, not anciliary service portion.
- Gas curve: Transco zone 6 (may be bundled one)
- Power curve: East hub of NY power pool
- EES short load is fixed

For valuation;

   Revenue from serving load (to make 12% IRR for an IPP)
+ Spread option value
+ ICAP
-  Fixed expenses
= NI

Ben 

Attached is an Excel Spreadsheet, worksheet 1 is a list the documents I think 
maybe available in whole or part now - we should make a request at our 
earliest convenience to Delmarva/TECO/???? I would be glad to call (probably 
following an introduction call) to get this going.

Worksheet 2 is a start of the Table of Contents of the Due Diligence - I will 
try and finish it today - we are modeling this on some Stone & Webster 
efforts we have copies of - I can get you an example as a go-by.

I have also started on the tasking letter, deliverable list, schedule, 
resources and estimated cost.  I should have that available either tomorrow 
or Monday (I won't have complete buyin on the numbers but should be close 
enough to get going).

If you have a list of our team on this project, it would be helpful. Sounded 
like Lou had a fairly complete list of the Clients people.

I spoke with Wally Schlink of Rochester today in follow up to our c-call.  He 
thought the call went well; however, he still fees the main point is the 
price for the PPA.

RPU will be meeting with their Financial Advisor on Monday and they plan to 
then meet internally and figure what they would want from Enron to do the 
deal.  I believe the will give us their number next week and we will know 
where to head from there.

In the interim we need to be working on the following:


1.  Response to the RFP in their format
2.  Prepare a bid bond and get an understanding as to what it may bind us to 
do.

I would like for Russ to take lead on these matters.  

Note that we cannot go forward with Rochester unless we are technically in 
the process.

Oscar

Hi Ben,

Many thanks for your thoughtful email and thoughtful visit.  It's very
important for everyone to put names with faces and to understand the nuances
of individuals' circumstances.

My colleagues and I very much appreciate your enthusiasm for the Texas
Business School and I wish you the best with the application process.

I hope to see you next fall.

Cheers,

Dave

Subject: Meeting!


David Jemison:

    Thank you for taking the time to meet with me last Friday afternoon.  I
really enjoyed meeting you and talking about the Texas Business School.  My
meetings with Professors' Brown, Titman and Ronn were extremely helpful with
regards to learning about the energy-finance program and the investment
fund.
    In reference to our discussion about my low GMAT scores, I do not test
well on these types of tests, thus I have always had to work a lot harder
than most to get where I want to go, therefore I am accustom to working hard
to reach my goals.  Enron is based on a team-oriented approach, where people
with diverse skills come together to formulate innovative ideas and
financial products and to solve difficult problems for our customers.  The
Texas Business School seems to work on this approach, thus I would be able
to provide my skills as well as learn from others.  I have excelled in this
type of environment at Enron and feel that I would continue to excel at the
Texas Business School.  I am fully committed to become successful and do
well within the energy-finance program and will work hard to be able to
learn from and contribute to the program.
    After talking with you and others at the School, I am certain that the
Texas Business School would be a perfect fit for me.  With my experiences
from State Street Bank and Enron, I would be able to contribute a great deal
to the program and continue to add to the program after graduation.  Thanks
again for taking the time to meet with me and to show an interest in my
career goals.


Sincerely,


Ben Rogers

Amelia-

I enjoyed the meeting today.  It was very helpful for me as I am not a very 
experienced biker (I'm in really good shape, but I am not a biking fool!) , 
and it was good to hear about rides sponsored during the week.  It was also 
helpful to learn about the inspection sticker - and I will bring my bike in 
on March 24 if that is still the date at which we can have them inspected.  
Please let me know about when the mechanics class will be held too - I need 
to know how to change my tires!

Can you please sign me up for the MS150?  Here's the info I think you need, 
and let me know if you need any other info. Thanks very much for your time!!!

Attached is the MS150 Training Ride Schedule.  The first ride is this Sunday, 
Jan. 30, at 9:00 a.m. (not 8:00) at Memorial Park.  I spoke to the folks at 
West U Schwinn and they verified the time change.  The meeting area is at the 
large parking lot before you enter the picnic loop.  The picnic loop is 
located on the other side of Memorial (across from the running trail).  If 
you have any questions, please give me a call.  Thanks!

P.S. This ride is for all levels of riders.

2.  What pricing does the 20 year project model show that we need?

3.  What additional information do you need from me to complete your analysis?

Subject: Organizational Changes


To:  Enron North America Corp.

From:  Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon


In July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, the=20
implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the=20
continued growth of ENA including: 1) accelerate the development of our=20
people, 2) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets=
,=20
and 3) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups, both=20
within ENA and across Enron. Consistent with these objectives and with the=
=20
corporate goal of fostering =01&One Enron=018, we would like to announce th=
e=20
following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the=
=20
Commercial Transactions Group within ENA.

1) Coverage/Origination:

To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product=
=20
technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream=20
businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated=
=20
under the leadership of Dave Delainey :
a) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals,=
=20
co-ops, energy service companies and IPP=01,s;
b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a=
=20
broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers=20
including  pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals an=
d=20
mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation,=
=20
textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream=20
Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries.

Downstream Coverage/Origination

As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha=
t=20
the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both=
=20
ENA and Enron Corp.  Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand=
=20
its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20
solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron=
=20
Corp.  Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function=
=20
will expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener=
gy=20
commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti=
es=20
but also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic=
als,=20
plastics and refined products risk management capability.  These additional=
=20
capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels=
=20
groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper=
=20
will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg=01,s=20
leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three=
=20
sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering:
a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage=
=20
activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible f=
or=20
the provision of innovative=20
products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio=
n=20
of paper risk management products;
b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello t=
o=20
lead the coverage activities in this business.  This group will be=20
responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the=20
chemicals and refined products industries;
c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers=
=20
Trust=01,s global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to lead=
 the=20
coverage activities in this business.  This group will be responsible for t=
he=20
provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining,=20
heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textile=
s=20
and glass manufacturing industries.




Midstream Coverage/Origination

a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01, activities will focus o=
n=20
energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern=
=20
Interconnect. We have asked  Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of thi=
s=20
group;
b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will focus =
on=20
energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. The=
y=20
will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring=20
opportunities in the Western U.S.  We have asked Chris Calger to assume the=
=20
leadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from=20
Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination effort=
s;
c) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will f=
ocus on=20
the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the=20
emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio=01,s of merc=
hant=20
power generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked =
=20
Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group.  In addition, Mike will=
=20
continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern=20
Interconnect;
d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructur=
ing=20
opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing=20
restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets.  We hav=
e=20
asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair,=20
formerly of Enron Asia=01,s development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of=
=20
Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join=
=20
this newly formed business.

2) Commercial Transactions:=20

The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20
Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of=
=20
transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex=
ecuting=20
transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity=
=20
of client coverage.  CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20
Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20
Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical=
=20
Analysis and Upstream Asset Management.

The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,=
=20
execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction=
=20
with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of=
=20
which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.  This=
=20
dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service=
=20
and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20
resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to=
=20
the highest value transactions across the coverage functions:

a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and=
=20
Western Coverage/Origination Groups.  The senior members of this group=20
include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy=
=20
Lemmons joined Enron in 1992.  Most recently, he was the Vice-President of=
=20
Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today=
=20
from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power=20
origination.
b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA=01,s industr=
ial=20
origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining,=20
Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is=
=20
established.  The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay=
=20
Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.  We anticipate announcing=
=20
two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks.
c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant=
=20
Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups.  The seni=
or=20
members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud a=
nd=20
John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the=
=20
Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix.  We=
=20
anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few=
=20
weeks.
d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20
Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.  The senior members of this team inclu=
de=20
Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.  We hope to announce the addition=
=20
of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.

Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and=
=20
Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary=
=20
responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.  Andrea Reed will=
=20
continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior=
=20
commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua=
l=20
responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the=20
Capital Structuring Group.  The remaining four groups within CTG will remai=
n=20
largely unchanged.  In addition, the Origination and the Transaction=20
Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located=
=20
together.

We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag=
e=20
and industry knowledge in all ENA=01,s markets particularly in the industri=
al=20
markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe=
en=20
the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups.=20

Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor=
th=20
America by working with us to implement these changes.

Ben,

I will be out of the office for the next couple of weeks on a honeymoon.  I 
will be out until March 20th, so could you keep the deal list updated until 
then?  Tina told me that you should already have access to the O:drive where 
it is now listed.  You can access it at O:Corpdev/Gtg/Deals/Newlist.  I 
created a new format so it will look little different.  Please let me know if 
you have any questions.

Thank you,

Ben Thomason

Ben,

I think we need to clean the Calpine model. We will get the firmer pricing 
from Structuring tomorrow. As soon as we have that, we need to come back to 
Scott with the pricing and the model. Here is some comments.

- Install switch to see unlevered IRR
- Clean up IDC

Scott wants to see what would be the capacity pricing to get unlevered IRR of 
9%. Let's talk in the morning.

Subject: Making a List & Checking it Twice!

Hey Team!  Here we are, 6 weeks away from the MS150, at 139 and growing.  
Please check the list and if your name is not here and you think it should 
be, please let me know ASAP.  

We have a VERY IMPORTANT DEADLINE on MARCH 15.  That's the day the MS Society 
determines team size, and that's when we qualify for our SUPER START.  The 
largest team, as of March 15, starts first.  If you rode with us last year, 
you'll recall going out the gate first, which is the only way to travel!  I 
can't count you as registered unless you let me know you've registered with 
the MS Society, or we have registered you through Enron.  If you have any 
friends thinking about joining the team, it's really important to get that 
done by March 15.

Of course, you can still register after that date, but the fee raises to $35, 
and we ask your support in getting all our riders listed as soon as possible.

THANK YOU FOR RIDING WITH ENRON!

Subject: Making a List & Checking it Twice!

Hey Team!  Here we are, 6 weeks away from the MS150, at 139 and growing.  
Please check the list and if your name is not here and you think it should 
be, please let me know ASAP.  

We have a VERY IMPORTANT DEADLINE on MARCH 15.  That's the day the MS Society 
determines team size, and that's when we qualify for our SUPER START.  The 
largest team, as of March 15, starts first.  If you rode with us last year, 
you'll recall going out the gate first, which is the only way to travel!  I 
can't count you as registered unless you let me know you've registered with 
the MS Society, or we have registered you through Enron.  If you have any 
friends thinking about joining the team, it's really important to get that 
done by March 15.

Of course, you can still register after that date, but the fee raises to $35, 
and we ask your support in getting all our riders listed as soon as possible.

THANK YOU FOR RIDING WITH ENRON!

Subject: Calpine: Sayreville  

Jinsung,

Below are the indicative prices for the Calpine deal assuming there are no 
additional gas costs related to 
the transport of gas from the Transco Sayreville meter point and the 
potential site.

We have passed this by the trader, Paul Racicot.  If we enter the next round 
of negotiations where specific information
has become available, a stronger price is possible but we would need to deal 
more specifically with the Unit Contingent
aspect and the gas cost from meter to site.

Here is the assumptions and the prices:

180MW
Priced at Sayreville (discount to  Eastern hub)
Must be called in 16 blocks
5x16 product
Total start cost: $1200 per start ($300 per unit)
No escalation in VOM
95% availability
Gas priced at NY zone 6 with $0.03 physical premium in summer, and $0.07 in 
summer.

Prices are June-May yearly calculations
3yr $3.89kw-mo
5yr $3.84kw-mo

At this stage, the desk does not have a different price for the 4hr block 
product

Edith,

- Substation location: Sayerville
- Gas: Transco Zone 6 (no additional cost for LDC)
- Unit contingent call
- 97% availability: It should be OK since we can assume 97% during summer 
time and 90~93% during non-summer time, for example.

Could you get the pricing for following scenario based on above assumption?

Flat and annual capacity payment for 3 and 5 year
With 16 hour block and 4 hour block

Please call me, if it doesn't make sense.

We got the numbers. They are about $4.00/kw-mo, not yet good enough. Ben and 
I will try to talk to you first thing tomorrow morning. The model is ready 
for doing sensitivity analysis. Let's talk about modelling and capacity

Calpine Pricing

Jinsung,

Below are the indicative prices for the Calpine deal assuming there are no 
additional gas costs related to 
the transport of gas from the Transco Sayreville meter point and the 
potential site.

We have passed this by the trader, Paul Racicot.  If we enter the next round 
of negotiations where specific information
has become available, a stronger price is possible but we would need to deal 
more specifically with the Unit Contingent
aspect and the gas cost from meter to site.

Here is the assumptions and the prices:

180MW
Priced at Sayreville (discount to  Eastern hub)
Must be called in 16 blocks
5x16 product
Total start cost: $1200 per start ($300 per unit)
No escalation in VOM
95% availability in winter, 97% in summer
Gas priced at NY zone 6 with $0.03 physical premium in summer, and $0.07 in 
WINTER.

Ben,

I think we need to start to build model, rather than waiting for Structuring. 
Once we build template, we can finish model just by dropping curves from 
Structuring. Could you adjust our existing LM 6000 model to reflect our 
valuation method as follow;

Valuation of Retail Short =
+ Revenue from serving load (to get 12% IRR)
+  Expense from serving load at the market
+ Spread option value for full capacity (190MW)
+ ICAP ($1.00/kw-mo for 6 months)
- Fixed expenses

Please let me know if this is too much on your plate. Thanks.

This is a message from Jim Gramke, our very own Enron #1 fundraiser for the 
MS150 tour.  Any of you interested in participating with him, might just pick 
up some fundraising tips, or maybe some of his success will rub off - worth a 
try!   Please respond to Jim at the address below.

Anyone in the club who is interested in having a fun day with kids, I'm 
conducting a Bike Rodeo at the Oaks Elementary School in Atascocita, Friday, 
March 10th. I need some volunteers to work in the AM, PM, or both, to run 
about 750 kids through a skills course that  teaches safe riding habits.

Team,

We need to push forward on the next phase of the pricing model.  I sense that 
we have lost some momentum so we need to pick it back up.

Enron needs to shed some of the risk of this deal in order to be able to do 
more of them.  I think the insurance market is a great platform to accomplish 
this.  I think our success potential is high as long as Enron is in a first 
loss position and pro-rata loss for the balance.  However, I am not confident 
that the insurance industry will be able to work up a meaningful offer.  My 
solution is to calculate a bid for their services.

The loss I am trying to protect is associated with a bankruptcy process where 
Enron seeks to gain control of the underlying asset and/or its liquidation.  
I propose that the trigger for an insurance pay-out would be the sale of the 
underlying project to a third party in a liquidation scenario for the benefit 
of creditors (i.e. EPMI).

I would like to price a structure where EPMI takes the first $50/kw of Loss 
and 10% of the balance.  Loss will be defined as Par amount of debt 
outstanding plus Net Amounts owed EPMI less sale proceeds from plant.  Net 
Amounts owed EPMI will include the net amount of MTM and accrued index 
payments owed EPMI under both the Financial Buy and Financial Sell contracts 
as of the date of sale.  For purposes of this analysis lets assume initially 
that Net Amounts are $0.

One way to price this product would be as a put option of 90% (100% - 10%) of 
the MW of the plant at a price equal to par amount of debt less $50/kw.  I am 
open to other ideas.

I expect results to be presented in the form of reduction of the put premium 
( equity's option to put plant to EPMI) that we have been calculating to date.

It is also essential that we update the pricing models to reflect different 
start and end dates and different strike price calls for each year.

regards,

Don

Don,

We got curves and spread option value from Structuring. Ben and I are 
finalising the first model based on following valuation method;

Valuation of Retail Short =
+ 1. Revenue from serving load (to get 12% IRR)
+  2. Expense from serving load at the market
+ 3. Spread option value for full capacity
+ 4. ICAP ($1.00/kw-mo for first 6 months)
- 5. Fixed expenses

Someone may think #2 (Expense from serving load at the market) is redundant, 
which maybe true, but I still think it is not double counting.

#1, 2, and 3 can be written as follows: (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees + Max[(Pmkt - MC), 
0]*Capa, where Pees is Energy price charged to EES, Pmkt is Market price of 
power, Lees is EES load, MC is Marginal cost of peaker, and Capa is Capacity 
of peaker. Therefore,

If (Pmkt - MC) < 0, (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees,
If (Pmkt - MC) > 0, (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*Capa, 
   (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*(Capa-Lees),
   (Pees - Pmkt + Pmkt - MC)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*(Capa-Lees),
   (Pees - MC)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*(Capa-Lees).  

This correctly shows our structure, I think. I will try to talk to you today 
after we finish model. Thank you.

Jason, please find attached the O&M estimate for the City of Austin 4 x 
LM6000PC gas fired, simple cycle power project. It shows the estimated cost 
for the Operator's Mobilization Period ($/kW) and Annual Operating Period 
average FOM and average VOM for both 3 year and 20 year periods. The estimate 
assumes the addition of operating staff at the project, but that maintenance, 
supervision and administration services can be performed by existing staffing 
at Austin Energy. The staffing is such that the peak periods could be manned 
for round the clock availability and eased off in the non-peak months. I have 
shown an O&M fee during Mobilization and Annual Operating Periods designed to 
cover this service, as well as the Operator's risk for meeting Availability 
requirements.



Per Sandra's request, I have not shown the GT and SCR reserve calculations in 
the estimate, but for purposes of documenting with our team, they are 
estimated to be:
GT Reserve = $54/fired hour (20 year term)
SCR Reserve = $25/fired hour (assume 40,000 hr life)

Please review and call if you would like to discuss further.

regards, Scot

Attached is our best guess at a likely EPC cost - full disclosure on our

think we should pitch this without compression and add it if we need to. I 
think that is Charles' plan also. Has Jim heard anything from Lone Star????

Scott,

Below is the new capacity pricing (improved by $0.1/kw-mo) based off of 
10,200 heat rate, which is still long way to go. I will make a more effort to 
get better pricing. There is still a room between mid curve and bid curve. 
Another possibility is to sell by 4 hour block with better pricing, as you 
commented. Please let me know if you have any better idea. Thank you.

Calpine Pricing

Jinsung,

Below are the indicative prices for the Calpine deal assuming there are no 
additional gas costs related to 
the transport of gas from the Transco Sayreville meter point and the 
potential site.

We have passed this by the trader, Paul Racicot.  If we enter the next round 
of negotiations where specific information
has become available, a stronger price is possible but we would need to deal 
more specifically with the Unit Contingent
aspect and the gas cost from meter to site.

Here is the assumptions and the prices:

180MW
HEAT RATE 10,200 (previously 10,500)
Priced at Sayreville (discount to  Eastern hub)
Must be called in 16 blocks
5x16 product
Total start cost: $1200 per start ($300 per unit)
No escalation in VOM
95% availability in winter, 97% in summer
Gas priced at NY zone 6 with $0.03 physical premium in summer, and $0.07 in 
WINTER.

I talked to Bruce on Friday around 5:00pm and they are getting us, as well as 
Nepco, the scope document on Wednesday.  Nepco will take till the following 
Monday to turn the doc. around.  I told him we need it sooner than that, but 
he seems to think that is the standard time of return.  We need to find out 
from Reed more information regardin the configuration, noise, water, etc.  We 
will meet with Bruce on Wednesday.  We also may want to think about going up 
there with an Engineer to visit the site.  We can talk more on Monday.

Hey there,

How is it going in Texas?  Did you go skiing this year?  Did you get the
message that I called from Hong Kong?  This has been one incredible
adventure.  The workday is long but the time flies.  It is also great to
work with people who are so dedicated and willing to try new things.  We are
now in the Persian Gulf so keep an eye on the news, if anything happens here
we either caused it or are caught in the middle of it.

What does your apartment look like?  I am getting your wedding present from
the Mid East and no, it is not your own pet camel.  That is for me.  I need
to know the colors you like or better yet the colors Megan likes in a rug.
I also need the size you want.  Think of what and where you would put it
when buy a house.  These things last forever and appreciate in value (as
long as you don't have a dog!).

I talked with OB via email and we are both going to try and enter the NYC
marathon this fall.  Are you doing this?  Its Saturday morning on the ship
and it is just like any other work day.  I am going for a 75 minute run.
Talk to you later.

Things are going well here in the States.  Work is very busy right now and i 
am actually training to  do the MS 150 Bike race.  It a race from Houston to 
Austin.  It's a 170 mile, two day ride with about 5,000 bikers.  It's on 
April 16th and 17th.  I rode this weekend only 40 miles.  Yes I am going todo 
the NYC Marathon and for you virgins, I will kick your fat asses.  Darnit, I 
wanted a pet Camel for our apartment.  Yes I got your message last week - I 
had just stepped away from my desk and just missed you.  When do you get 
back?  Sometime in the Summer.  By the summer I hope to be in the 185 range, 
currently I'm right at 200!!!  Not very good.  I have been talking with Mike 
Gioffre lately and were trying to get people together this spring or summer.  
I'll let you know when.  Gotta go, but I'll talk to you soon.

Meg:
I would like to make sure that I have fully explained the reason for my GMAT 
score.  If the admissions office needs me to provide documentation on this 
disability I can do that.  Due to this disability, the GMAT score is not a 
good indicator of how I will do at UT.  Through what I have learned in my 
work experiences with State Street Bank and Enron, I know that I will be able 
to successfully do the work that UT requires.  If you could let me know what 
I can do to further explain my GMAT score I would greatly appreciate it.  If 
you think it would be better to talk to Dr. Harris-I will do that.  Thanks 
again for taking the time to help me with this issue.

Carl and Brad,

Ben and I had a meeting with Don Black on Retail Short this morning. We think 
the project is moving well. We finished the first cut of model and are 
preparing some sensitivity analyses. One of them which Don wants to see is 
correlation sensitivity. Don want to have 50%, 60%, and 70% correlation 
scenario. Could you please run the spread option model with 50% and 60% 
correlation? Thank you.

Ben:

I talked to the admissions people last week.  They had not made a decision
but said that your GMAT score is a potential problem.  You may need to
either retake the exam or somehow document any disability that would bias
the score.

I hope that this works out -- I know that you will be a great addition to
our Energy Finance Program.

Professor Titman:
Thank you for talking with the people in the admissions office.  I wanted to 
ask you what you think I could do at this point to help the admission's 
people understand the reason for my GMAT score.  I know that this is a poor 
reflection of what I can actually achieve and I know that I will do well and 
be successful in the learning environment at UT.  If I need to, I can provide 
the admissions office the documents stating the disability.  If you can let 
me know what you think I can do, I would appreciate it.  Thanks agin!

Gentlemen,

Last Feb 22, I sent you an e-mail on an insurance concept to mitigate some of 
the risks of the Delmarva peaking deal.  In essence, the insurance policy 
would trigger off the sale of the asset to a third party, or other 
restructuring designed to recapture and repay moneys owed creditors such as 
Enron.  The basic formula would be (Asset Sale Proceeds - Debt - Moneys Owed 
Enron under both the Financial Buy or Financial Sell contracts = Loss).

I propose that Enron take the first $50/kw of loss and 10% of the balance.

Initial results from numerical analysis suggests I could pay $5 million for 
the policy.

I have attached a simple spreadsheet showing max. possible loss in any year, 
and equity write down each year under the maximum loss scenario.  The equity 
write down is designed to model the likelihood that equity will allow the 
project to go into bankruptcy.

regards,

Don

Edith,

I talked to Tom Swank today on the Synthetic Combined Cycle. Tom wants to 
have the capacity payment numbers based off of mid and bid curve as well as 
offer curve for indicative proposal to Aquila. Carl told me that you already 
ran the model one month ago. Is it relevant idea? Let me know your thought. 
Thank you.

Ben:

I don't know exactly what to recommend because I am not involved in the
admissions process.  I think that you may need to give them some sort of
documentation about the nature of your disability and demonstrate that this
will not carry over to your class performance.

I think the question is the following: Can you explain why you cannot
perform on a GMAT test but will be able to successfully perform on the
tests in your MBA classes?

I hope this is helpful and apologize for the stress we put our applicants
through.

regards,


Sheridan

Just wanted to let you know that I received an e-mail from Dr. Carl Harris, 
who at this point is in charge of my application.  He wants me to answer a 
few questions, making sure I will be able to handle the MBA coursework.  That 
was one of my main reasons for meeting with you and the Professors' Ronn and 
Brown, is to talk to you about the course work and inform you of my strengths 
and weaknesses, to make sure I could do the work.  I know that with my 
financial modeling and accounting skills, energy-finance background and the 
Business School's team-oriented approach to learning, that I will excel in 
this learning environment.  I will convey this message and others to him by 
tomorrow.  I hope things workout and thanks again for your help.

Professor Titman:
 I would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the MBA 
Program.  In the end, the results were not favorable.  I understand that it 
is a competitive process, but I felt that with my work experiences, 
recommendations, extrcurricular activities, etc., that this would help my 
chances and possibly compensate my disability.  After talking with you and 
Professors Ronn, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that UT was the right place to 
continue learning about energy-finance.  
  I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent 
graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do what 
ever it takes to get in next year.  I plan on taking a couple of graduate 
level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to 
demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this level. I also 
plan on trying to retake the GMAT test.  Due to my disability, this will be a 
monumental task, but I am determined to prove to the Admissions committment 
that I can do the work at The Texas University Graduate School of Business.
 Also, I would like to continue our dialague regarding creating an 
Energy-Finance Private Equity Fund at UT.  I know that with my industry-wide 
and investment banking contacts that I can help raise capital for the fund.  
I am very interested in energy-finance and think that your idea is a very 
good.  
 Thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me.  It has been a 
pleasure to meet with you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and 
finance in the future.  Also, if you think of anything else I can do to 
strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know.  
Take care and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,

Ben Rogers

Don,

Here is a couple of updates on Retail Short. 

- I realized that power curve has impact on both expense from serving EES 
load and spread option value, so I asked Carl to run spread option model with 
different mid curve scenarios as well as correlation.

- To make our analysis easier, I would like to have 40/60 of debt/equity and 
1.5 of DSCR (as you originally suggested), so that we can concentrate on 
""Energy charge"" to EES.

Please let me know, if you have any concern. We should be able to finish by 
today. Thank you.

Meg:
I would like to make sure that I have fully explained the reason for my
GMAT score.  If the admissions office needs me to provide documentation on
this disability I can do that.  Due to this disability, the GMAT score is
not a good indicator of how I will do at UT.  Through what I have learned
in my work experiences with State Street Bank and Enron, I know that I will
be able to successfully do the work that UT requires.  If you could let me
know what I can do to further explain my GMAT score I would greatly
appreciate it.  If you think it would be better to talk to Dr. Harris-I
will do that.  Thanks again for taking the time to help me with this issue.

Teddy-We are preparing the bid bond based on the request received yesterday 
evening.  The bid specifications indicate liquidated damages in the amount of 
$2,375,000 PER DAY.  I assume Enron will not accept damages at this level.  
Please check to determine if the bid will be qualified in this area-and what 
alternative damages may be offered.  Due to the unusual size of the penalty 
relative to the contract value, this could have an impact on reinsurance.

The contract indicates a normal one year warrenty from the contractor.  The 
charge for this warrenty is included in our standard performance bond rate.  
I have bonded a number of generator contracts similar to this, and frequently 
there is an option for the contractor to offer an extended warrenty up to 5 
years.  Since this would impact the premium charged, you may want to check to 
see if this option exist so we can get the pricing correct in your estimate.

Thanks.

Ben/Don

Attached is an Excel spreadsheet with a tasking letter, summary estimate of 
resources/cost, table of contents of deliverable package and the last is a 
sequence of task/reviews.

Looks like with a 12/20/1999 kickoff, we could have ""first look"" review and 
""fatal flaw"" report to you by third week of January, draft full report by mid 
February and final issue by end of February. This assumes Project Sponsor has 
most of the essential documentation available and in our hands by 12/27/99. 
It further assumes Project Sponsor has staff available in Houston to address 
questions as they come up in the review process. Project would be led by 
myself assisted by a  designated Project Engineering Manager to coordinate 
work efforts and report publication.

 

expected cost to be about $60,000 for EE&CC staff/travel, about $25,000 for 
third party environmental consultant (based on discussion with Project 
Sponsor's consultant and the apparent state of permits and licences). The 
Development engineer cost is already covered as an allocation to ENA so does 
not directly hit Project budget. Costs and resources should be considered 
estimated based on our understanding of project and our assumptions of 
available Project Sponsor documentation. We would anticipate publishing 
bi-weekly due diligence progress summaries and would have updated 
manhours/cost expened and commited to the report date.

Thanx Bruce"

Greetings, Mr. Rogers

We are now in possession of your TEXASMBA admission application.  Though it
has not yet completed the formal review process, you are correct in your
assessment that your GMAT score may prove to be a tremendous negative in
your overall competitive profile.

Before I conclude our final review, I would ask that you further clarify to
me the nature of the learning disability you mention in your fourth essay.
I am especially interested in how this disability directly affects your
performance in a timed, test situation, as well as the traditional classroom
setting.

Also, you mention in your essay that you have ""... overcome this disability
...""   I would ask that you cite for me the specific steps you have taken to
accomplish this feat, and by what measures you may make this claim.

Finally, I would ask that you summarize for me the reasons why you feel your
level of academic performance at Catholic University of America will not be
replicated in the graduate business classroom here at The TEXAS Graduate
School of Business.

As you consider your responses to these questions, I am placing your
application on ""hold"".  No final decision will be made until you are
satisfied that you have provide whatever additional information you feel
appropriate and merited.

I look forward to hearing from you, and thank you for your interest in The
TEXAS Graduate School of Business.

Dr. Harris:

    After receiving an e-mail from Meg Brooks, she has informed me that she
as sent my e-mail on to you.  I wanted to make sure that I have properly
provided enough information to the Admissions office regarding my low GMAT
score.  Three weeks ago I visited the school to participate in a information
session, Admissions Visit and to visit with Professors' Sheridan Titman,
Ehud Ronn, Keith Brown and David Jemison.  The discussions I had with
Professors Titman and Ronn were to discuss the Energy Finance Program, which
I intend to pursue at the school and as a career after graduation.  After
talking with them, they seemed to think that I would be a good fit with the
School and especially the Energy Finance Program.  Due to my disability
towards tests such as the GMAT, I feel that the GMAT is not a good indicator
of how I will perform at UT.  Through the experiences I have had with State
Street Bank and especially with Enron, two very competitive environments, I
know that I will continue to be successful at the Texas Business School.
    Please let me know if  you want me to provide this documentation on my
disability or if you what to meet in person I will come to Austin to meet
with you.  I know that UT would be a perfect fit for the skills I have
attained to help me contribute to the program as well as learn the skills I
need to build on and further my career in the energy-finance industry..
    Thank you in advance for taking the time to review my application.  I
hope that I have provided all the information you need to make an informed
decision.  Hope to have a chance to meet you in the near future.

Sincerely,

Ben Rogers

Don, per your request attached is the model I created to value the 
transaction.  This model was created utilizing the Origination/Structuring 
model as a starting point.  I have used EPMI/ENA's power and fuel curves as 
opposed to the company's base case pricing scenario.  I have also used a 
mortgage style debt amortization based on $118MM of funded debt.  Attached is 
a memo that touches on the transaction, the value of the price risk 
management contracts, financial results, and some closing comments.  

Regards,

Christopher

The guy you are talking about left CIN under a ""cloud of suspicion"" sort of 
speak.  He was the one who got into several bad deals and PPA's in California 
for CIN, thus he left on a bad note.  Let me know if you need more detail

Don,

Currently, our model assumes total project cost of $558/kW (EPC: $509/kW with 
turbine cost of $303/kW, Soft cost: $45/kW, Financing cost: $5/kW) . I think 
$558/kW may be too conservative (compare to what I have been hearing), so I 
ran some sensitivities on project cost as follows. The result is not 
negligible. See you tomorrow.

Regards,

Jinsung

Ben, 
Following up with our conversation earlier in the week regarding changes to 
the LM6000 model, I had tried speaking with Clement before he left for Asia 
but nothing materialized.  George and myself would like to have the model in 
suitable form with these chages (I have attached the file) in working shape 
quickly, ideally no later than the end of next week.  I am more than willing 
to help you with this in any way - especially explaining our proposed changes.

Why don't you review the changes and I'll drop by tomorrow to discuss a 
timeline.

Attached is the model. 

p.s The 2000 capacity prices that Jenny gave us for the 1999 peakers seems

FYI

ENA was low bidder for the LM-6000 deal with Rochester.  I will be calling 
Rochester today to determine next actions steps.  Please note that our 
proposal is contingent upon a bundled deal.  I would not take this as an 
indication of a done deal. (i.e. No Green Sheet Yet)

Ben,

I found that you should have considered that power plant will operate from 
June 2001, which means we can only realize the spread option value of 7 
months, not of a whole year. Please make the changes as well as clean up the 
""Opion"" page. We should start to think about going to RAROC and to scrub the 
model.

What is the source of the financing assumptions?

I spoke with Rochester this morning and they advised that they will present a 
recommendation to their Board on 3/28 as to the party they will negotiate 
with.

At this point, they are evaluating the bids and will be issuing questions, 
etc. (Note: 2 parties were disqualified for failure to submit bid bonds)

Again, even though we were low bidder, I would not view this as a given that 
we will be the final party.

I'll stay close to this and keep everyone advised."

Greetings, Mr. Rogers

My thanks for your prompt and thoughtful reply.

As I interpret your note, it is not your desire to accept our offer to
retake the GMAT at this time.  Accordingly, I will be adding this latest
addition to your application packet.

Apart from what you have already submitted, is there any other new
material(s) you wish to be considered in the applications final review?

Carl

Dr. Harris:
Sorry for the delay, I have been traveling with work and I just got back an 
hour ago.  I can try and retake the GMAT exam if this will help my overall 
application file.  I must say, due to my disability, I don't think my score 
would improve dramatically.  I can also send you a summary (or the whole 
report) on my disability from the professional examiner to further explain my 
disability.  I can also provide addition recommendations from my colleagues I 
work with to further demonstrate my achievements at work.  If you could let 
me know what information would help best  explain my disability, I would 
appreciate it.  Thanks again for your e-mail and sorry for the delay.

them earlier or not.  Looks like it going to be a very interesting Final

Greetings, Mr. Rogers

Your initial response to my request for a information regarding your
disability  is adequate at this time.

As for your comment regarding the prospects for an improved GMAT exam
score -- if you do not feel you will be able to improve your score through a
retake, I am unclear why you are making the attempt.  We have no interest in
you retaking the test just to retake the test.  Only if you strongly feel
your score can be improved should you even consider the attempt.  Only you
know if your first score is truly reflective of the best score you can
receive -- disability or not.  That is the reason the option to retake the
test was presented to you as it was.

My advice is do not retake the test if you feel your current score is the
best examination result you can achieve.  If, however, and for whatever
reason you feel your current score does not reflect your best examination
results -- then do proceed with the reexamination.

Regardless of your decision, I remain available for whatever assistance I
might provide as you now continue to consider the options before you.

Since I am a eternal optimist, I always feel I can strengthen my skills in 
most everything I do, but under these circumstances with the GMAT (timed 
exam) combined with my disability, I feel this is my best representation for 
this exam.  Also, I know that you would not what me to take the exam just to 
retake it, but due to my strong desire to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of 
Business, I would try to provide any additional information you needed to 
help strengthen my overall application file.  Again, thanks for the fast

Here is the FOM I am using. Let me know if they are correct and if so, if 
they already take into account the inflation or not.

Come one, come all to conquer the treacherous hills at Bastrop State Park on 
Saturday, March 25.  Bastrop IS the toughest part of the MS150.  We will be 
meeting at the large parking area which is located at the entrance of the 
park where you pay to get in.  Look for my green Toyota pickup truck with the 
camper top.  Meeting time is 10:00 a.m.  It takes approximately 2 1/2 hours 
to drive to Bastrop from Houston.  I will bring water and gatorade.  You're 
on your own for food.

Please RSVP to me so I'll have enough water and gatorade for everyone.

Things to bring:
Stuff to change a flat tire
Water bottle (filled with your favorite beverage)
Food (fruit, power bars, whatever else)
Helmet
Bike
Yourself

Here's a map of the park.  Let me know if you have any questions.


Directions:
Take I-10 West to 71 West towards Lagrange/Austin
Travel down 71W about 50 miles.
Turn right onto Loop 150
Travel .7 miles
Turn right onto TXP1 (Park Road 1A)
You'll be at the entrance to the park.

Please send me an excel spreadsheet which depicts the value that you see 
associated with the heat rate spread option.  I want to make sure that I 
understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this value 
would be booked.  As such, please provide the following detail:

Will we be valuing/booking a series of monthly call options or a series of 
daily call options?
What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub?
Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/MWh to 
value the deal?
What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities 
or intra-day volatilities or a blend of the two (if blending please show me 
what formula you using to blend the two vols)?
What expiration date are you using, i.e.: for monthly call options the 15th 
of the relevant month, and for daily options?
What correlation are you assuming, 15% flat for twenty years?
Are you deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option?
Are you using the ""SPRDOPT"" Exotic Options function to value the option?
Are you using the $/MWh VOM dollar amount as your strike?
Has Don provided the fixed payment stream?  This stream should be covering 
both P&I and not just principal.

Yvan, and Ben, please provide answers to these question via written 
correspondence so that their is limited probability of misunderstanding.  
Thank you both very much for your time and help thus far.  Furthermore, I 
would like to reiterate that RAC's goal, prior to quoting any credit reserve, 
is to be 100% confident that: (i) the methodology that is being employed is 
consistent among the internal groups; and (ii) the inherent value of the 
price risk management contracts matches.  This enables RAC to manage the 
associated risk during the life of the transaction both effectively and 
appropriately.

Regards,

Christopher"

Yvon,

Good morning!  Attached below is a letter I sent to TECO and Mosbacher 
yesterday describing how my deal benefits them.  I have offered to move some 
of the elements of my deal around to help with book earnings, etc. while 
maintaining PV value.

How much does it cost me to delay the start of my 50MW, $50 call option to 
1/1/03 and 1/1/04.
How much do I gain by increasing the size of my remaining calls by 10mw?
How much do I gain by adding 50MW, $200 and $300 calls for the following 
range of dates:

 Start Date 12/31/10 end 12/31/20 end
 1/1/03 ??? ???
 1/1/04 ??? ???

Make sure you use the base model without insurance.  This should be a good 
starting point.  I'm open to any suggestions.

regards,

Don

Anything over 250, in my book is ""DREAM TEAM"" status, as those of you who 
were with us in '98 will remember how excited we were to get to that level.  
It's happened again! - as of this moment, we have 293 registered riders, and 
we have room for more - so please be in touch if you have anyone else to add 
to the team.  (A handful of you who've told me you're not riding are still on 
the list - we're hoping you'll change your mind, and  also we get numbers 
credit for the amount of people registered.)

The deadline has passed for registering for $25.  As of today, registration 
is $35, and if you are a member of the cycling club, you will from this point 
forward need to register yourself and request a reimbursement from Stephanie 
Strong.

Many thanks to Becky Pham, Uniform Officer, and Stephanie Strong, Treasurer, 
who are handling jersey distribution.  It's going very well under their 
supervision.  And thanks to John Norden for chairing the jersey design 
process.  Please get in touch with Becky Pham at 713-345-7094 or Stephanie 
Strong at 713-853-1653 to get your jersey reserved and/or picked up.  The 
jerseys have caused quite a ""stir"" and it'll be great to see them on the road.

HERE'S TEAM ENRON 2000 !

You are invited to attend
Isuzu MS150 Bike Tour
Media Day

Monday, March 20, 2000
11:30 am - 1:00 pm
Quebedeaux Park
Adjacent to the Family Law Center
1115 Congress @ San Jacinto in downtown Houston

We need your help in spreading the word abou the Isuzu MS150.  Your story 
could go a long way in driving up attendance and generating pledges.  The MS 
Society is hosting the MS150 Media Day for journalists from Houston to Austin 
in order to encourage their coverage of this spectacular event.  The more 
people that know about the Bike Tour, the more that participate.....and 
ultimately the more funds that are raised to unravel the mysteries of 
multiple sclerosis.  We would like you on hand to share your story about why 
you are riding the MS150 or past experiences on the Tour.  All we ask is that 
you stop by Quebedeaux Park Monday, March 20, and if possible, wear your bike 
jersey.  It is a casual, outdoor event and lunch  will be provided.  We will 
also have training tips, cycling pros and veteran advice available - you 
can't lose!

It will be a fun time for all and a great way to gear up for this year's 
event."

Greetings, Mr. Rogers

I wish to inform you that your fall 2000 application for admission to the
TEXASMBA in The Graduate School of Business at The University of Texas at
Austin has now completed its formal review.  I regret your application has
not been successful, and that you are not being extended an offer of
admission.

The competitiveness of this year's applicant pool has made it an extremely
challenging quest for each of our 3,000 applicants.  Unfortunately, there
are only 420 seats available for the new class to fill.

I do wish to thank you for your interest in the TEXASMBA, and I wish you the
very best in both your personal and professional aspirations for the future.

Dr. Harris:
 I would like to thank you for personally taking the time to closely review 
my application. Though I am disappointed with the results I am still 
determined to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of Business next year.  I 
understand how competitive the process has become, but I felt that with my 
work experiences, recommendations, personality, extracurricular activities, 
etc. that this would compensate for my disability.  After talking with 
Professors Titman, Ronn, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that the School was 
the right place to get the education I was looking for.  
  I am still certain that the School is the best place for getting a great 
graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do 
whatever it takes to get in next year.  I plan on taking two or three 
graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and 
Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions committee that I can compete at the 
graduate level. I also plan on retaking the GMAT test.  Due to my disability, 
this will be a monumental task; but I am determined to prove to the Committee 
that I can be successful at The TEXAS Graduate School of Business.  I would 
like to come down to Austin this spring to meet with you to further discuss 
my application file and to personally meet you.   
  If you think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall application 
file for next year, please let me know.  Take care and hope to hear from you 
soon.

Sincerely,

Ben Rogers

Don:

Again, thanks for dropping by. A little ""face time"" can go along way!

Enjoy your night and weekend. I will be in D.C. most of next week, but
leave me
a message here at the office if you need to reach me.

I continue to feel strongly that we can work out an arrangement that is a
win-win for both
parties. But in keeping with our strategy ( and your recommendation), we
will proceed with CSFB
as planned until we have something else with which to work and ""sink our
teeth"" into.

Thanks againl. I appreciate your persistence and diligence.

Tom

reflecting starting date of 6/1/01. Also change ICAP value, which is

Please send me an excel spreadsheet which depicts the value that you see 
associated with the heat rate spread option.  I want to make sure that I 
understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this value 
would be booked.  As such, please provide the following detail:

Will we be valuing/booking a series of monthly call options or a series of 
daily call options?
What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub?
Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/MWh to 
value the deal?
What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities 
or intra-day volatilities or a blend of the two (if blending please show me 
what formula you using to blend the two vols)?
What expiration date are you using, i.e.: for monthly call options the 15th 
of the relevant month, and for daily options?
What correlation are you assuming, 15% flat for twenty years?
Are you deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option?
Are you using the ""SPRDOPT"" Exotic Options function to value the option?
Are you using the $/MWh VOM dollar amount as your strike?
Has Don provided the fixed payment stream?  This stream should be covering 
both P&I and not just principal.

Yvan, and Ben, please provide answers to these question via written 
correspondence so that their is limited probability of misunderstanding.  
Thank you both very much for your time and help thus far.  Furthermore, I 
would like to reiterate that RAC's goal, prior to quoting any credit reserve, 
is to be 100% confident that: (i) the methodology that is being employed is 
consistent among the internal groups; and (ii) the inherent value of the 
price risk management contracts matches.  This enables RAC to manage the 
associated risk during the life of the transaction both effectively and 
appropriately.

Regards,

Christopher

Chris,


Hopefully the following points should answer your questions. Feel free to=
=20
call me (34292) if you still have any question.

Yvan




1_  We will value Teco as a series of hourly Spread options.=20
Legitimate points of concern:=20
a) Are we valuing an index deal or a physical deal?
  b) If it is a physical deal can the plant realistically react on an hourl=
y=20
basis?

Answer: The deal Enron enters into is based on an spread between PJM index=
=20
and the appropriate OIL curve (New York Harbor + basis). However, the trigg=
er=20
for the default of the contract (which is really what we are concerned with=
)=20
is a function of the plant cash flows compared to the debt level. The plant=
=20
cash flows depend on the physical operations of the plant and its capacity =
to=20
dispatch during the most expensive hours of the year. Therefore the questio=
n=20
of whether the plant can or cannot ramp up quickly enough to dispatch=20
economically is very pertinent to our valuation.=20
I would argue that the plant will always (or almost always) be able to=20
dispatch economically for the following 2 reasons. In the first place, its=
=20
operational ramp up time is only 10 minutes. Secondly, the scalar curve we=
=20
use is fairly well behaved and doesn=01,t swing around a mean position (see=
=20
graph below), hence allowing sufficient preparation for the dispatchers. Th=
e=20
chances of dispatchers being caught by surprise when prices spike up or dow=
n=20
should therefore be relatively small, and the plant should be able to follo=
w=20
the real time prices pretty well.





2_ The power curve we use is PJM west. Even though the plant is located in=
=20
the south east end of PJM (i.e. the del Marva peninsula), we prefer not to=
=20
use the east curve which is too thinly traded to be meaningful.=20

4_ So far we have only used monthly vol for power. Should we start using=20
daily vol as well, then the blending formula would be:
'fvol =3D Sqr((dblMvol * dblMvol * (jDate - jToday) + dblDvol * dblDvol * 1=
5) /=20
(jDate - jToday + 15))

with  jDate the first of the considered month of dispatch
 dblMvol the monthly vol
 dblDvol the daily vol

6_ We are assuming 50% flat correlation for 20 years (a much more=20
conservative assumption than 15%). However we run sensitivities where the=
=20
correlation goes from 30% to 70%.

7_ Yes, we are deducting all operative expenses from the valuation.=20
Origination is currently trying to reconcile the differences in operations=
=20

What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub?
Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/MWh to=

What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities=

what formula you using to blend the two vols)?
What expiration date are you using, i.e.: for monthly call options the 15th=

What correlation are you assuming, 15% flat for twenty years?
Are you deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option?
Are you using the ""SPRDOPT"" Exotic Options function to value the option?
Are you using the $/MWh VOM dollar amount as your strike?

Dear Ben:

I am very disappointed to learn that you will be unable to join our energy
finance program next fall.  However, I'm pleased that you are willing to
keep trying.

I suggest that if possible, you take an MBA level finance class at U of
Houston this summer.  If you can get an A in the class, I will personally
argue your case to the admissions Dean.  I was also told that your chances
of getting in would improve considerably if you raise your GMAT over 500.

Its clearly a long shot, but we should still try to get you into the
program next fall.

Let me know how things are going.

regards,

Sheridan

Professor Titman:
 I hope you had an enjoyable summer and it didn't go too quickly.   I hope 
you remember who I am from last years application process.  I enjoyed meeting 
you last year and talking with  you regarding the curriculum and admissions 
process.  I wanted to let you know that I am still very much interested in 
attending the Business School.  
 I took your advice this summer and took a graduate level finance class 
(Financial Management), which I received an A.  I was very pleased with 
myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time.  I 
have decided to take another graduate level finance class (Macroeconomics), 
which I am currently taking and runs through December.  
 I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into GMAC to try 
and receive a ""special testing status"" for the GMAT.   I am currently waiting 
to hear back from them with their decision.
 As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the Business 
School for next year and I'm in the process of doing whatever I can to 
increase my application profile.  I am also sending an e-mail to Carl Harris, 
who heads up the admissions process  to inform him of these recent 
developments. 
 Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do to 
enhance my application profile.   Again, I hope all is going well and I look 
forward to hearing from you soon 

Regards,

Ben Rogers

Join the party and pick up your packet at the Enron Building.  This is a 
personalized packet pickup for the Enron team, and we appreciate the MS staff 
for helping us out with this.  Attached is the team roster, and MS will bring 
the packets for the people on this list.  If you know of anyone else who 
should be on this list, let me know ASAP so we can get theirs included.

This is a street party, so come join the fun!



11:30 - 1:00
Friday - March 24
Enron Building, 1400 Smith
Park:  Allen Center Garage

Events:

Packet Pickup for Team Enron 2000 provided by the MS Society
 Jersey pickup for Team Enron 2000 
Official Bike MS150 bike inspections provided by West U. Schwinn

Lunch for $5 provided by Fusion Cafe (Jerk Chicken, etc.)

Live Music

Some things you may be pondering:  

Yes, you can pick up rider packets for your friends if they cannot attend.  
MS Society will require a signed pledge sheet for any packet picked up, so be 
prepared for that if someone has asked your assistance with this.  For you 
rookies - if you've got a pledge sheet in production, just stop where you are 
and copy it to give to MS, and then you can continue with your pledge 
efforts.  If you haven't yet begun, you can fill out a blank one there, and 
sign your name obligating to the minimum pledge.  Money is not due yet - just 
pledges.

If you need to have your packet picked up, try to get a friend at Enron to do 
it who can deliver it to you, and if that's not an option, and you can get by 
the building at another time to pick up, just let us know and we'll reserve 
it for you if you fax your pledge sheet ahead of time - that means before 
10:00 AM on Friday.  This is the only private pickup we will have - after 
this, you'll need to go to one of the pickup points in the Rider Manual.  I 
will publish those for you later.

If you're picking up a jersey for a friend, we'll ask for a pledge commitment 
as well, because we like to know that everyone who rides for Enron pledges to 
raise a minimum of $400.  If any of you or your friends have trouble with 
this number, just contact me and we'll help you out.  We want you to ride 
with us, and I know it can be scary the first time you've tried to raise 
money.  Don't let that keep you off the team, just get in touch with me.

Jeff Nielsen of West U. Schwinn will be here to get your bikes inspected 
(free of charge).  If you don't know the reason for getting your bike 
inspected - it is designed to keep unworthy bikes off the road for safety and 
maintenance reasons, and if you have an official inspection sticker on your 
bike, you will not be charged any labor along the way if your bike should 
need repairs.  There is a bike shop at each rest stop to assist you with any 
breakdowns.

We have 3 rides this weekend, all on Saturday - two of which you've already 
received, and one official MS150 training ride. 

Saturday - March 25   (Ride Coordinator - Stephanie Strong - 713-853-1653)

Come one, come all to conquer the treacherous hills at Bastrop State Park on 
Saturday, March 25.  Bastrop IS the toughest part of the MS150.  We will be 
meeting at the large parking area which is located at the entrance of the 
park where you pay $3 entry fee.  Look for my green Toyota pickup truck with 
the camper top.  Meeting time is 10:00 a.m.  It takes approximately 2 1/2 
hours to drive to Bastrop from Houston.  I will bring water and gatorade.  
You're on your own for food.  The route is about 12 miles through the park, 
but it's a very important 12 miles because the hills are such a challenge.

Please RSVP to me so I'll have enough water and gatorade for everyone.

Things to bring:
Stuff to change a flat tire
Water bottle (filled with your favorite beverage)
Food (fruit, power bars, whatever else)
Helmet
Bike
Yourself

Here's a map of the park.  Let me know if you have any questions.


Directions:
Take I-10 West to 71 West towards Lagrange/Austin
Travel down 71W about 50 miles.
Turn right onto Loop 150
Travel .7 miles
Turn right onto TXP1 (Park Road 1A)
You'll be at the entrance to the park.

Saturday - March 25

Dan Lyons' training ride series leading up to the MS150 continues this 
Saturday, March 25, as described below. The terrain will range from what Dan 
considers to be light hills, through moderately hilly to hilly, and the 
traffic on each ride will be light to moderate.  The rides will not be sagged 
(although each of the rides will have stores at various distances) and riders 
should come prepared with water, food and the equipment necessary to repair 
flat tires.  The goal will be to ride these rides at a pace between 14-16MPH 
and to get in a little hill work before the MS150.  Although prior commitment 
is not a requirement, Dan would appreciate some kind of a head count, so if 
you plan on doing one or more of these rides, please email him at

Ben, please find attached revision one to the UAE - Lowell, Massachusetts 
LM6000 simple cycle peaking facility, which is to be located at an existing, 
staffed cogen facility. 

The revisions are due to the following changes in assumptions:
1. Increased annual maintenance costs due to going from 4 to 5 LM6000PC 
Enhanced Sprints units being installed. This increases the CO + SCR units, 
compression capacity and the chiller capacity. Some consumables increase as 
well (test gases for CEMS, oils, greases, etc)
2. Chemical costs increased due to NOx emissions limit from 5 ppm to 2.5 ppm. 
Amount of aqueous ammonia changed from 46 lbs/hr to 76 lbs/hr (per Peerless, 
Inc. quote - they package the CO + SCR system using 19% solution, which keeps 
operator below EPA RMP threshold of 20%)
3. Reduced the staffing costs due to no allocation of labor being assumed 
from existing plant to peaking plant (per your discussion with UAE). Two O&M 
tech staff adds are shown to cover the peaking operation only.
4. Chemical costs increased due to more throughput required. Assuming a RO + 
mixed beds installation per Bruce Golden.
5. Increase in O&M Fee from $80M/yr to $100M/yr due to scope increase.
6. Major Maintenance dollar value increased in absolute terms due to adding 
one more GTG (fyi, $/fired hr stays the same).



Please call if you have questions or want to discuss further.

regards, Scot"

Here is a summary of my telephone conversation with Jay Hopper of KN Energy:

1.  KN has permitted its 550 MW Arkansas plant (and received its Entergy 
interconnection agreement) and is out for bid on tolling agreements.  They 
have two counterparties who have bid a 15 year tolling agreement --437 MW, 
mid 7,000 heat rate; 5.75 KW-mo.; 113 MW duct firing, 4.75 KW-mo.; 3.00 mill 
escalating variable O&M charge.  KN has also conducted construction bids. 
[For our LM-6000 activities, seeing all this information would be extremely 
valuable].

2.  KN has a draft air permit on its Jackson Michigan plant.  They will know 
in 45 days if approved.  All other permits received. Since this project was 
first in the cue when we last talked to KN, I suspect something negative has 
happened to slow it down.

3.  KN has sites in Oklahoma, Dallas and Chicago (4).  

4.  KN and another party have 6 7FA turbines for June '01 projects in 
Illinois.  KN supposedly controls the turbines.  I asked KN if they would be 
interested in doing deals in other states with these turbines.  They said 
possibly.  The other counterparty would need an equity participation in the 
end project.  I also told them that to the extent that they did Illinois 
projects, we could be of assistance to them on reg. cap. pricing and sales 
tax strategies.

5.  KN has sites in Ohio and Geary, Indiana where a coal affiliate would take 
back a 30 year 100 mw PPA for both sites.  Given this contract, KN may 
entertain doing a deal with a merchant component.

6.  I asked Jay how KN would be interested in ENA participating in these 
projects.  KN is not interested in taking too much commodity risk.  Hence, 
our proposal of doing a fixed price toll for 5 years and a floating index 
price for an additional 15 years would not be of interest to them (evidently 
Kinder laughed at the proposal; though in Jay's telephone message he 
indicated that Kinder was interested in the structure).  If there was a floor 
that covered debt service in the merchant years (along with some upside 
participation for KN--Jay threw out a 20% participation), then they would be 
interested in doing a deal.  

7.  They would also entertain selling a 50% or 100% interest in these 
projects.

8.  Jay told me that KN is looking to make a steady and predictable income 
from these plants.  Thus far, his group has not made any money.  My sense is 
that they are looking for money or a story (ENA name).  I would suggest 
taking a pass at purchasing the Arkansas plant (to get their attention and 
see their project information) in an effort to get involved in the 7FA and 
ECAR projects.  If KN does have a long-term tolling agreement, then would 
should be able to lay off a large portion of the financial risk associated 
with the Arkansas transaction.  We could also look at applying Don's 
structure to the Arkansas transaction.  Needless to say, the 7FAs slots, if 
real, would allow ENA to do something strategic in Florida and Iowa. "

Along with my conversations about the Calvert City projects, I also spoke to 
Paul Burdick about the following:

1.  Putting a peaker expansion at AES's announced Sayreville, N.J. plant.  He 
indicated that they would be interested but that there was an issue with 
transmission cue spots.  I asked if there was a certain maximum size that 
would allow for a quick interconnection.  He was going to check?  Do we know 
of any exceptions?

2.  I mentioned that we were developing a market based LD insurance product 
to Paul.  I walked him through the basics of mark-to-market accounting.  He 
was extremely interested.  He says that they have 4 tolling agreements that 
they would be interested in applying the product to (I believe that the 
agreements are all with Williams;  one of the agreements I believe already 
calls for market based LDs).  I told him that we would organize a 
presentation shortly. "

Mike:
My Dad has the tickets and is going to keep them with him.  He doesn't want
them to get lost in the mail.  We are staying in Cincinatti and are driving
over Sat and Monday for the games.  The best thing to do is meet at a
certain gate # or the ""will call window"".  I will call your Dad next week
and set things up on a meeting place before the game.  Leave me your Dad's
home number so I can call him next week.  These guys are going to have a
great time that weekend.  Talk to you soon.

Just some shocking news about Enron's fundraising stars.  Would you believe 
this?

 Dan Lyons -  $8810
He's not too far from doubling what he raised last year, and he has three 
weeks to go.

Ray Sylvester - $6000  

Jordan Hunter - $4500
Another huge increase over last year

I hope this is incentive for all of us to get cracking - we have a larger 
goal this year - $350,000, but I know we can do it.  I know there are more 
good stories out there in the pledging jungle, so shoot me a note and let me 
know how you're doing.  

I want to tell you about a new friend of mine.  I met her just last weekend.  
She has MS, diagnosed in 1996.  She walks very slowly with a cane and needed 
help negotiating her way across a thin throw rug on the floor.  When she 
found out about our bike ride she pledged $500 to me and let me know how 
important this activity is to her.  Research is very important, client 
services to MS patients are very important - giving them hope is very 
important, and that's what we do when we're out there raising money for their 
future.

My new friend asked me to pass along
 to each and every one of you her very grateful appreciation for all you 
do.   

If you have any fundraising questions, or I can help you in any way - please 
give me a call at 713-646-6569.

I am sending via fed ex a copy of the following info on Boston Gas/Colonial:

1. 11x17 map showing Tennessee routing through Colonial system
2. 8x14 map showing the various upgrades under discussion w/Boston Gas
3. recent information from Boston Gas on capacity/delivery pressure from BG.


Our understanding/expectation is that Tennessee will be increasing its line
pressure to accomadate potential back hauls now that Maritimes is tied in.  
The
expected pressure on TGP is expected to rise over 600 psi.  This will have a 
big
impact on deliverability.  Colonial serves ULP by drawing from Tennessee at
Tewksbury, and also has a LNG facility at that site.  In order to ensure that
LNG can always be injected into their system, BG needs to regulate pressure to
no more than 600psi at the city gate.  Currently the line is running from 
300psi
to 600psi throughout the year.

Can you confirm our assumptions?

We are looking at the various options, but clearly option 3 looks best.  We 
will
be sending follow up questions tomorrow on quality of service (pressure drop,
""firm"" service), throughput charges, and other clarifications.

We are asking BG for a meeting date next week, on either March 29 or 30; we
would like ENA to join us in these negotiations.  Let us know if these dates
work for you.

Lets discuss tomorrow once you receive this information.  "

Hello Again,

Most of may have thought that I jumped ship in Malaysia to become a beach
bum but unfortunately I didn't.  We just spent a long 4 weeks at sea that
was not easy.  It is more the boredom of routine that slows the time down.
The team was getting a bit touchy with each other and everyone needed a
break.  We pulled into Bahrain in the Persian Gulf and it was a good time to
recharge.  We all survived the break and are now back out in the Persian
Gulf.  We will in the Persian Gulf until the end of May.  The ship's
aircraft fly everyday over Southern Iraq enforcing Operation Southern Watch,
the No-Fly zone.  The aircraft have been engaged by surface-to-air missiles
and anti-aircraft artillery.  The aircraft then bomb them into oblivion with
laser guided bombs.  I have seen the footage and it is pretty devastating.
Still the Iraq's light up their gun radars, though.  The Cruiser and
Destroyers of the Battle Group are on a different mission which is the
Maritime Intercept Operation of the UN.  This is the enforcement of oil
embargoes on Iran and Iraq for UN sanctions.  The ships stop the freighters
or tankers and then send in Navy Seals or Marines to search the ship.  I
have seen the footage of this and it is unbelievable the instant
coordination that goes on.

Below is my adventure in Bahrain and some pictures to go with them.  See you
all in the summer!

After 4 long weeks out to sea the Stennis finally weighed anchor at the port
of Bahrain.  The whole team was very relieved to have a day off after 29
days straight of working 10-14 hour days.

Day 1
They called the liberty call at 10 AM, which is earlier then they have ever
called it. I was caught in the shower so I had to rush to finish up.  My
bags had been packed for days so I was able to catch up with the rest of the
team in the Hanger Bay.  They have a new system called a Smart Card system
that logs everyone in and out of the ship. This always causes a 10-15 minute
delay.  After this though there are always plenty of boats to take us pier
side.  We hopped on one and rode the 4 miles into the dock area.  It was a
heavily industrious harbor and the water, though warm, looked a bit
polluted.  Tons of jellyfish were also seen throughout the water.  We then
walked about a half-mile down the pier and into the American Naval Base that
was there.  The gates and barricades to this place were heavier then the
White House and more heavily defended.  For most of the ship, they were not
granted overnight liberty and so the base would the focus of there
relaxation. There were bars setup and all sorts of activities planned.  We
caught a cab to our hotel, the Le Meridien that was the nicest in Bahrain
and had its own private beach.  The hotel was like an oasis in the desert
because it was outside the main city of Manama and surrounded by scrub
desert.  At the gate of the hotel an armed guard with a machine gun searched
the trunk of the cab.  Inside the hotel there were all Saudi's. It was the
end of the Hajj, their most religious time of the year, and they all come to
Bahrain to drink, smoke, and do other sins against Allah.  The whole ship
was told explicitly to stay out of their way by the XO of the ship.  Our
rooms weren't ready so we dumped our bags and went out to the pool caf, for
some lunch.  Lunch was a huge buffet spread that had shwarma's, Persian
rice, and all sorts of good Mid East food. We ate and drank for a couple of
hours.  I then got my room and changed to go to the beach.  The beach was
man-made and enclosed by a lagoon where I sat in the sun the rest of the
afternoon.  At 7PM some of us met to go get some drinks before dinner.  We
walked to the Trader Vic's next to the hotel and found it open but empty.
They apparently don't believe in happy hour.  We had some drinks and ate
there.  At 11 PM we left there to go meet up with some people from the ship
at an Irish Pub. They had Guinness on tap so I was happy.  We followed most
of the pilots from the Stennis to the Warbler that had a band that rocked
until 2 AM.  We then returned exhausted to the hotel and after making some
embarrassing late night calls (which of course is daytime in the States) to
friends, I went to sleep.
Day 2
The second day started much later as I was sleeping spread eagle on my king
sized bed and didn't want to leave it-ever.  I stumbled to the beach with a
headache and sat on the beach for the entire afternoon.  The 4weeks at sea
had apparently wiped out my tolerance.  I walked around the lagoon and took
it easy.  Since I realized that most restaurant did not start the food
service until 9 PM I decided to eat a late lunch at 4 PM which consisted of
the same incredible buffet as the day before.  We all met up in the club
level of the hotel around 8 PM for drinks before we decided to eat.  I was
not feeling to great but decided to join some of the people who were going
to the Italian restaurant that was located inside the hotel.  This was an
exceptional place where the food was very good.  The Veal Milanese rivaled
the best I have had in the States.  I felt much better after that and was
willing to join the rest of the group going out to a nightclub.  The
nightclub turned out to be pretty dead and at 2AM we called it a night.
Day 3
I woke up around 12PM and again had to fight to get out of bed.  I had set
my A/C to very cold and was buried under many soft blankets.  I met up with
a few people and ate lunch at the caf, on the beach. We then walked over to
the lagoon and sat on the beach over there for the rest of the afternoon.
The best thing about it was that there was a golfcart that drove around with
drinks and snacks for everyone.  I read my book and dozed most of the
afternoon.   The sun was never particular strong the whole time we were
there which I think was do to the amount of dust from the Saudi desert 30
miles across the Persian Gulf.  It reduces visibility across the entire Gulf
and into Iran.  3 of us decided to do the tourist thing in Bahrain later in
the afternoon.  The only thing we were told to go see was this new mall that
was built.  To me it was just like seeing any other mall except it was a
little smaller then US malls.  I didn't buy anything but it was interesting
to look at prices that were about double US standards.  You can haggle for
any price including a pair of socks but you couldn't get them to US prices.
Everything on Bahrain is imported because it is an island.  Upon returning
to the hotel around 8PM we met up with a group that was going to the
Lebanese restaurant inside the hotel.  This was also rated the best in
Bahrain.  It was quite a feast with 5 main courses spread from 10 PM until 2
AM with bellydancers and singers entertaining everyone.  It was in a huge
tent with beautiful Persian carpets everywhere.  I never ate so much and had
a great time. I literally rolled into bed.
Day 4
Our last day since we had to get back on the ship tonight.  Liberty expired
at 6 AM in the morning and it too much of a hassle to try and go in the AM.
I woke up and spent most of the day doing PwC paperwork by dialing in.
There were hundreds of junk emails to toss out and maybe 5 real messages
over 4 weeks of no connection.  I had the usual time and expense Nazis
screaming at me to sign timesheets.  After 3 months and multiple
explanations they still don't get that I have no connectivity.  I can't wait
to see that appear on my GCF.  I got most of what I needed done.  I then
needed to get my watch fixed and set out to find an Omega dealer in Bahrain.
After following at least 6 peoples directions to places they swore were
there, I gave up and would wait until Dubai.  Dubai is a larger city and has
multiple Omega dealers.  For our final meal we decided to again stay at the
hotel.  There was an excellent Indian restaurant in the hotel.  I couldn't
tell you the Indian name for the food I ordered but it was curry chicken and
a basmati rice/lamb combination.  Again I ate way too much and had to roll
out of there.  We packed up and headed to ship around 10 PM.

All in all it was great to get away from the ship for a couple of days after
the 4-week binge.  Bahrain doesn't have much to it and is basically
supported by all the Saudi's who drive across every weekend to party.  The
American base is tiny there.  I am glad the next 3 stops in the Persian Gulf
will be Dubai.  I was also told that Dubai has better values on gold and
rugs.  From now on all of our at-sea-periods will be around two weeks, Thank
God!

Greetings, Mr. Rogers

I am quite pleased to learn of your continuing interest in the program.

I wish you the very best in your renewed efforts to improve your application
profile.  If you have not already done so, I would recommend that you
explore with GMAC the options they might offer to assist you in addressing
the demands of your disability during the exam experience.

As for a meeting with me - that is certainly possible, but I would ask you
delay your visit till sometime later this summer.  As you might expect, this
is a very busy time for the TEXASMBA admissions staff -- and much of my
focus and energies will be elsewhere for the rest of this spring.

Carl

Dr. Harris:
     I would like to thank you for personally taking the time to closely
review
my application. Though I am disappointed with the results I am still
determined
to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of Business next year.  I understand how
competitive the process has become, but I felt that with my work
experiences,
recommendations, personality, extracurricular activities, etc. that this
would
compensate for my disability.  After talking with Professors Titman, Ronn,
Brown
and Jemison, I was sure that the School was the right place to get the
education
I was looking for.
     I am still certain that the School is the best place for getting a
great
graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do
whatever
it takes to get in next year.  I plan on taking two or three graduate level
finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to
demonstrate
to the Admissions committee that I can compete at the graduate level. I also
plan on retaking the GMAT test.  Due to my disability, this will be a
monumental
task; but I am determined to prove to the Committee that I can be successful
at
The TEXAS Graduate School of Business.  I would like to come down to Austin
this
spring to meet with you to further discuss my application file and to
personally
meet you.
      If you think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall
application file for next year, please let me know.  Take care and hope to
hear
from you soon.

Sincerely,

Ben Rogers

Dr. Harris:
 In my pursuit to strengthen my application profile for next year I have 
explored taking two graduate level night courses this summer and I wanted to 
know what courses the admissions committee would suggest that I take this 
summer.  I wanted to make sure that I was taking the courses that were most 
appropriate with regards to my application. Just to let you know, I was 
planning on taking two finance courses.  Thanks in advance for your 
suggestion with this matter.  
 I was in Austin yesterday for the completion of the MS 150 Bike ride, but 
was not able to stick around.  Hope all is going well and hope to hear from 
you soon.

I spoke to Jay Hopper again at KN.  Here are the results of my conversation:

1.  Entergy Project--I told Jay that our immediate interest would be to 
purchase the Jackson project with the outside tolling bid in place.  Given 
their immediate focus is to finalize the tolling agreement for the project, 
he suggested that we revisit this topic in 3 months.  He sounded a bit 
nervous.  Perhaps there is an opportunity to swoop in later.

2.  ECAR Projects--Because these projects are 4th and 5th in their cue, he 
would like to discuss our involvement at a later date.

3.  7FA versus 7EA turbines--It turbines out that KN's Illinois turbines are 
7EAs (six of them).  I told him that we would still be interested in making a 
joint venture proposal for the turbines to them.  He is going to have Chuck 
Walker from his Chicago office call me. "

I have attached the pitch book.  I think its a good start.  I didn't get
into the proposals as much, but we can kick that around in more detail.

 I think the more important thing is who (as in exact individuals) gets the
sales pitch.   This will be the key to getting a major deal completed.

Call me with questions, I'll be in and out the today and Monday.  On Tuesday
I start my journey across the country.  If you need me those days call me at
my home number and my wife will relay the messages to me.

Ben, please find attached revision two to the UAE - Lowell, Massachusetts 
LM6000 simple cycle peaking facility, which is to be located at an existing, 
staffed cogen facility. 

The second revisions are due to the following changes in assumptions:
1.  Further reduced the staffing costs due to no allocation of labor being 
assumed from existing plant to peaking plant and the addition of only ONE 
tech to cover the expansion O&M (per your discussion with UAE). 
2.  Restated the Annual Routine Maintenance costs components of FOM and VOM 
to 75% FOM and 25% VOM.



Please call if you have questions or want to discuss further.

regards, Scot"

Here is the latest Kinder-Morgan update from Scott.  As you know, these guys 
have alot of generation and are under pressure to get several projects done 
soon.  I also think that your price risk management structure would be a good

Levelized capacity payment (starting 6/1/02)
10 yr deal (Best term)
 - @mid curve: $6.21/kw-mo
 - @offer curve: $9.84/kw-mo
12 yr deal
 - @mid curve:  $6.23/kw-mo (due to curve shift since last time, compared to 
$6.10)
 - @offer curve: $9.90/kw-mo (due to curve shift since last time, compared to 
$9.65) 

Levelized capacity payment (starting 6/1/03)
8 yr deal (Best term)
 - @mid curve:  $5.98/kw-mo
 - @offer curve: $9.69/kw-mo
11 yr deal
 - @mid curve:  $6.04/kw-mo
 - @offer curve: $9.81/kw-mo 

This result comes mainly from upward shaping gas curve. Although I don't know 
exactly what pricing the trade will give to us for 8yr deal starting 6/1/03 
(best term), I can get the quote, if you want. Please see attached 
spreadsheet for complete analysis. Can we think of any other optionality 
other than term play? Let's sit down when you have time.

Quick question:

Do the heat rates you have in your spreadsheet change with the addition of 
chillers?  We are looking at an LM6000 deal in Entergy in which the customer 
would add chillers (no cost to us) and I wonder if this changes heat rate.  
Thanks for your time,

Claire

Basically, having chillers in the project (running at full load) will 
increase the Heat Rate by approximately 50 degrees (ie. if HR is 10,465 w/o 
chillers to 10,409 w chillers).  Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Santee Cooper O&M Estimate, Revision 1

George and Webb, please find attached revision one to the Santee Cooper O&M 
cost estimate. It is for mobilization and operating period O&M services for 
one gas fired, 5 x LM6000 simple cycle peaking facility located at the 
Georgia and South Carolina border. 


The revision made adjustments to the following:
      Rev 0   Rev 1
Mobilization fee     $90,000   $200,000
Annual Operating fee    $160,000  $250,000
Annual Maintenance cost Estimate  $405,000  $593,000
Mobilization Labor cost (adjusted benefits) $175,000  $193,000
Annual Labor cost (adjusted benefits)  $406,000  $450,000
Initial Spare Parts    $1,320,000  $1,300,000

My reasoning is this:
1. After consulting with OEC, the previous fees were not believed to be at 
""market"".
2. Annual Maintenance was recalculated after having more time to do a bottom 
up estimate.
3. Mob and annual labor costs changed due to a change in OEC benefits 
calculations.
4. Initial spares rounded down.

As we discussed, the GT major maintenance is scheduled to occur in year 18 of 
an 18 year term. 

Please provide your comments.

regards, Scot

Attached please find the 2000 Weekly cost reports.  



Please make note that there are upward forecast changes with respect to the 
Nepco reimbursables.  In the case of Lincoln center Nepco increased their 
Current Forecast over the last few months to $11million over original 
budget.  Dave Kristich has been and is currently in the process of reviewing 
and questioning every line item in all scope changes.  According to Dave, the 
Nepco forecast will be coming down once he has had a chance to do a complete 
analysis and Nepco has had a chance to revise/correct the scope changes.


Mike,
Through 12/99 ENA has paid Nepco $30.7 million in reimbursable dollars, with 
Nepco showing actuals of $6 million spent through 11/99.  Essentially ENA has 
fronted Nepco $24 million to cover December's bills.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.  Thanks Amy 3-7805"

It's not too late to train for the MS(180), regardless of what some people 
have told you - and if you're struggling with the ""whole"" reality of actually 
getting all the way to Austin - just think of it as 10 miles at a time.  That 
will get you there.  Another tool is visualizing - every night before you go 
to sleep, shut your eyes and visualize yourself on your little bike, going 
across the map from Houston to Austin - over and over and over.  It works!  
I've done it!

If virtual training won't be enough, get out this weekend on your bike - and 
here's some great ideas for you.  Of course, we have the Tour deCypress, but 
don't try to keep up with CHARLA REESE - she got a brand new bike and she is 
SMOKIN.'   This is a great ride - the first 40 miles is wonderfully scenic, 
and that last 40 miles is great resistance training in the wind.

Sunday  - April 2 - 7:30 AM - 50, 62 or 85 miles
Cypress Spring High School - FM 529 and Fry Road  
Sponsor: Northwest Cyclery - 713-622-1240

Saturday - April 1 - 8:00 AM - 32, 45 or 63 miles   (HBC ride)

Cypress-Prairie View - Flat roads through ranching and rice farming country 
around Waller and Hockley.  Very little traffic.  Eat after the ride at The 
Kettle at US290 & FM1960.  MEET:  29 miles NW on US-290 to Cypress-Rosehill 
Road, north 2 miles to Huffmeister.  Park in HL&P's parking lot on west side 
- farthest from the building.  Ride Starter:  David Dick @ 713-781-6052.

Sunday - April 2 - 8:00 AM - 40 or 62 miles

Chappell Hill - One of the prettier rides for wildflowers in the spring.  The 
short route heads north on FM1155 for 7.5 miles to the stop sign at FM2193, 
then heads east on FM1155 another 12 miles to Washington on the Brazos State 
Park.  The long route turns left at the stop sign, travels west on FM2193 and 
takes a winding route through some minor hills before ending up at the 
Washington on the Brazos.  There are bathroom facilities and water/soft 
drinks available at the park.  MEET:  Take Highway 290 from Houston, about 65 
miles (12 miles past Hempstead) until you come to the flashing light at the 
intersection of Highway 290 and FM1155.  There's a sign that says ""Chappell 
Hill"" to the right.  Turn right on FM1155 and go about 1 mile to the center 
of town.  The 2nd street on the right is ""Poplar.""  Take a right and go a 
block or two past the church and park on the side road connecting Poplar and 
Providence.

Happy Pedaling!   Amelia

I was informed today by Rochester that they will not be working with Enron 
(or General Electric) on the LM-6000 Project.  The following are key points:


1.  Based on a GE evaluation of the site, the total net output of a new 
LM-6000 with Sprint Package is 42.2 Mw at average site conditions (79 degrees 
@ 1,006').

2.  Rochester had initially thought they would need 25 Mw and Enron could 
re-market the balance until Rochester's load growth utilized the balance.  
Rochester had initially considered an LM-2500 (25 Mw) and was not in favor of 
a larger machine becasue they thought the incremental 20-25 megawatts would 
cost in the $6MM to $8MM range.  Enron's proposal absorbed Rochester's risk 
of the incremental megawatts and Rochester was very interested in our 
concept.   Subsequent to our discussions with Rochester and providing a 
couple of proposals, the formal bidding process on the turbines indicated 
that the cost of the incremental Megawatts above their 25 Mw requirement was 
only approximately $1.4MM.  In fact, the cost of the last 10 Mw was only $1MM.

3.  Rochester choose to utilize the Pratt & Whitney FT-8 (Twin Pak) turbine.  
This machine yields 52 Mw (net) at site conditions and the extra 10 Mw over 
the 42 Mw provided by the LM-6000 was only an incremental $1MM.  Rochester 
says the cost of the 52 Mw will be approximately $13.1 MM or $253/Kw.  
Installation cost would be additional. (Note: ENA's bid for the LM-6000 at 42 
Mw was $14MM and GE was at $14.2MM

4.  Rochester's board instructed them not to enter into any long term 
arrangments where they would have to sign long term PPA's etc.  Rochester 
will look to have the P&W turbine installed and will market the additional 
Megawatts on a day to day and month to month basis.


Thanks to everyone for their efforts on this prospect.  Please pass the above 
information on to anyone who would benefit from this technical and 
competitive feedback.

I talked to Tom Swank this morning on UAE and he feels that we need to have 
Nepco still send out their best EPC number to UAE.  Tom said he can buy some 
time from UAE, so that Nepco can send out the number the middle of next 
week.  I talked to Bruce this morning and he was having Nepco continue to put 
information together on UAE.  Thanks!

Here is the UAE transaction structure I discussed with the accountants:

1.  UAE to execute a financial gas contract which is highly in our favor 
(large to market value) with a buyout provision equal to our targeted option 
premium ($4-6 million).  UAE can cancel the contract by a defined date by 
forfeiting their $4-6 million deposit/option premium.  We should be able to 
mark the deposit because it is our worst case payment.  UAE should be 
motivated to cancel the contract because it will be out of the money to them.

2.  UAE to negotiate a purchase agreement for the turbines.  This purchase 
agreement will be conditioned upon the execution of a tolling agreement under 
defined terms and upon UAE making an initial payment for the turbines by a 
defined date in the future (one of the dates discussed at our meeting).  Up 
until this date, the turbine purchase agreement shall be cancellable at no 
cost to UAE.

The gas contract should be markable as long as it is delinked to the turbine 
purchase agreement.  We can capture the effective of an option in the turbine 
purchase agreement by making it cancellable at no cost up to some defined 
date.

What do you think?"

almost complete,  but if you can clean it up that would be great.   I will 
need 8 coler copies and bound. Please give me a call before you have someone

Enron recently introduced its Global Information System (GIS) as the first of 
a series of activities designed to enhance and improve the accuracy and 
accessibility of employee data. 4,578 employees responded and provided 
up-to-date information on themselves.  This represents a response of 
approximately 55% of the employees asked to participate. 

 Accurate data will play an important role in several key company-wide 
initiatives in the coming months, such as the SAP implementation and an 
expert directory, which will include a new on-line phone directory and 
employee skills.

The GIS provides you a vehicle to use in updating your personal information 
including your phone extension, office location, home address, current job 
responsibilities, as well as, existing skills and educational background.   
You are the best source of accurate information about you!  

Since you have not yet updated your information, I urge you to do so today.  
The GIS system will be available for your use through Friday, March 31.



You can access GIS from the Enron Intranet in one of two ways:
1. from the Enron Home page (home.enron.com)
2. from the HRWeb Home page (hrweb.enron.com)
Look for the link to GIS in the ""New"" section of either page.

As a first time user, please click on the ""New User"" button to enter your ID 
and set your password.  Your individual login ID is either your SSN (Social 
Security Number) or your SIN (Social Insurance Number - Canada).  To prevent 
someone from accessing or altering your GIS file without authorization, 
please keep your ID and password private.

You can contact the HRIS Helpdesk at (713) 853-5666, option #1 for 
application assistance.

Please update your personal GIS file by FRIDAY, MARCH 31.

MS150 Team Enron 2000 Meeting
Wednesday,  April 5
5:00 - 7:00 PM
Enron Building Conf Room 5C2

Park in the Allen Center garage, and proceed on the third floor walkway from 
the garage to the Enron Building, 1400 Smith.  Check in with security and 
they will have all your names listed.  
5C2 is just off the elevator on the 5th floor.

At this meeting you'll be able to pick up your newly designed 2000 Enron 
jersey.  Becky Pham and Stephanie Strong are in charge of the jerseys.  If 
you can't be there, please contact either of them by email: sstrong@enron.com 
or bpham@enron.com or call them 713-853-1653 or 713-345-7094 to reserve your 
size and make arrangements for pickup.  

Our guests are Jeff Nielsen and Trey Richardson, West U. Schwinn.  They will 
conduct a stretching/fitness clinic as well as a bike repair clinic.  Great 
time to ask anything you want to know about your bike from the experts.  This 
is a totally informal meeting - come and meet us and ask your questions, and 
get your jersey!

In case you're wondering about picking up your rider packet at this meeting, 
we do not have those available - we only had one opportunity for our team 
pickup from MS and that was last Friday.  If you showed up that day and 
turned in your pledge sheet but were told that your packet was not here, it 
will be provided to us and we will get it to you.  If you are not in that 
category, please plan to pick up your packet at one of the designated packet 
pickup points in your rider manual which I've listed below for your 
convenience.  (We are going to try and work out our own registration process 
for next year to cut out this confusion - we apologize for any inconvenience 
this has caused, and let me know if you feel that your rider packet is 
dangling.  Most of them that were left out have been delivered to you.  My 
phone number is 713-646-6569.)

Here's the remaining packet pickup locations:

KINGWOOD
Wednesday - April 5
5:00 to 8:00 pm
AJ Foyt Isuzu
22575 Highway 59 North

INNER LOOP HOUSTON
Saturday - April 8
10:00 am to 4:00 pm
The Home Depot #566
West Loop South @ Southwest Freeway

Monday - April 3
4:00 to 8:00 pm
Hooters
Kirby @ Southwest Freeway

SOUTHWEST HOUSTON
Wednesday - April 12
5:00 to 8:00 pm
McKinzey Bond Isuzu

If you miss all of these, you can still pick up at the Westside Marriott 
(MS150 headquarters hotel) at I-10 & Eldridge, on April 14 from 3:00 to 10:00 
pm, and while you're there, you can carbo-load on the pasta buffet and visit 
the Bike Expo - a good way to get ""pumped"" for the ride, pick up some good 
buys - be sure to visit Jeff Nielsen at the West U. Schwinn booth to thank 
him for all his support for the Enron team this year!"

There was an error in the distribution process in the previous memo which 
caused parts of the text to be omitted .  The following is the correct 
message.

The memo below is from our legal group pointing out some lessons we learned 
from our restructure experiences last year.  We fully support the conclusions 
stated in the memo and hope that we can learn from these experiences to 
improve our approach to new transactions.



TO: Cliff Baxter DATE: March 29, 2000

FROM: Mark Haedicke
  Julia Heintz Murray
  Lisa Mellencamp 

RE:  Lessons Learned in the Restructure Group 

 
Establish Benchmarks.  Establish benchmarks for terms and conditions expected 
in debt and security instruments to ensure standard and adequate lender 
protections in the downside case.  The use of non-standard terms and 
conditions negotiated into our documents has made it more difficult to act 
quickly, has increased the legal time and expense involved, has affected the 
liquidity of our investments in the distressed market and has opened the door 
to disagreements with respect to interpretation of provisions in the 
documents.  Non-standard terms and conditions give the other side room to 
argue, where more standard provisions, with more standard and universal 
interpretations, would not.
Approval Process.  Make certain that the approval process highlights and 
justifies deviations from the benchmarks, allows for an examination of the 
pricing of the transaction based on any increased risk as a result of those 
deviations and evaluates any increased legal risk in the downside case.
Hold Firm in Negotiations.  Be tougher in our negotiations of the transaction 
documents after the basic business deal is cut.  We start with a number of 
provisions that get negotiated out when we could hold firm and obtain what we 
need and want.  Deviations from the approved deal should go back through the 
system.
Evaluate for Downside Case.  Evaluate our documents carefully for the 
downside case and price for what controls and options we will have.  What can 
we do if things go south?  See if additional protections or leverage can be 
built into the documentation.  For example, a second lien position gives 
leverage in the downside case.  Also, we should look at preferred equity 
positions with debt-like features.
Prompt Exercise of Remedies.  Be prepared to exercise our remedies quickly 
and to actually do it.  In certain instances verbal waivers have been granted 
without going through any approval process.  Also, we have given waivers too 
easily in some instances which has resulted in other creditors and investors 
receiving more favorable treatment.
Use of Directors.  Consider carefully the use of Enron employees as 
directors.  In some instances having Enron employees as directors on boards 
of companies in which Enron has invested as an equity owner and/or has 
provided financing has hampered our ability to trade our investments and to 
take certain actions that might be in our interest but not the company's 
interest.
Trading Contracts.  Limit the instances when we grant security interests in 
our trading contracts or contractually tie up in any way our ability to 
terminate our trading contracts.  If we do, evaluate carefully the language 
used and have the trading experts involved.  Evaluate carefully the hedging 
strategies employed by the companies in which we invest.  Reevaluate the use 
of master netting agreements.
Use of Proceeds.  Establish tighter use of proceeds provisions.  If we are 
making a significant investment, we need to make sure that the funds are used 
for the designated purposes.  Consider in some instances parceling out the 
dollars as certain hurdles are met.
Proforma Compliance Certificates.  Eliminate disputes about financial 
covenant interpretations and calculations by having proforma compliance 
certificates required as a condition to closing and having the business 
people work through the calculations prior to closing, not after a dispute 
has arisen.
Evaluate Distressed Investments.  Evaluate all the components of our 
distressed investments as a package to see what is in the best interests of 
Enron as a whole and to coordinate strategies.
Pricing.  Evaluate carefully the proposed pricing of a transaction.  Are we 
being adequately paid for our risk?  If the deal does not conform to our 
benchmarks, are we being paid for the deviations?"

Ben, please find attached the preliminary cost estimate for full O&M services 
provided at one greenfield, stand alone 2 x LM6000 PC Sprint simple cycle 
power project located at St Peter, Illinois. The project is assumed to be 
100% gas-fired and operating 1,600 hrs per year in the months of May through 
September. The staffing plan does not anticipate operations during the other 
months of the year. The tentative schedule is NTP 9/00 and COD 6/01. Ameren 
is to own and operate.



A couple of questions:
1. Where is Ameren's headquarters located, i.e. the home office where their 
O&M staff would get their admin, technical support?
2. Who will own and operate the same plant that Spectrum is building 20 miles 
to the north of St Peter?

Please review and call should you have questions or comments.

regards, Scot"

I will not be sending out a cost summary or draw schedule this week for the 
99 Peakers since there was no change from the prior week's reports.  Next 
week I will be issuing the Final 1999 Cost Summary and Draw Schedule.  Please 
call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Don,

I had a meeting with Davis Thames from Global Finance group this morning. 
Basically, he did not agree with your (old) structure. He walked me through 
on his concerns in detail. For some critical points, I don't necessarily 
agree with his argument such as probability & volatility assumptions of the 
curve. He thought we don't have that at all in our valuation method. I will 
talk to Yvan tomorrow morning to find out exact structure/valuation method 
and let you know the result. It might happen because Davis didn't get the 
update on latest/revised structure. Thank you.

Coming back to browse through our notes on why we do this crazy thing called 
the MS150, we find that the primary inspiration is to assist the MS Society 
in its mission to encourage and provide for the needs of MS patients and give 
them the hope of endless possibilities.

PEDAL FOR PARTNERS is a new program this year designed to help MS patients 
feel part of the trek.  It creates a bond with them that is much appreciate 
and it gives them hope to know that we're out there.  Those who could ride,  
would ride, and some of those who can't are waiting at the finish line in 
Austin to tell you how much it meant to them to see you come in on your bike.

IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO WEAR A RIBBON ON YOUR RIDE WHICH HAS BEEN SIGNED BY AN 
MS PATIENT, IT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.  THAT PERSON'S ADDRESS IS 
PROVIDED ALONG WITH THE RIBBON SO THAT WHEN YOU GET BACK YOU CAN MAIL IT TO 
THE INDIVIDUAL FOR WHOM YOU RODE.

You can pick one up at the meeting tomorrow, get one from me in 3AC3120, 
Stephanie Strong at EB2414, or Becky Pham at EB2422A.  For you non-Enron 
riders, if you'll let us know this week, we can mail it to you."

Look at this great idea that Kelly Strader and Charla Reese ""cooked up.""    
Charla made the arrangements for us, and she says that reservations are not 
required.  I hope you can all make it, and if you do, what will Jimmy do with 
all of us?  That's his problem - he invited us!  I'll send a reminder next 
week.

Okay, team!  This is your last chance to train, and what an opportunity to 
train with Dan Lyons who knows the ropes and wants to help you train.  Not 
only that.....he's good for a laugh.  The guy who loves Hawaiin shirts and 
loves to cycle - interesting combination.  He's also a big-league fundraiser, 
and has now just crossed the $20,000 mark.  My wish for you is that you get 
to $6,000 so that you can can enjoy the Tour of Champions in Sedona with Dan 
and the gang.  It'll be a trip you'll never forget -- the mountain biking 
maybe -- but the Hawaiin shirts never!  100 miles or 50 miles - your choice 
for this weekend.

Saturday - April 8

    1. The 100-mile ride will start at 8:00 AM sharp from Tomball Middle 
School/Jr. High on FM2920(which is the main street of Tomball) about a mile 
east of TX249. To get there either take TX 249 north to FM 2920 and turn 
right and go about a mile east or take I45 North to FM 2920 and go west until 
you hit Tomball and go through town to the start point.  It will go north 
through Egypt and Honea up to Montgomery and then north and west to Richards 
in Grimes County via the Sam Houston National Forest.  It will then loop west 
and south coming back via Dacus and Dobbin.  This century will get you ready 
for the big ride. 

   2. The main ride will be a fairly hilly century, designed to get you ready 
for the150 the following weekend, but the map provided at the start will also 
show a 50 mile route that is only lightly hilled.

P.S. - Dan won't be in the office this week, so if you have any questions, 
too bad!  Just kidding - call me and I'll see if I can help.
                 
Saturday - April 8 - Official MS150 Training Ride

Bike Barn Clear Lake - 8:00 AM - 50 & 80 miles
Bike Barn: 281-332-6433
Bike Barn: 281-472-6651

AND AS A GRAND FINALE TO THE WEEKEND, WHY NOT DO ""RIDE FOR THE ROSES' IN 
AUSTIN ON SUNDAY, APRIL 9?

Ride for the Roses was started 3 years ago to honor Lance Armstrong's return 
from cancer and benefits the Lance Armstrong Foundation.  It starts at 7:00 
AM at the Travis County Expo Center at 7311 Decker Lane in Austin, and you 
can get more information on their website......www.laf.org.  It is 10 to 100 
miles.  Attached is the registration form.

 The meeting Don and I had with Kinder/Morgan to discuss his Price Risk 
Management Product went really well.  We met with Park Schaper (CFO), Anthony 
Lannie (President of Power Group) and Jay Hopper (VP and General Manager) was 
on the phone from Denver.  They were very interested with regards to 
potentially replacing long term tolling agreements with this product.  Enron 
could provide a five year toll and the product would begin in the sixth year 
through year 15 or 20.  
 We talked very little about their existing projects; Little Rock and 
Michigan.  They do have all the permits for the Little Rock site and are 
moving forward with the Michigan site and still do not have any tolling 
agreements in place for those projects. 
 The ball is currently in their court and were going to get back with Scot 
with respects to the projects and with Tom on the PRM Product.  Please let me 
know if you have any questions with this matter.  Thanks!

Just wanted to point out some very important people who are riding on our 
team:

ALL 378 OF YOU !!


Some of us are better known than others, however, and you may enjoy knowing 
that you're riding with:

Jeff Skilling, President & Chief Operating Officer of Enron
Wendy Gramm, Enron Board Member and wife of Senator Phil Gramm
Pauline Chiou - Channel Two Morning News (the early-bird MS150 rookie)
Judge Robert Eckels (don't bother him with your parking tickets- he will be 
busy surviving) 
Judge Mike Fields (the man with a mission - has a very good friend with M.S.)
Senator Phil Gramm's entire staff (back for the third year.  If '98 didn't 
scare them off, nothing will.)

And here's the latest team list - be sure to let me know if we're missing 
anyone!
We have 378 registered and 366 riding!

Mike, Ben,
I had sent both models but just noticed that they didn't go through as they 
were too large.  So you'll get this in two parts.
Here is Winston Cheng's model.  In Kate's view it would be better to use 
Winston's model as it incorporates the intrinsic and extrinsic valuation 
elements and the curves, but also covers the US tax situation (plus she says 
it is MORE SOPHISTICATED...!).

Our model will follow by another note.

One of the two models.  I think the other  one is Winston Chang's model (San 
Francisco office).

Here is the Moore Project model.

I did give Winston a call on using his model and of course he was fine with 
it.  Maybe please give him a call to confirm.  Thanks.

It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of eCommerce will ha=
ve=20
a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad=
=20
array of industries.  Through EnronOnLine, Enron has quickly become a major=
=20
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries. =
=20
EnronOnLine has been an enormous success since its launch.  Since launch, w=
e=20
have completed 67,043 transactions on line, with a total dollar value of ov=
er=20
$25 billion.  EnronOnLine is now the largest eCommerce site in the world.

We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very=
=20
specific reason.  In addition to providing a web-based platform for=20
transactions, Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the=20
site.  We stand ready at all times, in any market conditions, to buy and se=
ll=20
at the posted price.  This converts a =01&bulletin board=018 (the more typi=
cal=20
eCommerce concept) into a true market.  There are very few, if any,=20
competitors that can provide this capability.

We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be=20
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies.  If we are=
=20
correct, this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enro=
n.

Accordingly, we are initiating a major new effort to capture this=20
opportunity.  Effective today we are creating a new business, Enron Net=20
Works, to pursue new market development opportunities in eCommerce across a=
=20
broad range of industries.  It is likely that this business will ultimately=
=20
be our fifth business segment, joining transmission & distribution,=20
wholesale, retail and broadband services.

Included in this business will be our entire IT and technology group along=
=20
with significant talent and resources in market making and finance. =20
Initially, North America will provide primary direct support for staff=20
services and back office, however, over time we will be requesting support=
=20
services from virtually all Enron units to ensure continued growth and=20
success.  To facilitate the combining of commercial capabilities with these=
=20
new eCommerce platforms, Enron Net Works will work closely with the merchan=
t=20
functions of North America, Europe, South America, CALME, Asia and Broadban=
d.

Enron Net Works will be headed by Greg Whalley, Chief Executive Officer; Mi=
ke=20
McConnell, Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff McMahon, Chief Commercial=20
Officer.  These individuals will comprise the Office of the Chairman for=20
Enron Net Works and remain on the Executive Committee of Enron Corp. =20
Replacing Greg Whalley as President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron=20
North America is Dave Delainey, who will also join Enron=01,s Executive=20
Committee.

Global Technology will remain intact but will now be a part of Enron Net=20
Works.  It will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did =
as=20
an Enron global function.  Philippe Bibi will remain the Chief Technology=
=20
Officer for all of Enron Corp. and continues to be responsible for the=20
development of worldwide technology standards and platforms.

EnronOnLine, headed by Louise Kitchen, will also remain intact and will now=
=20
be a part of Enron Net Works.  The success of EnronOnLine enables us to=20
utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets. In addition, the=

current eCommerce initiatives: Harry Arora, Public Financial Securities; Ja=
y=20
Fitzgerald, New Markets Identification; Bruce Garner, Metals; and Greg Pipe=

Over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational=20

We are now the ""ENRON 400"" and have been officially notified that we have 
earned first position in the Super Team Start.  That means we are the very 
first out the gate again this year!  AWESOME !  Thanks to all of you for your 
recruiting efforts. We've gained 125 riders from last year.  MEET YOUR TEAM 
IN THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF TULLY STADIUM.  

To start this adventure, just show up with your bike and all your gear at 
Tully Stadium, I-10 & Dairy Ashford no later than 6:00 AM on Saturday, the 
15th.  The feeder road going east on I-10 from Dairy Ashford leads you to 
Tully Toad, dedicated as a one-way street that morning.  Turn right onto 
Tully and enter Tully Stadium grounds in the first 3 gates.  No vehicles of 
any kind  will be allowed into the parking lot from Dairy Ashford, so save 
yourself some time and just follow the crowd in from the feeder road.   
Please park your vehicle and then go ask questions if needed so that you 
don't jam up the entrance.  There are 3 drop-off points for your luggage.  
Each rider should have 2 luggage tags which are the same numbers as your 
helmet and bike numbers.

6:15 AM Team Picture (Southeast Corner of Parking Lot - in the Stadium)
6:30 AM Stage for Exit (Northwest Corner of Parking Lot)
7:00 AM The ""Enron 400"" out the gate!

(You have a Tully Stadium map in your rider manual)

The Top Team Start will be at 7:00 AM, staging at 6:30 AM, and it's very 
important to be there on time.  If you're not in the staging area in time for 
our start, you'll be stuck back with the crowd and it could take you as long 
as two hours to get out the gate.  Allow enough time to park, unload luggage, 
and get geared up, remembering that the freeway will be jammed up even that 
early.   We want you there for the team picture, and we don't want to leave 
without you, so please be there plenty early (I recommend arriving at 5:30 
AM).  Please wear your Enron jersey the first day.  This helps us to quickly 
identify who should be starting with us.  I did consent to let five IZUZU 
riders start with us.  Since they're sponsoring the whole event, I figured 
you guys wouldn't mind.  So just be nice!

If you have any questions about any of this, please email me or call me at 
713-646-6569.  I'll be out of the office the rest of this week in attending a 
conference,  but will be checking messages and email when possible.  My home 
number is 713-977-1527 and cell phone is 713-503-6313.  On Friday I'm picking 
up my kids who are flying in and getting their bikes ready, etc., but call if 
you need anything.

How's S.P.?  Wanted to ask you a question regarding your town house.  Have 
you sold it or are you renting it out, b/c we might be interested in renting

After reviewing the CIPCO RFP, Enron has questions that we would like to have 
answered.  I will call you on Friday to follow-up on these:


1.  Who is Henwood Energy Services and what aspect of the RFP will they 
review?

2.  What role will Burns & McDonnell play in the RFP and subsequent project.

3.  Enron controls several development sites in Iowa that provide direct 
access into Alliant.  Does CIPCO's transmission arrangements with Alliant 
allow for a network service whereby energy injected anywhere into the Alliant 
Grid in Iowa can be returned to CIPCO under the present transmission 
arrangement.

4.  Enron also controls sites on Mid-Am in Iowa.  Does CIPCO have network 
rights on Mid-Am or direct ties with Mid-Am.  Would generation on the Mid-Am 
system be of value to CIPCO.

5.  CIPCO states they will consider proposals beyond the 2005 timeframe.  How 
many years would CIPCO consider under a transaction where new generation is 
being built in a jointly developed project.?

6.  CIPCO states they have reviewed several sites for generation 
development.  Can CIPCO provide Enron with a list of preferred sites?

7.  Does CIPCO own separate transmission facilities or is the CIPCO system 
assumed to be CIPCO's network transmission contract on the Alliant System?

8.  Would CIPCO consider a project utilizing the General Electric LM-6000 
technology as we described in our previous meeting in November 1999.

9.  On a new capital project, would CIPCO finance the project with RUS 
financing, internal sources or be interested in financing through Enron?

10.  If Enron is not successful in the RFP and CIPCO elects to build a new 
plant, would CIPCO work with Enron to structure a delivered gas supply 
transaction whereby Enron would provide a new connecting gas lateral, gas 
transportation service and physical gas supply.

I would appreciate you insights on the above.

George,

As I mentioned, I may have to give a presentation Thursday to some Japanese 
utilities re. the North American power market.  I was hoping your group could 
help me with some generic market background information.

Wholesale volumes (sale for resale) by quarter, by NERC region since 1995 if 
possible.
Power marketer rankings, national volumes 1995 - 1999.
New plant (MW) coming on line by NERC region by year ... 1995 - 2005.
Load and reserve margins, 1995 - 2005 by NERC region.
Measures of wholesale power price volitility by region since 1995 ... 
possibly overlayed on reserve margins.
Do we track instances of line loading relief by region?

Any help on the above would be greatly appreciated.

regards,

Don

Subject: TECO-Answer to Chris Smith questions

Chris,


Hopefully the following points should answer your questions. Feel free to=
=20
call me (34292) if you still have any question.

Yvan




1_  We will value Teco as a series of hourly Spread options.=20
Legitimate points of concern:=20
a) Are we valuing an index deal or a physical deal?
  b) If it is a physical deal can the plant realistically react on an hourl=
y=20
basis?

Answer: The deal Enron enters into is based on an spread between PJM index=
=20
and the appropriate OIL curve (New York Harbor + basis). However, the trigg=
er=20
for the default of the contract (which is really what we are concerned with=
)=20
is a function of the plant cash flows compared to the debt level. The plant=
=20
cash flows depend on the physical operations of the plant and its capacity =
to=20
dispatch during the most expensive hours of the year. Therefore the questio=
n=20
of whether the plant can or cannot ramp up quickly enough to dispatch=20
economically is very pertinent to our valuation.=20
I would argue that the plant will always (or almost always) be able to=20
dispatch economically for the following 2 reasons. In the first place, its=
=20
operational ramp up time is only 10 minutes. Secondly, the scalar curve we=
=20
use is fairly well behaved and doesn=01,t swing around a mean position (see=
=20
graph below), hence allowing sufficient preparation for the dispatchers. Th=
e=20
chances of dispatchers being caught by surprise when prices spike up or dow=
n=20
should therefore be relatively small, and the plant should be able to follo=
w=20
the real time prices pretty well.





2_ The power curve we use is PJM west. Even though the plant is located in=
=20
the south east end of PJM (i.e. the del Marva peninsula), we prefer not to=
=20
use the east curve which is too thinly traded to be meaningful.=20

4_ So far we have only used monthly vol for power. Should we start using=20
daily vol as well, then the blending formula would be:
'fvol =3D Sqr((dblMvol * dblMvol * (jDate - jToday) + dblDvol * dblDvol * 1=
5) /=20
(jDate - jToday + 15))

with  jDate the first of the considered month of dispatch
 dblMvol the monthly vol
 dblDvol the daily vol

6_ We are assuming 50% flat correlation for 20 years (a much more=20
conservative assumption than 15%). However we run sensitivities where the=
=20
correlation goes from 30% to 70%.

7_ Yes, we are deducting all operative expenses from the valuation.=20
Origination is currently trying to reconcile the differences in operations=
=20
expenses between their numbers and those used by credits.

8_ The valuation model (coded by Alex Huang, Research) is based on a=20
bidimensional tree, and therefore doesn=01,t use the SPRDOPT function. Howe=
ver,=20
we checked that the SPRDOPT function from the structuring model and the tre=
e=20
based model yielded the same values for the spread option.

9_ The strike for the spread option is the sum of the OIL price + the VOM.









***************************************************************************=
***
***************************************************************************=
***
*********************888








Please send me an excel spreadsheet which depicts the value that you see=20
associated with the heat rate spread option.  I want to make sure that I=20
understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this val=
ue=20
would be booked.  As such, please provide the following detail:

Will we be valuing/booking a series of monthly call options or a series of=
=20
daily call options?
What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub?
Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/MWh to=
=20
value the deal?
What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities=
=20
or intra-day volatilities or a blend of the two (if blending please show me=
=20
what formula you using to blend the two vols)?
What expiration date are you using, i.e.: for monthly call options the 15th=
=20
of the relevant month, and for daily options?
What correlation are you assuming, 15% flat for twenty years?
Are you deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option?
Are you using the ""SPRDOPT"" Exotic Options function to value the option?
Are you using the $/MWh VOM dollar amount as your strike?
Has Don provided the fixed payment stream?  This stream should be covering=
=20
both P&I and not just principal.

Yvan, and Ben, please provide answers to these question via written=20
correspondence so that their is limited probability of misunderstanding. =
=20
Thank you both very much for your time and help thus far.  Furthermore, I=
=20
would like to reiterate that RAC's goal, prior to quoting any credit reserv=
e,=20
is to be 100% confident that: (i) the methodology that is being employed is=
=20
consistent among the internal groups; and (ii) the inherent value of the=20
price risk management contracts matches.  This enables RAC to manage the=20
associated risk during the life of the transaction both effectively and=20
appropriately.

Regards,

Christopher

Attached is nominal performance for 6 LM6000 and 75 MW STG at Homestead. I am 
getting about 8175 Btu/kWhr HHV net plant heat rate (does include GE/S&S

Here are the responses to my CIPCO questions

1.  Henwood Energy is a third party evaluation consultant.  They will review 
the RFP responses

2.  Burns & McDonald has assisted in site selection/review and will 
participate in evaluation of any self-builds that CIPCO does.

3.  CIPCO has a preference to purchase from the market or from plants that 
Enron would develop.  They are not big on wanting to build their own plant or 
JV.

4.  CIPCO has identified a key site in Iowa that has direct access to their 
own system as well as the Mid-Am system.  They would make that site available 
to us if we needed it.  They will not reveal the site unless we get into 
negotiations.

5.  CIPCO will consider terms longer than 5 years.  They would consider a 
15-20 year term if there was a capital project involved.

6.  CIPCO does have their own transmission system as well as point/point 
transmission agreements on Mid-Am and Alliant.  The point to point agreement 
are from plants where CIPCO owns a partial share to CIPCO's system.

7.  CIPCO appeared to not value the LM-6000 technology to any higher degree 
than other machines.

8.  CIPCO was not sure of how things would be financed.

9.  If CIPCO decided to self build, they would certainly be interested in 
working with Enron on the gas deal."

Ben, please find attached an O&M cost estimate for one oil fired 6 x 1 
LM6000PC power project located in Homestead, FL. The estimate assumes 1,400 
run hours in simple cycle during the first year (without SCR) and 2,500 run 
hours in combined cycle for years 2+, with SCR. Given that it's combined 
cycle in years 2+, the staffing plan is assuming year round availability 
needs (except for agreed upon Scheduled Outages). Please note the increase in 
GT Major Scheduled Maintenance costs due to liquid firing.



Please review it and let me know if you have questions or comments.

Mark and Tom, sorry for the short notice. Can you please review and provide 
comment, particularly on the proposed staffing plan and Operator fees?

Yvan,

According to Dave Botchlett, we should be able to use the Low Sulfur HO curve 
that is in the file I've given you in the past with the 3 cent transport cost 
over the NYH mean.  

He did a question:   Can we ship the oil into the plant on barges or on cargo 
ships as opposed to trucking?

Attached is the updated file

Michelle, I just faxes you an executed copy of the CA.

In addition, please find the turbine payment schedule, attached.  We are 
possibly signing a deal for the April 2000 payment ($69MM) tomorrow (so move 
quickly if you want that one!).  Therefore, I would suggest that you mainly 
focus on the payments scheduled after April 2000.  Finally, please keep in 
mind that the last column is for ABB turbines for our Arkansas project (the 
rest are GE).

Please give me a call to discuss.  I should be in the office today until 
around 2:00, and then back on Monday.

Regards,

My thoughts on the Central Iowa Power Cooperative RFP

Let me know what you think

1.  We will develop two GE 7 EA's.  Unit 1 operational 5/1/01.  Unit 2 
operational 5/1/02

2.  We will use the Ogden/Boone County Site being secured by John Moore.  The 
site is 1/4 mile from Northern Natural Gas Mainline.  Also, Ameren 345 Kv and 
Alliant 115Kv line onsite.  Assume interconnects to both of these systems.  
Please break out cost for each.

3.  Assume no fuel oil back-up

4.  Assume no black start

5.  Design the units to be later converted to combined cycle.

6.  Assume water injection for nox control.

7.  Assume portable de-min water facilities

8.  Assume Enron does EPC

9.  Assume CIPCO will finance and own the plant  through ther term of the PSA 
and thereafter

10.  Assume CIPCO will execute a power sales agreement (PSA) with Enron from 
5/1/01 through 10/31/07

Please review and lets discuss Monday (I am off tomorrow).  I have a rough
consensus on this but I am waiting to circulate it following our discussion.

Check out the new item on gas imbalance risk and see if it works.  I did not 
go
to 5.5 years (through 2006), but that would help our case.  Also I tried to
quantify the capital I want to have at risk at the end of the 4.5 year toll.
Hope this helps you evaluate other alternatives.

If you have comments tomorrow I'll review them over the weekend and make
changes.  Thanks.

NOTE:  We also need to know if you are going to move ahead on Ameren.  Your
comments to date on size make me think Enron is 50/50.  Please let me know 
asap.

Greetings, Mr. Rogers

My apologies for the delay in responding to your last inquiry - but the
entire TEXASMBA Admissions Team is still intently focused on the still
remaining pool of fall 2000 applicants requiring consideration for this
year's class.

However, let me briefly respond to your note by suggesting that you also
address one of the more visible point of need in your competitive admission
profile -- that being your GMAT.  I believe you had indicated previously
that you chose not to utilize GMAT's services and accommodations for
non-standard test takers such as yourself.   I suggest you consider the
merits of changing your position in this decision.

As one of the competitive points of consideration within your application
profile, it could be to your benefit to address your currently
non-competitive score by accepting GMAT's accommodations.   I suggest you
request a copy of GMAT's ""Supplement for Testing with Disabilities"" for
additional insights into the nature and personal acceptability of these
accommodations.

Best wishes as you again consider your options.

Carl

Dr. Harris:
     In my pursuit to strengthen my application profile for next year I have
explored taking two graduate level night courses this summer and I wanted to
know what courses the admissions committee would suggest that I take this
summer.  I wanted to make sure that I was taking the courses that were most
appropriate with regards to my application. Just to let you know, I was
planning
on taking two finance courses.  Thanks in advance for your suggestion with
this
matter.
     I was in Austin yesterday for the completion of the MS 150 Bike ride,
but
was not able to stick around.  Hope all is going well and hope to hear from
you
soon.

Ben Rogers

Dr. Harris:
 I hope you had an enjoyable summer and it did not go too quickly, as I felt 
mine did.  I wanted to let you know that I am still very much interested in 
attending the Business School.  
 I took your advice this summer and took a graduate level finance class 
(Financial Management), which I received an A.  I was very pleased with 
myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time.  I 
have also decided to take another graduate level finance class 
(Macroeconomics), which I am currently taking.  
 I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into GMAC to try 
and receive a ""special testing status"" for the GMAT.   I am currently waiting 
to hear back from them with their decision.  When I hear back from GMAC, I am 
planning on re-taking the GMAT to try and increase my score.
 As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the Business 
School for next year and I'm in the process of doing whatever I can to 
increase my application profile. 
 Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do to 
enhance my application profile.   Again, I hope all is going well and I look 
forward to hearing from you soon. 

Regards,

Ben Rogers

Ben

Roughly speaking if you use absorption chilling, you would save (at max 
summer conditions) maybe 1.2 MW per LM or about 2.5% on capacity which would 
be nominally a 2.5% improvement in heat rate. To get this you need a source 
of steam. For Lowell, we possibly could get steam from UAE (I don't know how 
the transaction would work). We would need about 180,000 lb/hr of steam at 
least at 15 psig. The chillers would cost about $400,000 total more than the 
mechanicals we have discussed.

If UAE can't supply the steam, then we would need small HRSG's behind each 
CTG and would most likely also try and steam injection for NOx control. Heat 
rate would improve by maybe 6-7%, plant net output would increase by maybe 2 
MW per LM. Capital cost would grow by maybe $8,000,000 (this is wild guess, 
we did get HRSG quotes for this steam injection/absorption version but have 
not done a detailed capex).

Hello,

As you know, this week I met with S&P on Wednesday and Moody's on Thursday.  
S&P had three people there including Peter Rigby and William Chew (MD 
infrastructure finance) and Moody's had eight people there including Susan 
Abbot (MD corp. finance, power group).  I thought the meetings went very 
well.  There was an active dialogue during both presentations and a lot of 
questions were asked.  The stated objective for both meetings was that Enron 
has gone as far as we can with our product development working in a vacuum, 
and that we feel we have developed a structure that covers the dominant 
outstanding risk that merchant generators are exposed to (market prices), and 
that we think this is enough to achieve an investment grade rating, but if 
not then what more do we need.  Both gave me no commitments but promised to 
give me preliminary feedback next week.

We e-mailed copies of the presentation to both of you yesterday.

I suggest a conference call between Enron, Linda and Tom...maybe Tuesday next 
week to discuss the rating agency meetings in more detail and to discuss 
where we are in product and project development.

The lawyers are continuing to refine and discuss my proposed structure.  Key 
issues seem to be potential treatment of my two contract structure in 
bankruptcy and whether or not my contracts are considered insurance.  I will 
keep you posted as we go.

Let me know what times are good for you.

regards,

Don Black

Attached is a short form estimate I had on Pittsburg which is a 2 X 1 GE7FA 
plant. Also included is Linden 6 (which is a 7FA with an HRSG supplying steam 
to an existing facility, i.e. no steam turbine). Pittsburg is an outdoor 
plant so should represent a fairly competitive deal.



I also have some place a 1 X 1 that we just got on Coyote Springs.

I am working with Kinder/Morgan on pricing a 3 year deal off of one of their 
facilities.  These are the facilities that we looked at late last year for 
buying 2 of their plants.  The plants have a configuration of: 6 LM 6000's, 2 
GE 7EA's and steam turbine.  They are able to run in at peak, swing and base 
load levels very easily.  They are looking for a 3 year  term deal for 510 
MW's, with $1.00 VOM and Heat Rate of 8,531 located in Little Rock, ARK..  
Pricing starts June 02 and goes to Cal. 04.  Anyway, I want to know if you 
guys are able to meet tomorrow at 2:00pm to talk about pricing up this 
deal.   It should only take about 15-25 minutes.  Thanks for your time.

Hey Ben,

How is life in Texas?  Have you met that guy Rob McDonald I know from DC?
He is good friends with my cousin Eddy Quinn.  Life has gotten rather boring
out here. We have a ton of work to do and work long hours with no days off.
This work style in the beginning made time fly but recently the monotony of
the routine has gotten mundane.  We all live for port calls and push the
envelope of ethical billing while in port.  I have been shot down by every
school I applied for.  How about you?  They can all blow me as I would
probably outperform all of those faggots with high GMATs.  That has been my
achilles heel.  Right now I am focused on the summer and getting off this
ship.

I hope I get in the marathon because I have been training for so long.
There is nothing else to do except that in my free time.  If I don't have a
goal to shoot for then I could never keep up this training on land.  The
summer will be the hardest because I am going to want to travel and visit
people when I get back.  Any plans to be in NY this summer?

I have been messing around with stocks too.  I have made only a little since
the tech crash.  I stay away from those Internet companies so I didn't get
killed.  See you in the summer.

CHOB"

Good to hear from you!  It's been a while.  I am also going to work for 
another year.  My undergrad grades were what held me back.  I have already 
enrolled in a summer graduate finance course for the summer.  How Fun!  I am 
also retaking the GMAT.  But what I am looking forward to is kicking your ass 
in the NYC Marathon since I signed up and will hopefully get in.  Megan will 
is almost done with school and will be spending most of July in NY.  So I 
will be coming up to NYC quite a bit this summer.  Would you be interested in 
going out to Colorado this summer to play some great golf.  They have some 
fantastic courses.  Other than that - work is going really well and Enron 
stock and company culture is really getting noticed by Wall Street, which is 
great for future job opportunities.  I'm playing a lot of tennis, golf anf 
basketball as of late and its been quite fun.  Hope all is going well and 
lets get together when you get back.  See ya soon.

Team,

I finally got a chance to talk to Entergy about their merchant peaker in 
their own service territory.  Specifics are as follows:

Configuration: 4 x GE 7EA's at 72 - 73 MW each because of elevation and 
humidity levels.
Location: Vicksburg, MS sharing a site with the Baxter Wilson plant (1320 MW 
coal/gas fired boiler)
HHV: 12,200 btu/kwh
Pipe: A new intra-state that will be shared with the Baxter Wilson plant.  
Existing sources are Koch and Duke.
Start date: 7/01
Permits: PSD permit at 9 ppm.  No run hour limitation.
Taxes: Fee in lieu of taxes at 1/3 cost for first ten years.  Full property 
taxes thereafter.  Entergy claims this is the same deal Ben Jacoby got for 
our peaker in MS.

First we need to model a pro-forma of plant operating costs using estimates 
of FOM and VOM from internal sources.
Second, we need to calculate spread option valuations of the underlying plant 
for 20-years using curve, vol and correlation assumptions acceptable to the 
desk.
Thirdly and based on 20-year plant valuations, I need to create a debt 
service schedule.
Finally, we have to price the put option premium and sensitivities using the 
research/structuring model.

Any questions, please call me at 3-4750.

regards,

Don"

Here is one of the models I have been working on, its the combine cycle 
model.  Here is also the summary page I am working on with the different case 
scenarios.  Give me a call or e-mail me to tell me what you think.  I am also 
building a combined - simple and combine cycle model.  My home number is

Basic summary for Teco:

Still working with Finance Group to come up with different finance structures.
Working with Insurance group (weather desk) to wear the risk of the project, 
since the Power desk will not wear that type of risk.
Pricing of the put, call and spread option values is still not finalized, 
because Kevin Presto has said that he does not put much value into these 
plants in Eastern PJM
Don Black is beginning to look at other companies for his price risk 
management product.  
He feels he will not be able to get a deal done with Teco at this point in 
time.

Let me know if this is suffient for your analysis.

Looks like a 2 X 1 MHI 501G plant would produce about 684MW plant net output 
at a heat rate of 6684 Btu/kWhr net new&clean. 

Still looking for capital cost.

We are still looking for capital costs for a 730 MW plant in Texas, which 
comprises of 4 FA's and 2 STG's.  We are currently using $450 MM for a total 
project cost number, which comes out to be $616/Kw.

Maybe the message is garbled but 4 7FA's and 2 STG's (probably two 2 X 1 
CCGT's) should be nominally $470,000,000 based on the Pittsburg CCGT out in 
California (but includes no real EPC contractor margin/contingency so will 
not match what Nepco or other third parties might bid), would nominally be 
480 MW at 95F for each 2 X 1 so about 960 MW for all. I think this works out 
to about $489/kW. This based on about $34,000,000 for each GE7FA so pricing 
will adjust if market price higher or lower.

I honestly don't and have not seen a 501G price. I did see 701G prices in 
Asia and they appeared to be about 5% lower per kilowatt than 701F and 
GE9FA's. In this hot market they maybe at a premium due to better heat rate 
and larger unit size. I would suggest $515/kW as a go by. I have called John 
Garrison to see what current pricing and delivery is - also to see if 
performance might be a touch better than our maybe two year old model. Do we 
want to get an estimate from Nepco or a benchmark from my estimator's? I 
would need a charge number/tasking letter.

This sure sounds like a deal Len Gunderson was looking at early this year and 
a large chemical facility. The capacity for the project did not match what 
equipment it was based on - any more details so I can see if we have any data 
from that earlier look?

Ben,

I have put together a quick estimate of the adder to get from the ""two 7EA 
open cycle peaker configuration"" to the ""2x1 combined cycle configuration"", 
adding the two HRSGs and 100 Mw steam turbine along with extra BOP equipment. 
The estimate was quick and is therefore +/- 20% accuracy. Beyond this 
accuracy, we would need a tasking letter.

Your CIPCO Proforma for EPC costs of two 7EAs Open Cycle = $57,580,000 or 
$378.82/Kw

The rough cost estimate (+/-20%) of the 2x1 Combined Cycle  = $130,336,000 or 
$493.70/Kw
 (See Attached Analysis)

The estimated adder for conversion to 2x1 Combined Cycle is therefore:

   $130,336,000
   -$ 57,580,000
   ____________
Estimated Adder is =  $72,756,000      +/- 20% 

Hope this data is sufficient for your needs. Please call me at ext 67958 if 
you need any clarification beyond the attached.

After an incredible holiday of travelling and partying, I needed some time
to rest and dry out.  I looked into those fancy resort spas and they were
way to expensive.  And then I thought, what better way to do it then be
stranded on a ship for six months.  I will lose some weight, get in shape,
grow my liver back, and come out a lean, mean fighting machine.  It is day 3
of the six month ""cruise"" and I don't seem to feel much different?  I hope
they didn't lie to me...

This is my new address as my old PwC address will only be read when I am in
a port.  I hope everyone had blast over the holidays and here is a picture
on New Years of me before I got really out of control.

Jesson -

Since you are too weak to show me a bid, here is an updated term sheet.  See 
you tomorrow morning at 9am.

I spoke with CIPCO today on our proposal submitted on 4/28/00 and they are 
initially interested in what we put together (i.e. 2 GE-7EA's) with right to 
substitute technology as long as overall project economics are not impacted.

They will be meeting with their consultants tomorrow (5/5/00) to come up with 
a list of questions to help develop a short list.

Assuming we make it to a short list, then we will be asked to come to Iowa to 
meet with their generation planning team.

All of this should play out over the next 3-4 weeks.


(Also, please note that we are looking at this as a way to substitute 3 
LM-6000's for the two EA's and keep the heat rate spread.  A plant at CIPCO 
also is an OPPD workout.  We have a site under option in Iowa that is into 
Mid-Am 345Kv and Alliant/CIPCO.

This is a revised Plano we did late yesterday. It was adjusted from Lowell, 
Mass Nepco estimate and we changed format to more closely match  Homestead 
form.

Biggest differences 'tween original Plano and original Homestead were:

Homestead had dual fuel     +4M
Homestead had additional piling and foundation bulks  +1.8M
Homestead was connecting to a complicated t-line config +1.5M
Homestead had an FPL substation    +5M
Homestead did not need as much gas pipeline    -2.1M
Homestead used 6% margin     +4.4M
Homestead had lower capacity due to additional chilling  +1.5% (not capital 
cost but does change $/kW)

Differences from original Plano to new Plano is that Nepco has estimated a 
union job for Lowell. This impacts indirects upward by about $5M and 
construction up above my earlier guesstimate by about $4M. I had doubled the 
cost per manhour which Nepco also did but additionally they added manhours 
for productivity loss. Additionally I moved new Plano margin to 6%.

New Homestead went up due to raw water pretreatment and first stage RO but we 
dropped the substation cost so total estimated cost went down by a coupla of 
million.

Numbers still just should be used for screening, no commitment. 

These summaries should not be passed around.

Ben,
Here is a real quick estimate on the info you gave me on this ""Synthetic CC 
Plant"".  Consider the error to be about +-25% with this quick a turn around.
I will be on vacation next week, if you can wait for the next go around until 
I return on the 15 May, your welcome to call Scot Chambers at 68371.

FYI--I called Jay Hopper and told him that our own backlog of LM-6000 
projects had priority in terms of tolling agreements.  Given our existing 
backlog of such projects, I would not presently be in position to offer a 
tolling agreement to KN's project in the pricing range that KN was seeking. "

Hey there; 
""Do you know who your ""big toe"" is yet?  Do you swallow alot of aggression 
along with alot of pizzas?  Well if you do, then you are going to be a lean, 
mean fighting machine.  I finally finished all of my applications and have 
had several interviews with Columbia and Rice.  Duke is in a couple of 
weeks.  I'll probably here from NYU in the next couple of weeks.  We were in 
St. Barts for New Years and it was awesome.  We need to have a huge party 
when you get back in the summer.  I talk to Gioffre quite a bit now and we 
are trying to get a lot of people together this summer.  Hope your trip is 
going well and Keep in touch.  I'll let you know how the B-School results 
come in.  Talk to you soon.

Attached is a revised and updated 2000 Weekly Cost Report.  Please review the 
changes, which I have summarized below, and call if you have any questions.  
Thanks Amy 3-7805

1.  For the Wilton and Gleason projects,  the Current Forecast was overstated 
by the amounts paid to Nepco on April the 28th.  This resulted in a 
significant erroneous variance of about $27 million.  In other words, I 
didn't reduce the forecast by the amount of the payment.

2. The unapproved Acceleration Scope change on Lincoln, approximately $14 
million , has been broken out separately to be consistent with the other 2 
projects as a separate variance explanation.

3.  The EECC Fixed Fee of $3 million per project has been removed from both 
the Original Budget and Current Forecast. as requested by Dave Delainey."

Dave:
 I was talking with my brother-in-law who is Kinder/Morgan's VP of Corp 
Development and they would be interested in talking with us about 
contributing their 5,000 MW's of generation into a JV/Partnership to lead 
into a public offering.  We are still under several different CA's with them, 
due to our past conversation's regarding generation.  
 With our previous discussions, Rich Kinder had suggested to Kevin Hannon if 
Enron would be interested in buying the whole Orion  Project, but at that 
time ENA was only interested in the first couple of projects, due to the 
delivery of the turbines.  
 In light of our past discussions and KMI's desire to exit the generation 
business, this JV would give them the perfect ""exit strategy"".  Also, it 
would give us a better growth strategy, with respects to our talks with other 
parties.  I know that bringing in a potential third party would complicate 
the deal structure, but I think that it would build a much better growth 
story to Wall Street.
 If you think this would be a good idea, I can begin to set up a meeting as 
soon as possible with Kinder/Morgan.  Thanks!

Clement,

Here is the first run on the FPL Map and Excel grid.  I found some additional 
plant information on the FPL home page, and I aligned the presentations with 
the home page as my main source.  

I plotted the locations by city and net MW, because that was in the key to 
the Enron asset page.  Please let me know if you would like me to change it 
to plant name.  Also, there are several wind projects in the cities of 
Altamont and Tehachapi, CA.  I totaled the projects' net MW and listed them 
under their respective city.  

Finally, the only pages that I altered on the PowerPoint presentation were 
the map pages.  The rest of the presenation is still in the Reliant format.  

Regards,

Ben

Here is the VOM and FOM for a 4 GE 7EA plant in Vicksburg, MS.
VOM = $0.88
Annual FOM = $915,000
These numbers are a good estimate based off of our Caledonia plant, which is 
currently operating in the TVA region.  Please give me a call if you have any 
questions.  Thanks!

Don:

Thomas and or Mike may have already asked you this, but I want to make sure 
we're all on the same page (or determine if I'm not). In order to support the 
greenfield merchant decision making process for '01, we need price forecasts 
for the following locations / configurations:

1. Florida - 6 - LM6000s in simple cycle mode; 6 - LM 6000s plus a 74.9MW 
steam turbine in combined cycle mode
2. St. Charles Parrish, LA (south of N.O.) 6 - LM6000s in simple cycle mode
3. Chicago area: 2 - ABB 11N2s in simple cycle mode; 6 - LM 6000s in simple 
cycle mode
4. Ameren / AEC interface, Missouri - 6 - LM 6000s in simple cycle mode

Please let us know as to how we should proceed in order to obtain these 
forecasts as soon as possible. Perhaps Thomas can take the lead in dealing 
with the consultants after you make the intro...

Thanks much,

Ben"

Ben,

On the Wisconsin Public Service deal (WPS) please consider the following:

1.  One LM-6000 to be sited near Green Bay Wisconsin
2.  Will be configured in combined cycle mode with a HRSG
3.  100% of the output will go to an industrial customer of WPS


Key Questions

1.  What is the heat rate and Mw rating of our turbine at site conditions (20 
degrees winter and 90 degrees summer)

2.  What is the water consumption with Sprint verses water injection

3.  What is a 10 year fixed gas price at chicago starting 6/1/01 on a 
baseload volume of 10,000 mmbtu/d

Question 1

Case 1 at 20F and 60% RH CTG would have net unit output of 46,726 kW at a 
heat rate of 10,183 Btu/kWhr HHV new & clean
Case 2 at 90F and 54% RH CTG would have net unit output of 43,220 kW at a 
heat rate of 10,804 Btu/kWhr HHV new & clean

Case 1 has gas compression, no chilling/heating, Case 2 has gas compression 
and chilling. Both cases include simple cycle CTG aux and expected steup 
transformer losses. Back pressure is based on 14"" HRSG.

Question 2

For case 2, Sprint water injection is 1915 lb/hr +/1 20%, we are also water 
injecting for NOx control 21,981 lb/hr so total is 23,896 lb/hr. Currently 
cannot Sprint with DLE combustor.

Question 1

Case 1 at 20F and 60% RH CTG would have net unit output of 46,726 kW at a 
heat rate of 10,183 Btu/kWhr HHV new & clean
Case 2 at 90F and 54% RH CTG would have net unit output of 43,220 kW at a 
heat rate of 10,804 Btu/kWhr HHV new & clean

Case 1 has gas compression, no chilling/heating, Case 2 has gas compression 
and chilling. Both cases include simple cycle CTG aux and expected steup 
transformer losses. Back pressure is based on 14"" HRSG.

Question 2

For case 2, Sprint water injection is 1915 lb/hr +/1 20%, we are also water 
injecting for NOx control 21,981 lb/hr so total is 23,896 lb/hr. Currently 
cannot Sprint with DLE combustor.

Ben:

Thomas Suffield has determined, through discussions with our accounting 
group, the project cost methodology used for our Genco assets. Unless there 
is a compelling reason, we need to conform your Florida model to this model 
as (i) it is already an accepted methodology used by the organization, (ii) 
it is used as the basis upon which we determine accrual income for our 
existing merchant portfolio, and (iii) it will result in more favorable cost 
profile in terms of $/kW month than other methodologies.

Please let me know if you have any issues relative to this approach. If not, 
please adjust the Florida model and provide me with the results which Mike 
and I need to present to Delainey on Friday. It would also be helpful to have 
the bid and ask from the desk (5 yr. term) for this presentation. Lastly, 
FYI, we have released ICF Kaiser to prepare a forecast specific to the LM6000 
configuration (6x and w/wo a 74.9mW steam turbine), which we can then use to 
compare to the forecasted cost basis of your model.

Thanks,

Ben"

I talked with Thomas Suffield and he wants Miguel Vasquez to run the numbers 
on the Florida model., since they have been running numbers on the Plano 
model for a little while now.  I walked Miguel through what I had done and 
how they should look at running the model, based on what Thomas found out and 
what you have said in the past.  I also gave them the numbers that the desk 
has given based on the simple cycle case (5 year number) and combine-cycle 
case (5 year number).  From this they have modeled and graphed these 
different scenarios.  I also worked on getting a bid and ask from the desk, 
but you may need to talk to Berney because they are not giving out the ask at 
this time.  
Hope this helps and please give me a call if you have any questions. Thanks

Hi Benjamin,

Winston Cheng asked me to forward to you the attached schedule of development 
projects for the west.  Note that these projects are not firm - for example, 
most have not got firm site commitments etc.  No doubt, many of the projects 
are expected to fall through or be terminated for one reason or another.

Cheers

Christian

Hey Dover,

You are the only one who figured out what the hell I was saying.  So many
people sent back dumbass responses such as your not that fat.  I thought I
was being very creative but obviously not.  I was in Rio for new years and
it was a sick time.  I have some digital pictures I will send you next time
I download to a floppy disk.  The people in Rio were so cool and showing as
much skin as possible is the custom.  I am trying to finish up my
applications while out here and I think I will be submitted by the end of
January.  I hear OB actually has to go back to work!  I hope he can handle
it.  I visited him before Christmas and he was partying like senior year of
college.

I still have not forgotten your wedding gift and am getting it when I am in
the Far East.  Something you guys will always remember-how many slaves do
you think you need, they are real cheap.

Ben,
 As far as Georgia is concerned, we should have a total of five dots on the 
state.  The Doyle project actually needs to be changed to ""In Operation"" as 
it is now going through its run tests.  The Athens, GA site should be labeled 
""Development (Site Secured)"".  Then, their should be three other dots all 
labeled for ""Development (Site Under Construction)"".  These three dots are 
sites in Hart, Jefferson and Washington county, GA.  

Stephen

Ben,
 In regards to the Chicago area, we also need to add another dot to the map 
for the Pontiac site.  This site will be labeled differently from the Plano 
and Torrance sites.  The Pontiac site will be labeled:  ""Development (Site 
under Negotiation)"".  Thanks.

I have scheduled a call at 10:00 Houston time on Monday to talk with ICF 
about a new curve for LV, Pastoria, Louisiana, Florida and Missouri.  They 
have said that they can get a preliminary curve to us within 3-5 days with a 
full market study to follow.  For this, they have ask for $95M.  They usually 
charge $37,500 per region, and usually give us a 12% discount for a total of 
$33,000.  So in their minds, they are shaving off $70M from the standard 
discounted price. 

Let's talk before the call if at all possible. We need to be in a position to 
give them the go ahead on Monday, if we are comfortable with the proposal.  
Otherwise, we risk not getting the results until the following week.

Thanks,

Don:  your list doesn't reference Ben J's request for Chicago:  based on LM 
6000's and the ABB's.  I know we have not been able to sit down with Clement 
to extrapolate on what he already has on Chicago (MAIN).  

BenT & Ben R:  let's get together heat rates for each of the referenced

but I have very little info on the West Coast projects.

I do not believe that Ozzie has given his two copies of the summary info to 
FPL yet. If not, let's get them back and make these changes plus the changes 
that to the summary chart that you discovered.

2)  Change Testing date from December 2002 to January 2002.

Greg and Steve have pointed out to me that a separate study has already been 
commissioned by ENA for RW Beck to produce curves for Florida.  We will not 
need to duplicate ICF curves for Florida which should arrive in the next  2 
weeks.

Don:  your list doesn't reference Ben J's request for Chicago:  based on LM 
6000's and the ABB's.  I know we have not been able to sit down with Clement 
to extrapolate on what he already has on Chicago (MAIN).  

BenT & Ben R:  let's get together heat rates for each of the referenced 
plants (there should be very little variable with inlet chilling on the LM's) 
but I have very little info on the West Coast projects.    
Thanks, Thomas.

Subject: ICF

I have scheduled a call at 10:00 Houston time on Monday to talk with ICF 
about a new curve for LV, Pastoria, Louisiana, Florida and Missouri.  They 
have said that they can get a preliminary curve to us within 3-5 days with a 
full market study to follow.  For this, they have ask for $95M.  They usually 
charge $37,500 per region, and usually give us a 12% discount for a total of 
$33,000.  So in their minds, they are shaving off $70M from the standard 
discounted price. 

Let's talk before the call if at all possible. We need to be in a position to 
give them the go ahead on Monday, if we are comfortable with the proposal.  
Otherwise, we risk not getting the results until the following week.

Thanks,

Don

Here is the VOM and FOM for the Entergy model.  Yvan Chaxel is using these 
same numbers in his spread option value model.
VOM - $0.89
FOM (Annual $'s) - $ 915,000/year
I am still getting the model together.

After talking to the Bradford, I changed the credit charge to be negotiated.  
I'm trying to get a meeting with Tracy Ngo of Credit to discuss the issues in 
more depth.  We're at the point of ""too many cooks"" since we haven't even 
talked to Orion.

Attached are the 2000 Cost Reports.  These reports only include actuals 
through 12/31/1999, January cost will not be posted until all year end 
Project Tracking has been purged which will be the week of the 17th.  
Therefore the next report will be 1/25/00, which will include January 
activity.

I have also updated the Scope Change tab for Wilton to include the amounts 
that ENA has approved for each scope change.  However, Nepco's Current 
Forecast still has the original amount of each Scope Change and therefore is 
overstated.  As soon as Nepco's forecast is reduced by the agreed to changes, 
I will reflect the reduced cost in my Forecast.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.  Thanks Amy 3-7805"

The New Power Company, the first national residential and small business 
energy service provider in deregulated
markets was launched today with strategic investors and partners including 
Enron, IBM and America Online.

H. Eugene Lockhart has been named President and Chief Executive Officer of 
the company.  He was formerly President
of AT&T Consumer Services and Chief Marketing Officer of AT&T, as well as 
President of Bank America's Global Retail
Bank and President and CEO of MasterCard International.  Lockhart is joined 
by a number of high-level executives from
the telecommunications and financial services sectors as well as several 
former Enron executives specializing in energy
commodity pricing, marketing, risk management and government regulatory 
affairs.   

The former Enron employees include Jim Badum, formerly Managing Director of 
Consumer Services at EES, John Henderson, 
formerly Vice President of Retail Risk Management for EES, Dave Eichinger, 
formerly Vice President of Corporate Development

Enron will provide The New Power Company with energy commodity pricing, risk 
management, and government/
regulatory affairs.  Ken Lay is quoted in the news release, ""We've studied 
the residential and small business market
for several years and believe this is the optimal way to provide value to 
these customers.  By assisting in setting up
an independent company, Enron is able to leverage its core competencies of 
energy and risk management, while
partnering with other industry leaders to give The New Power Company 
extraordinary and immediate depth and
capability.""  Ken will also serve on the Board of Directors.

The New Power Company is scheduled to initially provide service in 
Pennsylvania and New Jersey in the second half
of 2000.  The company will be headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut, with 
some operations in Houston.

Mitch,

Per your request, I am having copies of the 2000 budget for the 1999 and 2000 
Peakers delivered to you and Clement.  You should receive them within the 
hour.  I contacted Tom and informed him you are requesting a meeting to 
discuss the current estimate for each site.   He indicated he would be 
available for a conference call tomorrow morning.   He was in the process of 
catching his flight and stated he would contact me in the morning.

Thanks,
Chaundra

Subject: Revised JV Term Sheet for E2


Attached is the JV Term Sheet that was originally drafted by Lance which I 
have revised in the following ways:

1)  The concept of having 25% of the aggregate consideration supported by a 
letter of credit or otherwise payable in cash has been added.
2)  The bracketed questions/comments relating to (1) Purchaser's potential 
ability to effect a tax free contribution without requiring the establishment 
by the issuer of a holding company and (2) the request for confirmation about 
non-compete arrangements and development opportunities, have been deleted 
[JORDAN - PLEASE ADVISE IF THIS IS PROBLEMATIC]
3)  The Doyle and Calumet facilities have been removed from Annex A
4)  The entity names for the Wheatland and Lincoln Sites have been inserted.

Please call asap with any questions or comments

Stuart

all of the changes, (2) the General Terms and (3) a redline of the General
Terms highlighting my questions/comments.  Generally Delainey was a genius
as expected but a few things really ought to be tightened down before the

Recently, Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Treasurer of Enron 
Corp., accepted the position of Chief Commercial Officer of Enron Net Works.  
Jeff's many accomplishments at Enron Global Finance (""EGF"") include over $30 
billion of closed financings and an upgrade of Enron's credit rating by 
Moody's to Baa1.  We wish Jeff well in his new endeavor.

Ben Glisan, Vice President and head of EGF's Structured Finance business, 
will assume Jeff's responsibilities as Vice President and Treasurer of Enron 
Corp.  Ben joined Enron in 1996 from Arthur Andersen where he was responsible 
for managing structured transactions with Enron.  Prior to Arthur Andersen, 
Ben worked at Coopers & Lybrand providing accounting and finance services 
principally to financial institutions.  Ben will be a member of the Enron 
Corp. Executive Committee.

For additional details regarding EGF's organizational changes, please see the 
attached memo.

Don,

Tom and I had a quite good meeting with ICF staff yesterday. Although they 
did not show us actual mathematical formula, Tom is a lot more comfortable 
with ICF methodology. Their definition of capacity price and energy price is 
a little different from traditional concept. Tom will write summary memo and 
we can sit down Wednesday morning (9 or 10am). Another outcome is that we can 
go over ICF's assumption about O&M, financing, etc, and request more 
information as it is needed.

Are you available 9 or 10 am tomorrow? Thanks.

Jinsung"

Scott,
This should fit your purposes.  Please call me if you need any clarification 
or if it does not meet your needs.

Ben,
This is the same model I sent you back at the beginning of December for your 
scenarios with Rodney.  You may be more accessible to help Scott with any 
questions that he has though I'm happy to help should you need me.

Thanks

Don:
Regarding my conversation with John Garrison on the GE 7FA costs.

Delivery:  '00-'01  Cost:  $36.0 MM
Delivery:  '98-'99  Cost:  $34.250 MM
Delivery:  '96-'97  Cost:  $32.0 MM 
Delivery:  '95-'97  Cost:  $30.0 MM

It looks like that for every year and a half the costs go up approx. $2.0 
MM.  The next available order for GE 7FA's is 3rd qtr. 2003.

Don,

Your math seems correct to me. Keep that in mind our NI includes PPA value 
through amortization. Use attached model, which has better format if you 
will. Jin

I am currently in the process of updating the actuals for May.  At this stage 
in the process the only material changes would be the Nepco reimbursable 
portion of the report.  As some of you know Jody Pierce and Theresa Vos 
performed a review of actuals to date.  Hence, I have been waiting for a 
revised invoices that would true-up actuals and forecast for the projects, 
before updating the projects reports.  As of today, I still have not received 
Invoices and therefore the May cash curve forecasted payment was not made.  

As I am currently going though the month end close process I am having to 
update the report.  I should have updates by early next week.   If you have 
any questions, please call.  Thanks Amy 3-7805

Excellent time! Look forward to keeping it going at the wedding, Elizabeth
will be so impressed. Speaking of keeping it going, our good friend, Mr.
Kimzey, called me last night drunk as rodeo goat at about 10 PM asking me to
go out and party a little bit more. Did I miss something or did we not get
our share this weekend?

Apparently the weekend only caused Bryan to reflect on his current state of
affairs. By chance it was just the welts on his forehead from crushing cans
that caused him to start boozing all by his lonesome yesterday. Or perhaps
he just wanted to enjoy the perks of first class. Let's hope it was the
latter and had nothing to do with the frightful prospect of being a married
man in just 6 weeks.

Oh, by the way, I can assure you all Kimzey has not read a single one of
these emails yet, and likely won't till about noon. Damn slackers over there
at CSFB!

will now not miss the wonders of bachelorhood too much.

Found a camera - digital one in 317 - also have the elvis sun glasses - if
the
rightful owner would like to step forward - and yes we know who you are.

Mike:

Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last week.  I left you Rich 
Kinder's number on Thursday with your assistant, Sheilla - hope you got it.  
Again, I think a deal between or three companies is something to really look 
at.  I think it creates a great story to the street.  Kinder/Morgan brings 
the growth story, the gas pipelines for the convergence play and the 
development team, Enron brings the MW's and trading and Cinergy brings MW's, 
trading and operating expertise.  I feel that Enron and Cinergy can work 
togther with regards to the trading.  I am sending you an anayst report I 
just finish reading regarding generation spinoffs - I think it will be 
helpful.   Also, Kay Chapman, Dave's assistant informed me that you were 
coming up next week, and I wanted to know if you wanted me to be there or not 
or if you wanted me to prepare anything for you for the meeting.  

Hope you had a good weekend and I look forward to talking to you soon.
Regards,
Ben

I have a meeting with Dave on Monday at 8:30am. We will be bringing the deal
guys (Bill Grealis, Chuck Winger, Art Vivar, myself and possibly one other)
so we're ready to listen and make something shake loose. I am also going to
contact Rich Kinder this week to talk about the possibilities.

I very much appreciate your input and your insight and would welcome your
help when the time is right. As a side note you may have heard that
Madeleine Ludlow has left to pursue other business interests and we are in
the hunt for a corporate CFO and talent as I mentioned is my number one
priority. As to your inclusion in this meeting I will inquire with Dave as
to the attendees and mention your name as a good participant. (Dave's call
obviously). Thanks again....

Mike:
Just a thought regarding Kinder/Morgan.  These guys mainly care about the gas 
pipelines and that some of there projects are actually put on there lines to 
increase throughput.  These plants that they want on their lines are 
currently in construction or development.  Their only operational plants are 
in Colorado.  They have a good generation team, but I fell that they do not 
want to be in the business of operating and maintaining the plants, just as 
long as somebody wants to put them along their lines.  If you guys offered to 
buy their plants and projects, they would mainly care about price (cash and 
stock in the new company) and to put contracts in place for some of their 
projects to put on their lines.  Hope this helps.

What the hell happened this weekend?  All I can say right now is thank you

memories ever.  And thanks to Miguel and Blake again for organizing
everything; I couldn't have done it without y'all.  Once I can put more full
sentences together, I'll write more.  Thanks again.

Junell,

Thanks for the pictures.  You are the man.  I'll be waiting for the rest of
them.  Make sure to add Ben Rogers to your email distribution.  I cc'ed him
on this so you'd have his address.  I look forward to seeing you at the
wedding shower and the wedding if you can make it.  Thanks again, buddy.

Subject: Outstanding Pricing for AES Wolf Hollow

The power option premium pricing was done on 30 MW's, apparently a standard 
product amount. What is the effect on pricing, if any,  for the actual 730 
MW's? Or do we just take 24 of the 30 MW products?
Have we priced the 60/40 split scenario where we can call on the plant 25% of 
the year (effectectively it is a 25 capacity factor), at our option as to 
when we call? We would assume that we'd exercise this in periods/months when 
prices are highest.
For the scenario where the summer hourly power call on-peak is $85 and the 
off-peak summer power call is $25, I came up with a daily, summer-only, 
blended on and off-peak gas call of $7.64/MMBtu. Gas would be at 
index/floating in the winter. The premium for this summer gas call was 
$38,128/month. Bruce, does that seem within the right range?
AES said they need 2 1/2 times more value than the $850,000/month they'd have 
recieved under our initial proposed power premum. Ben is running the model to 
give us a check as to their debt service and FOM costs.

Ben, Bruce, what else do you have outstanding that needs to be run?

Thanks,

Michelle"

Here is the latest ""CA"" with everyone's changes.  I feel that this is pretty 
close to the best we can offer in terms of the stand-still and 
non-solicitation agreements.  Enron usually does not get into stand-still 
agreements, so doing this one was a big step for Enron.  Look forward to 
talking to you tomorrow morning.  Thanks for your patience.  Again, this is a 
draft copy for discussions purposes only.
Regards,
Ben

Happily situated in London trying to recover from the additional lack of sleep
post flight - all I have to say to y'all (no I don't use that turn of phrase 
in
regular conversation) is that I hope you get some more training in prior to 
the
wedding - after all, losing the second half of July to recovering is not
amenable.  Many thanks for the pics Mark - can't wait to see the rest.

Not sure how you can actualize these prices but here is what I think you were 
asking for...



So if you have 50MW then 50 times $ per MW available for sale.

Good to hear from you.  Happy Anniversary.  Arianna is growing everyday.  I
have been working long hours,
so she looks different every time I come home to her and Kati.  Kati is
well, trying to adjust to motherhood and
constantly watching over the baby.  She is off until September 1.  No major
plans for the summer.  Going to
Boston the third week in July for 5 days.  My golf game is barely treading
above water.  Don't play enough.  Such
is life.  Say hello to Megan and your family for me.  I hope we can get
together when you are in town. Until then, go sox.

Jon

Hey Jon;
Just e-mailing to see how everyone is doing.  Megan and I are going over to
Austin to a resort to celebrate our 1st anniversary - I can't believe it.
I've been trying to work on the golf game, but I'm taking a couple of
graduate business courses at night so that keeps me pretty busy on the
weekends as well.  Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.
Go Sox!
Ben

Dave:
I talked with the legal guys at Cinergy and after further discussions with 
Mike Cyrus, they felt that since these discussions were at a high level and 
very early in discussions that a ""CA"" at this time was not needed.  There 
were two sticking points that I was trying to get them to backdown from: 1) a 
stand-still agreement and 2) a solicitation agreement.  They were not willing 
to back down from these, thus they concluded with suggesting no ""CA"".  Let me 
know if this is your thoughts as well.  Thanks!

Attached is the weekly GenCo model. You might want to start getting familiar 
with it before things get heated up for FPL. We can sit down early next week 
so that I can walk thru with you how the model works and how to update it 
weekly.

Thanks.

Thank you all for your warm congratulatory words.  Arianna is now 1 month
old and is doing great (I promise you will not get an email like this every
month).  Kati is also
doing great.    Here are some photos for your viewing pleasure.

Ben,

Per your request, attached is a draft of the above-referenced confidentiality 
agreement.  Be advised that I do not have the authority to sign off on this 
document unless and until I have received approval from Tim Detmering 
(pursuant to his ability to sign off on standstill and non-solicitation 
provisions on behalf of the President of ENA), Mark Metts and Lance Schuler.

Attached is a redlined draft of the CA which includes the comments that I 
received from both Lance Schuler and Mark Metts.

Lance raised a very good point about the value of the standstill to Enron if 
ENA is a signatory to the agreement.  I will call Mark directly to discuss 
this issue but have attempted to highlight it for you in the revised draft.

Please feel free to call with any questions.

obtain approval from Mark Metts, Mark Haedicke (Lance Schuler has already 
approved of this form on his behalf), and the President of ENA (either Jeff

attached draft contains both a non-solicitation provision and a standstill 
agreement.  If the attached is acceptable, please indicate your approval in a

behalf of the President in these matters.  Should you have any questions, 
please feel free to call (x37493).

Ben,
Attached is a revised Confidentiality Agreement which incorporates many of
your suggested changes.  Several additional changes are being made to
address issues associated with the inadvertent erosion of key provisions
benefiting both Enron and Cinergy that resulted from other changes in your
latest drafts.  I assure you that this document with your changes
incorporated is less than what Cinergy has been willing to agree to in the
past.  I look forward to a favorable response so the pressing need for
exchange of documents and further business discussions can proceed
expeditiously.

Bill:
Here are the two CA's we are currently working off of.  The first one is 
Enron's latest draft and the second one is Cinergy's latest draft.  Enron 
usually does not get into stand-still agreements, but we decided to in this 
case.  We have been exchanging comments for two weeks and now we need to sit 
down and discuss these points from a commercial stand-point to get over these 
differences.  Please give me a call when you get this so we can go through 
these issues.  Thanks for your time with this issue.

Regards,
Ben

Amy:
I called a while back to get into the Enron class which you helped me get 
into and I just recently left you a message to take private sessions from the 
Princeton Review.  I have realized that I need  one on one  sessions to help 
me really prepare for the GMAT.  If you can point me in the right direction, 
I would greatly appreciate it.  I was looking to start sessions as soon as 
possible. Again, thanks for your help with this issue.

I changed Heat rates for Caledonia and Gleason, and Start Charge for Gleason. 
Heat rates has no impact on numbers. Only increased start charge reduced IRR 
from 13.966% to 13.947% with same debt and equity scenario. I think we can 
stay with previous numbers (debt and equity) with new heat rates and start 
charge. Jin

Clement:  We have an add'l issue on the LM  6000's and that is on IDC.  My 
understanding is when we originally structured the sharing of the West LB 
interim interest, we were assuming the turbines would move out of the 
facility to Project Facilities.  Since we have turbines that do not have 
homes, but will continue to incur add'l IDC, we would like to agree on a new 
methodology for accruing IDC per turbine.  We look forward to meeting with 
you soon to discuss this.  Let me know when you are available.  

Thanks, Thomas.

Matt:  thanks for the memo.  
As per my discussions with Billy, there is no problem with Austin being on 
balance sheet because we are accounting for our interest as a % of the J.V.  
and will accrue income, not Fair Value it.  
As to the turbine/West L.B. structure moving forward, I have left a message 
with Bruce Golden recommending in our next meeting we include the 
Procurement/Purchasing agent from NEPCO who would be involved in any 
ancillary purchases.  Additionally, accounting should be represented.  

Let us know when next week will work for you.  Thanks, Thomas.

Subject: LM6000 spending vs West LB budget

Ben,

I want to further discuss a few issues that arose from yesterday's LM6000 
budget meeting. When structuring the Acquisition and Development Agreement 
(ADA) for the LM6000s with West LB, a spending budget for major equipment 
purchases was put together and signed off by Mike Miller and Chris Booth 
which included ancillary equipment items, such as transformers but also 
chillers, stacks and compressors, etc, through November 12, 2000. What I 
heard in yesterday's meeting is that related to the LM6000's, NEPCO plans to 
order not just major equipment but smaller items too.   We need to ensure 
that  (1) the ADA as currently drafted allows for non-major items and (2) 
those items have been budgeted. We will get back to you related to (1).   

More generally, accounting has told us that NEPCO cannot pay directly for ANY 
(big or small) hard costs for which it is not reimbursed (this includes items 
for City of Austin until their units and associated ancillary equipment are 
removed from the West LB structure). Specifically, that means NEPCO must  (1) 
have a contract for all of the items (big or small) it plans to purchase on 
behalf of West LB as its acquisition agent (Kay please provide such language 
to Bruce Golden - he has informed me about an SCR LOI out there) and (2) have 
it in the West LB budget.  It would be helpful if CTG could coordinate with 
NEPCO so that all binding LOIs or contracts be reviewed ahead of time by 
accounting and finance to ensure off-balance sheet treatment. 

I will ask my assistant to put together another meeting to further discuss 
the purchase process and that the current West LB budget truly reflects what 
NEPCO plans to purchase on behalf of West LB.

Thanks,
Matt

Subject: Dave Delainey's Additional Requests

As per the presentation with Dave yesterday and a follow up conversation with 
him today, we need the following:

Kate:   Run the model based on the ""break even cost #'s"" in comparison to 
GENCO's #'s assuming a 6 1/2% fixed interest 
  rate. (As per Dave Don Miller's GENCO group should be able to supply us 
with their comparable #'s).
 Also run the model based on MAIN and ECAR curves ( we have already run the 
#'s on Cinergy and West NY).   
 Produce a graph showing the different curves, including ICF-Kaiser.  
 Also show a graph comparing Moore's tariff build up (based on the 30 yr 
curve) for Fixed and Variable O&M,    principal, interest. etc.  (Jonathan 
Hoff should be of great help here).

Miguel:  Get market comps from the Confidential-CSFB study that Don Miller 
has giving Asset Pricing comps for Power   Plants (GENCO related).  Also look 
to get any other market/asset sales info. we showed to Orion.
 Meet with the desk to get the MAIN and ECAR curves Dave has requested we 
run. (for Kate's proforma).  
 Since Miguel is out after Thursday, Adam  should coordinate and follow up in 
Miguel's absence.

He also gave us go ahead for the DASH and RAROC. Kate was cleaning up the 
DASH and the model to pass on to  Underwriting.

Joe D. and Lisa B. are following up on the Syn. Lease structure getting with 
the banks.  

Eric will of course address all the other issues including technical, 
transmission interface, turbine purchase, permitting, etc.

As you know, Dave wanted this done in tandem with all the other development 
projects, which means ASAP.

Thanks, Thomas.

Thank you for participating in the meeting/conference call yesterday 
afternoon.  I know it was helpful to go through the Synthetic Lease 
assumptions with everyone on board.  I met with Dave yesterday evening and 
briefly discussed his timing (ASAP) on meeting with Joe Sutton and his 
expectations (very high) on the Moore presentation.  I referenced oversizing 
the amount of the Synthetic Lease in order to keep the Canadian banks happy 
on the 90% Enron guarantee.  He agreed that the economics in the dash should 
still reflect the lower actual amount to be drawn down (currently U.S. 
$169MM).  Please note below his requests and delegated responsibilities in 
(brackets) below: 

Dave requested I revise the proposal (Adam) to show add'l NPV and IRR 
comparisons based on MAIN, ComEd and possibly ICF, and a 30 Yr, GENCO 
comparison (Kate).  Given the recent downward shift in some of the curves we 
may need to recompute our existing NPV and IRR #'s also (Kate).  Besides 
furnishing a graph for the referenced curves, I need to submit GENCO's 
capital cost comparison for peakers in the marketplace (Ben).  Further, based 
on the 30 year amortization, I need to show a graph of the build up of the 
components of capacity price and a break even earnings accrual price 
(Miguel).  I will need comparisons from GENCO of these two graphs as well as 
a chart comparing start costs, heat rate and Var. O&M contrasting the Moore 
Project with the GENCO peakers (Don and/or Jynsung or Clement or Ben).  In 
addition, Dave asked to get a Draft copy of the DASH ASAP (Chip).  Dave does 
not want to circulate the DASH for signature until he has met with Sutton. 

Thanks for your help.  
Thomas. "

Bill,

Thanks for your time today.  Attached are some materials I've written on my 
structure and an enhanced schematic.  When combined with what I gave you and 
this note you should have a pretty good idea of what I'm trying to accomplish.

First step is for Enron to come up with a prospective valuation for this 
plant each year for the next twenty years.  That valuation will set the 
maximum amount of debt we will allow the plant to carry in any given year up 
to a twenty year final maturity.  At some point,  the plant valuation going 
forward will exceed the outstanding debt because the debt amortises to zero 
whereas the plant will always have residual value to the end of its remaining 
useful life and at a minimum scrap value. 

Enron will then enter into two parallel and offsetting price risk management 
contracts which will pay a demand charge equal to debt service in exchange 
for formula floating payments.  The formula floating payments will be 
calculated as the positive difference, if any, between the generator strike 
price and a market index price for energy.  The two contracts will contribute 
to the credit of the project by their respective positions in the project 
flow of funds.  The top contract, (i.e. financial buy), will pay a demand 
charge to the project and will be on a parity in the flow of funds with debt 
service.  The lower contract (i.e. financial sell) will receive a demand 
charge and will be subordinate in the flow of funds to debt service and O&M 
costs.   The two contracts are engineered so that project revenue 
deficiencies will show up in the projects ability or inability to make the 
demand charge to Enron under the financial sell contract.  Therefore, the two 
contracts are opposite and identical except for their credit exposure to the 
project.  Flow of funds is as follows:

Revenues:
Merchant marketing activities to third parties
Demand payments from Enron under financial-buy
Energy payments from Enron under financial-sell
Other

Flow of funds:
Variable O&M
Debt service and financial-buy energy payments to Enron
Fixed O&M
Demand payment to Enron under financial-sell contract
Repayment of moneys owed Enron
Reserve replenishment
Equity

Payments owed Enron under both contracts will be secured by a subordinate 
lien on the same security package as the senior debt.

The two contracts should not create any MTM earnings effects or commodity 
desk VAR effects until one of them disappears.  At that point we hopefully 
have commodity hedge values that will offset the MTM valuation and VAR effect 
of the remaining exposed contract.

The contracts will be written directly to the trustee to avoid bankruptcy 
issues involving treatment of executory contracts.  The contracts will also 
be written through our Bermuda insurance subsidiary with offsets back to EPMI 
in order  to avoid potential insurance issues.

My plan is to charge a fee for entering into these two contracts which will 
be paid up-front.  Other features of the two contracts include:

No cross default,
The financial buy contract cannot be terminated for bankruptcy filing or any 
other such credit signal trigger,
Either contract can be terminated for non-performance (since financial this 
means payment default),
Either contract can be terminated at any time by either party by making a MTM 
payment except the financial-buy contract can only be terminated by Enron for 
non-performance.

Any questions, please feel free to call me at 3-4750.

regards,

Don

My comparison stops at Operating Margin because our analysis is done on a 
pretax basis and the debt service schedule are identical.  The primary 
difference is due to their assumptions with regards to annual merchant sales 
of available capacity after meeting contractual requirements.  We tried to 
value the merchant sales and it dragged down the value of the plants so we 
left it at 0.  Not suprisingly they are more bullish about their ability to 
sale the available electrons.  Take a look at the attachment and if you have 
any questions my cell # is (713)503-3107.  Thanks!

=20
they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone.  In thes=
e=20
cases we return the invoice to the vendor.  If the employee is designated, =
we=20
try to track him/her down and forward the invoice.  The high level of=20
employee movement among jobs and locations at Enron has made this=20
increasingly challenging.  Either way, we end up doing something less=20
productive than paying invoices.

To maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessa=
ry=20
for research, we request that employees who have pagers, cell phones, and=
=20
other individually billed items such as licenses, subscriptions, etc., pay=
=20
for them by personal check or charge card (if applicable=01*payment instruc=
tions=20
are usually indicated on the invoice) and request reimbursement through=20
employee expense reports.=20

By submitting these charges on your expense report, you can help us reduce=
=20
the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices, the number of=
=20
checks generated by Treasury, the number of vendors in our database, and th=
e=20
turnaround time for payment of invoices. =20

Incidentally, Accounts Payable is currently installing a corporate-wide=20
web-based expense reporting system similar to what Enron International has=
=20
used for the past year.  This will make it even easier to file your expense=
=20
report and receive quick reimbursement.

We=01,d like to make this effective immediately.  If you have any questions=
 or=20
suggestions, please contact the Accounts Payable department."

Randy:
I have a couple of items I am working and wanted to know from you.
1.  How will the annoucement of the 55 MW plant in R.I. and the potential 
stake in the 1,650 MW plant in Texas effect the current asset portfolio?
2.  I am working on a spreadsheet identifying all the current and the coming 
on-line merchant MW's in detail.  Can you provide me a detail list of which 
plant assets are merchant or are going to be merchant.  
Thanks,
Ben Rogers

This is to verify our meetings tomorrow on the following:


1.  Lincoln Electric (Russ/Ben) 10:00 a.m. to noon (conference room tba)
2.  Rochester, Mn (Russ/Ben) same as above
3.  Madision, WI (Erin/Mathew) 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. (conference room tba)


For each opportunity, I would like to line out a deal structure and formulate 
a base case and subsets for modeling.  I am totally open to ideas and input.  

I would also like to take our concepts and review with Geoff Allen (MAPP Mid 
Marketer) tomorrow afternoon as a cursory review.

If there are questionaires, input forms, etc. that are required for modeling 
efforts, we want to make sure we cover that as well.  In addition, we may 
want to have credit begin a review to verify the parties are creditworthy.  I 
know that Lincoln and Madision are highly rated, but I am not sure about 
Rochester.

Due to the short fuse on each of these, we need to be prepared to turn 
proposals around in 5 to 7 business days.

Thanks

Oscar

Could you please send us your latest operating model for Pastoria and LV 
Cogen? We are in the process of updating a spreadsheet to value the 
development projects. For now, we are concerned primarily with Net Income, 
Aftertax Cashflow, Capitalization, Capex and Debt Assumptions.

Also, since Winston is leaving for B-school soon, who should Ben and Jinsung 
contact for future modeling questionsconcerning Pastoria?


Thanks.

It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the=
=20
first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen.  We recogniz=
e=20
that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron=01,s business goals, and w=
e are=20
pleased that many of you have shared in the company=01,s financial success=
=20
through Enron stock options.=20

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=
he=20
All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided valu=
e=20
to participants through 2000.  Employees who have participated in this=20
program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of=
=20
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the=20
program.  =20

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package=
=20
and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron=01,s continued=
=20
success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and=
=20
Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid=
ed=20
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for=
=20
calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  =
It is=20
expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted,=
=20
effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib=
le=20
on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to=
=20
final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to=20
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and=20
international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base=20
salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on=20
December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some=20
international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.
? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated gran=
t=20
of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O=
ption=20
Program, among other good reasons=01( that=01,s why.

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =
=01)=20
Your Stock Option Program.  To provide information and answer your question=
s,=20
we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host=20
several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular=

basis.  In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact yo=

Human Resources representative.=20

Note: In addition to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, grant=

regulatory requirements.  It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock=

Today is my last day with the company and with all sincerity, I want to thank 
everyone for making my last 2.5 years so much fun.  It really has been a 
blast and I hope we keep in touch.  As you know, I'll be at Northwestern next 
year so if you're in Chicago, please look me up.  Take care, I wish you guys 
all the best.  Here is my forwarding info, but first...

No Iaia email is complete without a cheesy, Italian quote:
And so I leave you with the immortal words of Francis Albert Sinatra:

""And now, the end is near;
and so I face the final curtin.
I ate it up and spit it out.  
I faced it all and I stood tall;
And did it my way.""  

God bless that guy, anyway, here it is:

iaia14@hotmail.com
518-869-2280

It's been fun. Y'all take care now, y'hear?"

Hey Mike,
Thanks for the pics.  Where were the ones from which  looks to be a wedding?  
Hey, how many tickets were you thinking about? Were you thinking two for you 
and your Dad?  That weekend is April 1 & 3, 2000.  I'm not sure whether that 
is Easter weekend or not.  One other way to get tics is to go to 
www.finalfourseats.com  Let me know your situation.  Where are you spending 
the New Year?  Talk to you later.
Ben"

Attached is the latest weekly report.  You should notice a significant 
increase in forecast by the amount of the Acceleration for each project 
(previously shown as Unapproved trend changes, not included in forecast) 
totaling $21.5 million.   I am currently working with the developers to 
revise the forecast for the ENA expenses for such items as Spare Parts and 
Interconnect Costs.

The report does reflect Nepco payments through June with an Estimate to 
Complete.  However the report does not show actuals by budget line item for 
the NEPCO reimbursables for May (Gleason and Wheatland) or June.   Mike 
Miller and I are currently working with EECC trying to resolve three issues, 
one of which are timely accurate reports. 


Dave,

I did receive an invoice from EECC for the $9 million fee for the 2000 
projects, which I think Mike forwarded to you.  Let me know if I need to 
include the fee, previously pulled out, in the forecast.

Thanks Amy 3-7805"

 Congratulations Benjamin C  Rogers !

 You are a 2000 New York City Marathon Lottery winner. Cheers!

 YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS, DON'T YOU??

 You have earned the right to run 26.2 brilliant miles through the streets of 
New York City on Sunday, November 5, 2000! (Only 115 days to go.)

 AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, DON'T YOU??

 It's time to start training!

 Start RIGHT NOW by outfitting yourself with the official ""Training for 2000"" 
t-shirt! Why train in silence?! Let the world know your goal and wear a 
t-shirt that keeps your training on track.

 AND . . . because today is your lucky day, we have a great deal for you: 
order your ""Training For 2000"" t-shirt before 11:59pm* on Sunday, July16th, 
and the shirt is your's for the special price of $15 (regularly $18), or the 
Training for 2000 tee shirt and cap for $29.95! (Just note code #332 in the 
shipping instructions, and we will adjust your price!). To check it out, 
please visit the NYC Marathon website at www.nyrrc.org/merchandise.*

 Sincerely,
 Your friends at the New York City Marathon.

 *Hey, wait a minute! 11:59pm! What are you doing AWAKE? Get in bed and get 
some rest! You're a Marathoner in Training!

 **Also, now that your geared up, why not register for an NYRRC race and get 
acclimatized to the racing experience. Run with others, consume water on the 
go (not necessarily as easy as it looks), and start dress rehearsing for the 
big day. For information on our June favorites, visit www.nyrrc.org.

Dr. Ueng:
I wanted to mention this to you yesterday after the test, but didn't have 
time.  I was taking this course because I am applying to another business 
school and since I have been out of school for six years I wanted to provide 
the other schools with a recent academic record.  I was trying to get an A in 
the class, but my first test was not my best work. I feel that I did much 
better on the second test and that Brandon and mines case studies and my 
class participation were good enough to get me close to the A level.  That 
said if I am also able to get a recommendation from you I would greatly 
appreciate it.  I know that you are extremely busy now, so if I could get in 
touch with you at your earliest convenience that would be great.  Thanks for 
making the class educational and quite enjoyable.  Hope to talk to you soon 
and hope you can enjoy the rest of the summer.  

Regards,
Ben Rogers

Payroll FAQ=01,s

My paycheck has a line called =01&other deductions=018, what does that stan=

There is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck.  For=
=20
some employees, the number of deductions are more than we have room to=20
print.  In this circumstance, the system totals all remaining deductions an=
d=20
prints them on one line =01) titled =01&other deductions=018.  The detail o=
f all=20
deductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intrane=
t=20
at eHRonline.enron.com.

What do the earnings or deduction codes on my paycheck mean?
These definitions are listed on the Payroll webpage located at=20
hrweb.enron.com, select Enron Payroll  from the side index.

Why is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck?
Overtime is paid one pay period in arrears, therefore it will be reflected =
in=20
the next pay period. For example, if you reported overtime for the=20
July 1st =01)15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay ad=
vice=20
as =01+POvertime=01,.

What is the limit for Social Security (FICA)?
For year 2000 the limit is $4,724.40 on a wage base of $76,200. This limit =
is=20
applied to each Enron payroll tax company. Therefore, if you transfer to=20
another Enron company these limits will start over, however, the total amou=
nt=20
withheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub. Excess FIC=
A=20
will be credited to you by the IRS via your tax return.

What federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when I exercise stock=

options?
There is a standard federal income tax rate of 28% for these earnings. This=

As you are all aware, EBS has grown to be a significant part of Enron.  The=

it, =01&confirms the tremendous inroads Enron has made in the telecommunica=

business.=018  We expect this deal to be a springboard for enabling EBS to=

accomplish even greater things.

Because we believe that EBS is integral to Enron=01,s success, it is becomi=
ng=20
increasingly important for greater interaction among EBS senior management,=
=20
corporate leadership and our Houston-based business units.   In short, we=
=20
determined that it is necessary for the CEO to be based in Houston, althoug=
h=20
the Portland office will remain an integral part of EBS.=20

Joe Hirko as CEO and Ken Rice as Chief Commercial Officer have accomplished=
=20
great things, and we believe that both are completely qualified to fill the=
=20
CEO role moving forward.  However, Joe has decided to stay in Portland for=
=20
family reasons, and as a result, Ken will assume the role of CEO for EBS,=
=20
effective immediately. =20

Joe, unfortunately, has decided to leave Enron.  We want to recognize Joe f=
or=20
his role in making EBS a success.  He started the business, demonstrated it=
s=20
value to Enron management, and brought the team together to create the EBS=

vision.

We do believe that EBS will continue to grow and succeed under Ken=01,s=20
leadership.  Throughout his 19-year career with Enron, he has consistently=
=20
been a driving force in building businesses.

Please join us in wishing both Joe and Ken great success."

Hope all is going well and you have either finished or are almost finished 
your Phd.  I was wondering if I could be able to find out my grade for the

The time has finally arrived for me to leave the working world - tomorrow 
(7/28) is my last day at Bank United - and I will soon be leaving for 
Evanston, so I thought I'd pass along some info if you need to reach me.

I'll be in Houston until around August 23rd or so.  My home # is (713) 
665-5792.  I can also be reached at the parents' house at (281) 920-3113.  No 
more cell phone for now - drat!  My email address (until I get up to school) 
is: cbmcwherter@yahoo.com .

My contact info in Evanston is:

1600 Hinman, Apt. 1M
Evanston, Illinois 60201

(847) 869-7988


I'll forward my Kellogg e-mail address when I get it in September.  If you 
ever want to come up and check out Chicago, catch a game at Wrigley, or 
donate money to the McWherter Scholarship Fund, please let me know.  I'll be 
more than happy to take a break from the world of academia and do whatever.

I'm sure I'll see most of you before I leave, but if not, take care and I 
wish you the best.

Blake"

Hey friends:

As most of you already know, I had left Enron recently to embark on my MBA
program this coming fall. Sorry I don't have the time to visit with all of
you individually to bid farewell, and I would like to take this opportunity
to thank each and everyone of you for all your help and support over the
past 3 years I had been at Enron.

I am currently visiting my family and friends in Singapore, before heading
back to Houston to drive up to Boston. You can reach me at this permanent
email address, or alternatively, the following after 8/23/00:

636 HBS Student Mail Center
Boston, MA 02163-7807
(617) 493-1816
klau@mba.hbs2002.edu

Hope everything is well with all of you. Please keep in touch and take great
care of yourselves!

Best regards.

-Clement


p.s. Look for me if you are going to be in Boston area!

Dave:
Just wanted to say thank you for the invitation to Cafe Annie next Wednesday, 
unfortunately I will not be able to make it.  I can't tell how much I enjoy 
working within ENA and in particular the East Origination Group and with 
Genco.  Thanks again for the recognition and for giving me this opportunity 
to work in ENA.

Michael:
How's your summer?  Are you in Delaware now?  I am going to set up a
weekend in DC in the Fall and I will probably do it around homecoming
weekend.  I want to try and set it up for most of the people will huge out
with, but will take other suggestions.  I will be sending out e-mails to
everyone informing them of the weekend.  Choby is going to set up a bar to
rent out for Saturday night.  In the past, you have sent me e-mails with a
bunch of different e-mail addresses attached to it.  If you could send me a
list of the e-mails you have for our friends that would be great.  Thanks
for the help and lets talk about this further.  Talk to you soon.

Gents,

I made the following changes to this model:
I adjusted all the NPV functions to be as of 12/31/2000.
I incorporated the seasonal availabilities and capacities into revenue 
calculations.  Previous to this revision, all monthly merchant revenue was 
calculated using the Winter availability and Summer capacity.  All monthly 
PPA revenues were calculated using annual average availability and Summer 
capacity.
I cleaned up the update macro and added a nifty status bar progress indicator 
while the thing's running.

Let me know if you have any other revisions or corrections.

Jon

 Subject: Questions











Rich,

In working through our analysis for the revised proposal to Lincoln, I had the
following questions:

1.  In Lincoln's cost estimate of $545/kw, did this include SCR's?

2. Under taxable financing, what interest rate and repayment period would
Lincoln normally find acceptable?


Any input you could provide would be appreciated.


Thanks


Oscar

Just wanted to see how everything is going over there at EBS.  I had lunch 
with Andrew today and he was asking how everything was going.

Assume an 8% cost of money(taxable) and 25 year amortizaton schedule per our
Financial people. Assume also that we will need to include
a bond reserve fund of equal to one years P and I  plus about 1.5% financing
costs.  The latter two simulates the cost of taxexempt financing requirements.
which we are assuming taxable will be in the same ballpark of requirements.

Again the $545 does not include an SCR. When we got our PSD permit for our
Rokeby 3 unit, the informal quotes we got for that unit were in the
  1.6 to 2.0  Million  dollar range. In the end, we proved to EPA that the
addition  was not  cost effective by some convoluted economic analysis
they made us go thru. However it became very obvious to us, this is their next
regulatory objective. We were so convinced that our Rokeby3
was going  to need an SCR we had internally resigned ourselves to that
unpleasant assumption.
We would assume a 45mw unit's cost would be about 2/3 the cost of this larger
unit 90MW machine ie Rokeby 3..

 Subject: Questions











Rich,

In working through our analysis for the revised proposal to Lincoln, I had the
following questions:

1.  In Lincoln's cost estimate of $545/kw, did this include SCR's?

2. Under taxable financing, what interest rate and repayment period would
Lincoln normally find acceptable?


Any input you could provide would be appreciated.


Thanks


Oscar

I think I have cleaned this one up.  I removed the PPA portion (2001-2003).  
I haven't played with the debt too much; I just reduced it to give us roughly 
the same coverages as we had in the previous model.  Please review and let me 
know what I missed -- I'm sure there are a lot of things.  I have to take off 
around 3:00 this afternoon to turn in the keys from my old apartment, so 
e-mail your changes, and I'll get on it first thing tomorrow morning.

Subject: Revised Due Diligence Indices


Stuart,

Attached are a clean and a blackline version of each of the due diligence 
indices for the six plants.  As you know, I have recently made several 
additions to each of these indices based upon my time in the data room this 
past week.  This includes recent documents for the 2000 peakers as well as 
other previously unseen documents that came from the boxes that were given to 
me by Don Miller.

I understand that Jinsung and Ben Rogers had previously given the prior 
drafts to Ben Jacoby and others to review for redacting purposes.  It will be 
necessary and useful to give these blacklines to those persons doing that 
review to note the recent additions and review these as well.

I also understand from Carolyn Gilley that she will coordinate with Lorie 
Leigh regarding the creation of the due diligence files on Live Link.  It 
seems relevant that Jinsung and Ben Rogers are also aware of how this process 
would work.

My understanding, and I will confirm that this is done, is that Carolyn's 
scanning personnel are to be scanning in the additions into Live Link today 
per my request.  There is also some filing and re-filing that will need to be 
done in the data room and I have alerted Lorie Leigh to this fact via voice 
mail on Friday.

I seem to have left Don Miller's, as well as Ben Rogers' and Jinsung's, 
e-mail addresses at my home over the weekend.  By copy of this e-mail, I am 
asking Lorie to please forward it to Don, Ben, and Jinsung.  She has 
confirmed to me via telephone that she will do so.

If you or any of the others involved in this project have any further 
question, please do not hesitate to call me.  Thank you.

Best regards,

I reworked the debt section to eliminate tranche 1.  Tranche 2 now amortizes 
years 1-10 and pays 11% interest.  Tranche 3 amortizes years 11-20 with 
interest of 11.2%.  I re-solved for optimal amortization schedules and face 
amounts to get a minimum coverage ratio of 2.25x and an average coverage of 
3.25x.

I removed some references to the amortization of the power contract that 
Jinsung pointed out.  I also re-hardcoded the state franchise tax for Gleason.

Let me know what else needs re-working.

congratulations on the birth of your twins - thats great!  If there is any

By the way, I had a really good conversation with Rocky Storie the other

P.S.   Hello, Ben!    This is Cindy.    I just wanted to let you know that 
Stan has recently decided to open up, print, and reply to all of his own 
e-mails.    He did receive your initial e-mail and had typed up this message 
but saved it as a 'draft' and never sent it to you.   I just so happened to 
look in his 'draft' folder yesterday and saw this message, asked him about 
it, and he said to forward it on to you.     So, he hasn't been ignoring you 
(ha)...he just forgot to send the draft message.   This is just between you 
and me, okay?    ha ha     Don't joke with him about this....he's trying to 
become more knowledgeable in the technical area.    I just hope he doesn't 
decide to get rid of me!  ha ha      Have a great day and call me to set up a 
lunch with Stan."

Attached please find the weekly cost report.  The only material change is a 
reduction in Gleason Start-up Fuel/Power.  A credit for the sale of power was 
not booked against the project until after closing.  I am working with Ben 
Jacoby, Fred Mitro, and Chris Booth to review Estimate to Complete and Total 
Projects.   We are focusing in on a couple of areas, one being the 
Westinghouse Turbines.  We have withheld money for Liquidated Damage claims 
for both Wheatland and Gleason.

Additionally, we have scheduled the final Nepco audit for August 28th - 
30th.  We will be reviewing actuals, estimate to complete and ultimately the 
final forecast.  


Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks Amy 3-7805

After having conducted our first of several business reviews, Enron Global 
Markets - Office of the Chairman would like to outline the following 
organizational changes effective immediately.

The Global Risk Markets group under Jere Overdyke illustrates enormous 
opportunities given the size of those businesses.  To better focus on the 
different commercial functions and to capture market share and value, the 
group is being realigned.  Jere will continue to manage Global Risk Markets 
and build on our insurance capabilities.  Mark Tawney is responsible for our 
weather business and will now report to the EGM Office of the Chairman.  

Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President of 
Operations and Chief Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of 
the Chairman, and to Sally Beck, Vice President of Global Risk Management 
Operations.  In his role as Chief Accounting Officer, Brent will also report 
to Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for 
Enron Corp.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila Glover, 
business controller for Financial Products; Todd Hall, business controller 
for weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for global products and 
coal.  In addition, Tom Myers will join Brent's management team as Director 
of Accounting.  Brent and his team are responsible for all accounting, risk 
reporting and trading operations for all the businesses within EGM. 

Cindy Skinner will join the Enron Global Markets team with responsibility for 
Human Resources.  She will also report to David Oxley and the HR organization.
 
Please join us in congratulating everyone in their assignments. "

This is the model from KN regarding their 4 LM 6000 Plant and their other 
plant which has 6 LM 6000's and I EA.  These numbers are hard to follow so 
they probably won't make a lot of since, without me going through them with 
you, which we can do when I get back.  I will be back tomorrow night and will 
be checking my messages.

2.  (Lick finger and wipe on her shirt)  Let's get  you out of these wet
clothes.

3.  Nice legs...what time do they open?

4.  Do you work for UPS? I could have sworn I saw you checking out my
     package.

5.  You've got 206 bones in your body, want one more?

6.  Can I buy you a drink or do you just want the money?

7.  I may not be the best looking guy in here, but I'm the only one
    talking to you.

8.  I'm a bird watcher and I'm looking for a Big Breasted Bed
    Thrasher, have you seen one?

9.  I'm fighting the urge to make you the happiest woman on earth
     tonight.

10.  Wanna play army? I'll lay down and you can blow the hell outta
       me.

11.  I wish you were a Pony Carousel outside Walmart, so could ride
      you all day long for a quarter.

12.  Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that was a braille name tag.

13.  I'd really like to see how you look when I'm naked

14.  Is that a ladder in your stockings or the stairway the heaven?

15.  You might not be the best looking girl here, but beauty is only
       a light switch away

16.  Are those real?

17.  You must be the limp doctor because I've got a stiffy.

18.  You can feel the magic between us...No, lower!

19.  I'd walk a million miles for one of your smiles, and even
       farther for that thing you do with your tongue.

20.  Girl, if you were a porch I'd take out all the nails and screw
       ya
21.  If it's true that we are what we eat, then I could be you by
      morning.
22.  (Look down at the crotch)  It's not just going to suck tself.

23.  You know, if I were you, I'd have sex with me.

24.  You. Me. Whipped cream. Handcuffs. Any Questions?

31.  Hi, the voices in my head told me to come over and talk to you.

32.  My name isn't Elmo, but you can tickle me anytime you want to.

33.  I know milk it does a body good, but DAMN, how much have you
been  drinking?

34.  If you were the last woman and I was the last man onearth, I bet
      we could do it in public.

35.  Wanna come over for some pizza and sex? No? What you don't like
      pizza?

36.  I may not be Dairy Queen but I'll treat you right.

      without me.

38.  Do you sleep on your stomach at night? Can I???

39.  Do you wash your pants in Windex because I can see myself in
them.

40.  If I told you you had a nice body, would you hold IT against me?

41.  I lost my puppy, can you help me find him? I think he went into
       this cheap motel  room.

42.  If I could rewrite the alphabet, I would put you and I together.

Ben -

 Here are my comments to the CA.  The only substantive comment has to
do with the procedure to follow in the event of a legal proceeding that
requires disclosure.  The procedure you proposed is a pretty tough standard
for us to follow, and I would prefer a procedure more along the lines I have
proposed.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

Elizabeth and I would like to thank everyone who came to our wedding and
shower.  It wouldn't have been the same without all of your participation.
We have returned from our honeymoon in Hawaii and are now moved into our new
apartment here in NYC.  We are now trying to move all of our wedding and
shower gifts into our little one bedroom apartment.  It's a good problem to
have, though.  If you are ever in town, please give us a call.  Thanks again
and we look forward to seeing you in the near future.

Ben, Matthew, Jim, Jason:

As per discussion, I have created a common folder 
o:naes/from_ko/LM6000s/Control, for storage of the cost configuation model 
and finanicial base model.

Since Ben has to model Lincoln by next week, I suggest we use his model as 
the go forward base model from now onwards. By modeling an actual 
transaction, it would be easier for us to identify needed changes and links.

If you guys have time, please look thru the model and list the changes 
needed. We could then have a meeting next week to go through the suggestions 
and discuss how to coordinate taking turns working on the model.


Ben:

I will continue making cosmetic changes to the model for now, but I would 
make sure that the changes do not mess up the economics of the transaction.



Everyone:  

If any of you need to model anything, please use this base model. If you do 
not have access to the directory, please create a security request form 
through lotus notes.

Thanks.

Enron news release

FYI

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
-----------------------

Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement
said to be worth an estimated $666 Trillion.  In the deal, Enron will
provide
both gas and electric commodities to Hades' facilities throughout and
under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former CEO of energy monopolist
Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy management division.  Said
Rockefeller, ""Obviously Hell has significant heating demands.  While
eternal flames are a great idea in concept, they require vast and reliable
fuel
resources.  Enron was the only supplier willing to make a deal with my
boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just like the way they do business.""

A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
together during negotiations.  According to the company, ""The deal fits
both companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and
retain new customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for
millennia to come.""  According to several energy industry insiders,
Hades' high heating demand with very little need for summer air conditioning
make it a very attractive energy portfolio addition.

Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained
high growth rates over the last two thousand years.

Enron is one of the world's leading energy and communications
companies. The company owns approximately $37 billion in energy and
communications assets.  Enron ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's ""Best
100
Companies
to Work For if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A
Week,"" and is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked
by customers with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply
contracts.

Charlene,
Hope you do not mind a direct (email) solicitation, but I was referred to you 
by Ben Rogers who I have recently met in my new
position with Pulp & Paper on the 29th floor. I have a friend who is 
interested in a Finance-related
position with Enron.   I think you will find his resume to include a broad 
base of education and experience
that would fit in with this company.

If you have a need for someone of his background, please feel free to contact 
him directly.
I have attached his resume for your review.

Thanks very much,

Camille 
3-6150
