Sold some of the Ene stock. just saw a clip of moller (like 6 seconds). it 
was a collage of witnesses from the WTC blowup. It was on like the first day

Take care,

Great to hear from you.  Glad to know everyone's doing well.
Did you know Moller was going to be on TV or were you just channel
surfing?  How did he do?

Work's going OK.  ENE stock has been getting destroyed.  A lot
of negative press abt management.  I would sell your shares if
you still have them.  It's $30 right know but I have a feeling 
it's going lower.  Tell Dave also if you talk to him.  News has

Anyway, Lisa's job is going great - she's really happy.  We haven't
been up to a lot lately - just hanging around the neighborhood.

The anthrax scares and the terrorist stories are really scary.  What
a bunch of nuts we have living in this world.  I have a feeling it
could get worse before it gets better.  Don't open any letters from

C'mon you can play 18 then do housework all afternoon.  If you're just starting you don't get many invitations!  Truthfully, I'm usually napping after golf, you're always surprised how tired you get after 18 holes!

I've gotten some interest from various groups within EES, EGM and hopefully Industrial Markets, but it's tough.  Everybody is cautious, nobody's going gangbusters.  I've been pounding the pavement almost full time for 2 weeks.  Need to close something before heading back to Seoul.  I brought my family back to Houston and they're staying, but I'll head back to Seoul in a week or 2.

I think the only difference btw the 330Ci and the 330i is that the Ci
is a 2 door.  

Had a choice btw Wed and Thur game - chose Wed.  Not that disappointed
though as the Astros proved to be the biggest bunch of pussies in the
ML.  They were more concerned with not giving up a homer to Bonds than
with winning the game.  Now they stand a chance of not making the playoffs
at all.  If you ask me they don't deserve it and the mgr should be fired.

It was great to hear the fans booing the home team every other inning.  I'm
sure they lost a lot of fans over those 2 games.

Anyway, what's up on your front.  Are you still going out to Cali to visit
Hop and Denise?  How's flying?

I think the 330 is the better call.  You really don't want a BMW as a family

but the 330ic is pretty sweet.

Subject: RE: 


Drive 'em both, but at least for the older one's the 8 cyl was MUCH
smoother.  It really comes down to what you want.   Unless you're really
pushing it you won't notice much of a difference.  However, what you
will
notice is that the 6cyl will be working a lot harder (i.e. louder).
Once
you jump into the 5 you're in the luxury market and you probably want a
smoother car with plenty of torque (8 cyl).  Especially the way you
drive
(not winding the engine out in every gear) you'll feel more low end
power in
the 540.  Again, it comes down to the pax.  If you're hauling 2 most of
the
time, the 530 is probably fine;. hauling 4 it will be sucking wind a
bit.
Remember when you're on a test drive the car isn't configured the way it
will be in real life.  The tires will be under inflated, the gas tank
(large
in that car, like 14 gal ~90 pounds) and no passengers so your
performance
will seem better.  My best advice when looking at cars in that price
range
is to insist on an extended (overnight or over a weekend) test drive of
both.  You don't want to buy and wish you had bought the other a couple
of
weeks later.  Finally, think about long term (kids, etc) if you plan on
hanging onto it as long as the Miata.  It's not uncommon for a bimmer to
go
2-300,000 miles without engine work so you can hang onto them for quite
a
while if you stay up on the maintenance.  Give me a buzz at home
(301.737.5366) tonight if you want to yap about it.

Real quick on the cars.  The beamer is real tight in the back seat.
Think
about how often you might be hauling 3-4 people.  If you think it's a

I'd
still look at the Vovlvo S-60 twin turbo, it might surprise you.

I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section
154.
It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the
astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and
2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of
work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem
is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand
into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really
big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning
toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's
a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and
should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying
time???

That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.  I don't expect him

of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he
was

Conway,

Do you have T.J.'s new email address.  I want to let him know I
won't be out there in Oct.  Give me a shout.  How's everything going?

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Talk to you soon.

Thanks for the advice.  Much appreciated.  We plan on test driving
this weekend.  The BMW has a racing track in the back of the dealership -
I heard it's pretty sweet.  I have a feeling we're going to lean toward
the 330i just b/c everything I've read rates it the best in its class.
I feel like the 5 series will be too big for us right now (w/o kids) but
we should get a better feel this weekend.  I'll keep you informed.

Thanks again.

Subject: RE: 


Drive 'em both, but at least for the older one's the 8 cyl was MUCH
smoother.  It really comes down to what you want.   Unless you're really
pushing it you won't notice much of a difference.  However, what you will
notice is that the 6cyl will be working a lot harder (i.e. louder).  Once
you jump into the 5 you're in the luxury market and you probably want a
smoother car with plenty of torque (8 cyl).  Especially the way you drive
(not winding the engine out in every gear) you'll feel more low end power in
the 540.  Again, it comes down to the pax.  If you're hauling 2 most of the
time, the 530 is probably fine;. hauling 4 it will be sucking wind a bit.
Remember when you're on a test drive the car isn't configured the way it
will be in real life.  The tires will be under inflated, the gas tank (large
in that car, like 14 gal ~90 pounds) and no passengers so your performance
will seem better.  My best advice when looking at cars in that price range
is to insist on an extended (overnight or over a weekend) test drive of
both.  You don't want to buy and wish you had bought the other a couple of
weeks later.  Finally, think about long term (kids, etc) if you plan on
hanging onto it as long as the Miata.  It's not uncommon for a bimmer to go
2-300,000 miles without engine work so you can hang onto them for quite a
while if you stay up on the maintenance.  Give me a buzz at home
(301.737.5366) tonight if you want to yap about it.

Real quick on the cars.  The beamer is real tight in the back seat.
Think

I'd

Kamp,

Did you watch the Astros / Giants game last night.  It was embarrassing.  I've never
seen such a cowardly performance by a baseball team (of course I'm talking abt the
Astros).  When do you ever walk a guy with runners on 1st and 2nd, your team is 
down by 1 run and there is 2 outs?  Answer:  NEVER.  According to Dierker,
""... the critical walk was the one with runners on first and second,"" Dierker said. ""We did that because Jeff Kent was 3-for-17 against Williams and had struck out the last five at-bats (against him), so he showed some dominance against him. Obviously, you don't want to put another runner on base and move the runners another base in scoring position unless you have a very compelling reason, and we did.

How's long's this clown been managing.  I guess he hasn't followed Kent the last few years.  It wasn't like he was walking Bonds to get to 
Ivan DeJesus.  He doesn't even have the sack to admit he fucked up.  I've never seen fans boo their home team so much since the days of Michael Jack.

Have you and Patty been getting any sleep? How's Jack?

new car?  On my end, the classic motorcycle is buzzing like  a champ and a
complete blast to drive.

What's with the faggot Astro's walking your boy?  At least he pocketed one
record.

I don't have TJ's email w/ me, but I'm sure he never expected you to
actually show up in the first place.

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Talk to you soon.

Kamp,

How's everything going -I assume great?  How's the baby and Patty
doing?

How 'bout that Barry Bonds?  You must be in heaven - (1) baby boy,
(2) Yanks win the division, (3) Bonds goes for record.

I think Bonds is going to break the record Wednesday night in Houston.
Guess who'll be sitting in section 154 (check it out on the Astros
website) waiting for # 71.  Look for me on TV.

Don't know if you talked to Conway, but it looks like i'm going to cancel my trip in a couple weeks.
I really don't feel like flying right now with all the shit going on and the impending military strike.

No,

There's been a lot of shit happening with my company and frankely,
I don't know what's going to happen over the next few months.  As a 
result, we decided to wait at least a few months until our financial
situation is better known.  

Glad to hear everything's going well.  Did you go out to California?
What are your plans over Thanksgiving?

I've been super busy the last two weeks.  The pace seems to be cyclical and
we are definitely in high gear right now.  I don't expect it to slack off
until the Thanksgiving break with another push coming just before Xmas.  The
good news is, I am a third of the way through.

Did you ever get a car?

AP Camden,NJ: A terrorist cell has been broken up in Camden just east of
Philadelphia. Four of the members have been apprehended by the Camden
Police, with the fifth still at large. Arrested in the Camden sweep were
Bin Eatin, Bin Smokin, Bin Sleepin and Bin Drinkin. All are being held on
illegal immigration
charges. Police stated that they can find no one fitting the description of
the fifth cell member, Bin Workin, in the area. But Camden Police are
confident that anyone who resembles Bin Workin would be easy to spot in
Camden.

Robin,

How's everything in NY?  The flow of info around here has been horrible.  I
have no idea on what's happening - a bad situation to be in obviously.  We're
just reading all the news on the wires.

Just starting to look at some options in case the trading desk vanishes.  Do
you know if Sempra in CT is still looking for people.  I figure it's time to see
what else may be out there.

I'm sure we'll talk a little later.

Let me tell you who won't win - RU.  They are arguably the worst
division 1 football team I've ever seen.  I saw them for the 1st time
this weekend on TV.  They are horrible.  Hope everything's going well.
Life at Enron sucks.  I'm sure you've been following the situation.
I'm sure there'll be a #1 bestseller written about this circus.  Talk

Kevin,

This has to be one of the *ugly* games of the year.  The only saving
grace (and it isn't much of one either) is that the winner gets to say
they won their last game.  For Cal, that would be their only win.  I'm
going to be in OC at my in-laws, and I'm going to try to get an Internet
broadcast.

If Rutgers wins, I'll buy you a drink the next time I see you (actually
I'll buy you a drink regardless).  

Hi to Lisa - hope you guys have a Happy Thanksgiving.

Subject: Comments concerning Line Pack Gas Purchase Agreement form provided 
by Vector.

Kevin,
 As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form 
before Enron North America Corp.  can agree to use it.

1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon 
its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 
31, 2000.

2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance 
notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to 
Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at 
the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point 
of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as 
specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement.  The parties agree that time is of 
the essence in this Agreement..

3.  Add 4.2 to read as follows:  4.2  If Vector fails to purchase and receive 
from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it 
under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of 
Force Majeure, Vector shall indemnify Seller and shall be liable to pay 
Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have 
been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under 
the heading ""Daily Price Survey"" under the listing applicable to Chicago and 
using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector 
failed to perform multiplied by the volume Vector failed to purchase and 
receive from Seller for such day.

4.  Add the following language at the end of 9.1.  For breach of any 
provision for which an express remedy or measure of damages is herein 
provided, such express remedy or measure of damages shall be the sole and 
exclusive remedy hereunder.  If no remedy or measure of damages is expressly 
herein provided, the obligor's liability shall be limited to direct actual 
damages only, such direct actual damages shall be the sole and exclusive 
remedy hereunder and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are 
waived.  Unless expressly herein provided, neither party shall be liable for 
consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, lost 
profits or other business interruption damages, in tort, contract, under any 
indemnity provision or otherwise.

5.  Add the following Seller's information in 10.1.
 Enron North America Corp.
 P. O. Box 4428
 Houston, Texas 77210-4428
 Attn:  Documentation and Deal Clearing Desk
 Facsimile No. (713) 646-4816.

Of course your Dad would be invited to anything we do, but if you'd rather 
spend the
time alone with him that weekend we could always make it another weekend.  
The only
problem with the 12th is that we'll be consumed with the move the entire 
weekend.  Let
me know what works for you.  We're flexible after the 12th.

Stacy,

Kevin Ruscitti has requested a secondary firm ANR ML7 phy gas product for 
EOL.  I have located some language that you and Dale worked on back in May of 
2000.  Please let me know if this language will be OK for our needs.  Also, 
will the current GTC for Phy gas need to be revised in any way?

Thanks,

CW

A US Gas Transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which Seller shall 
sell and Buyer shall purchase a quantity of natural gas equal to the Daily 
Contract Quantity at the Contract Price on a secondary firm basis. The 
Contract Price shall be as submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The 
Period of Delivery shall be from the Effective Date through the Termination 
Date.
The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the 
Product description on the Website.
The transaction is for delivery at the ANR Pipeline Company ML7 
interconnect.  The volumes scheduled to be delivered are subject to 
reductions due to normal operational constraints on the ANR  Pipeline Company 
pipelines based upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused 
by these constraints are excused nonperformance and are not considered a 
failure to receive or deliver firm gas.  In the event that the volumes 
scheduled are reduced due to such normal operational constraints, Buyer may 
designate a secondary firm delivery location.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the 
Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of 
British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per 
day.

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

We'll just be doing some house shopping.  I think we're going to postpone the 
upgrade to
the existing house and look to buy a new house.  This would eliminate the 
need to move
out for 6 months.  I'm dying to live in a house that is complete.  Anyway, 
besides this we
don't seem to have much going on.  I'll just need to go into work for a few 
hours on Sunday.

Let me know what you want to do.

You're correct, Enron doesn't get too involved in these conventions.  I don't 
know 
why.  It seems that some of the desks have some functions but mine never 
does.   My desk
seems to be pretty apathetic (probably not a good thing).  I think we've 
relied, more than
any of our other desks, on the financial and e-commerce sides of the 
business.  Probably
not a great thing.  Anyway, lets get together for a cocktail or dinner 
sometime within the 
next month.  Did you guys move to the Galleria location yet.  Let me know - 
we'll go get 
a big steak at Morton's or Ruths' Chris.  I assume a country boy like you is 
into some
good red meat.

Stamos, 

Glad everyone had a good time at Sweets'.  I hope he had a blast.

In terms of your email reply,
you can have Calpine.  How are they going to make money long term if price 
caps are instituted?  This obviously would be the stupidest policy.  In 
addition
their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are 
they
going to get paid?  I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most 
regulated state in the country.  Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, 
it's 
going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??  PG&E and Edison
International are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to go
down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, noone
out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The 
politicians
are a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute 
stupidity
of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more 
focused 
on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.  I honestly think 
they are incable
of solving the problem.

Stamos,

I don't think many buying opportunities out there.   The economy is going to 
get 
crushed this year.  There's only one place to put one's money now, and that 
is in cash.
The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an 
increase in
plant shutdowns and company layoffs.  The Fed could continue to lower rates 
but there'll
be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.  I feel we've 
just seen the beginning.  
I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April.

Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear.  The crisis 
is not a short term
problem.  As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that 
state's economy goodbye.
Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate 
prices in the country, and 
(2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst 
of a hi-tech meltdown, what would
keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state??  
If you own any
CA real estate, sell.  The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to 
reduce demand or increase supply.
Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue 
likely won't be solved anytime
soon.  So, how do impact demand??  You have to price energy(power/gas) so 
high that
the discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves 
by closing its plant, cutting
back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak 
hours.  California will see
this reduction in demand over time.  If the blackouts subside it's because so 
many businesses have
closed their doors for good or moved to another state.  Without this, the 
blackouts will get much worse.
If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity 
and gas, I would bet it will go
bankrupt within 2-3 yrs.  Could you imagine the impact on the national 
economy from the bankruptcy 
of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.  Obviously this is only my opinion, but 
I would keep my eyes on
the energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.  Take Care 
and thanks for the email.

That state will never be the same.  My prediction is that the state will be
bankrupt within the next 2 years unless the Federal Gov't bails it out.  I 
hope
Lowery has held off on buying his house.

Talk to you this weekend.  I blew off the Montana trip so I'll be home.

Great to hear from you.  Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball 
game.
Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.  We 
should start
construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.  I 
definitely would
not do it if I had to do it over again.  One redeeming factor is that we 
bought on a good 
block.  We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.  We should get a 
pop in real
estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.  

Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer 
combined with
a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.  There is no doubt that the CA 
economy is going
to suffer a great recession.  You have a shortage of supply so the only way 
to ease the
problem is to reduce demand.  This usually occurs when prices reach levels 
where the price
sensitive buyers cut back.  However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for  
price caps, this won't
happen.   The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so 
this will probably
need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.  The other factor, of 
course, is that you
could have an increase in supply - new power plants.  But being that the amt. 
of time it takes to 
develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most 
other states combined
with the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an 
increase in supply
doesn't seem likely in the short term.  Again, this is only my opinion, so 
you could take it with
a grain of salt.  

Talk to you soon.

BL,

Have you experienced any blackouts yet?  I think you'll see a lot this summer.
What does everyone think about the situation?  Do they think it's a threat or 
not?  I think
the state is in for a horrific summer - I hope it doesn't turn out that way, 
but it'll be incredibly
difficult to avoid.

Hope everything's going well with work and with the family.  When's the next 
time you'll
be in Dallas?  Let me know.

Jen,

Great to hear from you.  Early congrats on your graduation.  Everything has 
been
going well down in the Lone Star State.  I got married in September down the 
Jersey
shore and everything has been going well.  We bought a house back in May.  It 
needs
an incredible amount of work.  We own the ugliest house on the block, by far.

How are things in Indiana?  Are you and Paul still together?  How is he 
doing?  When
is the last time you were back in Jersey?  We went back over Christmas but 
only for
a couple days.  I think next year we'll go back during New Year's instead of 
Christmas.
If you ever get near Texas or pass through Houston, please give us a call.  
You both
are always welcome to stay at our house.  My phone # is (713) 880-4157.  My 
work
# is (713) 853-6320.  Hope to hear from you soon.

The following article appeared in today's Chronicle.



Jan. 25, 2001, 10:59PM

Enron rating setup irks many workers 
By L.M. SIXEL 

TONGUES ARE WAGGING at Enron Corp., and it's not because of the bonuses 
they're expecting next month. 

Employees are irate about a new performance-review ranking system that pits 
them against each other. 

Under the system, nicknamed ""rank and yank,"" employees will be put in one of 
five categories: 5 percent will be identified as ""superior,"" 30 percent will 
be labeled ""excellent,"" 30 percent will be called ""strong,"" 20 percent will 
be labeled ""satisfactory"" and 15 percent will be called ""needs improvement"" 
or ""issues."" 

An insider said ""needs improvement"" means ""you have one leg hanging out the 
window."" And ""issues"" is Enron lingo for ""you're gone."" 

The rankings, whose names reportedly took Enron officials hours to come up 
with, are not based just on performance. 

Instead, they compare employee against employee. 

""It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher 
level compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current 
period if other employees' performance raised the bar,"" according to a memo 
from Chief of Staff Steven Kean and Executive Vice President Cindy Olson that 
was distributed this month. 

While employees are competing against each other for ratings, they're also 
expected to be team players, according to the memo. 


`Horse-trading' of rank denied
The problem, according to someone familiar with the new system, is the 
horse-trading that goes on when the rankings are divided up. 

Managers trade rankings like baseball cards, explained the insider, offering 
to downgrade one employee if they can get a better rating for another 
employee. 

An employee's ranking is more a function of the negotiating skills of the 
manager he is working for, the insider said. 

Olson, who's over human resources and community relations, said no 
horsetrading is going on. The rankings, due out this week, aren't set in 
stone, she said. Only 9 percent of employees were rated in the bottom 
category while 6 to 7 percent were labeled superior, she said. 

But Olson said she can see how employees might be worried about the prospect 
of bargaining. 

She speculated that one reason employees might worry is because it's a new 
system for about 60 percent of Enron's employees. In years past, only the 
wholesale energy services group was ranked this way. 

Some human resource managers expressed surprise that Enron, which is known 
for hiring superstars, apparently feels that it must get rid of so many 
employees -- or at least put them on notice that they're not doing well. 

It doesn't say much about the confidence of your recruiting system if you're 
getting rid of 10 to 15 percent of your work force each year, said a human 
resource manager in Houston who asked to remain anonymous. 


Some may not fit in
Some people, as smart and talented as they are, just don't fit into Enron's 
culture, Olson said. It's a company that doesn't tell people what to do; you 
have to know what adds value, she said. Some folks just have a hard time in 
that environment. 

After thinking about it for a moment, Olson added that maybe Enron's 
recruiters aren't doing a good enough job weeding out the people who wouldn't 
do well in an entrepreneurial environment. 

Forced ranking systems were popular several years ago. But they fell out of 
favor, in part because they were seen as damaging employee motivation. 

Several years ago, Houston Lighting & Power put in a forced ranking system, 
dividing all employees into four groups, with ""1"" the top group and ""4"" the 
lowest. Employees were so angry with the system that some work crews had 
T-shirts printed: ""Don't ask me -- I'm a 3."" 

Olson said she doesn't see a problem with motivation. People like to know how 
they stand and will work hard to reach the top category, she said. 

But many of the employees -- at least the ones who rate above satisfactory -- 
won't know how they're rated. Managers don't have to reveal the ratings. 

And as for figuring out what it takes to be superior? You've got to reinvent 
your job, add new business lines or create something totally new. 

""Employees understand that when it's explained to them,"" Olson said.

Correction,  I don't think thinks will blow over this summer, I think things 
could blow
up and actually be a lot worse than they are now.  In terms of longer term, I 
think
a lot depends on how the state tries to resolve the problem.  It will be 
interesting to
see.  I feel that the summer will be very interesting, especially if 
California gets the
kind of heat they had last summer.  Stay in touch.

The house thing is a tough call.  It's hard to say.   If you're not in any 
hurry to buy, the summer should give
you a good indication of continuing energy problems.  I personally think that 
the problem will come and go 
for a while, but a lot depends on how California's legislature deals with the 
situation.  I have no idea what 
they'll end up doing - they've acted pretty poorly already.

What's your time frame on a house?  If you're only concern is that prices are 
at their highest level in the last 
decade, I wouldn't worry too much about that.  It's impossible to time the 
market -  who would've thought 
San Francisco's housing prices would be at these current levels.   There are 
also a lot of intangibles associated 
with home ownership as your aware of.   

I would be concerned about the energy situation, so just try to keep abreast 
of it.  Also, you could call me if you
have any questions.  I'll try to help the best I can.  Take care and tell Kim 
and Kendall I said hi.

Kevin

Subject: Everythings Big in Texas?


Chump!
This energy crisis is making me question  my timing on buying a house.  I'm
thinking if the economy tanks the housing prices will dip a little.  They
just crack the highs of 1989 this last two years.  Any opinions?

I start my Texas travel in February.  I'll be in Dallas for the first full
week and back in March in Dallas again.  Starting the end of March I'll be
there almost every week for about 6 months.  You'll be seeing more of me than
you want.  When we get closer to March I'll give you a buzz to set up some
dates.
Sorry about the Kendall picture, I'll try again.

Take care, B

Mr. B. Lowery,

First of all, you sent me a picture with the head cut off.  I couldn't even 
see Kendall.
I don't know if something happened with the translation of the file, but try 
to send
it again if you can.  

In regards to California's energy crisis, I think that California is screwed 
- big time.
I think it has the potential to cripple the state's economy.  If, like you 
said, noone 
really talks about it much in SoCal, I would bet that will change soon.  It 
has the potential
to affect every person in the state.  Not only will consumers end up bailing 
out the
utilities - SoCal Edison, San Diego, Gas and Electric, PG&E - but it will 
likely prevent
many new companies from setting up shop in California.  After all, who would 
want
to put millions of dollars in an operation that will be subject to power 
interruptions 
while paying the highest utility bills in the country.  I think that the only 
way California
will come out of this OK, is if it has the least energy intensive weather for 
the foreseeable
future.  I don't think this is a problem that will be resolved within the 
next couple years.
But remember, that is just my meaningless opinion.

When do you start coming to Texas.  Let me know so we can try to hook up.  
I'll talk to
you soon.

Counnnnnnnnn,

What's up?   I heard Conway emailed you the other day about New Orleans.  I'm 
going to 
meet Conway and Jughead in N.O. on Nov 17 - 19 for a weekend getaway.  I just 
booked
my flight a couple days ago and wanted to see if there was any way you could 
make it
down.  It seems Conway has gotten a cheap hotel room with his military 
discount - one of the
perks of working for Uncle Sam.  I'm sorry for the short notice but we just 
decided to do it a 
few days ago.  If you could make it, we'd all love to see you.  If not, we'll 
have to get together
when I'm in NJ over Christmas.  Tell Chris we said hi.  Hope everything is 
going great for the
both of you.  Talk to you soon.

Sorry it's taken me so long to reply, but I just checked my email.  We were 
out of town the
last few days.  It sounds like you've been doing a lot of thinking and 
reflecting.   I think it healthy
to analyze one's actions in order to better understand oneself.  This better 
understanding, I find,
typically leads to self improvement and greater control, and ultimately, more 
happiness in life.
However, do not let it lead to any form of regret - that would be unfair.  We 
all have regrets, but
these regretted actions typically make us stronger and better people in the 
long run.  

I forwarded your email to Patty Kampmann, not Patti Campi.  As you might 
imagine, I got a kick
out of that.

Talk to you soon.

Cherly,

I have been promoted out of the Associate program last PRC.  As a result, if 
you could take me off the Analyst/
Associate distribution list I'd deeply appreciate it.  Thanks and let me know 
if you have any questions or if you
haven't been notified of the promotion.

TJ,

Thanks for the congratulatory message you left on our voicemail - it made us 
feel great.
We actually didn't go on a honeymoon - we will take one sometime next year.  
We've just
been swamped with the house we recently bought.  We bought an old small 
bungalow
in the city.  What a money pit.  Hope everything is going great.  Tell 
everyone we said
hi.

Thanks again,

Kevin"

The one thing I remember is that they are incredibly expensive and somewhat 
troublesome
to maintain.  Depending on how old it is, I definitely  wouldn't recommend it 
as your primary car.

Hope you had a good time at the wedding.  It was one of the best weekends 
I've had in ages.

Talk to you soon.

I appreciate the email.  I figured something must be wrong for you to miss 
the big day, but I was afraid to call.  The
important thing, obviously, is that you get better.  We'll just have to 
figure out a way to meet up with you in the near
future.  Tell everyone I said hi and keep me informed of your operation and 
recovery.  We'll all miss you very much.

Hugs and Kisses,

Kevin.

not have anyone else's email,
but Moller should be able to provide you with Coun's and Ricigiliano's.  Just 
ask him.  Let me know if you need anything

Hey bro

What is happening?! Fishing stuff is coming along. The charter is set for
Sept. 22nd in the A.M. departing from point pleasant. Capt. Gene will get
back to me in a week or so with more details.

The cost is $50 per person. No bottles allowed but you can bring cans or
cups. I've got the beer and drinks. Also pack food. Trip should be about 8
hours.

Contacted Rich Moeller and let him know about the time and specifics. It
looks like 14 people are going with the possibility of about 20 (5 are still
undecided). Should be a good time.

If you have some e-mail addresses for Rich or Rosigliano or a couple of
other people please supply them to me so I can keep everyone posted on the
details.

The big date is less than 4 weeks away (Can you believe it?)

Hope all is well,

Keith

Please forward this on to Mike and Kevin.  The turnaround time is rather
quick so you probably should contact this person directly to tell him that
you will be coming and sending a check to the address referenced in the
invitation.  Just tell him that you received the invitation from Kara Kinder
Howes (my cousin) and David Kinder.  Kara is one of the hosts of the event.

DK

This is the guy's name.

Alberto,

You're best bet is to send a resume to Chris Gaskill.  Chris is starting a 
new fundamental analysis group.  I know he
is looking for a few more people to get this group off the ground.  If you're 
interested in trading, it's probably the best
way to get involved in this side of the business.  I'm not sure if you have a 
long term interest in trading or if you're just
looking for a rotation.  Give me a call also after 4pm and I could provide 
you with some insight into the area.

Until then send Chris an email with your resume attached or you could talk to 
me first if you'd like.

Luke's growing like crazy.  Great to see the update.  Yeah,   the wedding is 
getting near and
the plans are pretty much complete.  We're really just having family so the 
plans at this point are minimum.

How's everything in California.  Is Lowery showing up on your doorstep every 
Sunday at dinner time?  I wouldn't
be surprised.

Did I tell you about the dinner I attended in NY a month ago.  What an 
event.  The party included - get this crew - 
Bill Ricigliano, Dan Sweetser, Jonathan Counnnn, Richie Moller, Brian Sh., 
and yes, Vincent Lima.  We were
all privey to Moller drinking a 12 oz. glass of fresh piss.  Some things 
never change.

Talk to you soon.

Good to hear from you.  The name of the jeweler is William Crescent and his 
phone
number is (708) 418-5075.  He is located in Lansing IL and his address is 
18049 Torrence Ave
Lansing, IL  60438

Let him know I recommended him and if he doesn't remember me tell him I was 
referred
by Greg Penmann and Mike Curry.  They both bought their engagement rings from 
Bill.

He's a pretty cool guy so just tell him what your looking for in terms of 
cut, clarity, color,
and carat.  He'll receive a number of stones that fit your description and 
describe them
over the phone.  He should encourage you to shop his prices.  I found him to 
be very
competitive.  Let me know how it goes.

Are you available to meet next Tuesday afternoon around 4pm.  Let me know.

Kevin"

You're correct, I am saddened to see such a great x-Philly treated so 
poorly.  I often look back 
with wonder at how much ground Stocker would cover at the shortstop position, 
not to mention
his tremendous power for a man of such small stature.  He could only be 
compared to x-Philly
and future hall of famer - Ivan DeJesus.  The only uncertainty is whether or 
not Ivan will elect
to be inducted under the Philly or Cubs uniform.

On the house front,  we purchased one and moved in at the beginning of May.  
It's a fixer-upper.
All our weekends are spent working on it.

I gotta run, but thanks for the email.  Let me know how everything is going 
in your world.  Tell
Rina and the kids we said hi.

Kelly,

I spoke with my friend and he mentioned that Michael was already talking to 2 
firms and he
didn't want to recommend a third at this time.  I told him that if anything 
changes, let me know.
It was worth a try anyway.  I'll talk to you soon.

That would be great.  Let me know so I could get tix to a ballgame if the 
Astros are in town that weekend.
I'm going to the game next Monday to see McGwire and the Cards.  Glad to hear 
everything's going well.

I got a call from Peremes on Saturday.  She heard I got engaged and was 
pissed I didn't tell her.  I think she's
smoking serious crack 'cause I told her when I talked to her about 6 mos. 
ago.  I guess she just chose to ignore
me as usual.

Talk to you soon.

KR

P.S.  We just closed on a house this past Friday.  It's in need of some 
serious work.  Hopefully it'll be
habitable by the time you see it. "

Chump,

Long time no hear.  Sorry it's taken me so long to touch base with you.  
Between work, the wedding,
and the fact that we just purchased a house (pending inspections) I've been 
pretty stressed.
As far as the wedding goes Lisa and I have decided to scale down 
considerably.  We're only going
to have immediately family and the folks in the wedding party.  For me that 
includes you of course, Moller,
Kampy and Peremes (even though she won't be in the wedding).  Don't tell her 
though, she's the only
one I haven't mentioned anything to.  I'll make sure you and Moller get to 
share a room.  I feel kinda bad
about not inviting Lowery since I was in his wedding, but I don't feel like 
dealing with Kim.  She's really 
annoyed me the last few times I've seen her.

We still plan on having it at the B&B in Long Beach Island.  We'll have a 
catered dinner for about 45 folks.
It should be more manageable and cheaper this way.

Do you have the exact date when you'll move back to the states?  I'm psyched 
you'll be a lot closer.  You
could swing over to Houston and check out the new house.  By that time we 
should have it in decent shape.
We bought the ugliest, most beat-up house on the block.  It definitely needs 
a lot of work.  We'll be busy for
the next year working on it.  I think when it's done,  it'll look pretty cool.

Anyway,  send me an email and let me know how everything's going and when 
you'll be back.  Take care and
tell Marie we said hi.

Congrats Murli,

Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you.  I'm glad you accepted a job 
at Enron.
I know you'll enjoy it.  As far as ECI goes, what group is this?  Is this the 
Communications
group?  I would not recommend EES however.  I think you're experience would 
be better
at ECT (now ENA) or Enron Communications.   Give me a call at 713-853-6320 
(W) and
we can talk.  Also I'm still in an apt so I don't know any real estate 
brokers to refer you to.

Talk to you soon.

Dave,

It was great getting a chance to finanlly meet the other night.  Hope you 
enjoyed dinner.

Since then, I've been thinking abt some of our conversation re: the PBR.  I 
have a quick
question - why wouldn't you under withdraw in Feb and over withdraw in Mar if 
Mar is currently
higher than Feb.  You could lock this in by buying Mar forward.  Also,  what 
happens if you
withdraw in Mar and the Summer peaks higher than what you withdrew at?  How 
is this accounted
for?

I'll talk to you after you get back from Houston.

Great to hear from you.  Things have been going well in Houston.  Lisa is 
working for Johnson Controls.
It must be a long time since we've talked b/c she's been with Johnson for 
about 5 months.  I love my
new job - I'm trading gas up in the Midwest market area - Illinois and 
Michigan.  Things have been 
incredibly busy.

The wedding plans have changed considerably.  As I'm sure you can relate to, 
the stress of planning 
combined with the input of so many others have made us decide to have a 
wedding with only our folks 
there and not even have a reception.   We figured we could put the money 
toward a house and save
a lot of anger, frustration and stress.

How's the job, new house, and Terri doing?  Have you been to many Bears 
games?  The Scarlet Knights
have been so inconsistent this year.  I think a lot is due to their youth.

Let's talk soon.

T.J.,

I need your LA address.  I'm sure I have it some place but I can't find it.
How's everything going?  How's Rena?  Are you heading home for the 
holidays or staying in LA?

Also,  if you have Lowery's address and phone # could you forward it.

Thanks,

Subject: FERC Staff Concerns on the Gas Side

Folks -- 

Had a good discussion with a Senior Staff member at FERC in preparation for 
the Pipelines Outreach meeting next week.  He told me that the two issues on 
the gas side that are of primary concern to the Commission are 1) Marketing 
Affiliates and potential abuse on the pipelines (Think El Paso); and 2) the 
failure of CFTC and/or SEC to more closely oversee derivative trading. 

Apparently, staff is considering whether to ban all transactions by marketers 
on an affiliated pipeline, and some form of filing/reporting requirement to 
better understand the derivative market.  Due to a lack of information, some 
at FERC are assuming the worst.    

I believe these proposals are in the formative stage and have not been 
presented to Senior Staff or Commissioners as a recommendation.  I think 
Staff would appreciate some information (ammo) to refute the need to further 
regulate marketing affiliates or delve into derivative trading.

INGAA filed comments and a study concerning Marketers' use of affiliated 
pipelines in response to the Marketing Affiliate Conference at FERC.  These 
are attached.   Staff questions whether the underlying information remains 
accurate.  We are considering whether to update the underlying information 
used in the INGAA Study and how best to address these issues (probably during 
Q&As) during the Staff Outreach.

I believe it would be helpful to put back together the coalition that Leslie 
Lawner used at the last Market Affiliate conference to request a meeting as 
part of the current Staff Outreach to discuss Staff's concerns.  In addition, 
I think it would be helpful to request a separate ENRON meeting with Staff to 
discuss how the derivative market works and why FERC does not need to 
establish ongoing reporting requirements or otherwise become involved in 
these markets.  Unfortunately, in this meeting we would probably be asked 
about our involvement in the El Paso Merchant Transportation deal into 
California, in light of Peggy Hegg's comment on the Frontline Show that El 
Paso hedged some of the risk with Enron.  

We can discuss further on Friday's call.  Later Joe

By copy of this email, I am asking Mary Cook to send to you a draft of the 
latest form of MNA.  This MNA , I believe, is still a work in progress and is 
intended to include  only  Master Agreements for which we are comfortable 
that the underlying transactions are commodities subject to the special 
bankruptcy code protections.  Hope it helps.

Elizabeth,

We are working on a settlement transaction which will leave a variety of
relationships in place with a group of financially troubled companies. We'd 
been
negotiating a netting agreement, and after you spoke to our group, it occurred
to us that we ought to take a look at your netting agreements for potential 
use
in our transaction. Could you please forward an example of one to me? We would
be netting with multiple parties on both sides, so it will be a ""rectangular""
netting arrangement, if I recall your descriptive terminology correctly.

Thanks much.

Paul Puchot

By the way, thanks very much for sharing your efforts with us. My comments 
about

David, 
spoke to trader, Steve Lowe of SOCO, and his main concern for the added 
language on our Enron confirmations, was to add specification of the INTO 
SOCO delivery point.   Referenced when the do business into Cinergy and 
Entergy there are constraints on transmission.   Just now started placing 
language (5/24 deal 621448.01) to our confirms, when Firm LD into SOCO, when 
SOCO purchases. 

Steve also mentioned his legal contacts, would like to discuss the EOL GTC's.

Please contact SOCO's legal for further information:  Lyle Larson  (205)

and if needed, trader Steve Lowe  (205) 257-7326.

As predicted Consumers have started the arbitration process. Andy Edison has 
been kept up to speed with all of this by me so between him and Dynegy we 
should be in good shape to progress.
 
If you need any other information please ask, otherwise I will keep you 
informed as this matter progresses, both from an arbitration stand-point and 
any attempts to commercially settle this dispute.

your playground! Whether you're looking for a romp in Mexico or the 
Caribbean, or fun in the sun in Orlando or Las Vegas, Excite Travel 
can help make your vacation plans a reality.

***FEATURED THIS MONTH***
Orlando
Save $150 on Your Orlando Vacation!
Orlando is one of the greatest all-ages playgrounds in the United 
States. There's Walt Disney World (""the happiest place on earth""), 
cutting-edge rides at Universal Orlando, underwater fun at SeaWorld, 
and more. If you haven't visited in a few years, come see what's new 
in Orlando! 

Jamaica
Win a Seven-Night Caribbean Cruise!
Reggae and rays. If that doesn't sound like fun, we don't know what 
does. Jamaica has that great Caribbean combination of laid-back 
mellowness combined with lively nightlife and tons of daytime 
activities. So lie back and relax on the beach. Or set off on an 
adventure exploring Dunn's River Falls, hiking, or scuba diving. 
The choice is yours. Book now!

Cabo San Lucas
Discover the Many Moods of Mexico!
Cabo San Lucas is world-famous for providing fun in the sun--and 
after the sun goes down, too. The waters of the Sea of Cortez are 
fabulous for water sports including diving, fishing, and sailing. 
There's also world-class golf. And after dark, the city throws a 
great party just about any night of the year. Don't let the town's 
small size fool you--there's enough fun here to fill a major city. 

Las Vegas
Vacation in Style at Caesars Palace!
The only hard part of a Vegas vacation is deciding what not to do. 
That, and picking a hotel! One property you can't go wrong with is 
Caesars Palace. Caesars celebrates the decadence of the Roman Empire 
with gorgeous gardens, sumptuous restaurants, and a 23,000 square-foot 
spa. As they say, when in Rome...

Due to the flooding, electrical and communications problems in Houston over 
the weekend, several Enron Information Technology systems experienced 
outages.  At this time all critical systems have been restored and should be 
operational.  

In the process of restoring service, several user and common data directories 
had to be restored from the backup tapes from Thursday evening.  Therefore, 
some of you may be missing data files on your H drive or M drive that you 
created or modified on Friday.

Just a friendly reminder that if you still want to a credit annex in place 
with Powerex, Powerex's outside counsel needs a ""go ahead"" from Powerex 
before he is willing to negotiate. (In other words, the Powerex folks 
probably need a push from you to authorize their outside counsel.) 

I realize that with the change in energy prices, this may not be a priority 
any longer.  However,  I wanted to bring it up in case you still wanted an 
annex in place for future reference.

Enclosed is a draft collateral agreement for discusion at the next meeting.  
We attempted to develop one that was simple and not onerous to comply with.  
I expect to send out a note shortly announcing that the next meeting will be 
at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs on August 10.

Leslie --Stuart Zisman is working to finalize a Purchase and Sale Agreement 
(""P&SA"") as to the New Albany plant and is trying to be fully informed  as to 
outstanding contracts in relation to the plant known to the legal's power 
trading group.  He will meet with a large group on this project at 11 a.m. 
this morning.  On information from the midmarket group, I have confirmed to 
him there are no trading contracts currently in effect, committing sales 
from  the plant.  He is also inquiring about a 'Station Service Agreement' or 
any other basic agreement(s) in effect  allowing the plant's operation 
(beyond those referenced in the P&SA --see Schedules 4.1(m) and 7.1 --I'll 
bring you a copy of these Schedules).   As you may have been involved when 
such contracts would have been negotiated or placed in effect, would you give 
Stuart any information you have on this at your soonest opportunity?  Thanks.

FROM: Mark Whitney, TheLaw.net Corporation
HOMEPAGE: http://www.thelaw.net
REMOVE: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm

     Legal research often comes in waves, but as night follows day, that 
onerous monthly commitment to West or Lexis is always there. But with so many 
new options, it doesn't have to be this way.


--VIABLE ALTERNATIVES ABOUND

     True though it may be that your West or Lexis rep is out to put you on 
that fat annual contract, both companies offer a variety of online 
alternatives. A person can:

----log in and buy most any document for a few bucks
----Shepardize or Keycite for around $4
----subscribe to KeyCite for $35 a month
----rent a state for a week for $40
----conduct transaction based case law searches only when you have to
----Supreme Court case law from 1790 is now available on the web for FREE
----California state case law from 1934 is now available on the web for FREE
----the landscape continues to change rapidly


--CHOOSE THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB

     There can be no question that the commercial value of proprietary legal 
research resources will continue to drop as more and more primary and 
secondary materials migrate online. At TheLaw.net Corporation we advocate 
choosing the right tool for the job. And one of the best single tools you can 
own these days is our flagship software solution, TheLaw.net Professional 
Legal Browser.


--LESS THAN $1 A DAY FOR EVERYTHING, UNLIMITED ACCESS

     For just $395 annually for an individual, TheLaw.net gives you a 
remarkable foundation of primary and secondary resources, on an unlimited use 
basis, with a national scope, including, but certainly not limited to, the 
following:

----A great proprietary, searchable case law database that includes the U.S. 
Supreme Court, the 13 Federal circuits, the 50 state supreme courts and 
intermediate appellate courts. See, http://www.thelaw.net/caselawgrid.htm

----Literally millions of searchable cases, updated four times daily, offered 
on an unlimited use basis

----Streamlined access to:
------Federal and state statutes, rules and regulations
------the CFR and Federal Register
------executive agency databases and bill trackers
------nearly 1,000 news resources
------another 1,000 reference desk tools
------nearly 10,000 practice area helpers and much, much more
------over 50,000 documents and databases
------all just a fast click or two away on your desktop 24 - 7 - 365


--THELAW.NET MAY OR MAY NOT BE ALL YOU NEED

     Depending on size, practice area and/or jurisdiction, TheLaw.net may 
well have everything you need. If not, West and Lexis are available online, a 
la carte for those times when you really need them. As an example, TheLaw.net 
is not yet a great resource for Federal District Court opinions.

     It all depends on what you want your life to look like. If the 
convenience and elegance of the gold standard is worth the rates charged by 
the legal research cartel, you should keep doing what you've been doing and 
renew that annual contract with Company A or Company B. If not, and you feel 
like you continue to get hammered at a time when given the efficiencies of 
computerized distribution of data, prices ought to be dropping, we can help. 
Our number is toll free: 1.877.4.LAWNET [877.452.9638] or see us on the web 
at: http://www.thelaw.net

Consumer advocates propose suing energy suppliers, which is consistent with 
the focus of the subpoena that PG&E wants the bankruptcy court to issue to 
suppliers.---sch
Who'll pay billions in PG&E debt? Consumers, taxpayers and asset sales are 
among the options.
By Claire Cooper
Bee Legal Affairs Writer
(Published June 11, 2001) 
A judge's decision not to meddle with electric rates has left open the 
biggest question in the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. bankruptcy case: Who 
will pay the utility's nearly $10 billion in bills? 
Ratepayers? Last week's decision by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali left 
rate-setting to the state Public Utilities Commission. But experts aren't 
ruling out PUC approval of major increases in the prices charged to PG&E's 
customers. 
Taxpayers? They'd foot the bill if the state bailed out the utility, another 
reportedly live option. 
Creditors? They could, as one consumer advocate says, ""cannibalize"" each 
other in competing for PG&E's assets. Though PG&E says creditors will all be 
paid in full, it hasn't said how long that will take. 
PG&E Corp., the utility's parent? It might be forced to infuse the utility 
with cash. PG&E also could sue energy wholesalers to recoup overcharges or 
could sell off its own power generators to raise cash. 
Until last week, when Montali made it known that he won't raise retail rates, 
the two major players in the bankruptcy proceedings -- the utility and the 
official creditors committee -- had agreed on most matters that came up in 
court, including the need for a rate increase. 
""Now, it's going to get maybe a little uglier and less friendly,"" predicts 
Jesse Fried, a bankruptcy law professor at the University of California, 
Berkeley. ""It looks like they're just going to have to sit down and decide 
who's going to eat the loss."" 
Fried says the ""right answer"" should be PG&E Corp., which requested 
deregulation of the energy market and profited from it until soaring 
wholesale prices left the utility subsidiary with massive debt, in part 
because retail rates were frozen. 
Between the time deregulation was passed and the end of 2000, the utility 
transferred $3.9 billion to its parent corporation before filing for 
bankruptcy protection April 6, according to a state-ordered audit. 
To force the corporation to repay the money, says Sacramento bankruptcy 
lawyer W. Austin Cooper, Montali would have to conclude that the transfer 
defrauded the utility's creditors. 
Montali has the power ""to pierce the corporate veil"" to find the answer, says 
Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights. 
But Cooper predicted a different scenario: sale of significant portions of 
PG&E assets -- such as generators or transmission lines -- to pay creditors 
and repay the state for electricity it has purchased on the wholesale market. 
At a meeting Thursday between the utility and some of its creditors, PG&E 
chief financial officer Kent Harvey said the utility's hydroelectric 
facilities are worth between $3.9 billion and $4.2 billion. James Lopes, the 
utility's bankruptcy lawyer, declared the subject of a possible sale off 
limits at the meeting. 
Rosenfield predicts it will remain off limits because, he says, the state 
would begin talking about seizing the generators rather than risk a sale to 
an out-of-state buyer. 
He favors another option: suing the out-of-state companies that have been 
charging the highest wholesale energy rates. 
""If I were the small business that supplies pencils and paper clips to PG&E, 
I would want to collect some money from the energy companies that overcharged 
PG&E for power until the state stepped in to buy the power in the utility's 
place,"" he said. 
If PG&E filed an antitrust case against those companies, it could be tried in 
Bankruptcy Court, according to Cooper. 
Discussion on that subject also was ruled off limits by Lopes. 
However, Harvey said the utility has requested a probe by the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission. 
And PG&E has been providing information to state agencies probing the 
out-of-state firms, spokesman Ron Low said. 
Rosenfield predicts growing pressure for a state-sponsored PG&E bailout like 
the $2.76 billion plan proposed by Gov. Gray Davis to keep Southern 
California Edison out of bankruptcy. 
Under the Davis proposal, the state would have spent $2.76 billion to buy 
that utility's power transmission lines. But the Legislature shelved Davis' 
plan, and Rosenfield warned that any such bailout would be forced to a public 
referendum, ""along with any politicians who supported it."" 
Stanford University bankruptcy law professor Marcus Cole says the long-range 
success of any plan for PG&E ""depends entirely on the prospects for 
profitability"" -- that is, pegging retail energy rates to wholesale costs. 
""PG&E is not a charity,"" Cole says. ""It's there to provide a service. The 
only way it's going to do that is if it can generate profits.""

Enron Community Relations and Aggies@Enron <mailto:Aggies@Enron> are planni=

Enron has made a corporate contribution of $500,000 to the American Red Cro=

Although Enron is supporting the American Red Cross, please feel free to ma=

We know that many Enron employees have been severely impacted by this=20

make sure that your immediate needs are being met. If you have been displac=

have been displaced, an account has been set up at the Enron Federal Credit=

Union to accept donations. Please bring/send your contribution to the Enron=

done  ... and not just that; I'm cruising the internet, investigating the 
Broadmoor's ""professional"" tennis camp for the weekend of August 10, 11, 12 
and booking rooms.  I asked for 4.  How's your game?

In the meanwhile I've been trying to call you but I can't get through to 
Portland.  Is it raining there?  Give me a call.

So great is the humor about all this WSPP stuff and the tennis backdrop that 
I would be willing to ""come out of retirement"" and enter the doubles combat 
zone.  The thought of Clyde Durham, itinerant journeyman, former Bible School 
doubles player from Kansas, striding on to the court to do battle with that 
little runt of a MIke Small,  this fuels my competitive imagination to the 
point of red hot coals.    I need to go see my cousin in Boulder and could 
work something in around this event. If there is room for me to go to the 
WSPP meeting, not the full camp thing, and you don't mind,  consider me in.

Attached are the short form of GTC's that we would like to use in connection 
with our telecom transactions.  Certain provisions of these GTC's are 
bracketed and I would appreciate your view as to whether or not these 
provisions should be included.  Also please note that I have incorporated the

Alan:

I will put on the fax to you shortly two memoranda relating to the foregoing; 
one that discusses the general agency law that may be applicable to 
transactions executed by the Service Companies and a second one that gives 
some background to the reasons and underlying authority for the use of such 
companies in a Registered Holding Company system corporate structure.  The 
second memo includes a form of ""checklist"" that you may want to employ in 
negotiating and documenting ECT's power and fuel contracts with these 
entities.  Also included with the fax is a form of Services Agreement for New 
Century Energies, a registered holding company, since the memo refers via 
example to some of the provisions in that agreement.

Please give me a call if you have any questions or want any further follow up.

Subject: Contract Standardization Meeting



As you know, the next meeting for the Wholesale Electric Contract 
Standardization Group will be held this Friday, May 7, on the 4th floor of 
EEI's offices at 701 Pennsylvania Ave, N.W. from 9:30 a.m. * 3:30 p.m.  
Attached are the agenda and draft contract for discussion at the meeting.  If 
you plan to attend and have not already done so, please fax back to 
202/508-5673 the form sent to you on April 13, or respond to this message by 
using your e-mail program's ""ReplyTo"" function.  If you have any questions or 
concerns, please call Kathy Seaman at 202/508-5757.

Those still planning to reply to the book-out survey may send their responses 
directly to Caroline Goodson at cgoodson@schiffhardin.com for summarization.  
Should you have confidentiality concerns, you may send them to EEI at 
kSeaman@eei.org; we will then strip out any identifying material to ensure 
anonymity and forward them to Caroline.

We hope that the subcommittee groups will be able to report the results of 
their efforts so that we can devote time to these issues at the meeting.  
Please pay particular attention to anything in the contract that's bracketed, 
as these will be major areas of focus at the meeting.

Hi Karen

Going to the legal conference.  Lucky me. I get to go only for Wed. night and 
2 hours on Thurs. then get to fly to DC for meetings w MH and others 
regarding contract standardization.  

Your analysis is historically correct but recently we have changed our 
policy. The new policy is meeting w limited sucess.

Let me know if you need any thing else.

don't think the current gas form permits assignements in connection w 
financings, but I could be wrong. let me know what else I can do."

Friday morning would be great for the Gibbs & Brun lawyers to meet with 
Tabors.  They have been speaking to him about a meeting in DC next week but 
if we could do it here it would be fantastic.  Let me know if you can get 
Tabors to stay over.

Thanks

Comments on the draft.

The language in 3.1 and 3.4 should be enough to show control of the 
generator's running status by EPMI (which has been delegated to Enron -SE 
Corp. for control area responsibility purposes).

In 3.8, Yes, EPMI would need to schedule the gas and electricity.  Please add 
""EPMI is responsible for scheduling any necessary transportation to the Gas 
Delivery Point and transmission from the Energy Delivery Point.""

5.2  Change ""energy"" to ""power""

12.1 As you discussed with Sam, this agreement would have to be filed at FERC.

First, on the Control area services agreement, (1) Add ""Area"" after Control 
in the title  (2) 2nd line-- should be ""EPMI to ESE"" instead of ""EPMI and 
ESE"".    Also, Whalley will be ""                        ""  (I'm checking what 
his title will be and I'll call you so we can finalize and you can initial 
it).

Second,  the LT purchase agreement that was filed at FERC between EPMI and 
SCC was a power purchase agreement.  The new agreement is a tolling agreement 
whereby EPMI delivers gas to Brownsville Power.  Would EPMI transport the gas 
on the pipeline?  or would ECT?  Several months ago, Stacy Dickson called and 
asked me if I knew whether EPMI could buy natural gas or transport natural 
gas  (as opposed to ECT, which does this under the FERC blanket, I think).  I 
told her that I didn't know and she said she didn't think that the particular 
deal she was working on would be structured with EPMI, so not to look into 
this.  Therefore, as I recall, I did not get an answer to this.  I also have 
not looked into the gas side of Genco (see note below).  I thought that Becky 
Cantrell and Julie Gomez handle the gas side for ECT.  If you want me to 
check into this type of question on the gas side, let me know.  I can also 
ask Sam B. who may know right away.  (I have not worked on the gas marketing 
side, just the pipes, so I would need to look this up.)

I had a thought this morning.  The three plants are fueled with gas.  GENCO 
buys the gas from ECT, and then transports it to the plant.  Is there any 
FERC reporting requirements related to the gas transactions?

As you may know, a group has been convened to develop an industry contract
to trade gas.  The group is called GISB-Canada and as the name suggests,
they intend to use the GISB gas contract as the Base Agreement and to
modify the language to make it applicable in Canada.  At first, they were
just going to change language like ""MMBtu"" to ""joule""; ""jurisdiction"" to
""province""; and reference a Canadian Bank interest rate rather than the
Wall Street Journal.    They were going to stay away from what they deemed
""substantive"" changes.

I have asked them to reconsider this decision and to take the opportunity
to ""update"" the GISB, hopefully, in a manner that could be used
cross-border.  I have explained that most of our counterparties supplement
the GISB with their own Special Provisions and we could use these
supplements as a starting point for creating an Industry Standard GISB
""update"" that could be used cross-border.

In this regard, would you please send me a copy of your company's Special
Provisions so that I can forward them to Ian Anderson in Canada.  Also,
would you please put me in touch with someone in your organization that
might be interested in participating in this effort.  I think it would be
very helpful for the Canadians to hear about our experience with GISB and
gas trading in general in developing an Industry Standard Contract.  The
next meeting in Canada is this Wednesday at 12:00 p.m. (Houston Time) and
again on June 26.  I would like to send them something to consider prior to
the June 26 meeting.

Thank you so much for your help on this.

Dede Russo

I'm not sure what their issue is but the CFTC issue related to thier interest 
in being able to terminate their purchase obligations for a price.  This is 
the type of provision we can't have in the contract because of CFTC

Western Power Market Stands 'Poised on the 
Precipice' According to the ICF Kaiser Consulting
Group's 1999 Bulk Power Outlook

FAIRFAX, Va., June 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Power markets in the Western System 
Coordinating Council are ``poised on the
precipice'' of capacity shortfalls and extreme price volatility this summer 
and next, according to a new study of the regional
market by the Energy Practice of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``The West 
stands at least a one in three chance of
experiencing price spikes similar to those seen in the Midwest market during 
the summer of 1998,'' said Judah Rose, a Senior
Vice President with the Group and the director of the ICF study.

ICF's analysis of the West points to a number of key near-term implications: 

     Regional Capacity Deficits. The region is in a delicate supply/demand 
balance, with most sub-regions of the West relying
     on a capacity surplus in the Pacific Northwest to meet near-term peak 
capacity requirements. Because demand growth is
     outpacing new supply additions, those deficits will only become more 
extreme over the next two years.
     Volatility Exacerbated by Hydroelectric Dependence. A fifth consecutive 
year of above-average hydroelectric generation
     -- the principle cause of the Pacific Northwest surplus -- will again 
mask the West's precarious supply/demand balance in
     1999. However, if the drought conditions of the early 1990s resurface, 
the West will find itself at an even greater risk of
     price spikes.
     Upward Pressure on Prices. Prices are on an upward trend for 1999 and 
2000, the result of both higher regional spot
     natural gas prices and the increasing value of ``pure capacity'' -- the 
value of ensuring reliability for consumers. 

The study also evaluates the long-term future of the Western market and 
highlights the following key results: 

     Capacity Requirements Growing Steadily. The region's underlying demand 
growth is strong, creating a long-term regional
     capacity need totaling more than 18,000 MW by 2005, unless there is a 
serious economic downturn in the region.
     Energy Prices Trending Downward. The trend for long-term energy prices 
is for negative real growth through 2010, but
     the region will remain susceptible to near-term volatility while market 
institutions continue to evolve and new supply is
     slowly added over the next few years.
     Capacity Prices Rising Slowly. Current low capacity values will continue 
to rise (but still remain below many other
     regions) as new, more efficient generation is added.
     Strong Gas Demand Growth at Stable Prices. Gas demand for power 
generation is poised to more than double by 2010,
     with the most explosive growth in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest 
subregions. Even so, the West region's vast gas
     supply potential appears capable of meeting this growth with little, if 
any, real price appreciation through 2010. 

``The Western U.S. Region volume of our Bulk Power Outlook, along with the 
other five regional volumes, offers
comprehensive insights into the rapidly changing North American power 
markets,'' said Sudhakar Kesavan, President of the
ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``No other firm can match our analytic 
capabilities -- which are based on an understanding of the
fundamentals driving electric power markets -- and the knowledge gained from 
working one- on-one with the market's key
players.''

About the ICF 1999 Bulk Power Outlook

ICF's analysis of the Western market is part of the 1999 Bulk Power Outlook, 
an authoritative assessment of North American
regional bulk power markets through 2010. The study also provides the 
analytical basis for ICF's extensive and well-respected
consulting services providing market assessment, asset valuation, and project 
due diligence evaluations for the North American
electric power and natural gas industries. The 1999 Bulk Power Outlook is 
available for six regional markets -- West,
Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, South Central, and Canada -- well as a 
National Subscription, which includes the six regional
studies and a North American summary volume. Additional information on the 
1999 Bulk Power Outlook, including a
prospectus, sample volume, and order form, can be found at 
http://www.icfkaiser.com/consulting/products/BPS.htm.

The 1999 Bulk Power Outlook is part of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group's 
growing family of products and services. Related
studies on energy and environmental issues recently completed by ICF include 
the SO2 Allowance Market Outlook and the
Ozone Transport Region: NOx Allowance Study, which detail ICF's views on air 
emissions allowance markets.

To all subcommittee members:

    Attached is the final draft which is being sent to TMOS for
approval.  Because the participants voted 7 to 3 to keep sections 5.2
and 5.3 as they are currently drafted, no changes were made to those
sections.  I reviewed and used most of TXU's and Southern's edits
regarding typos and clarification, which I appreciate.  If you would
like to see the changes, then go to Track Changes and highlight on
screen.

    Thank you all for your help. Hopefully this agreement will be
approved at TMOS and then TAC.  I will (or Naim) will keep you apprised.

The approval process initiated last year for ECT-NA customer and employee 
meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5K has enabled ECT to better 
evaluate the business value of events, accurately track our activities and 
save money.  Please be sure to follow the procedures described below so we 
can continue to successfully manage our events.

-  All ECT-NA meetings and events with costs in excess of $5K must be 
reviewed by the ECT Public Relations department and approved by the ECT-NA 
Office of the President before making any commitments to vendors or customers.

-  Depending on your needs, the PR department will either work with you to 
plan and produce your event in its entirety or simply review and evaluate an 
event you have planned.  In either case, the PR department will be 
responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and for 
ECT.  

-  A completed expenditure request form (blank attached) and supporting 
documentation is required for each event.  You should submit completed 
expenditure request forms and documentation to the ECT PR Dept. at EB3642 or 
work with PR to complete the form.

-  After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ECT Office of 
the President for final approval.  

Thank you for your cooperation.  If you have any questions regarding this 
process or would like assistance in planning an event, please contact Mike 
Rosen in the ECT Public Relations Dept. at (713) 853-9624.

Subject: TMOS Committee Meeting



To All Subcommittee members:

    TMOS accepted the Enabling Agreement with one exception, they
changed the language in 5.2 and 5.3 to the pre-May 19th language.  It
became clear that even if TMOS sent this issue back to our subcommittee
and the subcommittee voted to keep the revised language, that TMOS might
still not accept it.  The issue, as Kenneth Ragsdale put it, was ""who is
going to use the Exhibit ""E.""  To avoid postponing the Agreement going
to TAC, TMOS decided the issue in their meeting, which they clearly have
the right to do.

    I have  received a few more comments relating to scrivenor's errors
which I would like to clean up.  I will forward a revised final version
to all of you and TMOS by the end of next week.

    To all of you . . . job well done.  To Naim, who continued to
relentlessly push for the completion of this project, THANKS!

Margaret

Subject: ERCOT AGREEMENT



To all subcommittee members:

    Attached is the final draft which is being sent to TMOS for
approval.  Because the participants voted 7 to 3 to keep sections 5.2
and 5.3 as they are currently drafted, no changes were made to those
sections.  I reviewed and used most of TXU's and Southern's edits
regarding typos and clarification, which I appreciate.  If you would
like to see the changes, then go to Track Changes and highlight on
screen.

    Thank you all for your help. Hopefully this agreement will be
approved at TMOS and then TAC.  I will (or Naim) will keep you apprised.

Subject: WPTF Friday Thin Quality Burrito



Hey Burrito Heads!  It=0F's just another fascinating week in Burrito land.
I spent the better part of this week learning something new, which at my
age is not easy.  In fact, just about everything at my age is getting
more difficult.  But I wont  bore you with the details.  The new thing I
learned was how to be an Examiner on the Board of Examiners for this
year=0F's California Governor=0F's Quality Education and Development Award
(CalQED).  Its an annual shindig for companies, health care
institutions, and schools to compete for the honor of shaking the Gov=0F's
hand, and hearing that your (pick one: company, non-profit, school,
health care institution) are world class.  Being an examiner of the
written applications, and working with a team of peer examiners is all
pro bono on my part.  I am wondering what the hell I got myself into.
I=0F'll tell you more about it some other time.

Speaking of world class, I got two top notch letters this week that I
want to share with you.  One from Ken Lackey of Edison Mission Marketing
and Trading, regarding the May 25 overscheduling on the Silver Peak
intertie by 2900 MW (see Lori Eckman=0F's note to me in last week=0F's
Burrito), and a reply to Ken=0F's letter from George Sladoje, CEO of the
PX.

Ken, who I have known for several years, is a person who doesn=0F't speak
out unless something really bothers him. Ken wrote:

=0F""Since Day 1, I've always wondered what mechanism was in place to
protect against this scenario [overscheduling on an intertie], or if
this scenario would be regarded as a market implementation flaw or
""feature"".  I always figured it was a feature, simply because I didn't
think that a hole this large would be unintentionally overlooked.  I
also figured that this feature was available for use by market
participants and that if it became overused, that it would eventually
come under scrutiny by the market compliance police.  I also wondered if
people could use this to change spreads in such a way as to improve
their overall positions.  I also figured that for the most part there is
no such thing as ""artificially"" high prices since  in my opinion the
market design itself is somewhat artificial.   But now I know the
truth..it's a flaw, it was overlooked and there is no
protection...amazing.

=0F""I certainly do not agree with [George] Sladoje's interpretation of the
PX tariff (that overscheduling across a path constitutes improper
implementation of a generator schedule, which therefore constitutes a
violation of the tariff).   Also I believe that it is completely
inappropriate for the burden of proper functioning of the market to rest
on the shoulders of the market participants (i.e. if someone types in an
incorrect schedule in their PX Trade Application, the market should not
blowup) .  The responsibility of a properly functioning market lies with
the market operator (PX) itself.  PX software should validate that the
proper mechanics have been used by the market participants.

=0F""By the way, it wasn't us who caused this situation, and of course we
would prefer to pay low PX energy prices rather than high, but if we
review this situation and retroactively recreate prices, then perhaps
all other cases in which congestion at tie-points caused high prices
should also be reviewed to see if they are ""real"".

=0F""By the way, typically, I would not respond to this sort of thing due to
time constraints, however, some of our recent involvement in other
ISO/PXs has highlighted the contrasts between California and other
ISO/PXs.  Each of them, including California, has its strengths and
weaknesses, however, it's in California where the unusual is the norm.=0F""

I sent Ken=0F's letter to George, and his staff at the PX, and George wrote
back the following:

=0F""Because the incident of May 25 is the subject of an official
investigation by the PX Compliance unit, I cannot comment on the
specifics of this matter at this time.  It is likely that the CalPX
Market Monitoring Committee will be involved in the investigation and
the results will likely be presented to the CalPX Board of Governors.
As to the issue of a design flow in the overall California marketplace
--- we are currently reviewing this issue and have requested that the
ISO do the same.

=0F""I disagree with the assertion that CalPX Tariff provision 3.3.2 does
not apply here.  In all major exchange operations the institution not
only provides a forum for trading, but also monitors the activities of
its members, both currently and after the fact.  The participants are
expected to follow the rules.  At one of my previous employers, as an
example, (the Chicago Board of Trade), a suspected abuse or a compliant
from another member or customer results in an investigation by the
Office of Investigations and Audits (the counterpart of CalPX=0F's
Compliance unit).  Depending on the nature of the issue, the
investigation results are presented to the Floor Governors Committee,
Business Conduct Committee or the Financial Compliance Committee.  These
bodies then determine if additional investigation is warranted and if
the issue requires Board of Director action.

=0F""Similarly, the CalPX has the obligation to investigate and take actions
against participants who violate tariff provisions.  Our recently filed
sanction=0F's protocol formalizes the process further and describes a
series of penalties which can be imposed.  Therefore, we believe our
tariff does provide adequate protection.

=0F""Finally, as to whether a comparable event has occurred in the past ---
this will be part of the investigation process and a review of market
design.  Obviously, impact schedule submissions above ATC limits have
happened as a result of free and open markets.  Congestion has become an
almost regular occurrence.  The real issues under investigation in this
incident are magnitude, intent and materiality of impact on our
marketplace.=0F""

Thank you, both Ken and George for those comments.  I am sure we will
hear from other members on the issue.  Lori, don=0F't be silent.  You
started this thing.

Speaking of market design (segues, I am very big on segues this week),
old warrior, dear friend,  and defender of the just, Carl Imparato had a
few things to say about the ISO=0F's proposed utilization of ex post GMMs.
Carl wrote:

=0F""Yesterday, [the ISO Market Analysis Unit] stated that not implementing
after-the-fact GMMs would be a departure from the original vision of the
California market structure.

=0F""Ex post GMMs were NOT a part of the market structure.  When I was at
PG&E and we were developing the tariff in early 1997, no one (not at
PG&E, SCE or any other market participant, to my knowledge) ever
advocated ex post GMMs, and they were NOT included in the tariff.   I
don't recall the words ""state estimator"" (for calculation such GMMs)
ever being uttered by anyone in a WEPEX stakeholder meeting.

=0F""It was only somewhere in mid-1997, when Alex was working on UFE
equations, that Alex (I believe) suddenly came up with the proposal for
ex post GMMs, and the proposal was taken by ISO very quickly (before it
had ANY discussion in SCUG or any other forum), and was adopted by the
ISO Board (or whatever group passed for the Board at that time).
Immediately thereafter, virtually everyone in SCUG .  We were ignored.

=0F""But even in early 1998, we informally agreed that, in light of the
facts (that after-the-fact GMMs were not part of the original ""deal""),
after-the-fact GMM implementation would be given low priority and we
would be given opportunity to discuss this issue before ISO moved
forward.=0F""

I remember those discussions, Carl.  I wonder if deals made in 1998 have
any meaning today?

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The SCE Pilot Forwards Program, a continuing saga for WPTF,  popped up
again this week.  I visited with Commissioner Bilas on Monday to
encourage him to stay the course, and support the ALJ=0F's preliminary
decision to reject SCE=0F's Application, and cancel the hearings on legal
and procedural grounds.  Dick said that he supported that notion, but he
couldn=0F't guarantee that all his colleagues would.

Alas, two days later, Commissioner Joe Neeper, who clearly had too much
time on his hands this week, issued a public statement which is long,
but here is a taste:

=0F""ALJ Hale=0F's Proposed Decision (PD) is structured so that a ""Yes"" vote
will terminate the proceeding and a ""No"" vote will continue the
proceeding to hearings and ultimate resolution.=01;=01; I have concerns wit=
h
the PD.=01; However, I do not intend to issue an alternate because, should
my concerns not be addressed, I have the option to vote ""No"" which would
have the same effect as the alternate I otherwise would have written....

=0F""If we vote to allow this application to move to hearings, we can later
determine whether the Application should be approved on overall policy
grounds.  The PD dismisses the Application on the grounds that does not
comply with what is known as the buy/sell requirement for utilities to
sell all of their generation into, and purchase all of their energy
needs for their bundled customers out of, the PX.=01; I agree with the ALJ
and the Assigned Commissioner that the Application also must be
compatible with the buy-sell requirement in order to be approved, and
that this threshold decision is therefore necessary.....

=0F""The PD concludes that the Application makes SCE=0F's customers more
vulnerable to market power abuse.=01;In viewing the comments of parties, I
find the concern about market power abuse to be expressed best by
Western Power Trading Forum (WPTF) in its opening brief.=01; WPTF states on
page 7 that, under SCE=0F's proposal, ""ESPs will no longer be able to
compete with utilities on the basis of short-run incremental costs in an
open setting"" as envisioned by the PPD.=01;Thus, ""ESPs would find it
increasingly more difficult to compete with an Edison price which was
neither derived from a transparent PX price nor reflective of the retail
market in which ESPs must participate.""  ... The PX price is determined
in an open setting, and would continue to be determined in an open
setting under SCE=0F's proposal....I cannot find that the proposal would
violate the PPD by necessarily leading to abuse of market power.  Market
power concerns should be considered, and weighed against consumer and
other interests.=01; These issues certainly can be explored in greater
depth as policy matters in hearings.

=0F""I do not believe the Application by SCE is in violation of the
Commission=0F's Preferred Policy Decision.=01; The merits of the Applicatio=
n
should be considered through the hearing process and voted upon by the
Commissioners. =0F""

Well, Mr Neeper, justice isn=0F't free.  A hearing is expensive, and what
your are doing is raising the ante of staying in the
game,unnecessarily.  That supports the incumbents (UDCs), and hurts us.

At the time I am writing this Burrito, I do not know if the Commission
took action on this matter today, or punted it to the July 8 meeting.
I=0F'll keep you posted, next week.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

I am sure most of you have seen the press releases which came out last
week.  First, Dynegy and Illinova are merging, and, second, NEV is being
purchased by AES.  Both Dynegy and NEV are Voting members of WPTF.  I
was going to send Illinova a solicitation letter to join WPTF, but now I
think I=0F'll take that off my =0F""to do=0F""list.

In the NEV deal, the AES Corporation announced that it  has entered into
a definitive agreement to acquire New Energy Ventures  in a transaction
valued at approximately $90 million. AES will acquire all of the
outstanding shares of New  Energy Ventures from its current owners,
UniSource Energy Corporation. and New Energy Holdings, L.L.C. (which is
owned by senior  management of New Energy Ventures).

This is an incredible coincidence.  I was just telling someone, I think
it was Dan Douglass, that we ought to give a special award to Nancy Day
of NEV, who is a big fan of the Burrito, and quite possibly, although I
am not certain, one of the senior managers of that lucky corporation.
Well, heck, she has been at NEV from the beginning, so she deserves all
the financial success in the world, and we wish her well.   I just want
to share with all our Burrito readers that WPTF, a tax-exempt,
non-profit corporation, Tax ID 94-3296987, right here in the State of
California, soon to be a CalQED award winner, is looking for donors for
the soon-to-be-announced Executive Director=0F's fund.  Some of you might
not know about this new [slush] fund. It is intended to provide all the
necessary tools and ancillary needs of late night policy pow wows
attended by the usual wonks and otherwise homeless lobbyists who invade
my private hotel room during the WPTF general meeting, and who want to
discuss high level stuff all through the night.  What=0F's an executive
director to do?  So, Nancy, I was just thinking, we could launch this
program in your honor, with your name all over the thing, and get this
very important and much needed program in place.  At least it will pay
for a hotel room for Curtis who consistently falls asleep during these
meetings on my hotel-room couch while Beth Emery is lecturing him.

By the way, if, God forbid, the deal falls through, then forget I wrote
all this.

Have a great weekend.  Think quality.

Subject: Agency

Alan,

I am currently compiling a list of those utilities that to our knowledge have 
agents. I am also trying to round up all of the agency agreements from our 
files. In light of outside counsel's comments regarding the ability of an 
agent to bind more than one principal, I am quite concerned over the amount 
of business we do this way.  I would be interested in reading whatever you 
received from outside counsel.  Also, are you coordinating this with 
Elizabeth Sager?  Tracy Ngo , who works in our group, told me Elizabeth has 
outside counsel looking at this too ( she is working here part time?) and 
they are fairly comfortable with how these documents work for power. In 
addition, where do the FERC and SEC fit into the picture?  Tracy mentioned 
something about required approvals.  I am trying to determine our exposure to 
these contracts, and whether they truly place our credit risk with the 
utilities.

Thanks,
Tanya

Attorney Client Privilege--Not Discoverable

Here is a final thought about this PX situation before I take off.  In the 
normal give and take of haggling that has been going on since time out of 
mind in trading transactions, there is an element of deception.  The seller 
always bluffs that his product is much more valuable than it actually may be, 
in fact, the less valuable the product, the more the bluffing.  The buyer 
always treats the seller's product with disdain.  It is fundamentally 
necessary for an efficient market to work for buyers and sellers to be able 
to string each other along  with various  posturing gambits.  Price is the 
result of two hagglers finally coming forward out of the smoke surrounding 
their ritual dance  and shaking hands on a number.  By experimenting with the 
nuances of the PX software system  are traders not  merely doing what they 
have been doing since Biblical times,   i.e.  interjecting the absolutely 
essential ingredient of deceptive posturing  into the relatively new form of  
electronic commerce? 

What is the difference between  (a) one of our traders getting on the phone 
when we are short of power and bargaining for a good price  with a supply 
source  as though we have plenty of power and might just be willing to help 
the supplier out if he gives us a good deal,  and  (b) scheduling 3000 mw at 
Silver Peak when there is  15 mw of physical  capacity?  If the technology of 
electronic commerce cannot absorb the artful rituals of  real haggling, maybe 
it should be seen as a temporary experiment and rejected in favor of the time 
honored traditions.  In any event, participants should not be expected to be 
punished for experimenting.   --cgy  "

FYI, earlier today I ran through the draft Master Agreement (a copy of which 
previously has been circulated to you) with four of the members of the ad hoc 
working group formed to create new Nordic financial trading documentation.  
The document as such appeared to go down well but certain of the said members 
wanted to have more time to reflect and return with comments later this 
summer.  Due to intervening summer breaks, the next conference call was 
therefore set to be held on 31 August and comments are to be submitted a week 
before that date.

Good morning, Elizabeth.

I thought I would send you the comments and suggested revisions I put
together when I reviewed the proposed master agreement.  Hopefully we can
shorten the negotiation process this way.
I look forward to hearing from you when you've had a chance to look this
over.

Subject:  Steve Kean's testimony

Steve is giving testimony today before the US Senate Comm. on Energy and 
Natural
Resources in support of the dereg bills.  His oral testimony states that TVA 
has
refused to provide us with the same service it provides to itself.  Both the
oral and written testimony seek a new NERC, comparable treatment for native 
load
uses of the system, and ""green tags"" at the generator (not traced through to 
the
end user).  He will also discuss recent transmission access problems we have
encountered (new tag requirements , unannounced scheduling deadline changes, 
TLR
cuts, wrong info on the NERC redispatch page, etc.)

Subject: Listing of Mission Critical counterparties for Power Y2K contract 
review

Elizabeth and David,

Mike Robison asked that I send you a listing of the counterparties that the 
Y2K team has classified as Mission Critical in order to perform a review of 
the contracts for these counterparties in connection with the Y2K project.  
The attached spreadsheet lists all of the Mission Critical counterparties.  I 
have them sorted by commodity so you can look for power.  Please note that 
there are 2 sheets in the file.  The first contains approximately 140 Mission 
Critical counterparties.  We also added about 60 more that we are assessing 
and these are listed on the sheet labeled ""Tier 2"".  There is a power list on 
that page as well.  If you have any questions on this information, please 
leave me a message as I will be out of the office starting tomorrow through 
Monday, July 27.  I will be checking messages while I am out on vacation.




In addition, I am attaching the spreadsheet that we used to capture the 
results of our analysis of Houston gas contracts so you can see the format to 
use.

Subject: Jim Fallon in Charge of Power and Emissions Trading

Greg Whalley has informed me that Jim Fallon will now be in charge of East 
Power, West Power, and Emissions Trading.  This means that my boss will now 
be Jim Fallon rather than Greg Whalley.  I met with both Greg and Jim when I 
was in Houston last week.  Greg was very complimentary of the work that we've 
done here.  Greg has become extremely busy since his responsibilities have 
expanded from North American trading to risk management worldwide.  
Accordingly, he thought that it made the most sense to consolidate the power 
trading functions in North America under one person.

Jim was also very complimentary of our work.  We have been profitable for 6 
straight quarters --  exceeded plan in 1998 and have exceeded plan in Q1 and 
Q2 of 1999.  He wants to see this success continue.  Jim expects to spend at 
least one day out of every two weeks up here.  I am looking forward to 
working with Jim.  He has done an outstanding job running the east power 
desk.  This should enable us to increase coordination between the two groups 
and allow us to have a strong advocate in Houston.  While it's too early to 
say anything definitively, I don't expect much to change on a day to day 
basis here.  If anyone has any questions please don't hesitate to ask.

Privileged and Confidential.  Attoney Client Work Product.

Attached is a draft letter for your consideration.  Our outside counsel 
believes a letter like this would help us in our position that we do not have 
to continue buying energy when there is no transfer capability at the SDP 
because we know TVA will reject it.  Sending this letter is not critical to 
the sucess of our position but would bolster it somewhat.  Before deceiding 
to sent or not, I wanted your thoughts on how you think that giving this 
information to TVA would impact us, particularly given TVA's actions today, 
re acces to transmission through third party transactions.  Lets discuss this 
afternoon.

Thanks

all the following week.  My assistant Brenda knows where I am.  If you need 
to reach me either leave me a vm and I'll return the call (I would love

meetings I will be attending) or else call me on the cell phone 713 854

Last week, the WSPP drafing group met in sunny California  to continue the 
slow and steady march towards a standardized, ""national"" agreement. Schedule 
C , the service schedule for firm transactions, was the primary topic and the 
following is a summary of where the group is headed.

After much discussion, we proposed  that the group consider the definition of 
firm energy  that Tim, Christian and others have been considering.  The 
following is proposed language (the base was EPMI's version) that the WSPP 
group is currently reviewing:

Firm Power is power that is sold and scheduled in accordance with applicable 
reserve requirements for which the only excuse for the failure to deliver or 
recieve are those set forth in Schedule 3.9 of the WSPP Agreement.  Seller 
shall take steps necessary for the power to be considered Firm Power under 
this definition.

Schedule 3.9 only allows interruption if (i) within agreed recall time, (ii) 
due to an Uncontrollable Force or (iii) power is need for native load; 
provided, however it was agreed that a party would neverless be liable for 
LDs if it interrupts due to native load requirements (this last point is a 
major accomplishment that apppears to have uniform agreement and will be 
implemented in the next draft - the group claimed that the ""optics"" are 
necessary to help traditional utilities).  As a further note, the group 
agreed to do away with all references to C1 and  C2 and have just one 
Schedule.

Changes from EPMI's proposed definition where  the result of the following 
discussions:

1.  Generated vs. Sold - ""Sold"" was elected over ""generated"" because the 
group thinks that it is the receiving control area that determines the 
generator's reserve requirements.

2. ""Schedule""  was added to bolster the scheduling requirements.

3.  ""Reserves"" instead of ""Operating Reserves"" was used because the group 
thought the word operating may be too restrictive.

4.  ""WSCC reserve requirements"" was replaced with ""applicable"" reserve 
requirements because the group thinks that the WSPP Agreement is national in 
scope and should not be limited to WSPP.

5.  References to Non-firm supply as being excluded from Firm Power was 
excluded because the group thought it was redundent  - no control area would 
accept a non-firm supply as being firm.

6.  Power rather than energy is being used only bacause that is the decision 
that has already been made.

This defintion will be further discussed at  the next meeting on Aug 20th in 
Denver.  Prior to that time, I would like to get your thoughts on how this is 
shaping up and what additions/deletions are appropriate.  I look forward to 
hearing your thoughts.

Thanks.

Mark

Attached is the preliminary outline of a conference EEI is considering 
holding on November 17, 1999 to introduce the form of standardized power 
contract developed through EEI.  You will note that EEI listed you as a 
potential speaker.  EEI has also called me to discuss my role in this 
presentation but I wanted to get your thoughts first.

Subject: Conference on Standardized Contract



As part of our outreach process for the standardized contract, EEI is 
planning to offer a conference for the industry and regulators on November 
17, 1999 in Washington, D.C.  We would like to invite you to participate in 
the conference as speakers because of your roles in developing the Master 
Agreement.  I've attached a proposed program for the conference would 
appreciate your comments.  Not all the issues need to be part of the oral 
presentation, but could be included in the written handouts.

Please review the program to see which issues you might want to address.  Let 
me know if you are interested in being on the program, are available, or have 
someone else to recommend as a speaker.  As co-chairs of the working group, 
it seems logical to make Patti and Dave moderators. for the main sessions on 
the contract.  I've filled in some other potential speakers.  Also, we were 
thinking of having speakers on managing trading floor operations and credit 
ratings for power marketers.  Any suggestions there would be welcome.  If 
need be, we can set up a conference call to discuss working out the rest of 
the presenters for the program.

Apparently,  the Hill & Knowlton bad press is all over today's local valley

appears at all reluctant to proceed,  please let me know and these Hill 
contacts will contact him directly to advise him to go forward as they are 
willing to lend him their political support.

Subject: TVA authority

Craven Crowell's authority to act without a full TVA board is limited by 
federal statutory authority to only carrying out ""administrative functions.""  
He is explicitly prohibited from carrying out ""policy functions"" without the 
other board members in place.  We know who the Administration intends to 
nominate for the two board vacancies, however, these candidates can only be 
officially nominated and confirmed by Congress sometime after Congress 
reconvenes on September 8th at the earliest.

Since I know you would like an immediate fix to your TVA control area issue, 
during the month of August you might pursue TVA's policy actions against our 
control area in violation of federal statute.  (In the meantime, however,  I 
am continuing to work the Appropriations strategy (best possible resolution 
date October 1, 1999) and the Authorization strategy (best possible 
resolution date October 7, 2000.))

Currently, the TVA Inspector General George Prosser who can be reached at  
(423) 632-4120 is in hot pursuit of Mr. Crowell.  He has successfully had 
legislation introduced to curb Mr. Crowell's authorities, and soon will issue 
a report (sure to receive much front page negative publicity) that Mr. 
Crowell ""lied"" to Congress by failing to disclose a TVA $100,000 monthly 
publicity retainer with Hill & Knowlton to a House Congressional Oversight 
Committee.  Ironically, this retainer was to help Mr. Crowell obtain 
favourable earned media.

We believe  the I.G. could easily be persuaded to pursue the wrong-doing 
caused by Mr. Crowell in developing TVA policy in the absence of a board.  If 
he pursues the case, he would likely immediate reinstate our positions during 
the investigation so as not to cause further harm, plus he could require TVA 
to pay damages if he successfully proves his case.  Regardless, this 
investigation would cause nasty publicity for TVA.

I have discussed with Joe Hartsoe what materials he may wish to provide the 
I.G. in order to help him make our case that this action ""created policy.""  I 
have also given Joe Hartsoe a listing of all of TVA's industrial customers 
likely curtailed during the heat wave.  We should contact a few of these 
industrials in order to also ask them to intervene against TVA's policy 
action on our control area.  These industrials could also claim monetary 
damages from being wrongfully curtailed by a policy that arguably reduced the 
amount of available power in the region.  

The down side is Mr. Crowell could pursue ""administrative"" retributions 
against Enron activities.

Dear Elizabeth,

In response to the recent business reorganization, we are working to=20
streamline Enron=01,s Global Internet addressing structure.  As a result, t=
he=20
messaging group has been working to ensure a timely conversion from our=20
current addressing scheme of ""@ect.enron.com"" and ""@enron.co.uk"" to a unifi=
ed=20
""@enron.com"" address. =20

A great deal of effort has been put into this project to eliminate any=20
duplicate addresses across Enron's Global Messaging Enterprise. Some of you=
=20
may find that your original  Internet ""short name"" was changed as a result =
of=20
your short name being the same as someone else's at Enron.   In addition to=
=20
changing to a standard ""@enron.com"" we have made a global change to allow=
=20
users to receive email  by short name and long name (see below).

This consolidation will become effective for all former ECT users, beginnin=
g=20
Monday, September 6, 1999. =20

 Internet short name:  esager2@enron.com

 Internet long name:  Elizabeth.Sager@enron.com

Please note middle initials may be used to uniquely identify individuals wi=
th=20
the same name and differentiate them as unique, all names do not have middl=
e=20
initials.
i.e. John.A.Doe@enron.com

Your old ""@ect.enron.com"" and ""@enron.co.uk"" addresses will continue to be=
=20
supported until November 1st.
When ordering your new business cards, we are recommending that users begin=
=20
printing their long name address instead of short names.
In order to minimize the impact on your business please begin advising your=
=20
outside contacts of your new address and effective date of Monday, Septembe=
r=20
6th as soon as possible.
If you have additional questions regarding your new address, please contact=
=20
your local help desk.

Thank You for your support in this global messaging endeavor.

Janette,

Attached is the memorandum regarding the North American Energy and
Developing Products Committee meeting which will be held in Houston on
October 10.  We sent this out to all the Enron contacts by fax early last
week.  In addition to Mark (Haedicke) can you let me know if there will be
other representatives from Enron attending the meeting.

Also could I ask for your assistance in locating a contact name and
phone/fax number that we should forward this invitation to at Sempra Energy.

Thank in advance for your help.

Regards,

Rosemary

Dear Elizabeth,

Attached is the invitation to speak at ""Measuring, managing and
modelling credit risk"". If you have any problems opening the file please get 
in touch. I have suggested talk 5 in the pre-conference seminar, however, 
talk 3 is also available. I would be more than happy for you or your 
colleague to speak on either or both of these subjects. I am unfortunately 
working to a very tight schedule so if you could let me know ASAP if you 
could speak I would very much appreciate it.

Many Thanks
Helen Evans



Many Thanks

Elizabeth,

Three documents are coming your way by three routes:  1. the draft 
definitions for our confirms is attached.  2. the agenda for the WSPP 
meeting  is easy to get off the internet:  Brenda can put in ""WSPP.com"" into 
the search engine and pull up the WSPP homepage on which is listed the agenda 
for the meeting which can be printed out.  3. Jan is sending a monster fax of 
the latest proposed changes to the agreement.   

When you have all this paper, let's talk.--cgy

The following Message was sent to members of Contract List Server, the EEI 
Contract Standization Mailing List.
Andy Katz sent out the following message...We have had many 
undeliverables...I would appreciate your letting me know if you receive this 
message...thanks.
Working Group Members:

The drafting commitee met on September 15 to discuss the status of the Master 
Agreement and the agenda for the October 13 meeting at EEI's offices.  The 
general consensus of the drafting committee is that the Master Agreement is 
sound and there is no need for revision to the base terms and conditions of 
version 2.1.  Based on that meeting, the drafting committee would like to 
cover the following at the October 13 meeting :

GETTING CONTRACT IN PLACE.  The drafting committee believes that the number 
one priority is to get the Master Agreement used by more participants in the 
marketplace.   We would like to hear from the working group about the status 
of the Master Agreement in their organizations and issues about the contract 
that are holding up its use.  We will solicit suggestions on how to get wider 
acceptance of the Master Agreement.  The drafting committee has thought of 
holding another workshop in late January to address implementation issues 
such as establsihing credit thresholds.

STANDARDIZED SUPPLEMENTAL PROVISIONS.  There are  several areas not addressed 
in the base contract that are frequently used as customized supplemental 
provisions identified on many parties' cover sheets.  The drafting committee 
identified the following as useful to develop as suggested optional 
supplemental provisions that could be used in negotiating a cover sheet with 
a counterparty:   (1)  the incorporation of prior transactions as being 
governed by the Master Agreement; (2) the use of the Master Agreement for 
electronic trading; (3) alternative dispute resolution mechanisms; (4) 
treatment of new taxes or changes in regulatory policy; (5) additional 
products (e.g. Western firm or CAISO energy); (6) agreements with respect to 
agency relationships; (7) ""regulatory out"" provisions; and (8) provisions 
involving ""one-way"" counterparty relationships, i.e. sales only or purchases 
only.

The drafting committee will ask the working group to allow it to develop 
these provisions and once consensus on language is reached among the drafting 
committee members, they would be made available for downloading on the EEI 
website for use by the industry as suggested optional provisions.  We will 
also discuss the ways to tie these provisions to the Master Agreement general 
terms.


PROCEDURE FOR GETTING CONTRACT INTERPRETATION.  The drafting committee will 
discuss ways to get answers about the contract disseminated quickly.  One 
suggestion is to have a frequently asked questions section up on the EEI 
website.

As a reminder, the meeting will be held from 10-4.  Please contact me if you 
have any questions or comments about the agenda.   If you plan to attend or 
need information about hotels or transportation, please contact Patricia 
Young at 202-508-5757 or pyoung@eei.org. Thank-you.

Richard
I am attaching a revised copy of the agreement. TVA has agreed to these 
changes.
TVA supplied the basic changes and we intervened in a couple of cases where 
we did not think they met our agreements.
My  comments to are as follows:
I believe the second bullet is better stated than the original one we 
submitted. We support this wording.
In the last paragraph, if Enron also supports the wording related to ENNA and 
ENCA we need to include your name in the sentence.
Please disregard the original document and let's work from this one.
Thanks

I have scheduled a meeting for October 7th from 8:30 to 2:30 in room 3321 to 
recommence the project we began in January to review the existing 
Houston-based financial, gas and power trading forms.  All of you should have 
received a black binder labelled ""Analysis of ECT's Finacial, Power, Gas 
Forms""  which contains all of the long and short forms used for trading (as 
such forms existed in January 1999), as well as my summary comparison as to 
how each of the forms handles certain legal issues (eg, termination, cover, 
assignement, confidentiality ....).  If you did not receive or cannot locate 
this binder, let me know and I will forward to you another copy.  This 
analysis was done in January.   I am aware that some of the forms may have 
changed since then but have not undertaken to ""update"" the memo as we will be 
able to discuss such changes at the meeting.

The purpose of the meeting is to review how each of the Houston-based 
trading  forms has been structured and to note where there are differences.  
The ultimate goal is to determine what Enron's ""model"" trading provisions 
should be and to determine a consistent approach unless there is a justified 
rational for treating the commodities in a different manner.  With this in 
mind, I would hope to be able to create a ""modular type"" contract  whereby 
each legal issue would have a recommended approach, evidenced by language 
that will be approved by the group.  By way of example, Enron's gas contract 
prohibits assignement without consent, which consent can be withheld for any 
reason.  The financial form provides that a party can not unreasonably 
withhold its consent.  At this meeting we would discuss what the preferred 
approach is and then begin the process of drafting appropriate language, 
which language would be approved at a seperate meeting.  This  ""modular 
assignment section"" could then be dropped into all trading forms unless 
differences were required due to the commodity/product involved.

You will note that the analysis performed to date does not include all areas 
of a trading contract.  Similiar steps will still need to be undertaken with 
other provisions such as credit terms.  At the meeting, I hope to further 
discuss the additional areas everybody believes should be reviewed.

Aron Roffwarg, a lawyer  from Bracewell, will also be at the meeting to 
assist us in this effort.

Thanks

Subject: Proposed WSPP Firm Power Definition





The WSPP operating/contract drafting committee is meeting on October 7 in
Phoenix to discuss the reserve requirements for firm sales.  I would 
appreciate
your review and comments on the following as a definition for Firm Power for 
use
in the WSPP Agreement in lieu of the current language.  This language would be
inserted in Schedule C and replace Sections C-3.3 and C-3.6:

     Firm Power shall be interrupted only if the interruption is: (a) due to 
an
     Uncontrollable Force as provided in Section 10 of this Agreement and 
power
     is not available at the Delivery Point; or, (b) where applicable, to meet
     Seller's public utility or statutory obligations to its customers.  If
     Seller exercises its right to interrupt to meet its public utility or
     statutory obligations, Seller shall be responsible for payment of damages
     for failure to deliver Firm Power as provided in Section 21.3 of this
     Agreement or in any Confirmation Agreement.  If Firm Power is interrupted
     for any reason other than as provided in subpart (a) above, the
     non-performing party shall be obligated to pay damages under this 
Agreement
     or Confirmation Agreement.

Dear Liz,

Hello from Rice.  Just thought I'd drop an email to see it works.  The
above address is my email here at Rice on sabbatical.  If you mail
to wsager@ocean.tamu.edu, that's my address at TAMU.  I recommend
the TAMU address because I have those messages copied here,
so I will get them no matter where I am.  But I sometimes don't see
the Rice messages if they come while I am back home.

So last I heard, I thought you were working as an attorney in a private
practice.  But now you must be working for Enron.  Seems like
everybody in Houston is working in the awl bidness these days.  I hosted
a career discussion group for our grad students last week and invited
TAMU alums to come talk about careers in oceanography.  All were
driven by the offshore energy industry in some way (either energy
companies, service companies, or regulatory agencies), except for
one guy from the Navy.  And they all said ""don't plan to keep the same
job for more than ~10 years.""

Nice to see you at the wedding.  We'll have to plan to get together some
time.

Bye,
Will

Hi John - You are in good company - I never call or write those I care about; 
only my ""enemies"" get to hear or see me.  And if that doesn't tell you how I 
spend my time, nothing will.  Now that summer is almost upon us (its only 92 
degrees in Houston), I hope for more.  Give me a call and lets try to catch 
up this week.

Hope all is well for you.

Mary Hain, regultory director in Portland.

Can we get a very quick legal approval of this please.  I would be most 
grateful for a reply by end of tomorrow please with as few changes as 
possible. 

I have already got re-approval from the commercial group and the amednments 
are more editorial.

Thanks

Please find attached for your review the most recent form of the above 
agreement, blacklined to show the changes to the previous draft distributed 
to you.  I believe that we have now settled on the form of the agreement, but 
there remain a few commercial issues which we will be resolving in the next 
week or so.  If anyone has any final comments on the form, please communicate 
them to me as soon as possible.  I would also like to have any input from Rob 
Hemstock and Aleck Dadson on any particular issues relating to market 
operations in Ontario or Alberta.  I also need someone in the Toronto office 
to provide me with the definition of ""Interval Meters"" that I have included 
as a potential delivery point.  I have left that definition as a bullet and 
we will need to fill it in or remove it, if the latter makes more sense.  
Finally, once the last few business issues are resolved next week, I would 
like to set up a call with Jeff Hodge and Elizabeth Sager to obtain final 
internal legal approval on this agreement so that our commercial people can 
commence marketing the paper to potential counterparties.  Mark Powell will 
be using this form of the agreement in conjunction with the current ENA form 
of physical power GTC to prepare a Canadian form of physical power GTC that 
may be used to transact physical power transactions of less than one year in 
duration with counterparties with whom we do not have masters in place.

Thanks

Greg

Attached is the latest EEI contract for your review.  If you have any changes 
you think should be incorporated, please let me know before the the 16th of 
November.

As you all are aware, I have been working with EEI to come up with the 
definition of an ""Into"" product.  I circulated a draft definition at the last 
EEI meeting.  There will be a conference call on Tuesday Nov.9th from 230 to 
430 to further discuss with EEI members.  Let me know if you would like to 
participate.  In the meanwhile if you have any comments on the draft Into 
definition I circulated, please get me our comments as soon as possible.  I 
will be meeting with the traders later today to discuss with them.  

Thanks for everbody's help on this project.  The end may be near.

Subject: Standardized Master Purchase and Sale Agreement



The attached Master Purchase and Sale Agreement represents the culmination of 
a tremendous effort by the Standard Contract Working Group and Drafting 
Committee.  Every effort has been made to be as inclusive in the process of 
creating this document as possible.  Many compromises were made in creating 
this contract and  is not necessarily everyone's ideal agreement.  
Nevertheless, the contract should be a workable tool that hopefully will 
benefit the power market.  A clean and redline version of the contract are 
attached.  They were prepared by the Drafting Committee and every effort was 
made to include comments received during and since the September 24 meeting 
at EEI.

At this stage of the initiative, it would not be productive to circulate 
non-substantive comments (word smithing/formatting).  On the other hand, it 
would be useful to send any substantive comments or questions about the 
mechanics of the contract and how the contract language might apply under 
certain scenarios.  The best forum to respond to your questions or comments 
will be the November 17 Power Marketing Transactions conference in 
Washington, D.C.   Accordingly, it would be helpful to tailor your comments 
to the conference program.  Questions, comments, and hypotheticals could be

I believe that most parties in the industry will feel that the EEI Master
Power Purchase and Sale Agreement (Agreement)is fair, and will adopt it with
few changes, if any.  The most daunting task for parties will be to go
through the administrative process of entering into the contract with other
parties with whom they currently have bilaterals in place with.  The cover
sheet provided in the Agreement will make this task easier.

My idea was to have a database on your web site where individual parties
could fill in the required information and their choices presented in the
Cover Sheet.  Then, if we wanted to do a transaction with another party who
has provided the information to the database, we would simply pull up the
information relating to them that they input, and compare the options they
chose versus the options we chose.  If we chose the same options, we would
merely complete the transaction agreement.  If they made certain choices
that were different than ours, we would contact them and work it out and
list the controlling option in the transaction agreement.  This would
streamline the process and get people past the inertia they might feel with
the contract administration surrounding the switch to the Agreement.

I will be out tomorrow, but will be back in the office Monday if you wish to
discuss this.

Hi Everyone:

    It was brought to my attention by more than one eagle-eye that there was
a typo in section 13.1 of the Enabling Agreement.  The PUCT substantive rule
was 25 not 26.  Attached is the corrected document.  The admin office has
this corrected version as well.

    Sorry for any problems.

I've rewritten Schedule C as I think we would like to see it.  This draft
defines firm power as we're used to seeing it in the East, and places a
separate requirement on one of the parties to provide minimum operating
reserves.  I wasn't sure who should be the default provider of the reserves;
however, I'm inclined to think it should be the Buyer.  Please take a look
at the attached document and let me know if you have any comments.  I
haven't circulated this to anyone else yet, and probably won't until I hear
back from you.  Thanks to all of you.

Happy Thanksgiving!

Have you seen this?  Obviously, I ended up speaking to that Dow Jones
reporter late last week, at the request of our media relations dept.  I was
horribly misrepresented.  Virtually all of the reporter's questions were
about the factual differences between the EEI and WSPP contracts and this is
what the article ended up looking like.

Subject: Important FERC order re CalPX investigation
Mime-Version: 1.0

On November 23rd, the FERC issued an order that I believe is crucial in our 
case with the California PX.  In a case involving the New York ISO (New York 
Independent System Operator, Docket ER97-1523-010) FERC put the PX on notice 
that it will be revisiting the authorities and discretion it gave the PX to 
address exercises of market power.  

In the case, FERC only allowed the ISO to engage in voluntary actions on the 
part of ISO participants (such as negotiations).  However, in response to 
Enron (& ironically PG&E's) protests it found that the mitigation plan 
proposed by the ISO gave the ISO too much discretion and lacked specificity.  
FERC suggested that in filing a revised mitigation plan, the ISO propose to 
file on a case-by-case basis under section 205 of the Federal Power Act, to 
impose specific mitigation measures when the ISO concludes that they are 
warranted.  The filing would identify the particular conduct and justify the 
specific mitigation measures as a remedy.  Also, for recurring types of 
conduct it could propose mitigation and propose that it be authorized to 
impose the same mitigation measures on a prospective basis without making a 
subsequent filing in response to future conduct. 

In addition, the FERC specifically names California (although it doesn't 
mention the PX) and states that ""In rejecting the measures proposed here, we 
are aware that we have previously approved similar measures for other ISOs, 
such as those in New England and California.  We approved these earlier 
proposals in order to give these ISOs discretion to respond quickly to 
unforeseen market power and market design flaws, given the lack of prior 
experience with ISO operations.  This initial period is now passed and the 
authorities and discretion we previously accorded ISOs are, we believe, no 
longer appropriate.  We intend to revisit the authorities and discretion of 
these other ISOs.""

Not only is this a major victory for Enron, I believe this is our strongest 
argument for why the PX is now on notice that its proposed letter is beyond 
its authority.  Essentially, this case notifies the PX that the tariff the PX 
used as the basis for its proposed letter is at best of suspect effectiveness 
and at worst unlawful.  Further, it suggests that the PX cannot act against 
EPMI without making a Section 205 filing with FERC under which the PX bears 
the burden of proof.  

I think if Greg Whalley is going to call the PX, he should bring up this FERC 
order."

Hi

Thanks for the feedback - you never know how things are rec'd when you 
standing for 90 minutes in front of a crowd of credit numbers guys, in a dark 
room with slides that are barely legible, taking about a contract that only a 
lawyer could love ... OK tolerate.  I'll send you the presentation by mail.  
Hopefully I didn't get too carried away.


Looking forward to seeing you Friday.

Christi

Here is a brief summary of the TVA/EPMI lawsuit - Let me know if you would 
like more information 

(Note - the MOPA has been filed under seal in order to protect 
confidentiality  - The judge was sensitive about this given the potential 
right of a party to get the MOPA from TVA under a FOIA - Accordingly, we 
don't want to encourage further invetigation of the MOPA by third parties)



*EPMI filed a declaratory judgement proceeding on November 15, 1999 against 
TVA in the District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.  Judge Edgar 
has been assigned the matter.

*The lawsuit concerns the interpretation of an option contract EPMI and TVA 
entered into on December 6, 1995 (Master Option Purchase Agreement (MOPA).

*The sole issue presented by the declaratory judgement is the obligations of 
TVA and EPMI under the MOPA in the circumstances where EPMI is unable to 
schedule for delivery, or deliver, energy requested by TVA under the MOPA at 
the Scheduled Delivery Point (SDP) if the available transfer capability at 
the SDP is not sufficient to allow the schedule or delivery.  EPMI believes 
that the MOPA unambiguously addresses the issue.  

*A trial date in late June 2000 has been set.

*EPMI filed a Motion for Summary Judgement on November 18, 1999.

As you are aware, the legal group has been considering EPMI's options given 
TVA's failure during the summer of 99 to treat Enron's control areas in a 
manner similiar to other control areas. 

 One option we have considered is the possibility of claiming monetary 
damages against TVA  for TVA's breach of NERC policies.  In order to make 
such a statement, we would, in essence, be required to assert that the NERC 
policies are a ""contract"" which all NERC members are obligated to abide by 
and for which the failure to do so could result in monetary damages.  One 
concern with this strategy is whether EPMI and/or its affiliates could 
possibly be damaged in other, unrelated  proceedings if it was determined 
that NERC policies were indeed ""contractual obligations"" (e.g., a third party 
claims monetary damages against EPMI for an alleged violation of NERC 
""contractual policies"").

It would be very helpful if you would consider this issue and get back to me 
with any thoughts or comments you have.

Thanks for your help.

Patty and Harlan

I received your emails.

1. I agree with Patty that I'm not sure the first section of the agenda is 
relevant other than in connection with the product descriptions.

2. I would like to add the Unit Contingent definition as a discussion point.

3. My apologies given, but I'm still working on the revised draft of the INTO 
definition.  I promise that it will be avaiable no later than early Monday.  
If at all possible, I will try to get it out earlier but I can't promise 
given current work committments.  I will let you know by Thursday afternoon 
if it looks like earlier is doable.

Let me know if there is anything else I can do.

Thanks

Subject: Re: Draft Agenda for 12/15/99 EEI/NEMA Contract Group Meeting



Athough I know that PECO had a variety of questions about the interplay
of the FERC transmission policies and the force majeure definition at
the Nov. 18 meeting, I think we should keep the Houston session focussed
on the Products definitions first, and only deal with the force majeure
definition as it relates to the other products definitions.  If PECO
wants to continue to explore the transmission points, or other FERC
policy points they no doubt will, but I don't think they go on the
agenda, and certainly not first.
I think it would be very important to attach current products
definitions to the agenda, and would therefore plead with Liz and Marty
to see if we can get those implemented and to Andy for distribution by
Friday.  Also, Mitch Dutton was the one with custody of the System Firm
definition, and I will call him today to see if he can get it massaged
and to Andy by Friday morning.
  I'd love to have a discussion, with traders present, about the
bookout issue, but I don't know if we'll have time.  The other ""global""
issue that the traders need to focus on (and will no doubt want an
update on) is the status of the efforts to get FERC on board.  Andy, can
we at least give them tentatively that we WILL meet with FERC staff in
January, and the tentative dates of the rollout sessions on the contract
in Houston and New York?  PD

>>> <HEMU@dynegy.com> Tuesday, December 07, 1999 >>>
Please take a look at this and give me your thoughts.  One area that I
believe
needs more work in particular is the item referring to FERC policies; I
think
this is PECO's issue, but I'm not sure what FERC policies they are
concerned
about.

I would like to attach the current definitions of the products to the
agenda.
Do we have a definition of the ""Into __"" product that has been updated
since the
November 9 conference call?  Is there a new defintion of the ""Firm
(LD-System
Reliability)"" product?

What about trying to tackle bookouts if we have the time?  Is there
any
conceivable way we will have the time?

Thanks,

Harlan

I've been hiding in the weeds.  Hisss.  I agree w/ Patty and Liz that product 
definition should be the primary focus of the meeting.  It would seem most of 
the transmission related issues PECO (or Dynegy) have could be addressed in 
the context of the force majeure definition and how specific product 
definitions tighten or loosen FM excuses for non-performance.

I think we can represent that discussions w/ FERC staff will take place 
during January.  Our meeting coordinator is talking w/ Mariott about roll out 
meetings in Houston during the first week of March and in NYC late 
April/early May.  Let me know if you have any scheduling conflicts during 
those timeframes and I'll circulate some proposed dates w/ the product 
definitions.  Also, let me know if you are not interested in participating in 
one of or both roll-outs.

I will gladly circulate product definitions, but will be out of town after 
the 10th.  Could you CC: Patricia Young at EEI 202/508-5757 pyoung@eei.org 
with any definitions you want circulated.

Another topic I would suggest discussing briefly  if time is available is the 
results of the contract survey.  We have received many responses. Tabulation 
of the results should be done by our meeting.

Here are materials I recieved from EEI in anticipation of the EEI product 
description meeting on Wed.   I would guess that the bulk of the meeting  
will be spent on the ""Into"" definition, which draft was prepared by David and 
myself, but we will also need to provide requested alterations to the other 
product definitions (unit firm and system firm).  If you have any 
questions/thoughts about the Into definiton, please call either David or me.

Attached is the agenda and draft revised  definitions for the ""into"" and 
""system reliability"" products.  These files are in Rich Text Format.

As part of our discussion of the product definitions, we will discuss the 
effect of transmission curtailments on the parties' obligation to perform.  
We want to focus on the words on the page in Schedule P.   If anyone thinks 
the words on the page do not accurately reflect the business people's 
understanding of the allocations of risk and responsibilities in trading that 
product, please let them come to Houston with alternative WORDS that they 
feel better reflect the business relationships that exist in the 
marketplace.  The goal of the Houston meeting is to have  FINALIZED the 
WORDS, so that the document is ready to present to the industry and FERC.

We will convene at 10 am and adjourn at 4pm.  Lunch will be provided. 
Dynegy's offices are located in Houston at 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800.  If 
you need directions or information about hotels, please contact Michelle 
Cantu,  at Dynegy, 713/ 767-5981.

Elizabeth,

We have seemed to hit a brick wall in finding out who has monitored the fax 
machine we have discussed on the 31st Floor.  Don Black's assistant, 
Claudette Harvey said no one really collects the faxes and it is used by two 
groups.  Kay Chapman another assistant on the floor said it used to be 
monitored by Hub Gavela (sp?) but he is no longer here.  We called the 
service number on the fax to see if we could get a ""poll"" report listing all 
the faxes that have come in and found out this particular machine only has 
memory for the last 10 faxes.  I have called Lucent (the telephone people) 
and with approval from my manager they can give me a phone report of all the 
incoming phone numbers to that machine since September 1st.  Please advise.

Thanks,
Genia

Subject: Agenda and Product Definitions for Dec. 15 Meeting



Attached is the agenda and draft revised  definitions for the ""into"" and 
""system reliability"" products.  These files are in Rich Text Format.

As part of our discussion of the product definitions, we will discuss the 
effect of transmission curtailments on the parties' obligation to perform.  
We want to focus on the words on the page in Schedule P.   If anyone thinks 
the words on the page do not accurately reflect the business people's 
understanding of the allocations of risk and responsibilities in trading that 
product, please let them come to Houston with alternative WORDS that they 
feel better reflect the business relationships that exist in the 
marketplace.  The goal of the Houston meeting is to have  FINALIZED the 
WORDS, so that the document is ready to present to the industry and FERC.

We will convene at 10 am and adjourn at 4pm.  Lunch will be provided. 
Dynegy's offices are located in Houston at 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800.  If 
you need directions or information about hotels, please contact Michelle 
Cantu,  at Dynegy, 713/ 767-5981.

Attached is a preliminary draft of the letter prepared by Gibbs & Bruns 
notifying TVA of the occurrence of a Triggering Event and EMPI's suspension 
of deliveries under the MOPA.  Please review and call me with any questions 
or comments.  We will need to carefully consider EPMI's offer to provide 
energy under the MOPA at market based rates.  As you are aware,  the current 
plan is to send TVA  notice on Jan. 4th.   

The draft of the control area  petition should be ready for circulation on 
Tuesday, the 28th.   Once received, I will forward both the petition and a 
revised draft of this letter to legal, regulatory and trading for review.

Subject: Draft of Confirmation for Physical Transaction with Merrill 
(Moosehead)

As we discussed, attached is my draft of a confirmation under the Master 
Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement by and between EPMI and Merrill Lynch 
Capital Services, Inc.  In addition to the comments/questions noted within 
the Confirmation itself, I have the following thoughts/questions:

1) Note that the Enron Corp Guaranty is currently limited to an aggregate 
amount of $30,000,000 (this may become an issue late in the day when the 
folks over at Merrill figure out that this is one of the disadvantages to 
using a confirm as opposed to doing a sep. transaction with a separate and 
distinct Enron Corp. Guaranty);

2) Per Section 1.1 of the Master, in the event of any conflicts between the 
Master and a Confirm for a particular transaction, the Confirm governs;

3) Section 1.4 of the Master Agreement makes reference to a ""Qualified 
Financial Contract"" - is that applicable to this Transaction?  Might this 
somehow cause the accountants to treat the Transaction differently?;

4) Do we need to negate the reference to a ""Forward Contract"" in Section 4.6 
of the Master (Elizabeth we spoke about a concern that you had regarding this 
exact issue);

5) What changes should be made to the Confirm given the agreed to changes in 
the ISDA (Severability and Notice Update for example);

6) The last sentence of the Master appears to be missing some language.  It 
currently reads ""Disallowance of cost pass-through or any unfavorable or any 
Affiliate of the Non-Defaulting Party shall not constitute a requirement for 
a change to the terms of this Agreement."";

7) Should we still eliminate the last portion of Section 8.1(ii) of the 
Master to permit free assignment to an Affiliate (this previously was a big 
issue given our concern that we might have to assign certain rights to an 
Affiliate in the event of a bankruptcy).  Section 8.1(ii) currently reads:

  Neither Party shall assign this Agreement or its rights hereunder without 
the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent may be withheld 
  in its sole discretion; provided, however, either Party may, without the 
consent of (but with notice to) the other Party (and without relieving itself 
from 
  liability hereunder), (i) transfer, sell, pledge, encumber or assign this 
Agreement and all Transactions hereunder as a whole or the accounts, 
  revenues or proceeds hereof as a whole in connection with any financing or 
other financial arrangements, (ii) transfer or assign this
  Agreement to an Affiliate of such Party; provided, that such Party's Credit 
Support Provider issues a Credit Support 
  Document substantially in the form provided in connection with the 
execution hereof,; 

8) The draft of the Confirmation does not make reference to any of the 3 
""Facilities"".  Does it have to for acct purposes even though the only time 
that it was used was in the sections deal with gas supply (which did not make 
it into the Confirmation) and Section 6.2 of the prior physical agreement 
which used to make ""Buyer responsible for charges imposed on the delivery of 
Energy from a given Facility but related to the operation of third party 
transmission"" (this provision is not reflected in the Master and I suspect 
that Merrill would object strongly to its incorporation);

9) Did we ever determine whether the draft of the Confidentiality Agreement 
that I prepared was executed by Merrill?; and

10) The Master currently defines Stranded Costs but does not contain the 
standard provision regarding the same (should this be introduced???)

Per Chris Gaffney's request, attached for your review are blacklines of all 
of the transaction documents.  With respect to these ""near final"" drafts, 
please note the following:  (i) the Enron Corp.  Guaranty and the form of UIL 
Guaranty are being sent separately as well as part of the WPSA to highlight 
changes made to those documents from the prior drafts (they will appear 
completely underlined as Schedules to the WPSA); (ii) we have incorporated 
much of the comments from Wiggin & Dana with respect to Section 2.2 of the 
PPA Entitlements Transfer Agreement and Schedule 4 to the WPSA, but the new 
text may still need some tinkering with, particularly since the retention of 
the power entitlements by UI (coupled with the payment of the sale proceeds 
to EPMI) required a flow through of some conforming changes throughout the 
PETA; and (iii) the attached side letter relating to the RESCO Power pricing 
has not been reviewed by Enron as of this e-mail.  If you have any questions, 
please do not hesitate to contact Stephen Polakoff at 212-424-8350.

Subject: Latest Credit Worksheets for Project Moosehead

Attached please find the latest credit worksheets for the physical and 
financial transactions between EPMI and Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc.  
The credit worksheet for the physical transaction is in the form of a 
specific confirmation that will be confirmed under the existing Master Energy 
Purchase and Sale Agreement between EPMI and Merrill Lynch Capital Services.  
The credit worksheet for the financial transaction is in the form of a new 
ISDA Master Swap Agreement.  Per Bill Bradford, please note that Credit 
approval for both worksheets are contingent upon legal approval by Mark 
Haedicke of the physical and financial setoff/netting assumption.

I have requested and am waiting approval from Jeff McMahon to accept the 
counterparty's request to set the third party cross-default amount of 
$50,000,000.  For the purposes of these credit worksheets, the amount 
proposed remains at $100,000,000 for both parties.

Please call should you have any questions, x3-0554.

Regards,
Tracy

Enclosed are those documents I believe would be impacted if we elect to use 
separate Credit Support Annexes, one for the new EPMI ISDA and one for the 
Power Master (already in existence (""Old CSA"")).  

 1. New Credit Support Annex - to be attached to EPMI/ML ISDA (""New CSA"").  
Draft enclosed, including one marked to show changes from CSA currently in 
place between ENA and ML.

 2. Schedule to ISDA - Part 4(F) would reflect New CSA rather than Old CSA.  
Revised Schedule attached.

 3. No Amendment to Power Agreement would be required.  (Delete document 
named ""Power Amendment 1).

Subject: Project Moosehead - Revised Terms

Pursuant to my recent conversation with Rodney Malcolm, I am detailing below 
newly negotiated terms that have been accepted by Credit in regards to the 
contracts/confirms for the Merrill Lynch physical and financial transactions:

on behalf of EPMI, Enron Corp. will provide a $60MM guaranty to Merrill Lynch 
Capital Services covering exposures under both Master contracts (either amend 
existing $30MM physical guaranty or supersede existing guaranty with a new 
guaranty)
usage of the the stair-step Threshold that is currently in the Credit Support 
Annex (Paragraphe 13) of the existing Master power contract will remain 
effective for the specific power confirmation.  However, the valuation of the 
parties' exposure will be defined as exposures under the existing physical 
power Master agreement as well as the new financial ISDA Master.  [both the 
physical confirmation and the ISDA Master will need to reference this 
stair-step Threshold provision that will govern margin calls under both 
transactions]
deletion of the investment grade MAC for both credit worksheets (replaced by 
stair-step Threshold discussed above)
third party cross-default amounts:  Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. is $100MM and 
Enron Corp. is $50MM (contingent upon approval by Andy Fastow or Jeff 
McMahon.  I have left a voice message and an email for Jeff McMahon 
requesting approval of the third-party cross-default exception.)

Subject: Latest Credit Worksheets for Project Moosehead

Attached please find the latest credit worksheets for the physical and 
financial transactions between EPMI and Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc.  
The credit worksheet for the physical transaction is in the form of a 
specific confirmation that will be confirmed under the existing Master Energy 
Purchase and Sale Agreement between EPMI and Merrill Lynch Capital Services.  
The credit worksheet for the financial transaction is in the form of a new 
ISDA Master Swap Agreement.  Per Bill Bradford, please note that Credit 
approval for both worksheets are contingent upon legal approval by Mark 
Haedicke of the physical and financial setoff/netting assumption.

I have requested and am waiting approval from Jeff McMahon to accept the 
counterparty's request to set the third party cross-default amount of 
$50,000,000.  For the purposes of these credit worksheets, the amount 
proposed remains at $100,000,000 for both parties.

Please call should you have any questions, x3-0554.

Regards,
Tracy

Even though I've given you my new phone number, I thought it would be
helpful (my second name) to provide the new phone information to your
offices...there should be no excuses for not calling me...except that I
can't hear the new phone ringing unless I'm standing over it...which is
kinda like the old system...EXCEPT that I'm REALLY trying to check my
messages more often...as soon as I figure out how that is accomplished!!!

Soon I'll have a home e-mail address (as soon as Mr. Cox comes over and
installs the new home computer I have) which will be provided to all as soon
as it's available...

   new phone number is 832-236-5279

P.S.: this new phone is cellular...so theoretically, I can be reached any
place, any time..."

Give me a call about Duke's changes.  I also disagree w (ii) and really think 
even (i) is wrong since an Option can either be in the money or out of the 
money and in either case the full value should be taken and netted against 
other Gains and Losses.

Happy New Year

Jim,
I wanted to confirm that you had received the copy of the NDA that I sent
12/29.

Tomorrow (Wed. 1/5) will be the last day that I am in the office and
available to interact with your legal guys before our meeting on 1/7.  I
will assume, if I have not heard from Enron before 1/6, that the agreement
is acceptable as sent and that we can execute the document when I arrive on
Friday.

Regards,
Trent

At 10:45 am today, Jan 6th, we sent a notice to TVA advising them that a 
Triggering Event under the MOPA had occurred.  As a result of the Triggering 
Event, EPMI has the right to suspend deliveries and/or to terminate the 
MOPA.  At this point, we have not elected to suspend deliveries or to 
terminate the MOPA.  Accordingly, our performance under the MOPA at this 
point will not be impacted and we will continue to perform under the terms of 
the MOPA. 

 The letter also sets forth a proposal to TVA pursuant to which EPMI would be 
willing to continue performing under the MOPA.  This proposal is conditioned 
on  TVA allowing EPMI to seek a judicial determination of its rights and  TVA 
paying market-based rates for the energy delivered by EPMI to TVA under the 
MOPA  pending the judicial proceedings.

If you have any questions, please call me at 36349."

Attached is a memo from Julia about a meeting going over some of the deals, 
including power deals, that were closed last year.  Background information on 
the deals could be helpful as several of these deals are likely to be 
administered by power trading.  Let LindaNoske  know if you can make it 
(lunch will be served)

Subject: FREE LUNCH!

There IS such a thing as a free lunch (but you have to come to this meeting 
to get it).

On Tuesday, January 11, Chris Gaffney, Stuart Zisman, Dan Lyons and Karen 
Jones will discuss their experiences with some recently completed  
transactions.  These structured commodity deals were unique and interesting 
transactions, and transactions similar to these are expected to represent a 
growing portion of ENA's business.  This will be a good opportunity to find 
out more about this part of ENA's business, and to find out what our 
colleagues have been working on so hard over the past several months.

The transactions that we will discuss on Tuesday are only a few of the many 
deals that have been closed or are in the works, and additional meetings will 
be scheduled to learn more about some of these other transactions.  If there 
is a particular transaction that you would like to know more about, please 
let me know.      

On the agenda for Tuesday:

Chris Gaffney  -- United Illuminating
Stuart Zisman -- Project Doyle
Dan Lyons -- Project Saguaro
Karen Jones -- Project Big Horn (subject to Karen's availability)

The meeting will be held from 11:30 to 1:30 in EB30C1.

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE

The following is the current schedule for certain actions EPMI has taken or 
is contemplating taking relating to TVA:

Jan 6 -  MOPA- Sent notice to TVA by fax stating that a Triggering Event 
occurred and asking TVA to consider our  proposal in order to continue the 
MOPA in  effect (to date, there has been no response from TVA) 

Jan 24 - Operations - Cut transmission line for 2000 peaker

Jan 26 - MOPA - Notify TVA that EPMI is suspending deliveries under the MOPA  
effective Jan 27 and terminating the  MOPA by selecting an Early Termination  
Date ( which date may be no earlier than 10 Business Days after delivery of 
notice)

Feb 4 - Control Area - File complaint  relating to TVA's actions against 
EPMI's control areas, which lawsuit would be filed in the Eastern District of 
Tenn. (Judge  Edgar) as part of the already filed lawsuit on the interface 
issues

If you have any questions or concerns with this schedule, please notify me 
immediately.  

Unless there are any objections, we will proceed on this basis; provided, 
however, if we hear from Mike Miller that the target operations date of Jan 
24th can not be met, we would then propose to expedite this schedule.  If we 
move up any of these actions, we will notify everybody,

Attached is a revision of the Into product definition and  a blackline

now tend to regard the last sentence of each of  3C, 3D, 4A as overkill, or 
capable of being shortened, so I will look at this with fresh eyes as time 
permits on Monday Jan.17th.  Let me know any thoughts you have.  Before

Shelly Mansfield has drafted the attached Q&A and timeline in anticipation of 
our lawsuit against TVA regarding our control area.  Please review these 
materials and let me know if this is the approach we want to take if and when 
we receive inquiries.  Also attached is a standby statement if we receive 
inquiries about EPMI's letter to TVA about the MOPA.   We will probably want 
to revise this statement if the situation escalates.  

Thank you.

Subject: TVA - Time schedule for EPMI's actions  


	

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE

The following is the current schedule for certain actions EPMI has taken or 
is contemplating taking relating to TVA:

Jan 6 -  MOPA- Sent notice to TVA by fax stating that a Triggering Event 
occurred and asking TVA to consider our  proposal in order to continue the 
MOPA in  effect (to date, there has been no response from TVA) 

Jan 24 - Operations - Cut transmission line for 2000 peaker

Jan 26 - MOPA - Notify TVA that EPMI is suspending deliveries under the MOPA  
effective Jan 27 and terminating the  MOPA by selecting an Early Termination  
Date ( which date may be no earlier than 10 Business Days after delivery of 
notice)

Feb 4 - Control Area - File complaint  relating to TVA's actions against 
EPMI's control areas, which lawsuit would be filed in the Eastern District of 
Tenn. (Judge  Edgar) as part of the already filed lawsuit on the interface 
issues

If you have any questions or concerns with this schedule, please notify me 
immediately.  

Unless there are any objections, we will proceed on this basis; provided, 
however, if we hear from Mike Miller that the target operations date of Jan 
24th can not be met, we would then propose to expedite this schedule.  If we 
move up any of these actions, we will notify everybody,

Subject: Maine retail license for EPMI

Here are comments on the draft:

12.  ""Location, if any, of any office available to the general public or 
Maine customers:""  The draft says ""N/A"".  Shouldn't we put in Houston 
office?  Dan A's office?

13.  Customer rep. --Ramona in Dublin is EES customer rep.  Who will be ENA's?

15.  Should EPMI's response be limited to supplied RETAIL electricity in 
these jurisdictions?  Otherwise, all 48 states should be listed for EPMI.  
Also, the current EES sales in NEPOOL (New Hampshire and Rhode Island, I 
think) are made by EPMI.  There was/is also a retail sale in the MAPP area by 
EPMI, I think.

21.  EES' response is not exactly true with regard to EPMI, since it has been 
involved in civil legal actions.  However, does this really request any civil 
cases?  Can we answer by saying ""no enforcement proceedings by any state in 
which EPMI is providing retail sales of electricity?"" 

Tom, The application says ""Q"" is attached as other supporting material, but I 
can't find Q.  Also, you marked the Annual Electric Utility Report for 1998 
as ""A"", but I am not sure where it should go (""A"" is already answered.)

Thanks for the information.

Subject: Buying power from Industrials

Below is information about a FERC order allowing a power marketer, like EES 
or EPMI, to file to effectively act as an industrials ""agent"" when buying an 
industrial's excess power to insert into the grid.  Generally, an industrial 
would be required to obtain its own FERC power marketer license (takes about 
60 days) in order to sell into the grid.  EPMI and EES have not requested the 
""Impower"" type agent authority yet, but I have been asked to file this for 
EPMI (and, Dennis, we could file for EES too, let me know). 

If FERC allows EPMI and EES to do this, then we would make quarterly filings 
on behalf of any industrials from whom we buy power at wholesale and they 
would not have to make their own FERC power marketer filings.  (Also, Enron 
generally has to also file for ""EWG"" Exempt Wholesale Generator status due to 
utility rules; however, if the industrial is primarily an industrial business 
in something other than power generation, an EWG determination is not 
required.)

I will keep you advised on the status of the filing(s) once made.

On 3/30/2000, FERC issued an order accepting InPower's market based rates 
schedule that would permit entities that own generation to meet their own 
loads or for back up purposes (IPPs) to sell power at market based rates to 
InPower (on a profit share basis).  InPower made the filing stating it 
estimated that IPPs in MAIN (and, specifically, Wisconsin) could supply a 
substantial portion of the summer energy shortfalls (FERC did not limit 
ImPower to IPPs in MAIN).  InPower did not name any specific IPPs; however, 
to be eligible under ImPower's program, an IPP must control generation 
primarily for the purpose of meeting on-site demand or providing back-up 
generation and have such generation located on its premises or premises 
approved by the local utility.  Further, the generation must be capable of 
producing electricity either synchronous with the local utilities' grid or 
commensurate with agreements with the local utility.  Total sales made by 
IPPs in ImPower's program would not exceed 1000 MW/ hour.  The IPPs are in 
businesses other than the sale of electricity and are simply seeking 
""incremental return on the often-unused capacity of their generation assets.""

When an IPP participates in ImPower's program, it becomes subject to FERC's 
jurisdiction as a ""public utility.""  

Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA) protested ImPower's filing stating it 
allows retail customers to arbitrage retail and wholesale power markets by 
purchasing power at average, embedded cost retail rates and simultaneously 
using their generating facilities to sell power at wholesale to ImPower (at 
peak times).  FERC addressed JEA's concerns by saying that the IPPs cannot 
violate any rules and requirements properly imposed on the retail sales made 
to those suppliers.

This order allows ImPower (as an aggregator) to make the required quarterly 
filings for the IPPs and the IPPs do not have to apply for separate market 
based rates authority.  The are some additional reporting requirements FERC 
waived for the IPPs: accounting and reporting, issuance of securities and 
interlocking directorates (an affidavit is still needed). 

Please let me know if you would like a copy of the filing or order.

Subject: Re: Maine retail license for EPMI  

Tom has answered some questions:

12.  EES answered ""NA""; however, Dan, is this OK?

13.. Ramona Richards checked with someone and told Tom that she should be 
listed for EPMI.

15.  The Rhode Island web site only lists ""ECT"" as a retail seller, not 
EPMI.  Is this OK?

The A attachment is now inserted with the annual report and Jeff Hodge is 
providing Q.

Subject: Maine retail license for EPMI

Here are comments on the draft:

12.  ""Location, if any, of any office available to the general public or 
Maine customers:""  The draft says ""N/A"".  Shouldn't we put in Houston 
office?  Dan A's office?

13.  Customer rep. --Ramona in Dublin is EES customer rep.  Who will be ENA's?

15.  Should EPMI's response be limited to supplied RETAIL electricity in 
these jurisdictions?  Otherwise, all 48 states should be listed for EPMI.  
Also, the current EES sales in NEPOOL (New Hampshire and Rhode Island, I 
think) are made by EPMI.  There was/is also a retail sale in the MAPP area by 
EPMI, I think.

21.  EES' response is not exactly true with regard to EPMI, since it has been 
involved in civil legal actions.  However, does this really request any civil 
cases?  Can we answer by saying ""no enforcement proceedings by any state in 
which EPMI is providing retail sales of electricity?"" 

Tom, The application says ""Q"" is attached as other supporting material, but I 
can't find Q.  Also, you marked the Annual Electric Utility Report for 1998 
as ""A"", but I am not sure where it should go (""A"" is already answered.)

Thanks for the information.

Attached is a re-write of Product B, based on a general agreement between
Harlan and myself.  I apologize but I had a tremendous amount of problems
with redlining, and so have sent you a document that accepted all changes.
Hopefully someone has a comparerite program.  Andy would you please
circulate this product.  I will be glad to write up a summary in plain
English if you think that would be helpful.   All errors are my
responsibility alone, not Harlan's!  Look forward to seeing you on Wed.
Marji

PS: My email was wiped out since 1/3, what time do we meet, and would you
please provide Reliant's address.  Thanks.  M.

The EES application states that EES will not be serving residential customers 
so it is OK not to have a local office.

I don't know why RI lists ECT, not EPMI.

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE

 By letter dated January 24th, TVA rejected  EPMI's offer to continue 
performance under the MOPA at market prices.   Accordingly, we sent a letter 
to TVA today, January 25th, at 4:00 notifying TVA that (1) EPMI was 
suspending deliveries under the MOPA effective Thursday, January 27th and (2) 
EPMI intended to exercise its termination rights unless TVA agreed to our 
proposal to continue performance under the MOPA pending a judicial 
determination of whether a Triggering Event occurred under the MOPA.

 Please call me if you have any questions. 

  Copies of the letter will be distributed later today.

Attached for your review is a draft of the Joint Brief of Intervenors in the 
PCA
proceeding at the D.C. Circuit.  As you know, the Brief must be filed with the
Court on Friday.  Thus, to ensure that there is sufficient time to address
issues/concerns, we request that Intervenors provide comments as soon as
possible on Wednesday.  Please bear in mind that the Court has allotted
Intervenors 8,750 words and the current draft is right at that limit.  Over 
the
next day, where appropriate, we will add citations to the record, include 
other
citations such as case name short cites, and shorten quotations.  We look
forward to your comments.

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE

 EPMI filed an amended petition with the court in Tennessee where EPMI's 
current declaratory judgment action (interface issue) is pending alleging 
that TVA violated NERC rules as a result of TVA's actions during the summer 
of 99.  In order to amend the current petition to include this additional 
claim, EPMI needs the courts approval. 

 Please call me if you have any questions.

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE

 Pursuant to a letter faxed to TVA today, January 27th, we notified TVA that 
EPMI was terminating the MOPA effective February 11, 2000 (earliest date 
permitted under the MOPA).  At the same time, we filed an amended petition 
with the court in Tennessee where EPMI's current claim against TVA (interface 
issue) is pending seeking a declaratory judgment that EPMI had the right to 
terminate the MOPA.  In order to include this additional claim in the already 
filed petition, we will need the approval of the court.

   Copies of the letter will be distributed later .

As many of you know, the opening of Enron Field is quickly approaching.  
Enron Field, the new 42,000 seat retractable roof ballpark, will make its 
debut when the Astros play host to the World Champion New York Yankees on 
March 30th and 31st.  The defending American League West Champion Texas 
Rangers travel to Houston on April 1st.  The Astros open the 2000 
Championship Season on the road before playing host to the Philadelphia 
Phillies in the season opener on April 7th.

There have been numerous inquiries about how to secure tickets for Astros 
games at Enron Field.  A limited number of tickets have been allocated for 
Enron for these inaugural games.  However, we anticipate that the demand for 
tickets by employees will exceed this allocation.  In an effort to keep all 
of you informed, Astros tickets will be going on sale for the entire season 
to the general public for single-game tickets beginning this Saturday, 
January 29th at 9:00 a.m.  

 We recommend you secure personal tickets for the games of your choice 
through the traditional Astros ticket outlets listed below.  Enron will sell 
a significant portion of its allotted tickets to employees in late February; 
however, please remember that our supply of tickets is limited and will sell 
out quickly.

 March 30 vs. New York Yankees (Inaugural exhibition game)
 March 31 vs. New York Yankees
 April 1 vs. Texas Rangers
 April 7 vs. Philadelphia Phillies (Opening Day)

ADVANCED TICKET PURCHASES:
Tickets for all 84 home games, including three exhibition games, will be 
available at the Astrodome Box Office and the usual Ticketmaster outlets, 
including Houston-area Foley's, Fiesta and Kroger stores.  Those who wish to 
order by phone may do so by calling (713) 6-ASTROS.  Tickets are also 
accessible on-line at  www.astros.com and www.ticketmaster.com.

A detailed follow up e-mail will be sent to provide more information on when 
and where the Enron tickets will be sold.  In addition, Astros tickets will 
be available to Enron employees throughout the season, and we will notify you 
of these opportunities.

We had a little Excel disaster this afternoon adding fields for ENA, so if 
it's okay I'd like to deliver the environmental documents first thing Tuesday 
morning.  Unfortunately, Stacey is gone for the afternoon on personal matters 
and I am leaving for a doctors appt as well otherwise we'd send them today.  
You will have the map and the RPS and Disclosure standards and the New

As discussed at the 1/26 Working Group meeting, I am circulating minutes of 
the meeting we had with the FERC staff regarding tariff/filing/reporting  
issues related to the Master Contract.  In sum, the meeting was very 
successful in that the staff does not expect their requirements to impose a 
burden on the utilization of the Standard Contract.  If you have further 
questions, please feel free to contact me.

Elizabeth, 
Could you please review Alabama Power's attached Terms and Conditions.  All 
bidders must clearly state exceptions to these T&Cs in their offer.  They say 
any exceptions will affect the value of the offer to Southern.

In addition, you should have received last week three summaries regarding 
interconnection structures with Southern at Caledonia.  That interconnection 
review you are doing and this review of the T&Cs are necessary for us to bid 
on the RFP on Feb. 24th.  So if you could get back to me on Feb. 18st, that 
will give me a few days to formulate a proposal.  Also, depending on what you 
think the feasibility of an interconnection is, I may not submit a proposal 
at all since it costs $10,000 to propose.

Thanks for your assistance, please do not hesitate to call me with your 
thoughts - Mike

As you know, Enron does not own transmission facilities and therefore is not 
subject to the FERC code of conduct rules with respect to functional 
separation of generation and transmission.

However, when Enron established 3 control areas in the SERC region in 
June-July 1999, a separate legal entity (Enron SE Corp) was created to 
provide the reliability/control area operation function for Enron's Southeast 
generation assets.  Although functional separation is not required by FERC, 
Enron chose to do so because marketing/trading is indeed separate from the 
control area reliability function at Enron.  Additionally, Enron SE Corp. (as 
a certified control area) is entitled to ISN and IDC data that is subject to 
NERC confidentiality provisions and cannot be disclosed and/or utilized by 
the merchant function.

In order to protect the IDC and ISN information consistent with the NERC 
Confidentiality Agreement (for ISN data) and the OATI/NERC Non-Disclosure 
Agreement (for IDC data), only employees within the control area reliability 
function have access to the data.   To highlight the importance of this 
confidential information, verbal and written correspondence has been provided 
by Enron's legal and regulatory counsel to each control area employee with 
specific instructions to keep all required information confidential as set 
forth in the NERC Confidentiality Agreement.

I hope this adequately answers your question.  If you have any additional 
questions, please feel free to call me at 713-853-5035.

Thanks,
Kevin Presto

Tom,

 Please e-mail to me a copy of the presentation you gave to the ECAR
Executive Board last Thursday regarding Enron's request for a new control
area. I attended the meeting but the presentation was not part of the agenda
package.
 During your presentation you mentioned that Enron has agreed to
separate their marketing function from their control area function. Can you
please provide a brief explanation on what this means and how Enron plans to
accomplish this?

Subject: Duke Info

David,  Sorry I had to jump off our conversation earlier, I had a guy on the 
other line that I having been trying to catch for a while.   I will meet you 
up at Elizabeth's office  at 3:30pm to talk.  Attached is the e-mail proposal 
I recently sent Duke.  Other verbal understandings that have been exchanged 
are:

1.  Duke would be allowed 50 starts per year (June through May each year).  
Each start after 50/yr will have a $1500 per start charge.
2.  Duke gets 1 start per day

Duke has asked for Force Majeure and Availability language, so I guess we 
need to write up a standard PPA contract with all the standard language to 
provide them.  Kevin Presto has provided me the following information on how 
we want to proceed with the Availability issue:

Monthly Availability Calc. = MWHs delivered by Seller(in Month) / MWHs 
Scheduled by Buyer (in Month)

Base Payment = 100% of Demand Payment (Availability = 93% to 95%)

Penalty Payment = 1% bonus for every 1% Availability above 95%
Bonus Payment = 1% penalty for every 1% Availability below 93%

Note: Force Majeure is excluded from Availability Calc. if < 90 days

Thanks for your assistance.  Give me a call if you have any questions, - Mike

Dear Workshop Participants:

Please review the attached agenda proposal for the Houston and NY workshops.  
Generally, participants in the November workshop were placed on the same 
panels and given the same topics for the upcoming workshops.  I reviewed the 
audio tapes of the November workshop to determine these topics.    If you 
want, I can send you a tape of your presentations.  Other than the panelists 
noted, I am assuming you will be participating in both workshops.  Please let 
me know asap if  you want to change what you do in the program.

Generally, I think we need to highlight the changes to the Master since the 
November workshop, esp. product definitions, transmission contingency option, 
and confirmation procedures.   Of course, we need to get version 2.1 of the 
contract ready in advance of the Houston meeting.  We will do a postcard 
mailing to registrants letting them know the revised contract is up on our 
web site.

I also attached the power point presentation used by the contract panels.  If 
you want to change any of the existing slides, please make the change on 
hardcopy and FAX to me - 202-508-5673.   Liz and Fritz, I would like to use 
your into product slides.   If you want to add slides to the contract 
presentations, I would prefer they be handwritten and Faxed to me.  Our art 
department uses a formatting template.

Deadlines:  I need all new and revised presentations & bios, by cob February 
25 for the Houston workshop and cob April 11 for the New York workshop.

Audio visual:  We plan to have an LCD projector for powerpoint and a slide

Randy Petersen, VP in our Underwriting Group, is meeting with CanFibre 
tomorrow afternoon (Wed. Feb 9th).  He has asked if we can pull together the 
outstanding A/R amounts, date invoiced, and any other pertinent information 
he can take with him to the meeting.

Can you gather this information Wednesday morning and let me know when that 
will be available?

Thanks,

Subject: Can Fibre

Kevin:

I work in Portland in West Power tradng and have day-to-day responsibility 
for managing the Can Fibre account.  Since this deal started in Sept. they 
have only paid one invoice and that was paid 16 days late.  They are 
currently 57 days late on one outstanding invoice and 29 days late on 
another.  They have failed to come up with $ despite two ""heart-to-heart"" 
discussions with Dale Hrcak about this issue.  Stone and Webster, the firm 
building their Riverside plant, I guess controls the cash during this 
start-up period and Dale cannot get them to release funds.  They seem 
disorganized and fail to give us straight answers on when we will be paid.  
If Enron did not own a piece of this company I would be talking to credit and 
legal about whether or not Can Fibre is in default and what steps we should 
take to require collateral and/or termiante this agreement.  Instead, Jake 
Thomas indicated that I should talk to you re: next steps. Could you give me 
a call at 503/464-3822 and give me uyour thoughts? 

Thanks!

Chris

Tuesday works great for me. 

 As we discussed at the last meeting in Houston, I have begun, but not yet 
finished, revisions to Product B.  I have several questions and will need 
input from others as how best to proceed on some issues.  I spoke w Harlan 
briefly but would appreciate further input, particularly on the ""one-time, 
good faith effort"" to find an ADI.  I will call Harlan and Marjie to further 
discuss.  A draft will be circulated before the Tuesday call.

Thanks

Enclosed is a revised Term Sheet, one copy of which has been marked to show 
changes from Fred's last draft.  

The Term Sheet is intended to be in no way binding;  references to  the 
proposal being held  ""open"" have been deleted.  Also, I have not attempted to 
include any reference to SD Warren having the right to receive the financial 
benefits if EPMI resells the Power not used by SD Warren to NEPOOL at a price 
higher than the Contract Price (CFTC concerns).

Dan - Could you please help me fix the definition of ""Green Requirement"".

Fred - I wanted to stick to ""would"" instead of ""will""  as the operative verb 
in order to emphasize the non-binding nature of the proposal. 

If you have any questions or comments, please call me.  I will not be in the 
office on Friday.  In my absence, please call Leslie Hansen at 36121.

Shari and Elizabeth,

     We revised our CAISO language to address the 10 minute pricing
implemented recently.  See attached.  Do you plan to change your language
also?  As you can see, I took the easy way out and did not reference either
the 10 minute price or the Hourly Ex Post Price -- I just said the price
paid to CAISO by the Buyer.  Do you think this works?

this.

You may want to consider whether certain issues or solutions discussed here
would be applicable to Enron.

Andy
 
As we discussed during  the last conference call, attached is a revised 
Article 8,  Credit Provisions, to the EEI Contract, along with a revised 
section for the Cover Page.  The changes were made to make Article 8 more 
user friendly and to incorporate the few comments that were agreed  to during 
the conference call.  I tried blacklining, but that proved not decipherable 
due to the extensive formatting changes.  Maybe you will have better 
success.  I have attempted to mark by hand the changes and will fax that to 
you in case you want to distribute it to the rest of the group.

The only changes that were not discussed on the call (other than those 
resulting from the global restructuring) that I made are as follows:

1.  Changed  the Section entitled ""Performance Assurance"" to ""Collateral 
Threshold"" - Use of PA seemed  misleading since PA is referenced in other 
sections dealing with collateral.

2. Added the words ""acceptable to Party ___"" in new Section 8.1(d) and 8.2(d) 
in order to clarify, as we did in Sections 8.1 (a) and 8.2(a)  that the 
security must be acceptable to the receiving party.

3. Added provisions in the Cover Sheet to provide expressly whether the 
options are ""Applicable"" or ""Not Applicable"".

As always thanks for your help.

Elizabeth -- This letter is excellent.  Attached I added several 
suggestions.  Primarily, I suggest adding to the begining paragraph a few 
words and a sentence to put into perspective what is going on for the quick 
reader.  Also, on the mention of FERC, I suggested a ( ) to place into 
context and lighten the sting.  Lastly, when you use ""Commercial"" I suggest 
using ""commercially reasonable"" if that would be the ultimate standard 
applied.  Just suggestions -- use as you like.  Later JOE

Dear Andy:

     I want to clarify a misunderstanding in your email to the group.  While 
it
is correct that the CFTC proposes to regulate commodities with exhaustible and
nearly inexhaustible supplies differently, it has not characterized power as
having an inexhaustible supply.  In fact, I would expect the CFTC to treat 
power
as having a finite supply at any given time.  This means, for example, that
power derivatives traded on a multilateral transaction execution facility 
would
not qualify for exemption from the Commodity Exchange Act under the current
proposal.  I think the EEI and other industry groups should consider 
attempting
to persuade the CFTC to exempt physical and derivative power contracts from
certain provisions of the CEA under the CFTC's proposal to consider exemptions
on a ""case-by-case basis.""  See, for example, the discussion of DTFs on pages 
9
and 10 of the proposal.  I hope this clarifies the CFTC's proposal.

     Regards, Paul

A huge debate has been ongoing in he battle whether to include language in 
the EEI Contract that would provide that a confirmation that contains 
""substantive"" terms not discussed by the traders is subject to the ""deemed 
accepted"" language.  I have been very vocal against  adding this language.  
The politics as you can tell from this email have been fierce, and as in much 
of successful politics, dirty.  I'm not sure where this will end up, but feel 
like it is important that we all are aware of the history here as well as 
Enron's position (Confirmation needs to be the final, best evidence unless 
objected to in a timely manner). I will keep everybody posted on the results 
of the vote.

Subject: FWD:  Today's Decision



I am passing on the following message from Patty expressing her concern with 
today's decision to limit the choice on the ballot to optional language or no 
language.  Cutting through the ""edge"" of her comments, no doubt brought on by 
the frustration of being outvoted, I believe she has some valid points on our 
process here.  I have avoided  taking a position on substantive questions 
regarding the contract, but I too have a process concern  which I have raised 
with some of you individually.  I apologize for not vocalizing these concerns 
this morning.  Nevertheless, this is what I intend to do .  Given that Mitch 
was not available for the discussion and knowing Mitch's position on this 
issue compels me to release the comments he wanted circulated before going on 
vacation.  If there is a consensus from the balloting that the language 
should be included, but not as an option or as an ""opt out"" provision, this 
drafting committee should respect that sentiment.



The attention of many members of the Drafting Committee has waned and
EEI members (electric utilities which conduct wholesale power
transactions) are no longer represented on the Drafting Committee.
Mitch, in his email, did not think EEI member views were considered on
the Tuesday call.  And today's call  by Constellation, Enron, EPMC (and
Jones, Day and Schiff) did not even include any EEI members...
     The language compromise I accept, and believe that Mitch would
accept, in the spirit of Drafting Committee give and take.  But let's
not kid ourselves.  Today, a few members of the Drafting Committee made
a decision that even Mitch (the only EEI member on the Tuesday call) did
not think we had made or would make.  Read his email.  Today's decision
was to not even ""allow"" the EEI members' vote to be heard  to choose
what they overwhelmingly chose in Houston --- that is, to have the
provision in Section 2.3 of the Contract --- not just an option on the
Cover sheet). Today's decision is just wrong.
      As the person who was standing in the front of the room in
Houston, I feel strongly  that I know what occurred, and what Comed,
Dynegy,  Cinergy, IPALCO, AEP, Ameren and Toni Frost's group of
utilities, among others, know they voted on.   I am the person that
folks are going to call to ask why their views were ignored.  I had
become comfortable with the explanation for the revote --- to either not
add the language at all, add to 2.3, or add as an option.  But now
Working Group is not being given the choice  to vote as they did, like
the result or not, in Houston.  Even Fritz's suggestion that three
choices be given on the ballot was ignored.  Those three choices, as I
understood it, would have included an even more aggressive elimination
of the 2 business day presumption that the confirm, as sent, controls.

     The question I asked...  why we are afraid of even giving the
Working Group the choice to express the same views they expressed in
Houston...was never answered.
     When  EEI members call me to ask about this, I intend to suggest
that they vote ""YES"" on the ballot, and then  add an admonition to their
ballot that the language be included in 2.3 and not just be an option on
the cover sheet.  I would hope that the Drafting Committee (or whoever
remains on it) would at least consider such added comments although,
again, after today I have my doubts.  I intend to call some of the EEI
members that I know will feel strongly about this.  Since I know Mitch
will not be around (and don't feel he should be disenfranchised), I also
intend to call AEP as a courtesy.  I no longer support the idea of not
forwarding Mitch's email to the whole group, as he obviously intended.

     Ironically or perhaps intentionally, the Drafting Committee's
failure to address this directly until almost a month after the Houston
meeting means people won't even have a 2 Business Day voting window.
Nonetheless, regardless of the vote, I intend to discuss this in the
implementation discussion in the Houston/New York seminars.

In what I'm sure is an oversight, EEI forgtot to send me a ballot. After 
appealing for my right to vote, a ballot was forthcoming.  I voted ""NO"" on 
the proposal.  We will see what happens from here.

The following Message was sent to members of Contract List Server, the EEI 
Contract Standization Mailing List.
To Members of the Working Group:

A proposal was considered at the meeting in Houston on January 26 to add 
language to Article 2.3 of the Master Agreement which would require an 
agreement of both parties before any contract terms not part of the oral 
Transaction (but added to the written Confirmation) could become binding.  
Those in favor of adding such language hope to avoid the ""long form 
confirmations"" which have proliferated in the marketplace in the absence of 
an underlying master agreement - those containing arbitration clauses, Y2K 
representations and other non-commercial terms.  Those who oppose adding such 
language believe it is critical to market participants to know at some point, 
relatively promptly after the oral trade call, that the confirm represents 
the commercial Transaction, and that trade tapes can be overwritten.  They 
ask only that counterparties accept or reject the commercial Transaction 
terms within two Business Days.  If there is a dispute about the terms of the 
Transaction as it appears in the Confirmation, they want to be notified so 
that tapes can be preserved and the issues can be addressed promptly.

After much discussion, the Drafting Committee has developed language that 
could be added.  Given the strong feelings on both sides of this issue, 
however, the Drafting Committee decided to poll each company in the Working 
Group as to whether such  additional language should be added at all.   If 
the Working Group votes ""yes"", the additional language below would be 
inserted in Article 2.3 as an option that only would apply if selected on the 
cover sheet.

The following wording was developed by the Drafting Committee:

""If a Confirmation contains provisions, other than those provisions relating 
to the commercial terms of the Transaction (e.g., price, special transmission 
conditions), which modify or supplement the general terms and conditions of 
this Master Agreement (e.g., arbitration provisions,  additional 
representations and warranties), then such provisions shall not be deemed to 
be accepted pursuant to this Article 2.3 unless agreed to either orally or in 
writing by the Parties; provided that the foregoing will not affect the 
validity and binding nature of the Transaction.""

Accordingly, would ONE representative from each company in the Working Group 
please respond using the REPLY function of your email program to the 
following questions by cob Tuesday, February 29:

 1. Should the language addressing this point be inserted into the Master 
Agreement?  (If  yes, the language will be an option selected on the Cover 
Sheet.)

Yes_____ No_____

Subject: March 7 Workshop



I'm attaching my proposed schedule and panel assignments for the March 7 
workshop.  I've already spoken with several of you about your assignments. 
The panel moderators should have a conference call with their panels either 
Thursday or Friday this week to discuss the timing and assignments I put in 
the schedule.  I'd be happy to participate with you.

Materials.  For most of the contract-specific panels, I think we should use 
an updated version of the slides we used in November.  I am attaching the 
original slides and updated versions I've used subsequently.  Please make any 
changes you feel are needed and FAX them to me by noon Eastern tommorow.  I 
am also attaching Fritz' flowchart (into product 2.ppt) of the Into Product A 
and Liz' hypotheticals (examples.ppt).  Liz or Fritz, in light of the latest 
changes to the Into product, do these need to change?

Anyone with separate presentations they want distributed at the workshop has 
two options:  they can email them no later than cob Thursday or, if you can't 
make that deadline, make arrangements to have 110 copies delivered to the

Subject: Per your request


Attached is a form of Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement.  I believe 
that the provisions that you are looking for are contained in Section 3.5.  
The only concern I have is that the attached may not be the latest and 
greatest EPMI trading form (although I am reasonably comfortable that the 
cover damage language will not need a substantial overhaul).  There have been 
numerous discussions about this form being revised.  By carbon copy of this 
email, I am requesting that Elizabeth Sager forward to each of us, the latest 
and greatest form if it has been finally agreed upon.

Stuart

I've added today's comments to remainder of contract, including Patty's 
latest comments on Sch P and have renamed the file .  I plan to ship this to 
Fritz in the morning so his people can do the formatting and return it for 
our shipment to Houston tomorrow night.  You prompt comments would be 
appreciated.

Andy / Fritz:
*Please forward this e-mail to Patty Dondanville as I did not have her e-mail
address*  THANKS!

DeDe and I spoke this afternoon regarding the ""Independent Amount"" term in the
EEI Agreement.

Just to provide some feedback from a ""users"" perspective, the ""Independent
Amount"" concept was something that Elizabeth Sager suggested we use as a proxy
for bilateral margining which I introduced at the Sept. EEI meeting in D.C.
This term was literally ""borrowed"" from the ISDA Agreement.

The definition used in the ISDA Credit Support Annex is as follows:
""Independent Amount"" means, with respect to a party, the amount specified as
such for that party in Paragraph 13; if no amount is specified, zero.
(The ISDA Paragraph 13 is synonymous with the EEI Cover Sheet)

There isn't a ""definition"" per se.  The term comes into play in 8.3 as it is
added to the Termination Payment and compared to the Collateral Threshold.  To
put it in another way, it acts as ""buffer"" Termination Payment to handle
additional potential credit exposure created by transactions valued against
extremely volatile price indices.

Please call me in Houston should you have additional questions (713) 207-1211.

Thanks,
Randy

I am circulating the final of version 2-1 of the Master Agreement.  Those 
making presentations at the March 7 workshop should refer to this version in 
their presentations.  After the thorough going over by our reviewers the past 
two days, I can't imagine anything got missed.  Many thanks to the word 
processing dept. at Jones Day in NY and Fritz for getting the document 
formatted.   If something did not get picked up let me know asap.  No 
unilateral changes will be made unless it was an omission or overlooked 
typo.  Remember, I have all your faxes!

I am also attaching a new flowchart of the into product that Fritz prepared.

Remember, today is the last day we can accept presentations for reproduction 
and insertion in the March 7 conference binders.  Materials must be received 
by 4pm Eastern.  Otherwise, please arrange to have 110 copies of any material 
you want to hand out at the conference sent to the  hotel no later than

I made the following changes to these hypotheticals as I understand the 
changes made to the product:

Example #1

3. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission within 30 minutes of Seller's 
notification and request is accepted and purchased by Buyer.  Entergy is 
sinking in Cinergy.


Seller must move to another interface (either on  Cinergy's border (NIPSCO, 
LG&E, AEP. . .) or in Cinergy's control area (Wabash) at which Buyer can 
receive energy such that energy can sink in Cinergy.  Seller can require 
Buyer to purchase Non-Firm transmission (or Firm, if available) but each 
party will be responsible for any additional transmission costs incurred to 
reschedule to another delivery point.

Ex #2

3. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission within 30 minutes of Seller's 
notification and receives response that Firm is available.  Buyer purchases 
Non-Firm instead.  Entergy is sinking in Cinergy.

Ex #3

3. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission from Cinergy within 30 minutes 
of Seller's notification and request is accepted and purchased by Buyer.  
Buyer also secures Firm transmission from LG&E to sink energy in LG&E.


There are references to specific sections in the product definition, I don't 
know if they are still valid in light of the latest changes.

Could someone help me out before 4pm Eastern?  Thanks.

We were very pleased to see the enthusiasm surrounding the opening of Enron 
Field yesterday as tickets to the first four games at the ballpark went on 
sale to employees.  Unfortunately, Enron was only able to obtain a very 
limited number of tickets from the Astros to these games, and as expected, 
tickets sold out very quickly.  Therefore, no tickets are available for sale 
going forward.

We appreciate the feedback, both positive and negative, that some of you have 
shared regarding the opportunity provided employees to purchase tickets and 
the process by which the tickets were sold.  We recognize that no method for 
selling such a limited supply of tickets would be without room for 
improvement.  The process was devised to  allow the majority of employees a 
fair and reasonable opportunity to secure tickets through Enron for one of 
these first four games.  While careful consideration was given to 
establishing a lottery system, direct sales were selected because of the 
magnitude of logistical issues surrounding a lottery of this scale and scope.
 
We established the 11am - 1pm time frame so that most employees could 
purchase tickets over their lunch hour, rather than during business hours.  
Much to our dismay, some employees began forming lines as early as 9:00am.  
By 10:00am, the crowd was so large that it presented a safety hazard within 
the building.  We began issuing flyers for tickets at 10:30am and selling 
tickets at 10:45am at my direction to eliminate any safety concerns.

Considering the demand for these tickets throughout the City of Houston and 
Southeast Texas, it is truly a benefit that Enron employees were provided a 
special opportunity  to purchase these tickets.  We regret that Enron does 
not have a larger number of tickets for these games to offer employees and 
that so many were disappointed.  We hope to be able to give away tickets to 
some of these games through special promotions, as well as provide 
opportunities to purchase tickets to other games throughout the inaugural 
season at Enron Field.
  
Tickets for all 84 home games are available through Ticketmaster outlets, 
including Houston-area Foley's, Fiesta and Kroger stores.  Those who wish to 
order by phone can call (713) 6-ASTROS.  Tickets are also accessible on-line 
at www.astros.com and www.ticketmaster.com.

Thanks again for your enthusiasm surrounding Enron Field."

 Elizabeth & Janet:

Attached is a draft of the memo we spoke about the other day.  We tried to 
come up with as many arguments as possible, recognizing the strong commercial 
desire to put in the second interconnect.  As we have discussed, certain 
language in the Interconnect Agreement is troublesome, generally due to the 
fact that it does not appear that a second interconnect was contemplated at 
the time the project was initially developed.  Nonetheless, we believe that 
Caledonia does have a number of arguments in favor of the position that it 
should be able to build the second interconnect without a contractual block.  
The strength of some of these arguments will turn in large part on further 
factual development with the commercial group, as noted in a number of places 
in the memo.

Please let me know when you wish to follow up.  And, as I noted in my 
conversation with Elizabeth this morning, there is a possibility I may be in 
Houston next week and perhaps we could meet with the commercial folks at that 
time.  I think it would be advisable to walk through the various possible 
scenarios/strategies with them so that we have the benefit of the TVA 
""history"" and likely responses of TVA to some of the arguments noted in the 
memo.

Thanks  John

Please find attached my markup of the Draft Power Sale Agreement with New 
Hampshire Electric Coop.  I have added some important language in Article 
14.2 to reflect that Installed Capability will still be credited by ISO-NE 
even during an outage at Seabrook (i.e., they should have full liability for 
providing ICAP regardless of whether the plant is operating).  The rest of my 
comments should be pretty clear.

We need to have comments to NHEC by noon eastern time, Monday March 13th.  
Please call me at 978-449-9936 to discuss.  Thanks much.

Elizabeth:

Per Paul Racicot's voicemail to you, please find attached a draft power 
supply agrreement between Enron and New Hampshire Electric Coop.  (Reference 
to PSEG in the message body must have been inadvertant).  Tracy Ngo ran a 
credit check on them and found they have been running a deficit, but didn't 
see that as a problem since we are purchasing non-LD unit contingent power 
from them.

We need to have comments to them by noon Eastern, 11 Am Houston time.   
Thanks very much for your help, and I'll need to swing by and introduce 
myself next time I'm down in Houston.  I can be reached today, over the 
weekend, or Monday at the following numbers:

  Office:   978-449-9936
  Home:  978-448-9260
  If neither of these work, then:
  Cell:  978-314-5614
  Pager:  877-246-3206

Regards,
John

Here is the Formosa Term Sheet that spells out a straight-forward tolling 
arrangement.  After further discussion, I have eliminated sharing options.  
We will use this as a starting point and if Formosa insists on a sharing 
alternative, we will address that at that point.

Thanks again for lunch.  I enjoyed it and satisfied my craving.  I frequently 
order books from Amazon, so I get junk e-mail like this. They usually have 
good insites on new kids books (as if Eleanor does not have enough already, 
but I feel ok about buying books).  Sheryl.

I've spent the past 2 hours exploring each and every post office in the 
armpit of southwest Houston (Enron advice) looking to simply renew my pasport 
only to be intimidated by the words ""no less than a 4 hour wait""   (on hard 
floors) .

Any advice?  Your experience certainly must have been better.

Sad I am."

Subject: Kaiser One Month Melodrama

A number of parts of the deal making process are flying around at the same 
time and for the purpose of communicating to the team where legal sees the 
matter at this point I offer the following:

Apparently Greg Whalley has not yet signed the one month DASH.
Credit has requested that legal put a MAC clause in the one month confirm 
before the DASH is resubmitted to Whalley.
West Desk traders (Greg Wolfe and Mike Etringer) report that Kaiser's power 
guys in Spokane are saying that we can ""sleeve""  the power to them through 
Bonneville.  To legal, this means we sell power to BPA no strings attached  
and assume nothing about who they resell it too.

Obviously a clean one month sale to BPA is attractive.  But can it be 
detached from the larger call spread transaction?  I don't know.  Given this 
quandry, Greg Wolfe has advised me to hold off temporarily on preparing the 
one off confirmation  until the BPA option is sorted out.  I am following 
this sensible guidance and if anybody has a thought to the contrary please 
give me a call:  503-464-7845.  ----cgy

ATTENTION: This is a lengthy e-mail! Avoid eyestrain!
                     Print it before you continue!!

Dear Liz,

    I wish I=01,d been at the house when you called the
other Friday. Robert and I were scrambling about
attending to a dozen last minute errands on our last
full day stateside. Just that morning he had
interviewed at Flint Hill School, a K-12 private
school in Oakton, and came back beaming. He hit it off
with everyone he spoke with, and they let him know
they would offer him the job - Director of Technology
- as soon as they checked his references! The
Headmaster called the following Weds night with an
offer and said he=01,d have the contract in the mail the
next day. Of course he assumed Robert would want to
discuss it with his wife - as of February 16, 2000,
that=01,s me!- before accepting. Thursday night, two
weeks ago, Robert called him back to deliver a
resounding =01&I accept!=018. He=01,s very excited about the
job, a truly promising and stimulating change from
strictly teaching. The school=01,s policy is that all
administrators must teach a class, so he=01,ll be keeping
one foot in the classroom. We were SO very relieved
that the salary offered was more than we expected, and
we believe we=01,ll be able to live comfortably. Very
good news considering that there=01,ll be no second
income any time soon for this future NoVa household!
Unless I sell a screenplay or start a home-based
business down the line - Avon calling?, Tupperware
Parties?, Mary Kay?, Amway? medical billing? stuffing
envelopes? The Hamptons will, after all, be back in
the Land of Opportunity!!!
    His job starts late July, and we=01,ll stay with my
parents until we can find a good  place to live. I=01,d
like to live as close to the school as possible so
he=01,ll be spared the hardships of commuting. The Vienna
Metro - the last stop on that line - isn=01,t far from
the school, so we could also consider living near
other stops back down the line where he could ideally
walk to the station and ride from there. That area out
there is unknown territory in my experience. Vienna is
as far as I ever got while growing up in Langley. I'm
hankering to make a home these days, so I'm excited at
the prospect of hunting for one. And of course I'll
have Mom's seasoned advice and assistance. I even have
a few boxes of housewares still in storage at my
parents from when Philip and I lived on 10th Street in
New York. They haven't seen the light of day in almost
15 years! I have no idea what I'll find   when I open
them up! Robert has acquired very little, mostly books
and CDs,  living solo for so long. This is fortunate
because shipping belongings to the States from here is
bound to be a complicated chore and expensive as well.

    As much as Robert has enjoyed life here in Roma since
arriving in the fall of 1988 to work at the American
Overseas School of Rome (where he has been teaching
ever since), we didn=01,t seriously consider remaining
here. Job opportunities are very limited for someone
who is not a citizen of the EU. In that respect it=01,s
rather a dead end. For me the charms and pleasures of
city living in general are few and far-between at this
time in my life. And I find the urban living
conditions here even harder to cope with than in the
U.S.. The noise and air pollution are greater, and the
traffic seems far worse and more chaotic - inadequate
roads, more automobiles, and hordes of infernal,
spewing, deafening motorbikes that don=01,t observe even
the most basic of traffic laws and make every trip an
obstacle course. But  my greatest pet peeve?   The
clouds of cigarette smoke everywhere you go!  It
really is nauseating and spoils the pleasure of eating
out or going to a cafe or coffee bar.
    We flew back to Rome Saturday March 4, having spent 3
weeks with my parents on Hampton Ridge Drive in The
Hamptons - how fitting! Robert Hampton was entitled to
2 weeks matrimonial leave (Italian Law!) and the third
week was the school=01,s mid-winter vacation. My doctor
had no objections to my flying in my 8th month, so I
wasn=01,t uneasy about it. Our flight to D.C. via Newark
was a breeze because we were on a less-than-full 777,
the biggest, most spacious, and most comfortable plane
I=01,ve ever experienced. Our return flight was another
story entirely - a DC10, cramped, stuffy, packed with
passengers (many were bible-toting pilgrims to the
Eternal City), dreadfully dry air- it was miserable!
It took me almost a full week to recover from that
night and the jet lag. Of course at this stage in my
pregnancy I=01,m experiencing the occasional acute
discomfort, but for the most part it=01,s been a
trouble-free 8 months. What a unique sensation it is
feeling the baby bumping around in the womb.! I can=01,t
help but laugh much of the time, it=01,s such a curious
sensation and sight! She=01,s been very active all along,
at all times of the day and evening.  I=01,m glad to say
most nights I sleep quite soundly.
    Baby is due April 6th, two weeks from Thursday, and
the school=01,s spring vacation is April 15th - May 2, so
Daddy=01,s Home!!! Mom will be coming over as soon as her
2nd granddaughter is this side of the womb. We
returned to find Spring has arrived here! with lots of
birdsong and flowering all around: cherry and almond
blossoms, mimosa (a new sight and scent for me),
daffodils, daisies and violets. I must say I=01,m glad
our daughter will be arriving at this balmy time of
year. We are still undecided about a name for her, but
we agree we=01,d like it to be Italian in honor of her
birthplace. We=01,re told she may even be entitled to
Italian citizenship! But as with all things regarding
Italian law and its interpretation and real-world
application, one never knows until one dares to enter
the byzantine and infernal world of Italian
bureaucracy! We went to the Italian Embassy in D.C.
with our marriage certificate in order to get a proper
visa for me (tourists are only permitted to stay in
the country 3 months at a time), only to learn that
the only one that I could apply for is impossible
under the circumstances! Because Robert has been
residing in the country, he is required to request
from the authorities here that his spouse join him.
Then once his request is granted he must send the
appropriate paperwork to me in the U.S. where I in
turn approach the Embassy for the visa. And we learned
the other day that the waiting period here just for an
appointment to make the initial request is 5 months!
    There=01,s a possibility that because I=01,m pregnant and
have already joined him here I can get some kind of
residence permit. We wanted me to be here legally so
there would be no snags when it comes time to register
the baby=01,s birth. It=01,s all rather exasperating. Even
the American Embassy needs to see my divorce
certificates in order for us to register her birth
with them! I had to go rummaging in my parents=01,
basement to find them, and it will be the first time
I=01,ve had reason to present them to anyone!
    The last 8 months have been eventful, to say the
least! Our romance started in Waterford (where I was
housesitting for the summer) the first weekend in
July, and it started with a conscious, expressed, and
mutual desire to have and raise a child together.
We=01,ve known each other since living in Charlottesville
in 1981, and curiously enough he met both Philip, in
New York in 1983/84, and Tom, when he and I spent a
few days here in Rome in November of 1990 just a
couple of months after we got married. Also, we=01,d
spent time together over the past couple of summers on
Block Island, and I=01,d visited him here back in January
of 1998. But not until this past summer were we both
truly unattached and free to get involved. We feel it
was a beautiful twist of fate that I got pregnant
right away. The fact is I=01,d read for years that it can
take much time and effort for a woman my age - I
turned 40 in October- to conceive. We feel such joy
and promise being together and are looking forward to
joining the rest of you in the secret society known as
Parenthood! Robert is the most wonderful and sweetest
man I=01,ve ever been with. He is so good-natured and
even-tempered and bright. Life with him just gets
better and better. I do hope our daughter has his
disposition!
    So you can see why we felt it was fitting that we get
married in Waterford! We arrived in Virginia on Sunday
the 13th and made our way to the Loudon County
Courthouse in Leesburg on the afternoon of the 15th to
get the license. One doesn=01,t need to be a resident of
Virginia, and there is no waiting period since the
state doesn=01,t require blood tests. Caroline had
already made inquiries about the civil ceremony. They
aren=01,t performed at the Court House but the Office of
the Clerk of the Circuit Court provides the names and
numbers of =01&local civil marriage celebrants=018. We
called around Monday and found that Mr. Fred Howard
was willing to come to Waterford the morning of the
16th. The woman who completed the license for us asked
us who would be officiating. We answered and she
exclaimed, =01&Well, he=01,s right behind you!=018. We turned
around where we stood at the counter and saw a
portrait on the wall identified as Fred Howard, Clerk
of the Circuit Court, 1969-1981! It turns out both he
and his wife are natives of Leesburg. He was a
delightful and gracious man, and we were so pleased
with the ceremony.
    The fact is we=01,d given almost no thought to the
=01&event=018 itself! Caroline made it truly memorable by
making a cake and a bridal bouquet, buying champagne,
dressing us that very morning, and taking photographs.
I=01,d bought a loose-fitting size 16 deep blue velvet
floor-length sleeveless shift on Monday at Marshall=01,s
for $10, a haphazard purchase I made on the fly while
shopping for an interview outfit for Robert. I=01,d also
bought some special tea from Paris at Sutton Place
Gourmet across from my parents and packed 4 of
Grandmother=01,s best teacups, thinking we could have a
tea ceremony of sorts to mark the occasion. Out of the
blue (the result of Caroline=01,s prompting!), Robert
appeared in one of Charlie=01,s suits! It sent me into a
panic - my casual black wool turtleneck under my dress
wouldn=01,t do now! Caroline came up with a long and
flowing ivory silk blouse and a string of pearls that
complemented my dress perfectly. And so the wedding
party - Caroline, Charlie, Walker, Robert Michael
Hampton, and Jacqueline Walker Brock - took their
places in the cabin before Mr. Howard who shortly
thereafter pronounced us husband and wife! (No matter
that there were no rings to exchange! I=01,ll be looking
for one here in Rome. Robert has never worn a ring and
is reluctant to do so. Perhaps a tattoo is in order! )
And then we were able to go outside for a photo
session because the weather that day was so balmy. Two
days later snow and sleet arrived, but for the rest of
our visit the weather was very agreeable and
temperatures were warm and spring-like most every day.

    I would love to hear from you! I=01,ve been meaning to
get in touch for months. How=01,s Y2K treating the Cox
family of Houston? How did you celebrate the New
Year/New Millennium? I understand that you=01,ll be going
to Tina=01,s wedding with Ella and that Alex and Lucy and
Kate and Chi will be there as well. That should be
both a memorable reunion and curious event! Boy was it
shocking to learn that Mrs. Pafenburg died and that
Mr. Pafenburg is now living with Tina and suffering
from Alzheimer=01,s and requiring a full-time attendant
to look after him. It truly makes me appreciate the
good health and life that my parents have.
    E-mail me when you can! Hope all is well with you.
Love to you and Grant, Ella and Sam,  AND HAPPY
SPRING!!!!
    Ciao, XOXOXOXOXOXOX, Jacqueline

Elizabeth:

Here is a set of documents which might be useful as a starting point for your 
situation.  The idea in the transaction for which they were tailored was that 
the California Energy Commission (""CEC"") and three California UDC's would 
divert payments they were otherwise  required to make to a blackballed ESP 
into the infamous ""Lockbox.""  The bank-administrator of the Lockbox was to 
swear in blood to send money coming into the lockbox to our account first and 
dribble any leftovers to the blackballed ESP as they saw fit.  Also,  the 
mili-second that the funds plunked into the Lockbox a virulent ""Security 
Interest"" attached itself like a vampire to the juggler vein of these funds 
and this security interest was for our benefit.  

 Although I am proud to have the  name Yoder associated with the Lockbox 
concept,  I must in all modesty confess I have never closed out a real deal 
using the damn thing.  Stewart Rosman, an innovative trader who is well known 
for his patience with the legal process,  and later,  John ""Big Sky"" 
Malowney,   tried valiantly to get Legal to implement this sturcture but 
alas, I cannot yet put it on my resume as a triumph.  Good luck and let me 
know if I can help out in any way with your project.----cgy "

Attached are the documents Mike and I discussed.

1) Fact Sheet provided by TVA
2) Draft Master Purchase Agreement between Valley Energy and your company
3) Sample Confirmation Letter for Transactions under the Agreement

Valley Energy Corporation will be acting as purchase agent for an
aggregated group of TVA power distributors totaling about 400 MW.  We will
be purchasing blocks of 5 x 16 liquidated damages firm energy each week.
The minimum block size will be 25 MW delivered to the TVA control area.

The Draft Master Purchase Agreement reflects the requirements and
constraints placed on us as a participant in the TVA program.

Valley energy is in the process of obtaining a Line of Credit to satisfy
the credit requirements of our supplier counterparties.  We are also
interested in similar protection for situations where liquidated damages
may be due from our suppliers.

Please review the attached documents and provide me with feedback as soon
as possible.

Our objective is to be able to conduct business by April 6, 2000, which is
the first day TVA will allow us to participate.  Power purchased on April 6
would be for delivery beginning April 10, 2000.

Call if you have questions.

Thank you very much,

into the infamous ""Lockbox.""  The bank-administrator of the Lockbox was to 
swear in blood to send money coming into the lockbox to our account first and 
dribble any leftovers to the blackballed ESP as they saw fit.  Also,  the 
mili-second that the funds plunked into the Lockbox a virulent ""Security 
Interest"" attached itself like a vampire to the juggler vein of these funds 
and this security interest was for our benefit.  

 Although I am proud to have the  name Yoder associated with the Lockbox 
concept,  I must in all modesty confess I have never closed out a real deal 
using the damn thing.  Stewart Rosman, an innovative trader who is well known 
for his patience with the legal process,  and later,  John ""Big Sky"" 
Malowney,   tried valiantly to get Legal to implement this sturcture but 
alas, I cannot yet put it on my resume as a triumph.  Good luck and let me 
know if I can help out in any way with your project.----cgy

Enron's Third-Quarter Profit Rises 31 Percent as Sales Surge

Enron's Third-Quarter Profit Rises 31 Percent as Sales Surge

     Houston, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
largest energy trader, said third-earnings rose 31 percent as
revenue more than doubled.
     Net income rose to $292 million, or 34 cents a share, from
profit from operations of $223 million, or 27 cents, in the year-
earlier quarter. Enron was expected to earn 32 cents a share, the
average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson
Financial. Revenue rose to $30 billion from $11.84 billion.
     Revenue from Enron's wholesale energy operations and services
unit, which consists of marketing energy commodities and investing
in energy-related assets, more than doubled to $28.2 billion from
$11.1 billion. Revenue from its retail energy services business
almost tripled to $1.48 billion from $542 million.
     In the year-earlier quarter, a gain of $345 million, or
44 cents a share, and a charge of $278 million, or 36 cents, made
net income $290 million, or 35 cents.
     Shares in the Houston-based company rose 50 cents to $80
yesterday. They've risen 80 percent this year.

HOUSTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., North America's biggest buyer and 
seller of electricity and natural gas, said on Tuesday its third-quarter 
earnings rose 31 percent, beating Wall Street's expectations as online 
trading helped drive strong growth at its wholesale energy operations. 
Recurring net income rose to $292 million or 34 cents per share from $223 
million or 27 cents in the third quarter of 1999. Wall Street analysts had 
expected earnings of 32 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson 
Financial.
""Our wholesale and retail energy businesses have achieved record-setting 
levels of physical deliveries, contract originations and profitability,"" said 
Chairman and CEO Ken Lay. 
""We operate in some of the largest and fastest growing markets in the world, 
and we are very optimistic about the continued strong outlook for our 
company,"" Lay added. 
Enron, which has recently branched out beyond energy into fields such as 
broadband telecommunications and metals trading, said third-quarter revenues 
rose 154 percent to $30 billion compared with the same period of 1999. The 
company's stock has risen some 80 percent so far this year.

Arena-backers promote plan to group of Hispanic leaders 
By JANETTE RODRIGUES 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Pro-arena forces did some direct marketing to the Hispanic community Monday, 
pitching the $175 million plan to a grass-roots group of Latino leaders. 
More than 150 community activists and leaders, precinct judges and 
civic-association members attended an informational meeting and 
get-out-the-vote rally for the Nov. 7 arena referendum. The rally was 
sponsored by the Let's Build It Together political action committee. 
""By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this, it 
empowers us,"" said Celina Garza-Ridge, a Harris County-Houston Sports 
Authority director. ""It's very important to be able to say the Hispanic 
community made a difference, and we are exactly in that position."" 
George Postolos, the Houston Rockets' chief operating officer, said the team 
is actively courting the Hispanic community. 
The pro-arena committee, headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, 
and Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, does not want a 
repeat of the 1999 referendum. 
Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal. The sports 
authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and 
county to oversee and develop sports venues. 
The Rockets made a 30-percent participation commitment, similar to the one 
made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field, to fairly share 
the new arena's design and construction jobs with minorities and women. 
The team also promised to distribute up to $50,000 a year in neighborhood 
improvement grants of up to $1,000 each to worthy grass-roots, nonprofit 
organizations and civic clubs in inner-city Houston. The new program targets 
the Hispanic community, Postolos said. 
The new arena plan is being endorsed by a cross-section of Latino leaders, 
including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez, state Rep. Mario 
Gallegos, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others. 
Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city, and the Hispanic community, is 
getting more tangibles this time around. 
He said, ""When you consider that our community will get 30 percent 
affirmative action, that our youth will be taken care of through youth 
outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well, this 
is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the 
Hispanic community."" 
Mercedes Alejandro, who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston, 
heard the details of the plan for the first time. 
""It's good if it creates jobs for the community, and opportunities to rebuild 
the community,"" she said. ""We want it to be good for the whole, not the few."" 
Humberto Barrera, president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization, 
was critical of Hispanic leaders, not the arena plan. 
""I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay 
raises for teachers, health care and public safety, than building arenas for 
rich entrepreneurs,"" Barrera said. 
Richard Torres, director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told 
attendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing. 
Sergio Davila, president of the Eastwood Civic Association, brought up the 
lack of Latinos in leadership positions on the team's staff. Postolos 
acknowledged that the team needs to do better. 


	



TVA Says Enron Breach Of Power Sales Pact Cost $140 Mln
By Bryan Lee

10/16/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The nation's top two power providers are battling in 
a U.S. court over an unexecuted power sales agreement.
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has filed a claim against the power 
marketing unit of Enron Corp. (ENE) alleging breach of a power sales 
contract. 
TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its 
distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen 
expenses contributing to the government-owned utility's inability to meet its 
debt-reduction forecast. 
According to the documents, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, the alleged 
breach of contract contributed to a $140 million shortfall during fiscal year 
2000. 
TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case, which is 
under a court protective order. 
""A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract,"" said 
David Smith, TVA's chief financial officer, when asked Friday to elaborate on 
the line item in the information provided to TVA's distribution utility 
customers. 
But after consulting with attorneys, Smith revealed that Enron was the 
subject of the claim. 
TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment 
order from the U.S. District Court in Chattanooga, Tenn., in February, 
stemming from a dispute over a long-term sales agreement, an Enron spokesman 
said Monday. 
In March, TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of 
contract, a TVA spokesman said Monday. 
But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract, or to 
elaborate further on the dispute, citing the judge's protective order. TVA 
said Enron sought the court seal. 
The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houston-based 
energy giant and TVA, a government-owned utility that ranks among the largest 
U.S. power producers. 
The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to 
the lucrative U.S. Midwest power market, which saw extreme price spikes 
during hot weather in the summers of 1998 and 1999. 
After the summer of 1998 - in which power that typically sells for between 
$30 and $50 per megawatt-hour spiked as high as $7,000 per megawatt-hour - 
Enron cited a study showing that TVA's power grid represented the only 
unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest. 
TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were 
spiking upward. 
Enron built gas-fired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on 
the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access 
across TVA's system. 
After the summer of 1999 saw a repeat in extreme price volatility, Enron 
began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by 
failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service 
requests. 
A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement 
over the government utility's handling of transmission-access requests. 
But the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public 
with its complaints about TVA's transmission service. 
In February, Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson 
asking for the government's help, charging that TVA was unfairly giving its 
own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enron's 
requests were gathering dust. 
Enron later dropped the matter, saying that TVA was processing its 
transmission service requests on a timely basis. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones

Subject: NHEC ICAP and Energy Sale

All:

I wanted to give you a heads-up that we have been shortlisted to negotiate 
with New Hampshire Electric Coop (NHEC) on supplying their load requirements 
from Sep-00 through May-01.   Attached is a table that sets forth the monthly 
quantities and our indicative pricing (will be refreshing pricing based on 
updated forwards).  They have decided not to go with the purchase for Jul-Aug 
at this time.  They seem to have gotten their act a little better together 
this time around with pre-approvals internally, but any deal they do would 
still need to be approved by the NHPUC.

Here's the scoop on timeline:

They will send to us a draft contract this Friday for review/comment.  We 
need to have our comments back to them by Weds Apr 5th.  Elizabeth, does this 
fit your schedule OK?
They plan to hold negotiations with us and other parties via phone on Monday 
Apr 10th, and hope to close  a deal that same day.  Again, this deal would be 
subject to NHPUC approval, so we need to get a feel for the risk of NHPUC 
disapproval.
Tracy - as you know, they are not so attractive from a credit standpoint.   
Is letter of credit sufficient in their case?  Can we talk about what we need 
to put in place for the transaction.

I will be in Houston on Weds-Fri of this week (Elizabeth and Tracy -- I'll be 
sure to swing by and introduce myself).  Thanks much and I'll forward the 
contract when I get it.

Regards,
John

     For our New York workshop, I would like to put some ""meat"" on my very
intellectual (HaHa) discussion of the Cover Sheet.  Specifically, I would
like to go through some examples of how the Cover Sheet can be filled out,
i.e., focus on some credit hypotheticals and provide examples of the type
of things that you can add to the Cover Sheet, i.e., arbitration, choice of
venue, waiver of jury trial, language regarding transactions performed in
the WSPP or ERCOT control areas, etc.

     If you have already drafted any provisions to add to the Cover Sheet
or have any ideas for hypotheticals, I'd appreciate your input.  If you are
planning on adding standard provisions to all your EEI Cover Sheets, this
would be an excellent opportunity to allow me to ""market"" them for you and
explain their need/purpose/applicability.

     Also, I don't suppose anyone has come up with a Gas Schedule to the
EEI Agreement???  Just an idea which I'm not opposed to and which would
lead us in the direction Mark and Chris seemed to be pointing, i.e., a
Master Physical Agreement applicable to numerous types commodities.
Considering GISB is intending to revise its current form for short term
transactions and create a new form for long term transactions, this would
be an excellent opportunity to allow GISB and EEI to work with (and not
against) each other.

     If you, or your company, is not currently on the drafting committee
for GISB's proposed revisions and creation of a new form for long term
transactions (which, by the way, is an important point I want to make to
the GISB group that we do not want two separate forms, one for short and
one for long in the first place), I encourage you to contact GISB @
GISB1@aol.com and get involved.

     Please let me know your thoughts.

     Thanks.

Hi Susan

How's things going?  I hope at least OK if not well.

Delete my rambling voice mail if you haven't heard it .

Hey about the Sat party, I'm thrilled.  We would, of course, love to come to 
your house (I think Gail told me that you generously offered to host your own 
birthday party) but we would also love to have you guys at our house as well 
(wouldn't you rather relax, drink and let the kids shuffle around without 
having to worry about the diner preparation, and worse yet, clean up - after 
all it is your party - mine's next).  Let me know what you think.

Hi Dede 

I got your email about NY seminar. Great idea but sorry we can't be of much 
help - I haven't touched EEI since the Houston seminar.  I know its time to 
start trying to use it.  Oh well, next week's project.

On a more important note, do you want to try and hit this Tuesday (the 4th) 
at lunch?  Let me know.

Hope you have fun on Friday night.

I got your email regarding our sale to NHEC.  I will be out of the office 
March 31, and April 3, 6, 7.  When you get the draft contract, please forward 
it ASAP to Brenda Whitehead, my assistant, and Leslie Hansen.  Depending upon 
the timing and the extent of the comments either me, Leslie or another lawyer 
will be able to help you with this.  The timing may be awkward because all 
Enron lawyers will in San Antonio next week, but we will work it out.  Once I 
see the draft, I will have a better feel for the timing.

Talk to you soon

Mark had asked me to call Williams and invite them to the ISDA Energy meeting 
in Houston last week.  Tim at Williams very much wanted to participate.  As 
you can see from his email, he must not be on the distribution list for 
ISDA.  Can you see if it is OK to add him to the distribution list for future 
meetings.  Also, I called Dynegy at Mark's request and they very much want to 
participate as well - Harlan Murphy called me afterwards to ask that he also 
get notice of the meetings because they fully support the idea of one Master 
for all trades.  I will get Genia to forward Harlan's address info to you.  
Thanks for your help.

Elizabeth 36349

PS Mark 

At the EEI meeting last week there was a fair bit of discussion about cross 
defaulting all commodity lines and using a single master for all trades.  It 
seems that there is alot of interest in this idea.

Elizabeth,
Is it possible that we can be included on future mailings/meetings of the
North America Energy and Developing Products Committee - due to the late
notice of the last meeting on 10/10 in Houston we were unable to send a
representative.  We will, with ample notice, attempt to send a
representative to future meetings as Williams has an interest in the topics
that would be discussed.  Thanks for your assistance.  Tim

The latest version of the EEI-NEM Master Contract now can be downloaded from 
EEI's website at  http://www.eei.org/issues/contract/.  We only ask that a 
short registration form be filled out first so that we can better serve the 
community interested in using the contract.  We are making the contract 
freely available, multiple copies may be made, our only restriction is that 
the contract not be resold.  We also request that attribution to EEI and NEM 
be given in all copies of the contract.

Our intention is to use the EEI website and listserver as tools to help 
promote dissemination and use of the contract.  For instance, we could make a 
listing of companies using the contract on the website.  Also, we are 
considering posting on a periodic basis responses to requests for 
clarification or interpretation of the contract terms that would be of 
interest to the user community.  Please let me know if there are other 
enhancements that you would find helpful

Hi

Just FYI - A collection of racquets is more than just a luxury.  On Friday, 
after the matches, I was keen to assert my new found tennis prowess.   I 
thought I could do it too.  I was playing like a spring chicken until my 
first big overhead.  I set up well, ready to bounce that ball right over 
Grant's head.  I thought I was so cool.  Up I  went to find the ball and out 
came flying my  racquet.  On the other side of the net.  Cracked.  Everybody 
stood to stare to see if it was anger or incompetence that created such a 
mess.  I think I better work on that shot.

Tennis on Wed.?

Wed. we will be filing our protest (plus, many others will be filing 
protests) that Entergy's filing is discriminatory and not the way to solve 
transmission constraints issues.  Actually, Entergy proposes solving 
constraint issues by not allowing parking at a generation only control area 
and by eliminating netting--both items that we won last year at NERC against 
TVA.  Entergy's filing is a proposal to solve ""partial paths"", which they 
call ""fictional"" sinks/sources via elimination of the path.  

Now MAIN and ComEd (specifically stating that it doesn't want us to sink at 
the Enron soon-to-be control area in ComEd) have raised this issue.  We are 
working on a response to ComEd and Dick may be going out to meet with them 
too.  

Finally, DUKE AND CINERGY both told me that while their marketing/traders 
greatly want to protest Entergy's filing, their transmission side won't let 
them.  So both are filing plain vanilla interventions.  We need to again be 
looking for any NERC email blasters that go out from marketers of utilities 
now and into the summer, similar to what SCEM (Southern's marketer) sent out 
last year complaining about TLRs.  If you see any of these, let me know so we 
can possibly send them to FERC staff because it is very difficult to get them 
to take a public position.  PECO Energy is filing a good protest to Entergy.  
C.

Below, Harry Terhune from MAIN org. is advertising Entergy's recent tariff 
filing to MAIN members as a way to deal with ""partial path"" reservations and 
valid ATC calculations.

Subject: Entergy's March 21, 2000 Filing, FERC Docket No. ER00-1933



MAIN ATCSC, C&CSC, EC and OC TP and Control Area Contacts:

MAIN is presently struggling with the issues of how to properly represent
both partial path reservations (those submitted without true source and
sink) and schedules which are not physically realizable in its ATC
calculation and posting process in a way which validly represents the
ability of the transmission system to support power transfers and provides
fair and accurate ATC information to all potential users of the
transmission system.

One of our MIC representatives reported that Entergy has filed a tariff
amendment with a proposal to deal with these issues, and you may wish to
examine the proposed business practices to evaluate the amendment's merits
or potential complications.

If so, below please find instructions for your convenience on how to access
the Entergy tariff filing related to providing valid source and sink
information for evaluation of transmission service, reservations and
schedules:

 The information below provides an electronic link to Entergy's March 21,
2000, filing in FERC Docket No. ER00-1933.  Because the filing is a series
of scanned images, I do not know how to electronically transfer a copy of
the actual filing.  However, if you double-click on the http reference
below, your web browser should take you to a page on the FERC web site.
This FERC page should provide a space for you to enter a ""document ID.""  In
the space provided, please type in the following

document ID:  2040905

Then hit the [enter] key on your keyboard.  This will bring you to another
FERC web page where you can click on ""I=25"" (on the far right-hand side of
the screen) which will link you to the 25 imaged pages of Entergy's filing.

Oops forgot to respond to this request. It would be absolutely fine to use 
our arbitration language as an example for the Cover Sheet.  My only 
suggestion would be to leave blank the place for the arbitration (I've gotten

The latest version of the EEI-NEM Master Contract now can be downloaded from 
EEI's website at  http://www.eei.org/issues/contract/.  We only ask that a 
short registration form be filled out first so that we can better serve the 
community interested in using the contract.  We are making the contract 
freely available, multiple copies may be made, our only restriction is that 
the contract not be resold.  We also request that attribution to EEI and NEM 
be given in all copies of the contract.

Our intention is to use the EEI website and listserver as tools to help 
promote dissemination and use of the contract.  For instance, we could make a 
listing of companies using the contract on the website.  Also, we are 
considering posting on a periodic basis responses to requests for 
clarification or interpretation of the contract terms that would be of 
interest to the user community.  Please let me know if there are other 
enhancements that you would find helpful

I agree w Tracy - the Calpine master is legally sufficient for trades and our 
relationship w Calpine is sensitive.  We do not need to push the EEI Master 
unless they want it in which case we are happy to oblige.  Just FYI, 
depending on  the trade we would likely like to  add product definition (eg 
West Firm, Into Product since products are not defined in master).  

John

When you are ready with the deal terms, just let me know and we can find the 
right person to help you document it given the nature of the product involved."

We need to send a letter to TVA appointing the Operating Representatives for 
the 4 Interconnection Agreements.   I recommend yourself and Lloyd Will be 
the Enron representatives for the respective Agreements.  I have a previous 
letter in the file (get from Felicia) that you can use a template to create

Morris--Thanks for your previous information where you said, from a tax 
standpoint, that EPMI could buy and sell power in Canada as long as the 
trading was done in Houston (or Portland).  Can the EPMI traders physically 
meet in Canada with Canadian counterparties, as long as the agreement is 
executed by EPMI in the US?

Morris/Elizabeth/Jeff -- Tom May, our new NY trader, wants to wheel power 
to/from NEPOOL or NY through Hydro Quebec Power and New Brunswick Power.  
Rhonda and I will take care of the EPMI wheeling agreements on HQ and New 
Brunswick.  Who can make sure that EPMI has the necessary export permits to 
take power out of Canada (DOE or NEB)?  Thanks.

		 Subject: Cal PX indmentity agreement

The CalPX ""Credit Redisign"" situation is an irritating mess that I am trying 
to help straighten out.  Here is a summary of what is going on.  Please keep 
this summary around and read it every time you get a question from a confused 
individual  and feel free to forward it to whomever out there is confused 
about things.

The CalPX  has a Surety bond with a big Surety entity.  The gist of the thing 
is that If the PX ever gets into a situation where one of the players on its 
exchange defaults, it can pick up the phone and call the  Surety and the 
Surety will rush money to the PX withing 5 minutes, no questions asked.   
Before the Surety agreed to do this bond with the PX they insisted that all 
of the players that do business with the PX (called principals) sign 
indemnity agreements with it.  The indemnity agreements basically say that if 
the Surety ever has to pay a penny to the PX,, it can immediately call the 
Principal and the principal will rush a penny to the Surety within 5.1 
minutes.  The indemnity agreement says that the Principal must pay the Surety 
upon demand for the share of the loss that it caused.  It also says a bunch 
of stuff that makes it very clear that we might also have to pay money in 
situations that are not our fault too.  It is a risky, bad agreement to sign 
and in the first round of this stuff with the PX a year or so ago we did not 
sign any indemnity agreement.  What happened instead was that Enron Corp 
stepped in and saved the day.  It just so happens that Enron Corp. already 
had a preexisting Indemnity Agreement with the Surety covering various 
exposures at the 20,000 foot corporate level.  I was able to get the Enron 
Corp bond people to talk to the Surety and the result was a two sentence 
letter from the PX saying we were okay to trade.  We did not have to sign the 
indemnity agreement.  I did not negotiate any of the terms  between Corp and 
the PX on this. 

That is the history.  Now we come to the PX's new ""Credit Redisign.""   The PX 
is anxious that it is not covered well enough.  So, out they come with 
exactly the same set of documents demanding that everybody sign another 
indemnity agreement.  Like a trained dog, I have just been trying to do the 
same thing I did last time.  I have called Corp and tried to get them to make 
the issue go away the same way they did last time.  Unfortunately there are 
different people involved now and I have not been very aggressive about 
telling the story and getting eveybody to work together.  I am now back from 
a nice littel vacation and promise to push the thing through Corp. as best I 
can.  I have already left two voice mails and will faithfully and doggedly 
try to take care of this.  ----cgy"

All:

I received an RFP from Northeast Utilities for sale of peaking plant 
entitlements to which I would like to respond (respose due Fri 5/12).  A 
requirement for any transaction coming out of this process is that the 
winning buyer must be signed on to NU's Tariff 7 (mkt based rate tariff).  Do 
any of you know whether or not we are already signed on to this?  If not, 
would one of you be able to review this tariff (attached) to see if there are 
any problems with it?  Thanks.

John

(anytime anywhere) or Wednesday?  Also, I see that Shari has sent out CAISO 
language which I have not yet reviewed.  Maybe we can also schedule a real 
meeting on Monday to finalize.  Let me know if that works for you.  See ya."

Hi Brent 

Hope all is well.

I received your email.  In the US we do physical power puts and calls,  
usually on a daily, weekly or monthly basis (e.g several month deal that 
gives party right to receive/sell energy on a daily basis).  The confirmation 
for them is very simple, and generally assumes an underlying master that 
would govern the physical delivery if the option is exercised as well as all 
the other general terms and conditions.  
By copy of this email, I would ask Leslie Hansen to send you copies of a put 
and call confirmation which she can get from our documentation group.

Looking forward to seeing you soon back in Houston

(Thanks Leslie)

Michael

I received a call from your attorney a few days ago; she was  inquiring
about the status of the draft of the power sales agreement.  .  I misplaced
her number; therefore I did not get back to her.  Please apologize to her
for me.  We have not spent much time with your draft because we feel our
positions are so far apart that  NES's time was better spent working with
those suppliers that understood the program and were comfortable with the
program.  We have one contract signed and are negotiating with two other
suppliers.  Is there any point to sending ENRON a copy of the agreement NES
is will to sign or has ENRON decided it has very little interest in the
program as it is structured?

We will get back in touch with you as soon as we check the details.  Thanks 
for the great offer and encouragement. I'm praying we can make it all work

		 Subject: TVA/Gleason - second transmission credits doc

Elizabeth, we discussed this matter intenally yesterday, witht he following 
conclusions:

We want to be able to apply Gleason Network credits to all transmission costs 
(from all  TVA-related control areas)
We want to be able to go negative on application of the credits - when 
network upgrade invoices to Gleason have not  yet caught up to transmission 
credit requests from all of the control areas.
We do not want to make a monthly declaration of transmission requirements.  
We need to agree with TVA on a process to keep track  of the credit usage and 
balance.

We would like to go over them with you in our 2:30 pm meeting today - at the 
controol room conference table.  

Larry.

Subject: Re: Ltr to Soderquist - Designate Recipients of Trans Credit  

Larry:

Please make sure folks are up to speed on this. In any current month, the 
amount of the transmission credit is equal to the then current amount of 
capital costs paid by Gleason to TVA for the Shleby upgrade, less any 
transmission credits previously used. I think the way to go is first to see 
if we can use the credits to offset transmission charges from our other TVA 
plants (on this point, TVA said no, but since Luke is out of the picture, we 
should make another run at this). If that does not fly, (that is, if the 
amount of credits we can use in any month is limited to the transmission 
charges otherwise due from Gleason on the power it generates), we obviously 
want to make sure we designate a credit amount equal to only as much as we 
actually need. 

Given that I believe we are the first IPP to be in this situation with TVA, 
and given that TVA is to repay us in 2009 for the actual cost of the Shelby 
upgrade less transmission credits actually used, we also need to make sure we 
are accurately tracking both upgrade costs and transmission credits used, and 
that TVA agrees with what we believe to be the correct balance. Jody Pierce 
and Amy Copeland are aware of this, but I caution that we need to be 
extremely careful given the amount of money involved. Toward this end, I have 
asked Jody and Amy to make sure each TVA Shelby upgrade invoice is adequately 
labelled as such by TVA before we make payments. I strongly suggest we put in 
place a similar system for transmission credits whereby we receive TVA 
signoff as part of the process Dennis To references below.

Please follow up with Jody, Amy, and Lloyd to make sure everyone is up to 
speed on this as we proceed, and please make sure that an adequate process is 
set up to account for transmission charges, credits, and balance of Shelby 
upgrade costs.

Thanks much,

Ben

No one will be audited at this time but I just wanted to see if the agreement 
would be acceptable to us in the future.

What would FRCC be auditing Enron for or on?  L:et me know, then I'll show 
this to ENA legal.

Attached is the audit confidentiality agreement we used in our audit process
last year.  As I mentioned, it did have legal review by several of the audit
team member companies, and all of our team members signed it.  Hope it
helps.

Adam:  Will you be in charge of this filing on behalf of the Wind companies?  
Christi:  Will you be in charge of this filing on behalf of the peakers, or 
should we include someone from that group in the process as well.

Mary:  This should include all the people who need to be involved.  Also, EES 
has a section 203 application pending before FERC now to acquire PG&E Energy 
Services.  I want to wait to file this tariff with FERC until we get FERC 
approval on the PG&E ES application (we hope to get FERC authorization by 
mid-June).

 Hi John

Just wanted to let you know that we still have not heard from TVA, re dual 
interconnect with Southern. In the next week or so we will give them a call.  
On the Gleason facility, TVA has been relatively helpful and has agreed to 
let us go ""commercial"" sooner than they otherwise would be required to.  
Maybe this is a thawing of relations.  Just dreaming.

Talk to you soon.

Hope all is well.

The June 1 issue of PUF contains an article about the Master Contract.  The 
reporter interviewed me and Richard McMahon, another EEI staffer, after our 
NY workshop.  The reporter promised that I would see the article before 
publication.  This never occured.  Had I had seen it I would have tried to 
correct several errors.   At the outset, I want to apologize for the 
mischarcterization of me and Richard McMahon as ""architects"" of the 
contract.   The true architects are the many industry representatives who 
devoted their time, energy, and company resources to participating in the 
year and a half drafting process.  EEI's role was only as a facilitator; 
hosting meetings; disseminating information, and sponsoring our series of 
contract workshops.
I intend to correct this error in a letter to the editor.

Subject: Entergy WSPP Contract


Mike - 

I just spoke to my contact at Entergy.  They have moved exclusively to the 
WSPP contract to streamline their contracts department and protect them 
against inconsistent contractual language.  They are not bending on this 
requirement at this time.  As such, I think we need to proceed with signing 
this agreement unless there are any significant issues.  

Could you coordinate the execution with legal ( I think E. Sager was working 
on this).  Arlyn Kelleher is the contact on Entergy's side.  Her # is 
281-297-3582.

Kevin, Kyle, Elizabeth - are there any significant issues that would prevent 
us from executing this contract?  We need them as a counterparty and I do not 
think sleeving is the answer.

Thanks,
Rogers

Mike - As much as I wanted to come to the June 12th WSPP meeting, a conflict 
arose which I am not able to get out of.  In my absence, I asked Christian 
Yoder to help out (general Enron thoughts) and Randy Osteen (Constellation)  
to speak about the EEI ""Into Product"" if the group wants to understand  a 
little of the history behind it and how the product works (Randy actively 
participated in the review and formulation of the Into Product as well.

Sorry again for missing the meeting.

Talk to you soon.

Elizabeth:  I got in touch with Sam.  He agrees that you can do a 
""back-to-back"" arrangement in the interim between signing and closing--i.e., 
before you receive the 203 approval for the assignment of the contracts.  
Also, you are correct that there is no statutory or regulatory deadline that 
FERC must meet in granting (or denying) 203 approval.  I can add that in a 
couple of relatively similar and uncontoversial situations with which we have 
been involved recently or are otherwise aware of, 203 approval has been 
received in as short as 45-60 days.  However, it is possible that at this 
time of year, dealing with summer vacations, it could take somewhat longer 
even in the most straightforward cases.  Let me know if you need anything 
else.  Low to high.  Thanks.  John

At the request of Christi Nicolay, attached please find the definition of an 
""Into Product"" that was prepared by a group of industry participants working 
with the Edison Electric Institute (EEI)  (this definition is also available 
on the EEI web page).  The only other definition of an ""Into"" product of 
which I am aware is the information that is available on the Cinergy web page 
or the definition published by NYMEX for its ""Into Entergy"" product.  If you 
have any questions about the ""Into"" energy product that is so commonly traded 
in the over-the-counter market in the East (eg ""Into Entergy"", ""Into TVA"", 
""Into Cinergy"", ""Into ComEd""), please don't hesitate to call me.

Attorney-Client Privileged Communication

Hi Tim

Leslie Reeves recently spoke to me about an outstanding receivable we still 
have relating to PCA.  

PCA went into bankruptcy in 1998.  At the time of PCA's bankruptcy, PCA owed  
a $5.3 million receivable to EPMI.   On EPMI's books, this uncollected 
receivable amount was offset by an out-of-the money forward position EPMI had 
with PCA which we were able to take to zero when PCA defaulted (contract 
provided for one  way payments upon the occurrence of an event of default) 
and some funds from credit.  After netting all these amounts,  there is still 
a $600,000 receivable showing up as owed from PCA to EPMI.  Based on the 
current bankruptcy proceedings, it is not likely that EPMI will receive any 
additional funds from PCA (we have taken a very low key approach in the 
bankruptcy due to the lack of PCA funds, the extensive amounts owed by PCA to 
other creditors, the assertions being made by PCA against some of the other 
creditors, and the legal effect of the one-way payment termination payment 
that provided us a significant offset to the receivable).

Accordingly, unless I hear otherwise from you, I will talk to Leslie and tell 
her to go ahead and clean up the $600,000  PCA receivable now, and in the 
unlikely event PCA makes payments to any creditors,  we would then give such 
amounts received from PCA back to you. 

Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks
Elizabeth

Here is a rough draft.  I will also start on TVA letter.  Per my earlier vm, 
I am struggling with the benefit of a 2 year proposal vs. 7.  I'm not sure if 
we get any ""cap"" benefit from making a seven year deal even if TVA doesn't 
accept our offers (benefit would assume that TVA has an obligation to cover 
entire position which is contrary to what our outside counsel has said in the 
past.  According to Bob, since TVA is asking for specific performance, it may 
not be reasonable for TVA to cover entire period.  I will try to talk to him 
tonight.). If  TVA accepts one of our proposals and then we lose the 
termination argument, what do we do? Supply? Terminate Again? In either case 
our proposal for 7 years will likely not cap our damages.  Let me know what 
you think.  I'll be in early tomorrow.  Thanks"

Richard and Jeff - 

As we discussed,  I will need further assistance from you to complete several 
of the entries.  I have put your names by the entries that will either need 
to be updated or to be completed. I believe Julia and Mark T would be the 
best to provide updated information on the SEC Risk and the CFTC Risk , 
respectively, and I will get with them shortly to update.  This document has 
limited access; only my assistant, Brenda Whitehead can view/revise.  
Accordingly, Jeff and Richard - please either call me to discuss your

		 Subject: Indian Mesa II PPA -- Oct. 23 draft




Attached are clean and blacklined drafts of the revised PPA for Indian Mesa 
II.? I apologize for not being able to distribute this in the ""track changes"" 
format, but because of numerous internal drafts, the track changes document 
was simply too confusing with internal comments showing as deletions.? As a 
result, you will not be able to go into the blacklined version and 
accept/reject changes, nor make additional changes to such document without 
such changes being re-inserted into the ""clean"" version.? 

If you have any problems opening the attachments, please contact me at

Members of the working group for MISO

Attached are a set of files that many of you may have seen that are the
result of work undertaken to define the attributes of a real flow system for
SPP.  Because, at yesterday's meeting, several of you indicated that you had
not seen these I am including the full deck here.

The work reported in these documents was sponsored by:

Coral
Dynegy
Enron
PG&E Gen
Tanaska.

In addition to the FAQ attached we responded to about 40 other questions
that were posed by participants in SPP. These came in several waves and
tended to be far more specific to SPP and therefore are not attached.  I can
pull those together if you believe that they would be helpful.

My plan is to be at the meeting in Chicago next monday and I can answer
questions (off line so that I don't take committee time) about these
documents if that would be useful for individuals.

BEST

Elizabeth:
Sorry I haven't got back to you sooner.  Can you give me your home number?  I 
think that weekends would be easier to schedule since weekdays are still 
fairly hectic.  I'll call you soon.  How about this heat?  Fortunately, I've 
been playing early in the mornings or late at night so it's not too bad.  
I've also am hooked on watching the Open every day - a fringe benefit to 
maternity leave.  Tonight should be great.  I hope one of the Williams' gets 
beat.  talk to you soon.

Hi Carol!

Thrilled to hear all is going well.  I would love to play tennis anytime 
(hopefully sooner rather than later so I can take advantage of  that 
lingering fatigue that takes months? years? to abate).  We can play at the 
Met either around lunchtime or sometime after 4:00.  Weekends would also 
work.  Can you play next Tuesday or Wednesday?  Call or write.

See you soon

Elizabeth:

I'd like a flat screen monitor if they are still making those available.  
Note that I have a lap top, so if there are any issues involved in using the 
flat screen with the lap top, I'd like to know before we make the switch.

Hi Shari,

Christian asked me to review these inc/dec examples.  I think these are an 
excellent idea and will be very helpful to your counterparties in 
understanding how the Adjustment Payment works in combination with inc/dec 
pricing.

I made some corrections to the examples, which I have attached as a redline 
document so that you can see what I did.  You will also see that I added a 
few words here and there to clarify things.  The other document is a clean 
version incorporating all of the proposed changes from the redlined document.

Dear Bob- 

Elizabeth has put together a set of examples to help our counterparties 
better understand Inc and Dec Pricing. Would you please look through these 
and let me know if this all correct from your view point? 

If you could let me know by Wed. morning - that would be great. I have a lot 
of pressure to get this out to counterparties ASAP. 

Thank you !

Shari

I discovered Thursday afternoon that ACES Power Marketing is entering into 
power transactions on behalf of Wabash Valley Power Association, Inc.  Our CP 
in En-Power is Wabash, and so far as documentation/global counterparties, all 
transactions are entered into directly by Wabash.  However, it is actually 
ACES that is making the call or using the EOL password to do a deal.  

I have requested a copy of the agency agreement between Aces and Wabash and 
have forwarded to Wabash the attached form of Consent and Acknowledgment for 
execution.

I would like to discuss with you whether you feel further steps are necessary 
with regard to either our general contractual relationship or EnronOnline and 
have set up a meeting through Brenda.

Leslie

The attached list is a follow up to our discussion (i.e., IPALCO's problem 
contract) on existing customer contracts and mid-market's initiative to 
dramatically ramp up short term deal flow. This list represents 
counter-parties we anticipate transacting with frequently. Please advise as

		 Subject: Single Master Agreement


As we discussed at the Board meeting last week, the impetus for a single
master agreement will need to come from several fronts, but especially from
within each of your firms. The various trade associations will be most
responsive to the idea if they are hearing strong support for a single
agreement from decision-making levels within member firms. We will
separately continue or commence a dialogue with the trade associations that
sponsor various agreements or are active in the areas of the financial
products that would be covered by such an agreement.

The trade associations we have identified as likely to be important to this
project are the following:

Securities Industry Association (US)
The Bond Market Association (US)
International Securities Market Association (principally Europe)
European Banking Federation (Europe)
The Foreign Exchange Committee (NY, London, Tokyo)
Emerging Markets Traders Association

The following associations may also be helpful to the process:

Australian Financial Markets Association
British Bankers Association
Japan Securities Dealers Association
Canadian Bankers Association
International Primary Markets Association (London-based)
ACI (The Foreign Exchange Association)(Paris-based)_

If your firm is active in any of these organizations, we encourage you to
discuss as soon as possible with your representative within that
organization the need to support the development of a single agreement for
financial products and urge them to express their support to the
associations. If it would be useful to share with them the thoughts in my
memorandum to the board, please feel free to do so. I have attached an
edited version which deletes the last couple of sections on my discussions
with the BMA, the Russo-Carlin group, Ernie Patrikis's letter and possible
approaches for ISDA.

I will try to contact each of you over the course of the next week to get
your feedback. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not
hesitate to email me or call me (212-332-2554)

Bob

 ANSWERS TO INTERROGATORIES


INTERROGATORY NO. 1:

Please describe in detail the factual and legal basis for your contention
that CPSC =01&breached the Assignment Agreement=018 by allegedly =01&failin=
g to
endeavor in good faith to obtain the consent from LCRA.=018

ANSWER:  On July 30, 1999, Calpine entered into an agreement with Enron in
which it agreed to assume Enron=01,s obligation to supply power to the LCRA
under the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement dated August 31, 199=
5
and as it was amended on April 15, 1999.  The July 30, 1999 Assignment
Agreement contains a condition that Calpine will obtain LCRA=01,s written
consent to the assignment and a release of Enron and its affiliates from an=
y
and all obligations and liabilities under the Agreement.  Calpine
specifically agreed to endeavor in good faith to obtain LCRA=01,s consent a=
s
soon as practicable following Enron=01,s execution of the Assignment Agreem=
ent.
Shortly after the execution of the Assignment Agreement, Ed Baughman and
Steve Snow spoke to determine the status of Calpine=01,s efforts to obtain =
LCRA
=01,s consent.  Mr. Baughman followed up with Mr. Snow during the week of
August 16, 1999 to determine the status of Calpine=01,s efforts to obtain L=
CRA=01,
s consent.  It was clear from Mr. Baughman=01,s conversation with Mr. Snow =
that
Calpine was not exercising its best efforts to obtain LCRA=01,s consent.  W=
hen
this became apparent, Mr. Baughman and others at Enron began making
inquiries of LCRA to determine what would be required to obtain LCRA=01,s
consent.  These conversations made it clear that Calpine had not explored
the issue with the LCRA.  Further, Enron representatives were advised by
representatives of the LCRA that Calpine had not furnished any financial
information to the LCRA to make it comfortable with Calpine=01,s assumption=
 of
the delivery obligations.  Such failure by Calpine to use due diligence in
obtaining LCRA=01,s consent combined with its failure to provide the LCRA w=
ith
any financial or credit information demonstrates that Calpine did not
endeavor in good faith to obtain the LCRA=01,s consent.



INTERROGATORY NO. 2:

Please describe in detail the factual and legal basis for your contention
that CPSC failed =01&to exercise  good faith in agreeing to reasonable requ=
ests
relating to the assignment,=018 specifically identifying each and every all=
eged
=01&reasonable request=018, and when, how, by whom, and under what circumst=
ances
the request was made, and CPSC=01,s response to each request.

ANSWER:  Calpine failed to exercise good faith in agreeing to reasonable
requests relating to the assignment by failing to endeavor in good faith to
obtain LCRA=01,s consent to the assignment, failing to provide LCRA with
financial information and failing to provide LCRA with a parent guaranty
guaranteeing Calpine Power Services Corporation=01,s performance of its
assumption of the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement.
Additionally, Calpine failed to agree to reasonable requests when it failed
to provide an indemnification from its parent corporation indemnifying Enro=
n
in the event that Enron paid any money out on its guaranty to the LCRA.  On
or about August 26, 1999, after it became clear that Calpine was not taking
any effort to endeavor in good faith to obtain the LCRA=01,s consent, David
Portz of Enron sent Ron Fischer of Calpine the documents necessary to
provide Calpine=01,s parent guaranty and indemnification of any payment by
Enron under the LCRA agreement.  Calpine refused to execute these documents
or to negotiate in good faith for any necessary modifications thereto.
Additionally, in a telephone conversation between Enron and Calpine
representatives, Calpine conceded that in the past, it had traditionally
provided a parent guaranty.



INTERROGATORY NO. 3:

Please describe in detail any and all damages allegedly suffered by you and
for which you seek redress herein, and describe in detail the method by
which such damages are calculated.

ANSWER:  Enron has not yet calculated the damages it has incurred as a
result of Calpine=01,s breach of its obligations under the Assignment
Agreement.  Enron continues to have an obligation to supply the LCRA with
power and will be required to do so until the contract terminates on
December 31, 2002.  Enron will supplement this interrogatory in accordance
with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.



INTERROGATORY NO. 4:

Do you contend that CPSC was obligated under the July 30, 1999 Letter to
seek and/or secure a guarantee from Calpine Corporation?  If you answer to
either is =01&yes,=018 please describe in detail the legal and factual basi=
s for
each such contention.

ANSWER:  Yes.  Beginning during approximately the summer of 1998, it became
customary in the wholesale power market to provide a parent guarantee when
the power was either being purchased by or sold to a marketing affiliate.
In a telephone conference on the afternoon of August 27, 1999, Calpine
representatives conceded that they generally provided a parent guaranty.
Additionally, the representatives conceded that it did not cost Calpine
Power Services Company any money to provide a parent guaranty.  In the
negotiations between Enron and Calpine prior to the execution of the
Assignment Agreement, it was understood that Calpine would provide a parent
guarantee.  When the transaction changed from the back-to-back transaction
to the assignment, in recognition of the increased risk, Enron increased th=
e
amount that it was willing to pay Calpine to assume its obligations under
the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement to $1.8 million.  In
recognition that parent guarantees are customary in the industry, in
December of 1999, Calpine and Enron exchanged parent guarantees.


INTERROGATORY NO. 5:

Identify each action which you contend is =01&customary and reasonable in t=
he
industry=018 and which you contend CPSC failed to undertake in order to =01=
&obtain
LCRA=01,s consent=018 to the assignment of the Power Agreement.

ANSWER:  Calpine failed to act in a customary and reasonable manner by
failing to act promptly to obtain the LCRA=01,s consent to Calpine=01,s
assignment.  Further, Calpine failed to act in a customary and reasonable
manner in failing to provide LCRA with any financial information concerning
Calpine Power Services Corporation or its parent in order to assure the LCR=
A
of Calpine=01,s financial ability to perform under the Assignment Agreement=
.
Calpine also failed to provide either Enron or LCRA with a parent guarantee
and to provide parent indemnification to Enron for any amounts paid by Enro=
n
to the LCRA as a result of Calpine=01,s failure to perform its obligations
under the Power Purchase and Sale  Agreement.


INTERROGATORY NO. 6:

Identify and describe in detail each and ever action taken by you to
mitigate your alleged damages in this matter.

ANSWER:  On December 8, 1999, Enron gave notice to the LCRA of its
termination of the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement dated Augus=
t
31, 1995, as amended on April 15, 1999 effective December 31, 2002.  On
December 31, 1999, Enron entered into an agreement with Oxy Vinyls, L.P.
wherein Enron Power Marketing, Inc. purchased electrical capacity and energ=
y
from Oxy.  Additionally, Enron has purchased the power necessary to supply
the LCRA at the lowest prices available to it in the market.

John,

We need to make sure we are valuing the spread option using only No. 2 oil in 
Dec, Jan & Feb.  We will almost certainly be curtailed during blow out events 
in the winter and, therefore, it is not appropriate to use nat gas as the 
winter fuel.

Elizabeth and Bill - As you are aware the NSTAR transaction has been split 
into a one year deal with a potential long term (3 year) deal to follow as 
NSTAR felt the structure of the long term deal was complex and would require 
certain regulatory approvals (which had long lead time and were potentially 
difficult to obtain).  The one year deal will not require such approvals and 
will be structured like the current 6-month deal with which NSTAR is 
comfortable.

This structure eliminates certain issues including the physical/financial 
netting issue.  This is because the financial swap and put is eliminated and 
in its place is simply a fixed energy offset amount which reduces the volumes 
Enron is required to deliver.

The short term structure was set up whereby EPMI would be obligated to supply 
each of the NSTAR operating subs (Boston Edison, Cambridge, and Commonwealth) 
under one agreement.  There are embedded cross defaults in the agreement 
(e.g. a ratings drop by any NSTAR sub results in a MAC).  However, the 
agreement also included a provision that each of the NSTAR subs is severally 
but not jointly liable.  Thus, in a NSTAR default termination scenario EPMI 
would likely need to stream volumes and calculate 3 separate termination 
payments and subsequently pursue each sub separately notwithstanding the 
obligation to pay the termination payment is set up as a collective 
obligation of the NSTAR subs.

Unlike the 6-month deal, the attached draft provides that NSTAR is obligated 
to deliver a parent guarantee.  This was resisted by NSTAR on the short term 
deal as each of the NSTAR subs has an above investment grade (I believe A-) 
credit rating.  I will leave it to Bill to determine whether a parent 
guarantee is required or appropriate; however, provision of the guarantee 
would provide somewhat of a fix to the several liability structure.

I have been advised that NSTAR has a board meeting on Monday and would like 
to see the draft tomorrow.  In this regard it would be greatly appreciate if 
you could provide comments on the document by tomorrow morning.

Regards
CJG

Do you suppose that Shari could handle this for John today?  This is the 
first I've seen of the term sheet, and I haven't even taken the time to read 
it, so I'm not even sure exactly what this deal is.  ""Tolling"" means so many 
different things..............  Shari sent this company an EEI Master this 
summer and has been bugging them about it but w/ no response (according to 
the database).  Maybe this would be a good opportunity to advance 
that.........
And I'm still working on the Maine SOS proposal, and VPPSA and the N. 
Carolina project that David Fairley wants comments on yesterday, as well as 
the Reedy Creek stuff that came up as a rush yesterday afternoon (I've left 
you a vmail on that).

Janice

		 Subject: Black Hills Pepperell tolling transaction

Attached is an indicative term sheet I shared with the customer yesterday 
relating to the referenced tolling transaction.  Preliminary feedback from 
the customer has been positive, so I am hopeful that we will come to mutually 
agreeable pricing and terms on this transaction.   I should get some 
additional feedback sometime today. 

I have raised the flag with the customer that we need to put paper and credit 
terms in place, and given their desire to close on this quickly, we will 
likely need to move quickly on this today/tomorrow.   As for cedit, their 
consultant indicated that a corp guarantee from the Black Hill Power Corp 
parent is probably not the customer's preferred approach, but rather credit 
arrangements tagged specifically to the project.  The project is owned by 
Black Hills Energy Capital, which invests in power projects through some sort 
of investment fund.  Their consultant speculated that Enron might have some 
interests in that investment fund relating to some projects out West, but he 
wasn't sure.   In any event, depending on their desire to move forward with 
us, we will need to be ready to talk credit/contract with them on short 
notice.

I'll keep you all updated on any feedback i get from the customer.

Regards
John

Happiness is looking at the new legal org chart (which Jan just now dropped 
on my desk).   I always approach these dry documents as though they were 
trigrams resulting  from throwing the coins and consulting the I-Ching.   At 
the top of the trigram which I find myself listed in I see a single name:  
Elizabeth Sager,  and at the bottom I see the name Genia FitzGerald.  The 
name at the top signifies all is well in the heavens and the name at the 
bottom signifies all is well on earth, and my name between the two means all 
is well beside the flowing river.  A new star has ascended into  the vault of 
the heavens above me and my most beloved of long standing friends from the 
trenches is steadfastly walking beside me below,  and all is very very 
blissful indeed for the itinerant, journeyman energy attorney.

To the Casino I say:   throw anything you've got at me and be damned!

This was sent to me by one of the developers.  I believe it relates to an 
expansion (or new interconnection) of the Caledonia facility.  I don't know 
which lawyer has been working on it, so I'm sending it around to see if 
anyone claims it. Chris thought that someone from Power Trading may have been 
working on it.

As you are aware, some lawyers and legal specialists were recently moved into 
different groups within our department.  Time and expenses should continue to 
be charged through year end to the Cost Centers or WBS Elements which were 
already in place.  This is for budget purposes.

This means timekeepers need to continue to enter time as usual --- for the 
same people and groups you have been entering time for until we can charge 
time and expenses to the new Cost Centers at the beginning of 2001. 

In summary, your Cost Center will not change until January 2001.

I just received the package of master agreements you asked Genia to send me.
Thank you so much.  I have some thoughts about an approach to a simple master
and will look through these documents over the next weeks to see if I think 
the
approach will work.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help you.  I am asking my
secretary to send you a copy of the recent supplement to Documentation for
Derivatives on cross-product risk management that Tony and I just published, 
in
case it is of interest.

Here's the final draft that was sent out today.  Still waiting for credit 
terms to be worked out, as far as I know at the moment.  Thanks very much for 
your help today.  Made me feel better about this going out there for possible 
execution.  And even if this deal doesn't go, we all learned a lot about 
doing unit entitlement purchases -- which will come in handy if the National 
Grid deal goes through.  That RFP response was sent in w/ indicative 
pricing/terms, rather than a binding bid. 
Got your voicemail about JEA.  I brought all that stuff w/ me and planned to 
read it on the plane.  I'm sorry that I misunderstood  -- didn't realize that 
you needed the followup today.    
Regards,
Janice

Effective today, there is a new legal review procedure for physical power 
contracts that are individually negotiated, with a term longer than one 
year.  Please notify me (Janette will maintain a list of contracts, 
counterparties and status) when drafting starts on such power contracts and 
provide me with a draft with sufficient time to make comments prior to 
closing.  My objective is to insure a consistent approach on these power 
contracts.  Thanks for your cooperation in this matter.  Please forward this 
memo on to the lawyers on your team.

John,

We need to make sure we are valuing the spread option using only No. 2 oil in 
Dec, Jan & Feb.  We will almost certainly be curtailed during blow out events 
in the winter and, therefore, it is not appropriate to use nat gas as the 
winter fuel."

HEre's the resume of someone that Lloyd met at a conference this week.  It 
looks like she has a lot of experience -- some of it  power related, and 
might be worth an interview.  Didn't want to send it to Michelle, since I'm

Dear Lloyd---I really enjoyed meeting you yesterday at the Greater Houston
Partnership luncheon and truly appreciate your prompt inquiries on my behalf!
 Attached are a resume, ""highlights sheet"" and summary of recent assignments
which outline my experience as a corporate attorney.  As I had mentioned,
there are two emphases in my generalist career: (1) finance and transactions;
and (2) labor and employment law.  Along the way I have also addressed
anti-trust, corporate secretarial, environmental, some intellectual property
and some real estate matters.  In the marketing/trading arena, you will see
the reference to ISDA's and GISB's plus commodities swap and futures trading
agreements.  I look forward to sitting down with you and/or others in the
Enron organization to detail my background in person.  Please let me know if
there is any problem opening this document.

Again, thank you for ""putting my name in the ring"" .  I hope we can meet
again soon.
                                                        Alice Ginsburgh

Subject: Trading on Inside Information

In a meeting yesterday with some ENA traders, it was argued that in the 
finanical markets people are not allowed to trade in a stock if they have 
material information that would move the market.

In the power business, people that control 15,000 MW are allowed to buy and 
sell financial products with the ""inside"" knowledge that their units may be 
off.  Is this illegal or could we make it illegal?  What are the restrictions 
here?

I guess the issue also involves CFTC regulation, or lack of regulation?  If 
FERC has the field, why don't we continue to push for more market 
transparency?

Jim

Dear Jane,

Further to our discussions on Friday, I attach a copy of the Energy Trading
Paper prepared by our Washington office.

The paper is relevant to what we are focussing on now with EPSA, and 
discusses:
what is happening in the US and English markets, the legal issues in merchant
power sale contracts, the EEI agreement (on which Enron's EPSA is largely 
based,
or was it vice versa), and compliance issues.

A few of points I found particularly interesting:

* The way in which many of the risks are born seems to be reasonably
settled in the US market/EEI form.  The issue is to what extent Japan
will/should follow the same allocation, on which subject the Enron EPSA seems 
to
be setting the pace, at least for the moment.

* We cannot discount the danger that some of the counterparties in Japan
will in fact become insolvent or choose not to perform.  We have attempted to
cover this in EPSA.

* The treatment of force majeure, particularly non-performance by the
back-to-back supplier/customer, will need more attention as specific fact
situations arise.

* The need for a commercial/legal response system to be in place to
immediately address any failures.

I hope you find the paper useful and, as discussed, I rely on you to 
distribute
it to other persons within Enron who are likely to be interested.

Best regards

Paul Davis

Subject: How FERC's proposed order will affect Enron contracts
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-From: Steve C Hall
X-To: Christian Yoder, Elizabeth Sager
X-cc: 
X-bcc: 
X-Folder: \Elizabeth_Sager_Dec2000\Notes Folders\All documents
X-Origin: Sager-E
X-FileName: esager.nsf

As a starting point for briefing Mark, I thought I would open the dialogue by 
listing the proposed remedies and my thoughts on whether each would impact 
Enron's existing contracts.  Keep in mind that FERC's remedies for the 
California market are only proposals that may or may not be adopted.

Below I have listed all of the proposed remedies, with comments next to or 
below each proposed remedy.

1.  Eliminating requirement that the California IOUs buy/sell into the Cal 
PX: The IOUs will no longer be required to sell all generation into and buy 
all of their requirements from the PX.  This will allow the IOUs to act as 
their own scheduling coordinator instead of using the PX as a scheduling 
coordinator.  It is expected that the IOUs will enter into more bilateral 
contracts.

 I can't think of how this would affect contacts, but I would suggest that if 
the IOUs pull out of the PX in a big way, the PX market will be more thinly 
traded/less liquid, leading to more volatile prices at the PX.  

2.  Penalty Charge for Load Deviations Greater Than 5% of Actual Load:  If 
actual load deviates from its schedule by more than 5%, the ISO will impose a 
penalty charge of two times the ISO's real time energy cost for balancing 
energy (twice the inc price).

 We should review our contracts to determine if they allocate this penalty to 
the appropriate party.  

3.  Removal of the Existing ISO and PX Governing Boards:  Probably a good 
idea, but I can't see how this will affect our contracts.

4.  Interconnection Procedures:  FERC has directed the ISO to develop 
standard tariff provisions to facilitate the interconnection of new and 
existing generators seeking to increase the rated capacity of their facility 
in California.

 Will this affect any contracts that the Origination group is working on?  
Because this proposed ISO's new tariff language has yet to be written, I 
would suggest that its effect on contracts at this time is remote.

5.  Long Term Suggestions:  The FERC also made the following suggestions:  
(1) The ISO and the load serving entities in California should develop market 
rules to ensure sufficient supply; (2) consider alternatives to the 
single-price auction; (3) eliminate the balanced schedule requirement by 
intergrating PX and ISO day-ahead demand and supply bids into one venue; (4) 
develop less-intrusive market mitigation remedies, i.e., no price caps; (5) 
redesign the congestion management system; (6) develop demand response 
programs that would allow loads to bid into the market offers to reduce 
demand; and, (6) conform the ISO to the requirements of RTOs under Order 888 
and Order 2000.  

 Since these are suggestions, and may never materialize, I do not think we 
need to modify our contracts at this time in response to these proposed 
changes.

6.  Refunds:  FERC has said that it will not order refunds for unjust and 
unreasonable rates for the period before October 2, 2000.  Going forward, 
FERC may order refunds for unjust and unreasonable rates for the period Oct 
2, 2000 through October 2, 2002.  

 Should we put a provision in our confirms or contracts that would make 
counterparties waive their rights to assert that such prices were unjust and 
unreasonable for that transaction?

7.  Price Caps:  FERC has proposed a $150 'soft' price cap.  The market 
clearing price would be capped at $150, but parties can submit higher bids.  
If a higher bid is submitted, that party would be required to submit 
transaction information to the ISO or PX detailing the generation cost and 
any legitimate opportunity cost.

 I would echo the point below about any reviewing any contracts tied to index 
prices.  
 
 How will we provide the ""incremental generation cost,"" since we are only the 
marketer?  We may have to contractually require parties to provide us the 
information.  This would also raise confidentiality issues.

Joe Hartsoe, Rick Shapiro, or Jim Steffes can fill you in on the details of 
what FERC did today.  One question you need to think about is how their 
decision on price caps affects any contracts which we may have indexed to 
California's spot market.  The way it reports the market clearing price will 
change fundamentally if prices over 150 will be accepted but not used to 
clear the market for all bids.  So, if we are using this as a reference price 
in our contracts it may trigger the need to look for alternatives.

USA: FACTBOX-FERC details changes for Calif power market.

11/01/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
on Wednesday approved several actions to revamp California's power market 
over the next two years. 
Immediate changes include the following:
* Eliminate requirement that three utilities - Pacific Gas & Electric, San 
Diego Power and SoCal Edison - must sell all of their power to and buy all 
their power from the state Power Exchange (PX). 
* Require market participants to schedule 95 percent of their transactions in 
the day-ahead markets to reduce chronic underscheduling of load and 
generation and over-reliance on the ISO's real-time imbalance market to meet 
supply. FERC also proposed a penalty charge for scheduling deviations in 
excess of 5 percent of hourly load requirements. 
* Temporary modification of the single-price auction so bids above $150 MWh 
cannot set the market clearing price paid to all bidders. 
* Establish independent, non-stakeholder governing boards for the California 
Power Exchange (PX) and Independent System Operator (ISO). 
* Create congestion management design proposal. 
* Establish generation inter-connection procedures. 
* Explore alternatives to the single price auction by the ISO and PX. 
* Develop market rules to ensure sufficient supply is available to meet load 
and reserve requirements. 
FERC also approved changes to protect wholesale customers from unreasonable 
rates during the time it will take to adopt longer-term market remedies. The 
following price mitigation measures will remain in effect until Dec. 31, 
2002: 
* Single-price auctions for all sales in the ISO and PX markets at or below 
$150 MWh. The single price would be used for all load which clears below this 
amount in the auction. 
* If an auction does not clear below the $150 MWh level, suppliers who choose 
to bid above $150 would be paid their price bid. In other words, the highest 
bid of the day, if above $150 per MWh, would no longer be the clearing price 
paid by all. 
* Sellers receiving above $150 per MWh would be required to report their bids 
to FERC on a weekly basis and provide certain cost information to the agency. 
* The ISO and PX would be required to report monthly information on such 
bids, allowing FERC to monitor competitive conditions and assure just and 
reasonable rates. Sellers would be subject to potential refund liability but 
no lower than their marginal or opportunity cost if FERC finds 
non-competitive conditions. The potential refund liability would extend the 
full 24 months it would take to implement the market reforms.

Here is a report on current Muni deals in the west.  

1. Grant County PUD:  (Washington)   we have orally agreed (no signed 
confirms) to two identical deals,  each calls for us to deliver power to 
Grant during year one and for Grant to deliver us power and money in year 4 
or 5.  Our effort to get an opinion from them that these deals have been 
properly authorized has foundered badly.  We have the classic situation of a 
PUD whose procedural practice does not fit with the statute.  They are 
irritated to have this pointed out to them and so far, unwilling to go back 
and fix their practices for fear of embarassment before the Board.  
Delicate,  complex, difficult mess.  Pat Boylston of Stoel Rives helping.   

2.  Clatskanie: (Oregon)  We have done a deal ( signed confirms and EEI soon 
to be signed) whereby we deliver Clatskanie power in year 1, for which we 
receive a monthly payment which is roughly akin to a contract price,  and 
they deliver us power in year 5.   We have every expectation of receiving a 
satisfactory legal opinion from them when they return the signed EEI 
agreement.

3. EWEB: (Oregon)   We have done a deal (being documented as a swap by the 
swap group) which I believe is a five year deal.  The deal was originally 
conceived as being a physical transaction.  We  received satisfactory 
documentation about authorization from EWEB for the physical transaction, but 
when it switched over to being a swap at the last minute,  and Sara 
subsequently reviewed the authorization issue,  her conclusion was that we 
were not satisfied with what EWEB had shown us.  I have gotten Pat Boylston  
to get EWEB to promise to give us a Board resolution in a couple of weeks 
addressing the financial risk concern.  

4. Valley Coop. (Nevada)  We have recently done a 4 year vanilla commodity 
sale to Valley and are in the process of checking out their authorization to 
do longer term deals.   We have a services agreement with them whereby we are 
their SC for load balancing purposes involving the California market.  A 
question has arisen as to whether or not certain sales we make to them as 
part of this arrangement  may generate revenue for them in excess of 15%,  if 
so, perhaps putting their tax exempt status as a muni in jeopardy.  It is a 
tax, accounting issue.  Pat Boylston of Stoel Rives is helping us sort it out.

5. LMUD (California)  City of Lassen.  We are trying to do a long term sale 
of power to them.  Attempts to check out authorization have run into a 
complex, California municipality statute and a small town lawyer and we are 
presently stalled out.  Sandy Skaggs of McCutcheon Doyle is helping as best 
he can.  The commercial deal died its first death yesterday but rigor mortis 
is not complete and we may have to revive authorization efforts.

6.  Tracy Ngo has given us a long list of munis, prioritized as to our credit 
exposure to them.  Presumably I am busy checking all of the most serious ones 
out and making sure we have proper authorizations.  In fact, I have done 
nothing with this  because I am busy with other immediate priorities.  

Pat Boylston of Stoel Rives and Sandy Skaggs of McCutcheon Doyle are 
providing very valuable service in this area.  They are both very good at 
dealing with these muni type folks and, with the exception of Grant, (and not 
because of Pat, who has been great)  have gotten fairly good results so 
far.----cgy"

Matt and Patrick:
We're not sure exactly what tax exposures you're concerned about, but I'm 
sending you the attached language, which was approved by Tax Dept. earlier 
this year for use w/ EEI Master Agreements.  We since decided, with Tax Dept. 
approval, to go w/ the shorter standard language in the EEI Master, adding 
this language only to longer term deals (> one year).   Does the attached 
language go far enough to address your concerns with the industrials?  Please 
advise.

Regards,
Janice

ENA East Power will be making an aggressive push to build industrial market 
share in open access states in 2001. Pat Maloy and Matt Gockerman
in Enron's  tax dept. have voiced concern over potential exposure to: 1. 
sales & use tax, 2. gross receipts tax. Two primary questions I have are:

 1. Legal: Can we craft standard language that pushes all tax consequences 
onto the industrial ?
 2. Do we need to alter the deal documentation mechanics (i.e., Enpower) to 
adjust for this issue?

I request that Elizabeth Sager and Kim Theriot advise me on this issue.

Thanks,   Ed

This is our argument now on appeal in Entergy source and sink -- that FERC 
has always deferred to NERC and totally disregarded the NERC letters against 
TVA and MAIN in the Entergy order.  FERC staff's quote should be helpful in 
our brief at the DC Circuit.

Elizabeth,

I understand from speaking with Genia that you have approved a baby shower 
for Leslie to be charged to your Cost Center number.  Leslie has chosen a 
tentative date of December 14th (or possibly the 13th, depending on 
conference room availability).  

Linda and I just finished organizing Stacy's shower at an approximate cost of 
$430 (breakdown as follows:  invitations $40, plates, tablecloths, 
decorations $40, cake $50, lunch from Vespucci's $300).  

Please let me know if this same estimate will be okay for Leslie's shower. 

Thanks!

Sheri"

Attached please find a confirmation which contains the new definition of 
CAISO. Please use this as soon as possible going forward. Also, if 
counterparties want to amend past or outstanding confirmations to include 
this language - that is fine with me.  In addition, we need to be requesting 
that this definition be included in all counterparty confirms for Calif. 
Delivery Points.

I am working with Leslie Hansen to put this as the CAISO definition on EOL 
asap.

Please call me if you have any questions. 

Thanks!

Below please find the new definition of CAISO Energy. Please update all 
Masters under negotiation to include it. (For the avoidance of doubt - we are 
no longer making reference to a Schedule Adjustment). 


""CAISO Energy"" means with respect to a Transaction, a Product under which the 
Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall purchase a quantity of energy equal to 
the hourly quantity without Ancillary Services (as defined in the Tariff) 
that is or will be scheduled as a schedule coordinator to schedule 
coordinator transaction pursuant to the applicable tariff and protocol 
provisions of the California Independent System Operator (""CAISO"") (as 
amended from time to time, the ""Tariff"") for which the only excuse for 
failure to deliver or receive is an ""Uncontrollable Force"" (as defined in the 
Tariff).

Brenda- I will help you insert this in our template EEI Cover Sheet.  

Regarding the Confirm Desk, I have already alerted them use this definition 
from here on and upon request in any outstanding confirms. I am also working 
with Leslie to get it changed on EOL.

Elizabeth, I am responding to your voice mail that today's meeting is 
canceled.  I agree with your suggestion that you, Mark, Jeff, Bill and Shari 
can come to a conclusion and just let us know.

I believe the issues come down to:

1. risk of intentional default by our counterparty

2. risk of unintentional default by us

3. what the market is doing

As agreed at our last call, I reviewed the issues commercially here, and I 
believe the commercial preference is to maintain cherry picking for the 
reasons in 1 above.  Please let Greg and mw know what is decided."

I really don't want to beat this to death, but I'm afraid I don't know how to 
be more precise than this note, sent to you a month ago.  I didn't leave you 
a voicemail about this at the time b/c we were already leaving each other 
lots of voicemails about various deals and I didn't want the details, dates, 
etc. to get lost.  Since 1996 when I came to Enron, I've only stayed with my 
family during the holidays once -- because of year-end deals.  And last 
Thanksgiving, I spent the whole day on the telephone and flew out to 
Singapore the day after Thanksgiving to close the SK Korea deal.  I know what 
4Q is like around here, and I would never have asked except for the 
extraordinary occasion.  I'm sorry, but I just don't think that we're 
connecting and I don't know how to improve the quality of our communications.

Haven't heard about coordinating schedules for the group yet, and I know 
there might be some uncertainty just now b/c of the reorgs, but I'd like to 
know if the following is ok with you.  
Thanksgiving:  I'd like to go to my daughter's baby shower in VA on Sat. 
11/18, take my computer, and then work from VA on Mon, Tue, Wed -- rather 
than flying back here on Monday and flying back there again on Wed.  That's 
assuming there isn't a deal that needs me to go to meetings in Houston (or 
Singapore, for that matter) during that week.  
Christmas:  I'd like to use all remaining vacation days from 2000 after 
Christmas and not return til after mid January or after my grandson is born 
(his due date is 1/3/01), assuming I've used pretty much all vacation for 
2001at that point. 
Travel plans need to be made pretty soon, as you know, so the sooner I get 
your decision the better.  Thanks very much.

I have discussed relocating Shari to Portland with both of you.  Elizabeth 
wanted to make sure that she had hired at least one additional attorney 
before Shari could move to Portland.  When I spoke to Mark earlier this week 
he indicated that January 1st  was a reasonable deadline.  I would like to 
get some closure/finality on this matter -- both from a business perspective 
and to allow Shari to know what the future holds.  Let me know your thoughts."

By the way, I spoke to Chris Foster and Greg Wolfe about the relative merits 
of Steve Hall and Shari Stack.  Their thinking was that Steve is probably a 
better ""deep thinker"" (to use Elizabeth's words) but that he might be bored 
with the routine transaction work that Shari seems to really enjoy.  He also 
doesn't have the ISDA background which would provide tremendous benefit to 
us.  Therefore, I think Shari is a better fit for our current needs.  

Having said that, I am extremely impressed with Steve.  He has a better 
handle on this California work than anyone I've worked with yet.  He seems 
really bright and responsive.  I talked to him last week about working for 
Enron and he seemed interested.  I didn't get into any details about our 
needs, but gauged his general level of interest in the work that he is doing 
for us and his willingness to consider jobs other than his current one.  He 
basically said that he would be happy to hear about opportunities here.  I 
was talking to Richard Sanders yesterday and he also is impressed with Steve 
and said that he had considered trying to hire him.  I don't know if there is 
a position for Steve or not.  I just wanted to give you feedback on my 
discussions with him.  Let me know if you need any help or information from 
me on this matter.

Regards,
Tim"

Subject: Master Agreements - Cherry Picking

Elizabeth, I am responding to your voice mail that today's meeting is 
canceled.  I agree with your suggestion that you, Mark, Jeff, Bill and Shari 
can come to a conclusion and just let us know.

I believe the issues come down to:

1. risk of intentional default by our counterparty

2. risk of unintentional default by us

3. what the market is doing

As agreed at our last call, I reviewed the issues commercially here, and I 
believe the commercial preference is to maintain cherry picking for the 
reasons in 1 above.  Please let Greg and mw know what is decided.

Please find attached clean and blacklined copies of the base contract, cover 
sheet and schedules.  These drafts evidence changes made to the documents 
pursuant to comments from Elizabeth and Chris.  Given the urgency in the 
Alberta market to start putting masters in place, I would propose to 
distribute these versions to our commercial people in Calgary to start 
negotiating with Alberta counterparties for Jan 1.  We can update the form as 
we tweek it over the course of the drafting process in Ontario.  If anyone 
has any concerns with this approach, please let me know ASAP.

Thanks

Greg

		 Subject: EPMI's First Energy filing

I attach a DRAFT of our revised Service Agreement to be submitted to 
FirstEnergy.  I have met with Elizabeth Sager and have tried to address the 
most serious problems in the underlying Tariff.  Note that because these 
changes, even if they are all accepted by FE, are not necessarily controlling 
(because they are in the Service Agmt rather than the Tariff)  but would at 
least give us arguments on our side in case of a dispute.  Ed Sacks, per my 
voicemail, I still need your credit comments please.  Janine and Ed Baughman, 
who would be appropriate to comment on Sec 2.1 re:  Scheduling? 

Because this is not blacklined to show changes, my changes from the original 
Service Agreement that FE published are as follows:

Section 3.1:  The last 2 sentences are copied from the EES Service Agmt
Sec. 3.3-3.10:  This is all new language suggested by EPMI.  (Note that I 
still need to run 3.10 by Elizabeth.)
Section 5.15:  I added a new final sentence.
Section 5.16:  I added this whole thing because the Tariff does not have any 
reps being given by FE (and this language makes the reps reciprocal). I also 
added reps from FE to us re:  its relationship as Agent for the 4 underlying 
utilities, which change  we have found to be critical b/c EPMI is not in 
direct privity of contract with such 4 utilities.)
Sec. 5.17:  This mirrors the change requested by EES.

I will return to the office on Monday.  Please feel free to call me at 57400.
Janet

I have discussed relocating Shari to Portland with both of you.  Elizabeth 
wanted to make sure that she had hired at least one additional attorney 
before Shari could move to Portland.  When I spoke to Mark earlier this week 
he indicated that January 1st  was a reasonable deadline.  I would like to 
get some closure/finality on this matter -- both from a business perspective 
and to allow Shari to know what the future holds.  Let me know your thoughts."

Andy,  As discussed, heer is MSDW's proposal for a draft version of a
Collateral Annex that can be used in connection with the EEI Agreement
(it would be advisable for a clause to be included in the EEI cover
sheet incorporating the collateral annex by reference).  We are offering
this draft as a starting point for the industry's efforts to develop an
EEI Collateral Annex.  Please feel free to distribute it and let Ed or
me know if you would like to have a conference call with others to
determine the next steps in getting feedback.  Bill McCoy

For the purposes of implementing physical power masters with counterparties 
to buy and sell power in Alberta, please find attached the final forms of the 
following documents, which collectively comprise our Canadianized version of 
the EEI master and incorporate comments received from Elizabeth, Peter, Chris 
and Mark Powell:

1.  Cover Sheet (which contains notification information, credit elections 
and our specific amendments to the form of base contract)
2.  Base contract (which constitutes the actual agreement)
3.  Schedules (which describe the Products and set forth the form of 
confirmation letter and the forms of guarantees)

The idea is that there are no changes made to the actual form of the base 
contract.  Instead, any changes to the terms of the base contract are made 
through amendments contained in the cover sheet.  The enclosed form of cover 
sheet contains our preferred amendments and credit elections.

I would ask that Rob Hemstock review the description of the ""Firm (LD)"" 
product.  You will see that I have created a general description of ""Firm 
(LD)"" and then gone on to describe what it means specifically for the Alberta 
market.  Rob, this description is contained in Schedule P of the attached 
""Schedules"" document.  Rob, please let me know if you have any comments on 
the Alberta specific description.

As it is still unclear as to how the documentation will evolve for trading 
physical power in Ontario, please be advised that we are still developing the 
appropriate product descriptions for Ontario, so for the time being we should 
probably not be using this document in Ontario.  If there is a counterparty 
that wishes to use it in Ontario, please contact Chris Gaffney to discuss 
same.

Dianne, the form of confirmation letter included in the ""Schedules"" document 
is the form that we should be setting up in your system.

Bill, the credit provisions contained in these documents are now basically 
identical to those in the EEI form in use by EPMI in the US, so there 
shouldn't be any real issues with the documentation from a credit perspective.

Finally, I wanted to reiterate that the process for putting this physical 
power master in place with counterparties is identical to that undertaken 
with the gas master.  In other words, (i) the commercial person who wants the 
master put in place will contact the credit department and provide them with 
the counterparty details, (ii) the credit department will prepare a credit 
worksheet and send it to the Calgary legal group, (iii) the legal group will 
prepare the master based upon the credit worksheet and forward it to the 
commercial person for review, and (iv) the commercial person will review and 
initial the master and return it to legal who will send it out to the 
counterparty for execution.  Milnthorp will then execute the master once we 
get the executed copy back from the counterparty.

Thanks,
Greg

the By Laws for the formation of the WIO.  It is anticipated that the WIO

amt of material and some of it needs review by legal in my opinion.   Note 
that we voted  ""no"" on the EHV ballot  because it restricts access to

I talked to David Portz about MECS and have passed on the information that he 
gave me to Eileen.  He believes that we should not go back to confirming 
under the 1996 agreement since we have been confirming under the long form 
GTC and they have executed them in the past.  I am faxing an executed confirm 
to Eileen and told her that she could contact David regarding this matter 
since I could not convince her that the long form GTC controls.  We would 
have to get Leslie Reeves approval in order to change the payment terms of 
the long form confirm to 10 days after receipt..

All:
I haven't heard from Woody yet, but I thought I'd chime in to add something 
to John's excellent summary of the Maine SOS potential deal.

Perhaps the biggest legal risk is that Enron would be subjected to Maine 
rules and regulations on SOS, which could be changed at any time.  During 
phone conversations over the last 2 weeks, we explained to Maine PUC staff 
that, in a wholesale contract, we usually do not retain this risk.  We 
explained the clauses in the UI deal (anonymously, of course) that (1) 
prohibit UI from advocating change that would adversely affect us and (2) if 
such change occurs anyway, requires UI to negotiate w/ us to restore the 
original economic bargain.  The staff indicated a willingness to have the PUC 
issue its order awarding the SOS contract also say that the PUC would not 
change the rules for the term of that award.  But we don't know how they 
would do that (we might see a draft early this week), and that still doesn't 
really remove the regulatory change risk  -- only a statute could do that, 
and they don't appear to have much of an appetite for that.  

On the damages issues, the contract w/ the T&D company gives Enron no comfort 
at all.  The T&D company has virtually no liability to Enron, nor does anyone 
else.  However, under SOS Rule 301, if Enron defaults, the Maine PUC will 
order the T&D company how to handle finding replacement service and Enron 
would be exposed to the full replacement costs, in spite of the cap on the 
Enron Corp. guarantee.  Effectively, this means that Enron Corp.'s liability 
is capped, but the Enron entity that provides the SOS can potentially be sued 
by the Maine Attorney General for additional amounts needed to pay for the 
additional costs -- or the PUC can approve a rate increase from customers.  
(Sounds like this would be a political decision, eventually.)  The difference 
between this exposure and how we usually handle this issue is that our 
contract usually sets parameters on calculating replacement costs and 
requires commercially reasonable behavior, standards for which are widely 
accepted and ultimately interpreted by commercial arbitrators in a neutral 
forum.  In the Maine situation, if we want to dispute the amounts claimed, 
we'd have to argue about whether commercially reasonable behavior was even 
required, and we'd be doing that in litigation in a Maine court facing the 
Maine Attorney General.  

Please let me know if you'd like any other info or wish to discuss further. 
Regards,
Janice

Janet:

As promised, here is a brief synopsis of the Maine SOS transaction terms and 
issues.  I am in the office all day and free to discuss if you like.  Woody 
is actually on the way to Houston and is available after about noon central 
time.

Janice Moore (x31794) has worked on the many legal issues and can elaborate 
more fully on the issues there, including the lack of a real contract 
counterparty.  Jim Meyn and Pearce Hammond in structuring can give you more 
details on the load stats, etc in each of the classes for each utility.

I will also forward some old email correspondence I have which discusses the 
various legal issues and bidder qualification requirements, etc.

Please feel free to call to discuss.  (978-449-9936).

Regards,
John

Mike- 

As discussed, attached please find the agreement we currently use to document 
physical power transactions. It is the EEI Master Power Purchase and Sale 
Agreement and is comprised of boiler plate language  (see ""EEI Master (6) 
4-25-00"") and a Cover Sheet where the relevant elections are made (see ""EEI 
Master CS with Prior Transactions""). 

For your purposes, please look at Article 8 in the boilerplate as it sets 
forth the language regarding collateral requirements. I think you will be 
most interested in Articles 8.1(c) and 8.2 (c).  Then, in the Cover Sheet, 
look on p. 2 under Article 8. This is where the relevant threshold numbers, 
etc... are inserted. 

Please call me if you have any questions - I will be happy to help guide you 
through it.   

Kind regards,

As expected, Lil Anne cannot baby sit next Saturday.  She has a Christmas 
party that night.  I left Ted a message that we were both have problems 
getting a baby sitter and suggested that perhaps the 16th would work.

We didn't talk about the Nutcracker, but are you interested in going on the 
same night?  I think Eleanor might sit and behave better if an older, more 
calm friend went also...

Talk to you later.  Sheryl.

           Attorney Work Product/Not Discoverable

Top Legal Risks

1.  Power Forms -  Trading contracts in the power industry are very weak.  
Typical problems include, trading under multiple masters, no liquidated 
damages for non-delivery, no events of default or calculation of termination 
damages, broad performance outs.

2. Agency - Several of our major trading partners operate through an agent 
acting on behalf of several operating companies. This creates uncertainty as 
to which entity is liable for which trades.

3. Municipalities - Difficult authorization issues associated municipalities.

4.Complexity of transactions - Power transactions can be very complex as a 
result, in part, of difficult delivery mechanics and volatile pricing.

5.Timing of transactions - Power transactions typically must be completed on 
a very tight time schedule.

6. Lawyer Training - Difficult, time consuming process to train lawyers on 
how to document transactions involving power.

7.Process for approval of transactions - Uncertain procedures for making sure 
everybody understands risks associated with transactions.

Documentation Projects

1.  EEI - cont'd work to make EEI the trading contract for power/lessen 
reliance on WSPP.

2.  One-off Power Form - creation of contract to be used for individual 
transactions that are not part of a master.

3. Product Definition - cont'd work on creating/building acceptance for power 
product definitions.

4. Platform Trading - Encourage use of EEI as trading platform for all 
e-trading.

5. Single master contract for all physical commodities/financial trading  -  
work with ISDA to develop single contract for physical trading and then roll 
that into single contract for physical and financial trading"

Hey.

Hear that you didn't get to hit with Dan on Monday but instead got a few 
games of doubles under your belt.  How did that go?

I was wondering if you wanted to hit on Thursday either during lunch or after 
work.  I usually have a meeting during lunch on Thursday but heard it might 
be cancelled.  I am going to be up at the Met this evening and will book a 
court if you want to hit during either times.  I will just have to get back 
with you if you want to hit during lunch to let you know if we have our 
meeting or not.

Talk to you soon.

As discussed, attached is the above referenced letter in a clean version and 
in a redlined version showing changes from the version put forward by Lee 
Garner, Wind's outside counsel.  Please review and respond with comments.  I 
will provide each of you a hard copy of Feb. 1998 Enron Corp. corporate 
resolutions passed in connection with a Minnesota project, though it is not 
certain that they are flush with what will be required in this instance.

Mark

As you are aware, I reviewed the proposed Canadian Power Master and have been 
speaking to Greg Johnston about various issues.  The Canadian Master is based 
upon EEI but has been ""retyped"" making changes based upon variations in the 
way US power has evolved from that of the Canadian master gas contract (the 
basis for a number of the differences from EEI) , operational distinctions, 
differences in product and jurisdictional issues.  EEI has called me and 
stated that they want to attend a meeting on November 9th  in Ontario to 
advocate the use of the EEI form in Canada.   Peter Keohane, I know, wants 
the form he and Greg prepared to be the model Canadian form for all the 
reasons he stated in his email to you.  Do you think I should set up a 
meeting with you, Jeff Hodge, Peter K., Greg J. and myself to discuss.  At 
that time, we could also discuss the significant ""policy differences"" to make 
sure that everybody knows what is going on and that there are good reasons 
for the differences.

Thanks
Elizabeth

I appreciate the succinct summary and lead time and we will get our thoughts 
to you on Friday.----cgy


To: Monica Lande/PDX/ECT@ECT, Robert Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Christian 
Yoder/HOU/ECT@ECT
cc: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron 
Subject: Forward Index Position

We potentially have a huge exposure associated with forward index sales in 
California.  If the FERC implements a ""soft cap"" then the index that they 
post will not exceed this ""soft cap"" even if the PX (for PX markets) or the 
ISO (for the ex post market) buys a material quantity of energy above the 
""soft cap"" price.  The FERC is likely to implement either a $100 or $150 
""soft cap.""  Let's say the FERC implements a $100 ""soft cap.""  It is likely 
that there would be 20,000 MW of demand at that price and perhaps 5,000 MW of 
supply (I made these numbers up).  I am not sure how the PX would allocate 
its scarce supply -- a logical way would be pro rata which means that each 
buyer would be awarded 25% of its bid.  So let's say we were short 100 MW of 
index and went to buy it back from the PX each day.  We would have to submit 
bids for 400 MW in hopes of getting 100 MW.  Eventually buyers would bid for 
many multiples of their load, driving demand up while supply remains fixed 
thus lowering the percentage that each buyer receives.  To fix this problem, 
the PX could limit the amount that you could bid for in their market based on 
how much load you serve.  EES might argue that they can bid since it is their 
load.  Long story short -- their are lots of ways for this to explode into a 
big problem for us and only a few ways for things to turn out fine.

Here's what I'd like to do.  First, I would like to get a download of all 
Index Forward deals currently on the books for delivery starting in January 
of 2001.  I want to see all important deal attributes in a spreadsheet.  I 
think that the result of this process will be that we are short up to a 
couple of hundred MW of index power in California over the next two years.  
Bob Badeer will lead that effort.  Then, I need to understand what our legal 
position is with respect to the FERC, ISO, and PX redefining the index.  Do 
our contracts give us an out if the index materially changes in a way so that 
it no longer reflects a competitive market clearing price where supply and 
demand balance?  Christian Yoder should be the point person on that effort.  
Thanks for your help on this matter.  I will be out of the office on 
Wednesday, Thursday, and most of Friday.  I would like some answers to this, 
to the extent that anwers are knowable on the legal side, by Friday.

Molly:

This has been on my calendar for 2;30 for quite a while, but a note sent 
earlier this week (while I was out sick) says it should be 2:00 -- is that 
right?  I'm afraid that I've set up a conference call w/ 4 other people for 
1:30 and it can't be changed at this point.  So I'm probably not going to be 
available at 2:00.  I don't want to appear rude to Alice, so could you let 
her know?  And I have no paperwork on her yet -- should I have a resume or 
something?  And you should also note that my location has changed. I'm now in 
EB3811.  

Thanks for your assistance.

Janice

I have a full set of the briefs filed in the DC Circuit regarding the FERC
notice issue raised by PCA.  I assume Enron's regulatory counsel, LeBoeuf,
Lamb, has provided you with a set. If, however, you'd like me to send a
complete set over, just let me know.  Thanks.

What do you think of Schedule M to the EEI ?
Should we propose that it ---or something like it be considered ?
Since it is part of EEI, I am sure certain people will oppose it but for
the same reason might want a WSPP version.
Thoughts ?

Thanks for everyone's help with the schedules. 

We believe we now have ""execution ready"" schedules.  If you would like to 
review your relevant section once more, please contact Stuart Zisman.  
Otherwise we will assume no request for review is an acknowledgement that the 
schedules are complete and include everything that you feel is relevant.  As 
you all know, we will be making ""reps and warranties"" as to the accuracy of 
the schedules, so it is important for everyone to feel comfortable that the 
schedules are all inclusive and exhaustive.

We will be providing the schedules by midday Friday to all the counterparties 
evaluating Caledonia and Brownsville.

Sorry to belabour this point; however, as you all know, the accuracy of the 
schedules are key in a transaction such as this.

Thanks again for your help and support throughout this process.

Regards,

Don

Great!  The Met has 3 hour free parking - use the ""yellow entrance""  to the 
Allen Center (located on the far side of the parking garage, next to all the 
open air parking lots) and follow the signs for Met parking (off to the 
right).  Met is on the 6th floor.  I can meet anytime around lunch - I'll go 
ahead and get court for 11:30, but if you want to meet later, that would be 
fine - just let me know.  Looking forward to playing."

Pursuant to the various discussions over the past few days, attached please 
find the following documents which have been blacklined to show the 
revisions: 
1. EEI Cover Sheet: 

a. I have made most of the changes suggested in Gayle's fax of 11/29 except 
that the definition of Performance Assurance needs to stay as it is given 
that it does not only mean the Escrowed Funds (for instance, in the event of 
Downgrade Event with respect to Enron Corp., EPMI would have to post 
Performance Assurance). We have also not amended the last line of Section 5.5 
since, among other things, the two amendments taken together would mean that 
in the event of a dispute, the Non-Defaulting Party would be limited to 
receiving only what is in the Escrow Fund. First, that would not work if we 
were the Defaulting Party and secondly, we believe that the Non-Defaulting 
Party should receive an amount equal to the Termination Payment. 

Also, with respect to Section 5.5, Tracy Ngo was willing to extend the 
Defaulting Party's response time from two days to five days, but not all the 
way out to ten days.     

b. Pages 1-2 still need to have information filled in by Black Hills.

2. Confirmation: I have incorporated the modifications John suggested 
regarding Black Hills supplying Energy from an alternative source. I have 
also made a few minor typographical changes. In addition, the Confirmation 
contains revised Escrow language which reflects the recent discussions 
between Richard, Tracy and John. 

I will be happy to incorporate the Escrow language in the La Salle Bank 
Escrow Agreement once someone from Black Hills lets me know that the Escrow 
language is acceptable as written. 

Thank you,

Dear Elizabeth---Just wanted you to know I truly enjoyed meeting you today.
Thank you for taking the time to learn more about my background and to share
your Enron experience with me.  On reflection, I still think Enron is more of
a financial company than a tech company - tech/broadband is just one of
Enron's many facets.  A few years ago I think Enron was having trouble
deciding whether it was an energy company or a financial company - and
settled on the latter to chart its direction.  I think Enron's innovative
processes and approaches to problem solving are what make the prospect of
working with you so exciting.  I am most interested in the available
opportunity and look forward to hearing from you soon,

Alice Ginsburgh"

Dear Bart

As per my VM, attached please find the Escrow Agreement which the Escrow 
Agent, La Salle Bank, would like to use. Could you please review this for us 
and let us know your thoughts?

I am also attaching a description of the Escrow procedures that we have 
tentatively agreed with our counterpart. Those will need to be incorporated 
in the Escrow Agreement. I can do that but I thought you might be interested 
to have the ""full picture"".

Please call me when you get a chance and I can more fully explain our role in 
the escrow ararngement. 

Thank you,

Although it is prepared as a ""one-size-fits-all"" agreement, please feel
free to revise it to fit the purposes of your proposed escrow.  In addition
to being in-house counsel for LaSalle Bank's Corporate Trust Services

Leonardo

I understand and share the desire for a simple website, but have several 
times indicated that these are not GTC terms, but tailored to this product 
offering (and any subsequent capacity products to be offered), and it is 
therefore legal's belief that they should appear within the website itself.  
Please keep me updated as to the progress on the product, as it occurs.  
Thanks.  David

David,

Sorry for not replying to your message before.  All of our resources are 
still focused on the next phase of EnronOnline, thus we have had to delay all 
new products and new  auctions  development. We should be ready to start 
working on your auction in a couple of weeks. 

I agree that we had discussed the ""contract section"" before however, when I 
passed it through David Forster he did not like the format (legal wording). 
The reason for this is that we like to keep a same format an all of 
EnronOnline's offerings. Would it be possible to move this section to the 
GTC? We can always refer the clauses to the contracts. We would like to keep 
the contract section a  easy-to-read as possible.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks again for your help!

David,

Thanks for the text. I reviewed it and think that there is only one major 
issue outstanding:

Additional Contract Terms: The clauses of this section seem to be extracted 
directly from a contract. They look like they are verbatim from a legal 
document. As you all know, the idea of the website text is to inform and 
guide your customers through the whole process. We need to substitute the 
current clauses with easy to read highlights appropriate to the web page. We 
can always refer the clauses to the contracts. We would like to keep this 
section a  easy-to-read as possible. A good example of the ""Contract Section"" 
is the one used for the Emission Auctions.


Please review and let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Thank you very much for your help!

I also think this is a great idea - there would be a tremendous benefit if 
the EEI contract became the standard for on-line trading platforms.  While 
Enron currently uses simplified GTCs for trading online with those 
counterparties with whom we do not have a Master Power Trading Contract (if 
we do that agreement governs power trades), we have talked about and likely 
will eventually make the EEI contract the ""default"" contract if there are no 
other arrangements in place.  I would fully support and provide any 
assistance to pursue this idea with and through EEI.

Andy,

I could provide language by the end of next week, if needed by then.

Separately, I understand that we intend to emphasize marketing efforts
towards all potential EEI users, but utilities in particular due to that
group's lower acceptance rate to date.  Another ""group"" to which I believe
that we should emphasize our marketing efforts includes the online trading
platforms.

Three types of online trading platforms presently exist: (1)proprietary
exchanges (EnronOnline, Dynegydirect); (2) consortium platforms (ICEX); and
(3) independent, third-party platform (Altra) [these platforms are similar
to (2)but differ in that the shareholders/backers have not committed
liquidity].  The volumes traded on these types of electric platforms are
significant and growing.  According to MegawattDaily, Ameren Energy
conducts
about 40% of next-day deals and 30% of forwards on various electronic
platforms.  There are presently close to 25 platforms (of course, with so
many competitors, as usually happens, there will probably be a weeding out
and/or consolidations/mergers...the Jurassic period notwithstanding, as
blame for the mass dinosaur extinction lay with an errant meteor or
possibly
the taking up of cigarette smoking by the majority of the dinosaurs
according to Larsen...all apologies for the joke).

As each platform system has different definitions, products, and contracts,
and as several of the platforms are considering adopting standard
contracts,
I believe an opportunity exists to push the EEI as either the exclusive
standard agreement used for trading on a particular platform or as a
default
agreement for those proprietary and other platforms under which trading
partners lack executed Masters with the counterparty.  In fact, according
to
published sources, Houston Street, RedMeteor, and others have been working
with others for several months on developing industry standards.

Just a thought.

Babak

Some random thoughts:

There was a teleconference today regarding the credit annex.  Bill McCoy
should have draft language by early next week.  This draft only addresses
EEI transactions, but could easily be expanded to transactions under other
master agreements.  I will circulate Bill's draft as soon as I get it.
Randy Baker & Michelle McLendin (Duke), and Lisa Grof & Frank Hilton (AEP)
have volunteered to work on the on the credit annex subcommittee.

According to my notes, assignments for the remaining optional provisions
are
as follows:

1) Incorporating old  trades - Elizabeth
2) One-way transactions - Buddy
3) New products e.g. Western Firm/CAISO - Dede & Elizabeth
4) Regulatory Out - John Crespo & Randy Osteen
5) New taxes - Fritz
6) ADR - Patty
7) Agency relationship - Elizabeth
8) Electronic Exchanges - Babak

Additional provisions
9) Credit Annex - Bill McCoy, et al.
10) incorporating prior trades not under netting, Frank Stllingwerf
11) Broker Confirmations ?
12) Over Deliveries - Phyliss Lemel

What kind of deadline for these assignments is realistic?

Randy Osteen & I plan to meet next w/ week to start planning the workshop
in
Atlanta we plan to hold at the end of January.  If anyone has ideas for the
program please let us know.

I plan to fix up the contract web page next week

Sterling Koch of TransAlta said he would like to set up a presentation
opportunity for an EEI contract representative to talk to the Canadian
standardization group.

Finally, EEI has a block of rooms and meeting space at the Four Seasons in
Newport Bearch, CA for our Legal Committee from April 18-21.  We would like
to shorten our meeting to two days.  Ed has offerred the block of rooms and
meeting space to us for the night of the 20th and the 21st if we want to
put
on a conference or hold a meeting then.  Something to think about.

Elizabeth,
For various reasons, and from time to time,  these new RTO-type things come 
to legal because we presumably have some special ""corporate law"" expertise 
about board compostition and by-laws.  I'm not sure we do, but in any event,  
Steve and I have reviewed this three inch pile of paper and our conclusions 
are set forth below.  If you would like us to do anything further, please let

Subject: Western Connection Interface (WIO)

Christian,

Earlier this week you asked me to review a stack of documents (proposals and 
draft bylaws) relating to the proposed Western Interconnection Organization.  

Conclusion:  Based upon a quick review of the draft proposal, bylaws, and 
other materials, I see no major objections to Enron voting for the formation 
of the WIO.   The reason to vote for this organization would be to facilitate 
the development of uniform reliability standards and efficient electric 
markets in the Western Interconnection.  However, you should carefully 
consider the fact that the board of directors will be weighted towards 
transmission owners (who will have 8 of the 27 votes).  Power marketers, 
generators, and load-serving entities will only have 4 votes.  14 directors 
establish a quorum and the board only requires a majority vote of directors 
present, so it is conceivable that, for example, 15 directors show up, 8 of 
which are transmission owners, and the transmission owners are able to pass 
any resoultion they wish.  Related to this issue is the inability of one 
membership group, such as the power marketer's group, to be able to veto a 
proposal.  It will take three membership classes acting in unison, plus two 
other votes, to defeat a proposed action by the board.  Unfortunately, 
because I am not personally familiar with the internal dynamics of the WSCC 
membership, I am unable to offer any indication of the how much of a risk 
this presents.  

       Background and Overview
In General:  The Western Interconnection Organization (""WIO"") will be formed 
by consolidating the Western Regional Transmission Association, the 
Southwestern Regional Transmission Association, the Northwestern Regional 
Transmission Association, and the Western States Coordinating Council (WRTA, 
SWRTA, NRTA, and WSCC, respectively) into one organization.  The WIO, a 
non-profit corporation, will assume and perform the functions of these 
organizations, and, eventually, those organizations will be disbanded.

The principal responsibilities of the WIO will be as follows:

 *The WIO will be the primary authority for promulgating regional 
reliability, operating, and procedural standards.
 *The WIO will work to resolve conflicting regional reliability standards, 
and work to develop compatible and efficient practices throughout the Western 
Interconnection.
 *The WIO will have no authority over commercial practices (but may work to 
promote compatible, efficient markets).
 *Provide a process for resolving disputes arising out of WIO functions and 
between WIO members.

Membership:

Any entity meeting the criteria for membership in one of the following 
membership classes may be Member of the WIO.  There are five classes of 
membership:  (1) Business entities owning more than 1000 miles of 
transmission lines, (2) Business entities owning less than 1000 miles of 
transmission lines; (3) Business entities that do not own, control, or 
operate transmission or distribution lines, e.g., power marketers, 
load-serving entities, independent power producers; (4) End users of 
electricity; and (5) Representatives of States and Provinces in the Western 
Interconnection.

 *Each class elects four (4) directors.
 *All of the classes select seven (7) non-affiliated directors, for a total 
of twenty-seven (27) directors.
 
Quorum:  A majority of all members, including a majority in at least three 
classes.  In the case of directors, there must be 14 directors.

Board Decisions:  A board decision requires a majority of the directors 
present.

Standing Committees:  There are three standing committees:  the Planning 
Coordination Committee, the Operating Committee, and the Market Interface 
Committee.  

Committee Voting:  For purposes of voting on recommendations to the board, 
committees are divided into three classes:  (1) transmission providers, (2) 
transmission customers, and (3) States and Provincial Members (which is Class 
5). In order to make a recommendation to the board, there must be a simple 
majority of votes from the transmission provider and transmission customer 
classes.

Termination:  The WIO can be terminated upon a vote of the majority of the 
members.

Dear Mike,

As various companies have expressed on several occasions, Enron, Reliant and 
Constellation strongly believe that the WSPP should provide some guidance to 
the membership as to the various issues that are unique but must be addressed 
when dealing with municipalities in the west (such as Public Utility 
Districts, Cities, etc...).  As was evident during the Las Vegas meeting, 
several members do not seem to have any experience in this regard and 
therefore should at the very least be apprised of the issues that might 
confront them when entering into transactions with such entities.

While we agree with you that an amendment might not be the appropriate 
mechanism at this time for addressing this issue, we think that it is 
imperative that the WSPP educate its membership as to the potential pitfalls 
involved.  Therefore, we propose that Wright and Talisman draft a memo that 
describes the authorizations that entities involved in trading other 
commodities commonly request (i.e. statutory authorizations to transact, 
signature authorizations, resolutions setting forth transaction parameters, 
board resolutions, city council approvals, etc.).  We would also request that 
W&T point to some relevant examples over the last few years - specifically, 
City of Springfield, Illinois and Orange County - as well as any other 
guidance that W&T might be able on the topic.  

Therefore, this issue is different than what Morgan Stanley proposed during 
the Las Vegas meeting. 

With regard to bringing up issues which have already been addressed, it is 
our understanding that the WSPP Working Group overwhelmingly voted not to 
incorporate East product definitions into the WSPP.   Therefore, we wonder 
why it appears in the agenda for SFO meeting.


Thank you, 

Shari Stack, Enron 
Randy Osteen, Constellation 
Dede Russo, Reliant

Thanks.  With all the action here in Alberta this week I won't be able to
attend in person again.  Is this board room set up for tele-conferencing?

Yes, the cp is required to post to EPMI a standby, letter of credit in the 
amount of $10,000,000 (ten million USD) in a form acceptable to EPMI no later 
than the end of business day, December 7, 2000.

I believe we had a previous confirm that included an l/c requirement...you 
may want to look at the last long term deal for language to insert into this 
confirm...or discuss the language with EPMI legal.

Thanks,
Tracy

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Folks,

It appears from the comment below that the NYISO does not intend to revise 
October's bill until February 2001.  This is a very signifigant issue for 
Enron.  Recall that the NYISO intentionally billed for October with the 
incorrect prices for the proxy busses even though the prices had been revised 
on the NYISO web site for some time prior to the bill.  The impact of this 
was that the NYISO withheld about $3,000,000.00 from Enron for October.  In 
addition they have not updated the November bill to reflect revised prices 
and the payment date is approaching.  When asked about this last month, the 
NYISO indicated that they knew they were billing incorrectly and would rebill 
later but that, according to the tarriff, market participants must settle 
there bills as posted.  I believe this to be a blatent abuse of the tarriff 
and that the NYISO is intentionally ""leaning"" on market participants for 
credit.  With year end approaching I believe that there is an emphasis on 
maximizing working capital which makes this even more critical (this point is 
highly confidential).

I believe that if they are not going to address this with the November bill 
than we should be taking the most aggressive response.  Should we put this in 
an intervention to the NYSEG filing regarding payments  to the NYISO or 
should we file separately with FERC requesting as a separate issue?  What 
would get the quickest response?  Can and should we consider legal action 
outright?

Howard,  can you approach the NYISO at highest levels ASAP with this issue 
and find out if there is any intention to address this?  So much for there 
efforts to gain credibility in the Marketplace.

Following Howards inquiry, I suggest that we meet by phone to determine our 
course of action.  We have very little time if we have any hope of confincing 
them of revising the bill with the November billing due around the 15th.

On a similar issue, NYISO is asking us to repay $4.6 million in TCC revenues 
from earlier this year.  I believe that they must revise prices in order for 
them to do this and that they are outside the window for revising prices.

Howard, can you arrange for Sara Shackleton and Shari Stack to get the TCC 
rules that were in effect prior to August as well as any rules around price 
revisions.

Thanks,
Tom.

Response:

Rebecca,
Due to a coding error in calculating ancillary reserves for the 25 hour day
(Oct. 29), hour 1 was not charged on the bill and was overwritten by hour 2 
data
and all remaining hours were shifted up one hour. This error is scheduled to 
be
fixed prior to the October rebill (tentatively scheduled for 2/01).

Dave Evanoski
518-356-6031

Question:
The hours in the Transactions LBMP section are not
agreeing with the hours in the Ancillary section.
It looks like SH01 for 126mw is missing from the
Ancillary settlement file for 10/29/00 and all other
hours are shifted up one hour.  I have attached
a file as support.

All:

I just wanted to thank everyone for their great effort on the Pepperell 
deal.  I know it was a bit frustrating at times, but in the end I think we 
will derive a lot of value out of this deal and benefit from the learning 
experience of managing generation in NEPOOL.   Kevin Presto and Dana Davis 
made it clear that this position will be a nice strategic addition to our 
NEPOOL book.

On to the next one!

Elizabeth,

Well, I think I can safely say my biggest accomplishment this year was in my 
personal life however, I guess that will have to be ""graded"" by a higher 
being!!!!

1.  Understanding and implementing the EEI Master Power Purchase and Sale 
Agreement.  Fine tuning where necessary and adjusting per Counterparty.

2.  Supporting a larger staff of attorneys than previously, keeping the paper 
flow moving for all, assisting with special projects as needed and insuring a 
sense of urgency when warranted.

3.  Understanding the different personalities in the Group, acting as liason 
within the Group and promoting a team effort to help the overall success of 
the Power Trading Group.

4.  Performing my duties in a cheerful, helpful manner always remembering to 
be respectful of others and a good listener.

Genia"

Because WIO will be deciding issues involving the primary congested paths in 
the West, I believe the issues to be resolved by WIO may be very important.  
Accordingly, I have argued in-house (to anyone who will listen) that we 
should be arguing that WIO should be independent.  I don't believe that it is 
independent, it's a stakeholder board, like California and the WSCC, both of 
which we have had problems with. 

Historically, a number of people have worked on WIO.  Tom worked on it for a 
while.  Recently, I think Marcie Milner has been monitoring the meetings.  I 
think Steve Walton and DIck Ingersoll may also be following WIO to some 
degree.  Also Jim has suggested to Alan that he might want to be following 
""seams"" issues.  A while ago Marcie asked me to review the governance 
structure.  I told her that I didn't like the lack of independence and 
suggested that we oppose it.  Nonetheless, I believe I was told that we had 
already agreed to it.

Subject: Western Connection Interface (WIO)

Christian,

Earlier this week you asked me to review a stack of documents (proposals and 
draft bylaws) relating to the proposed Western Interconnection Organization.  

Conclusion:  Based upon a quick review of the draft proposal, bylaws, and 
other materials, I see no major objections to Enron voting for the formation 
of the WIO.   The reason to vote for this organization would be to facilitate 
the development of uniform reliability standards and efficient electric 
markets in the Western Interconnection.  However, you should carefully 
consider the fact that the board of directors will be weighted towards 
transmission owners (who will have 8 of the 27 votes).  Power marketers, 
generators, and load-serving entities will only have 4 votes.  14 directors 
establish a quorum and the board only requires a majority vote of directors 
present, so it is conceivable that, for example, 15 directors show up, 8 of 
which are transmission owners, and the transmission owners are able to pass 
any resoultion they wish.  Related to this issue is the inability of one 
membership group, such as the power marketer's group, to be able to veto a 
proposal.  It will take three membership classes acting in unison, plus two 
other votes, to defeat a proposed action by the board.  Unfortunately, 
because I am not personally familiar with the internal dynamics of the WSCC 
membership, I am unable to offer any indication of the how much of a risk 
this presents.  

       Background and Overview
In General:  The Western Interconnection Organization (""WIO"") will be formed 
by consolidating the Western Regional Transmission Association, the 
Southwestern Regional Transmission Association, the Northwestern Regional 
Transmission Association, and the Western States Coordinating Council (WRTA, 
SWRTA, NRTA, and WSCC, respectively) into one organization.  The WIO, a 
non-profit corporation, will assume and perform the functions of these 
organizations, and, eventually, those organizations will be disbanded.

The principal responsibilities of the WIO will be as follows:

 *The WIO will be the primary authority for promulgating regional 
reliability, operating, and procedural standards.
 *The WIO will work to resolve conflicting regional reliability standards, 
and work to develop compatible and efficient practices throughout the Western 
Interconnection.
 *The WIO will have no authority over commercial practices (but may work to 
promote compatible, efficient markets).
 *Provide a process for resolving disputes arising out of WIO functions and 
between WIO members.

Membership:

Any entity meeting the criteria for membership in one of the following 
membership classes may be Member of the WIO.  There are five classes of 
membership:  (1) Business entities owning more than 1000 miles of 
transmission lines, (2) Business entities owning less than 1000 miles of 
transmission lines; (3) Business entities that do not own, control, or 
operate transmission or distribution lines, e.g., power marketers, 
load-serving entities, independent power producers; (4) End users of 
electricity; and (5) Representatives of States and Provinces in the Western 
Interconnection.

 *Each class elects four (4) directors.
 *All of the classes select seven (7) non-affiliated directors, for a total 
of twenty-seven (27) directors.
 
Quorum:  A majority of all members, including a majority in at least three 
classes.  In the case of directors, there must be 14 directors.

Board Decisions:  A board decision requires a majority of the directors 
present.

Standing Committees:  There are three standing committees:  the Planning 
Coordination Committee, the Operating Committee, and the Market Interface 
Committee.  

Committee Voting:  For purposes of voting on recommendations to the board, 
committees are divided into three classes:  (1) transmission providers, (2) 
transmission customers, and (3) States and Provincial Members (which is Class 
5). In order to make a recommendation to the board, there must be a simple 
majority of votes from the transmission provider and transmission customer 
classes.

Termination:  The WIO can be terminated upon a vote of the majority of the 
members.

I wonder if Section 2.7 may need to go into the SD Warren K in some 
fashion...  I will discuss this with you tomorrow.

Here's the draft I was telling you about earlier today.  The CMS is addressed 
in sec. 2.7 I think.  The New Market Products concept was aimed at makeing 
sure that Enron wouldn't have responsibility for any ancillary services 
""invented"" after the deal was signed, unless, of course, we had new 
negotiations w/ new price, etc.

Elizabeth - I just wanted to remind you that I have another Ontario standard 
contract meeting tomorrow.  If you do have a chance to either send me an 
email or give me a call with some more info on why it is a physical market it 
would be greatly appreciated.  Attached is a short slide presentation that 
was made at the last meeting regarding how the market settles.

Thanks
CJG

Attached is a draft of the reply brief.  I will continue to edit and
tighten it up, but I wanted to get it to you in ordre to give you some,
albiet limited, time to review.  We need to have it filed by 5:00pm EST
tomorrow, and need to have it on the fax to Jane Parver by 4:00 pm EST.
Pullman & Comley in Conn. will need some time to convert it to their
system, so if there is any way you could try to get  comments to me by noon
tomorrow, I'd greatly appreciate it.

I think we have a shot and feel much better about our chances than I did
upon initially reviewing the Trustee's brief.  Although well written, the
Trustee truly mischaracterizes a number of cases and loses a lot of
credibility.

Thanks.

Would the drafting commitee and representative credit managers be interested 
in meeting in New York City on December 14 to discuss credit annex draft.  
Bill McCoy is giving a brown bag discussion on trading documentation at a law 
firm in NYC and perhaps we could meet with him afterwards?  Let me know asap 
and I'll ask Marving Goldstein, a partner at the firm, if we can meet after 
the brown bag.  Of course, that depends on Bill's availability too.

Just a suggestion, it may be a better use of everyone's time if the Credit
Managers met to discuss the draft of the Credit Support Annex prepared by
Bill before we get the drafting committee involved.  I don't know about the
other Credit Managers but I am in the process of going through and making
comments to Bill's draft.  I was thinking  we could gain consensus amongst
the Credit Managers and then get the drafting committee involved.  Maybe
even have a conference call or two before we actually meet.  Any thoughts?

I have reviewed the ADR proposal and have the following comments.

This ADR proposal is a double edged sword.  On the one hand - as members of 
WSCC it will help to protect us from antitrust liability.  On the other hand, 
only full members of WSCC are obligated under the ADR provisions (Section 
12.1), so just like the ADR provisions of NRTA/WRTA/SWRTA, entities merely 
have to quit WSCC to get out of the ADR obligation.  This is especially 
problematic with entities that are not FERC jurisdictional.  But, I think, on 
balance, we are probably more concerned about the antitrust protection, given 
that the WSCC usually makes decisions that effect operating systems much more 
than marketers, although this is changing over time.  What do others think?
 I agree with the proposal to have binding arbitration for such controversial 
matters as transmission path ratings.  Section 12.6.2.  The lack of such a 
mechanism has created extended FERC litigation concerning the Alturas line.   
Further, I agree with the grounds for appealing the arbitration decision 
(contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, lack of a fair hearing, or 
serious arbitrator misconduct).  Section 12.9.1.  However, the process for 
requiring FERC filings (under Sections 12.11) seem to undermine the binding 
nature of the arbitration provisions.  To really be binding, it seems like 
once the appeals process has been completed, Section 12.11 should require the 
prevailing and non-prevailing party to file joint filings to carry out the 
binding arbitration decisions.

Whenever or wherever people want to meet is fine with me.  Just remember 
there seemed to be a lot of interest in having a credit annex at the meeting 
on October 13tth.  I think the drafting committee should be responsive to 
that interest and not wait too long to produce a draft for consideration by 
the larger group.  Also, be mindful that for a lot of counterparties, a 
really complex document will be difficult to execute.  It essential to have a 
credit annex ready for the EEI Credit workshop in January or February (date 
is still to be determined).

Just a suggestion, it may be a better use of everyone's time if the Credit
Managers met to discuss the draft of the Credit Support Annex prepared by
Bill before we get the drafting committee involved.  I don't know about the
other Credit Managers but I am in the process of going through and making
comments to Bill's draft.  I was thinking  we could gain consensus amongst
the Credit Managers and then get the drafting committee involved.  Maybe
even have a conference call or two before we actually meet.  Any thoughts?

Subject:  Meeting on December 14


Would the drafting commitee and representative credit managers be
interested in meeting in New York City on December 14 to discuss credit
annex draft.  Bill McCoy is giving a brown bag discussion on trading
documentation at a law firm in NYC and perhaps we could meet with him
afterwards?  Let me know asap and I'll ask Marving Goldstein, a partner at
the firm, if we can meet after the brown bag.  Of course, that depends on
Bill's availability too.

I think Lisa's suggestion is a very positive way to get others involved in
the process as well as working through issues that credit managers may raise
when they read through the proposed credit annex.

Are we still on for lunch Wed.?
(1) The PSEG tolling agreement is super high priority right now, b/c of mkt 
volatility, so I'm marking up the Black Hills deal (lots of it is not 
relevant or helpful b/c there are dispatch blocks in the PSEG deal, which 
need to be addressed somehow) and will speak to you tomorrow, I hope , after 
meeting w/ the commercial guys again.
(2) New deal from Woody -- Wisvest is trying to unload the SOS load they have 
for Connecticut Light & Power -- wholesale contract, about 11% of the CT SOS 
load and Dana is interested in doing this one.  Wisvest wants an MOU by next 
week.  Just got the CA this evening and am working on it so we can get the 
info needed for evaluation.
(3) TEPAC is still pretty hot, b/c TVA's short power, so this would be a good 
time to have a deal w/ them.  I still need to meet w/ everybody and go over 
the remaining risks on that one
(4) Reliant - Dave Fairley wants to do a 50 MW deal w/ them in FL just like 
the one we did w/ Reedy Creek, w/ a few wrinkles I haven't fully learned 
about yet, except that they own 2 units and about 50 MW from another unit; 
he's not sure who the interconnects are with; Reliant has no native load, of 
course, so the FM issues will be different.  Another one that has to close 
very soon b/c the price is only $26.
(5) E Trans is at it again, but all they need at the moment is a couple more 
confidentiality agreements so they can start talking to some new players.  
Apparently, the National Grid is interested in operating an RTO and PJM is 
forming its own jv to provide services to RTOs and they all want us to have 
some kind of role -- getting interesting again.
Will keep you posted.

Janice

No problem Richard. I hope the weather isn't too inclement - we've
only just begun here.....

I'll send along notes when complete. Incidentally, I will also
include minutes from last meeting - regrettably other issues have
kept me form completing them until this evening.

Warmest regards (no pun intended)

Jim - 

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  While I'm still checking,  I am 
not aware that there is a ""formal process"" for being a board member of a 
non-corporate entity like SPP. We would, however,  want to look at the 
equivalent of SPPs Bylaws to make sure that members are not going to be 
liable for actions taken and to see if SPP has something like D&O insurance, 
protecting the members.  We can talk to SPP and see what there is.  Let me 
know if you want us to request/review documents.  Thanks

		 Subject: EPMI on SPP Board

Elizabeth --

Ron McNamara heads up Government Affairs activities for SPP.  He has been 
asked to be a member of the SPP Board.  This would be great for EPMI because 
we would have more ability to influence SPP and its actions regarding opening 
the market.

What form of approval do we need to have internally (if any) before Ron can 
become a SPP Board Member?  Are there any internal restrictions on this type 
of activity? 

Not sure if there are any risks, but I want to make sure that Ron won't be 
harmed by pursuing this opportunity.

Thanks,

Jim

As I mentioned to you Nick Brown has put my name on the ballot to be a member 
of the SPP Board.  The election is at the next meeting (a week from Tuesday).

     Subscribers to TheLaw.net's Custom Web Browser already know that the 
days of submitting solely to the ""Wexis"" duopoly are over.

     Why limit your options to cherry-picking subscription slices from the 
Wexis pay-per-view menu when TheLaw.net offers an all-you-can-eat, unlimited 
access buffet for under $25 a month annualized; a subscription that has as 
its centerpiece unlimited access to the largest searchable database of 
Federal and state appellate case law on the planet next to those provided by 
the big-two compusearchers. Personal Editions are just $295 a year. Annual 
Workgroup Editions are just $995 for the first five users. 
http://www.thelaw.net/subscribe.htm

--MORE THAN JUST CASE LAW
     Wexis, of course, offers us a vast array of high-quality resources, with 
many slick bells and whistles. But for most of us, these resources exist in 
name only and deviating from the plan usually means getting hammered with 
unwieldy transaction charges. In contrast, TheLaw.net puts cases, statutes, 
regulations, rules, forms, news, executive agency databases, legislative 
tracking tools, full-text law journals, a massive reference desk and Federal, 
state and local court resources just a click or two away on your desktop.

     As legal research and reference materials continue to migrate online the 
commercial value of this information bottoms out for the few who have the 
time and talent to find it scattered among the thousands of servers 
controlled by governments, academia and non-profits. For the rest of us, 
there's TheLaw.net

--NO RISK 30 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE
     Your no risk Personal, Convenience or Workgroup Edition includes an 
unconditional 30 day money-back guarantee. Five attorneys in a firm or 
workgroup, for example, get unlimited use for an entire year for just $995; 
individual users for just $295. You'll be up and running in minutes and we 
can deliver your software today!

Here is another Tolling that Stuart did and reviewed when we were thinking of 
taking back a PPA (in this case we were supplying gas and taking electricity, 
so your deal does not have the same perspective) when we sold the plants - 
this deal never happened and was very convoluted because of lease accounting 
issues. Anyway it may be helpful on your toll.

We have started doing transactions with TVA on the desk and we would like to 
increase these transactions going forward.  Could you look at this language 
they sent us regarding opt out clauses and interruption premiums on energy

I must agree with Mary, the governance structure in the WIO is fundimentally 
flawed and only sets up a board that fights to a stalemate end game.  This 
board should had been independent and Marys right.  that's my 2 cents.

Was Ontario Power Generation the Canadian company you mentioned this morning 
that has alot of generation in Ontario and would likely be a major factor in 
determining the contract to be utilized in Canada?  Shari has had numerous

I do not know who has agreed tothe governance.  At meetings I have gone to 
and in inhouse e mails I have opposed the make up of the proposed Board  It 
lacks independence and has two transmission segments.

Because WIO will be deciding issues involving the primary congested paths in 
the West, I believe the issues to be resolved by WIO may be very important.  
Accordingly, I have argued in-house (to anyone who will listen) that we 
should be arguing that WIO should be independent.  I don't believe that it is 
independent, it's a stakeholder board, like California and the WSCC, both of 
which we have had problems with. 

Historically, a number of people have worked on WIO.  Tom worked on it for a 
while.  Recently, I think Marcie Milner has been monitoring the meetings.  I 
think Steve Walton and DIck Ingersoll may also be following WIO to some 
degree.  Also Jim has suggested to Alan that he might want to be following 
""seams"" issues.  A while ago Marcie asked me to review the governance 
structure.  I told her that I didn't like the lack of independence and 
suggested that we oppose it.  Nonetheless, I believe I was told that we had 
already agreed to it.

Subject: Western Connection Interface (WIO)

Christian,

Earlier this week you asked me to review a stack of documents (proposals and 
draft bylaws) relating to the proposed Western Interconnection Organization.  

Conclusion:  Based upon a quick review of the draft proposal, bylaws, and 
other materials, I see no major objections to Enron voting for the formation 
of the WIO.   The reason to vote for this organization would be to facilitate 
the development of uniform reliability standards and efficient electric 
markets in the Western Interconnection.  However, you should carefully 
consider the fact that the board of directors will be weighted towards 
transmission owners (who will have 8 of the 27 votes).  Power marketers, 
generators, and load-serving entities will only have 4 votes.  14 directors 
establish a quorum and the board only requires a majority vote of directors 
present, so it is conceivable that, for example, 15 directors show up, 8 of 
which are transmission owners, and the transmission owners are able to pass 
any resoultion they wish.  Related to this issue is the inability of one 
membership group, such as the power marketer's group, to be able to veto a 
proposal.  It will take three membership classes acting in unison, plus two 
other votes, to defeat a proposed action by the board.  Unfortunately, 
because I am not personally familiar with the internal dynamics of the WSCC 
membership, I am unable to offer any indication of the how much of a risk 
this presents.  

       Background and Overview
In General:  The Western Interconnection Organization (""WIO"") will be formed 
by consolidating the Western Regional Transmission Association, the 
Southwestern Regional Transmission Association, the Northwestern Regional 
Transmission Association, and the Western States Coordinating Council (WRTA, 
SWRTA, NRTA, and WSCC, respectively) into one organization.  The WIO, a 
non-profit corporation, will assume and perform the functions of these 
organizations, and, eventually, those organizations will be disbanded.

The principal responsibilities of the WIO will be as follows:

 *The WIO will be the primary authority for promulgating regional 
reliability, operating, and procedural standards.
 *The WIO will work to resolve conflicting regional reliability standards, 
and work to develop compatible and efficient practices throughout the Western 
Interconnection.
 *The WIO will have no authority over commercial practices (but may work to 
promote compatible, efficient markets).
 *Provide a process for resolving disputes arising out of WIO functions and 
between WIO members.

Membership:

Any entity meeting the criteria for membership in one of the following 
membership classes may be Member of the WIO.  There are five classes of 
membership:  (1) Business entities owning more than 1000 miles of 
transmission lines, (2) Business entities owning less than 1000 miles of 
transmission lines; (3) Business entities that do not own, control, or 
operate transmission or distribution lines, e.g., power marketers, 
load-serving entities, independent power producers; (4) End users of 
electricity; and (5) Representatives of States and Provinces in the Western 
Interconnection.

 *Each class elects four (4) directors.
 *All of the classes select seven (7) non-affiliated directors, for a total 
of twenty-seven (27) directors.
 
Quorum:  A majority of all members, including a majority in at least three 
classes.  In the case of directors, there must be 14 directors.

Board Decisions:  A board decision requires a majority of the directors 
present.

Standing Committees:  There are three standing committees:  the Planning 
Coordination Committee, the Operating Committee, and the Market Interface 
Committee.  

Committee Voting:  For purposes of voting on recommendations to the board, 
committees are divided into three classes:  (1) transmission providers, (2) 
transmission customers, and (3) States and Provincial Members (which is Class 
5). In order to make a recommendation to the board, there must be a simple 
majority of votes from the transmission provider and transmission customer 
classes.

Termination:  The WIO can be terminated upon a vote of the majority of the 
members.

Thanks for your replies. One area that has concerned me is the possibility of 
a claim by our CA counterparty that we developed an idea using in part their 
information, when in fact we independently developed the concept.  have seen 
some CA's that expressly address this as an exception to the definition of 
Confidential Information. Also, how should we address the point Mark raised 
about the development of ideas jointly while in discussions with the 
counterparty. I
Let's get together to talk further about this next week when Mark G. gets

		 Subject: Re: Intellectual Property Rights Protection in Confidentiality 
Agreements

Not quite sure what you mean by ""information developed"" from a value or 
exploitation perspective, or understand the exposure you believe we have 
under our existing, well drafted confidentiality agreements, to which I take 
no credit whatsoever, unfortunately. 

We should not be using the information disclosed by a counterparty for any  
purpose other than to evaluate and negotiate any possible transaction with 
that counterparty. To use it for any other purpose would be in breach of the 
confidentiality agreement. Since we are discussing the information and 
disclosing it to each other it is caught by the confidentiality undertakings. 
 
If we develop any  information independently without the benefit of any 
confidential information received from the disclosing counterparty, then of 
course we can claim it as ours, before expiry of the term of the 
confidentiality agreement, and protect it accordingly and the counterparty 
would have to establish that we did not develop it independently without the 
benefit of their confidential information.
 
During the period of the confidentiality agreement, ownership of information 
that we developed using a counterparty's confidential information is not an 
issue, since we can only use it for the purposes set out in the relevant 
confidentiality agreement. If we want to use it for any other purpose, during 
the term of the confidentiality agreement, we will need to reach agreement 
with the counterparty as to any rights for exploitation in a substantive 
agreement, recognising that we may will be mixing intellectual property 
rights. 
 

Regards
 
Marcus

Subject: Re: Intellectual Property Rights Protection in Confidentiality 
Agreements  

Alan -

I agree that we need to make some revisions and, having read Marcus' 
comments, I agree also that broad language covers the general concepts.  I 
believe ownership of information developed during discussions will be the hot 
area, especially where we are discussing projects with companies while we 
developed parallel projects.  These situations make Enron an easy target.  

Though the general language of the agreement covers this generally, enhanced 
language should be considered.

Please let me know if you want to pursue this further.

I have been thinking that we should enhance our Confidentiality Agreement 
forms to address IP issues to protect Enron's interests. Do you concur that 
we should do something? If so what modifications should be made? Peter Mims, 
the VE lawyer at the offsite last Octobe, might be a good person to work with 
on this project.

Advise me of your thoughts.

Alan

I've attempted to draft language for the ""CAISO Schedule Adjustment""
definition, as we discussed yesterday.  We can discuss this proposed
language in our call tomorrow:

""CAISO Schedule Adjustment"" means a schedule change implemented by the CAISO
on a schedule coordinator-schedule coordinator transaction after the CAISO's
final hourly scheduling deadline for the transaction, and on which
transaction the CAISO imposes Inc and Dec Prices.  Such schedule change
shall neither be caused by, nor within the control of, either Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a CAISO Schedule Adjustment shall not be
deemed to occur if the schedule change is due to (i) the curtailment of
imports into, or exports from, California; (ii) load deviations; (iii) the
failure of a Party to accurately submit or balance its schedule with the
CAISO.

Dear Mark and Liz::

I'm going to be in NYC for a mid-day meeting on 12/14  and was hoping to meet 
later with someone at ISDA to discuss how they operate.  I know you are both 
active in ISDA and was hoping you could help me set up a meeting with the 
right person(s).  Please let me know if you can help.

The reason for the request is that  I am in the information gathering stage 
of developing a business plan to establish a membership organization to 
manage the EEI contract  process.  Once my plan is fleshed out, I would like 
to come down to Houston and make a presentation to the participating members 
of the EEI-NEM contract group to get their reaction.

This is a proposed margin agreement from Pacificorp.  We are out of the money 
over $250mm and they are getting nervous.  Tracy and I are trying to get them 
to sign an EEI but they are dragging their feet.  Let's discuss a strategy 
for moving forward.   

If this agreement is not bad from a legal perspective than I am okay with 
moving forward with some changes to the credit levels.  However, if it is not 
acceptable we should put pressure on them to sign an EEI.

Let's discuss.
Bill

Bill:  As a follow-up to our discussions last night we are sending a draft

unfortunately until I get some direction from our contract people this is
the agreement we would like to go with.

Elizabeth -- Three comments to consider:

In the first change, I think that I understand your change, but my impression 
was that ""provided for in this Confirmation"" was referring or tieing 
specifically to the ""deal"" defined in the Confirmation, therefore the change 
to say ""may be agreed to"" seems to weaken that reference.

On the 10th line, does adding the word ""firm"" in front of energy potentially 
conflict with the specific transaction if it is something more or something 
different than a simple firm deal.  Shouldn't the level of firmness be fully 
defined elsewhere in the confirm.

In (b), suggest adding some reference to quantity after your reference to 
timing along these lines:  "" (b)  the starting and ending time and date, and 
the quantity of the release or interruption;""     Since partial quantity 
releases are possible/likely, probably even successive releases (due to 
gradual weather changes)  it would be equally as important to identify 
quantity and timing.  Example:  start with 200 MW for the month, release 50 
MW starting day 10 for balance of month, then another 50 MW over a weekend.

As always, thanks for your assistance. -- David

Attached is TVA language, to which I made a few changes.  Concept is fine, 
but before we start using and drop in confirm I will need to see the rest of 
a draft confirm that we use with TVA.

Unfortunately I came down the flu yesterday and wasn't able to attend the 
meeting.  Please send me the minutes too.

I don't know how far things got yesterday, but I was going to volunteer to be 
on the smaller drafting committee that was talked about at the previous 
meeting.  If they are still looking for volunteers, I would be happy to 
volunteer.

No problem Richard. I hope the weather isn't too inclement - we've
only just begun here.....

I'll send along notes when complete. Incidentally, I will also
include minutes from last meeting - regrettably other issues have
kept me form completing them until this evening.

Warmest regards (no pun intended)

Dave

Just making sure that you all were still planning on coming by and walking 
around Lights in the Heights with us on Saturday.  We'll have some snacks and 
toddies (sp? and I'm not looking it up) ready around 5:30ish.  I have invited 
Gail to come also, maybe she can fit it her busy social schedule.

Word around here spread like wildfire about my leaving.  I told 3 partners 
before I left to go out of town last week and by the time I got back, even my 
secretary knew.  It was a bit awkward.  I wanted to personally tell her.  Oh 
well.

See you guys Saturday.

Dear Elizabeth:

Thank you for accepting our invitation to speak at the Energy and Developing
Porducts conference in Houston on March 6th, 2001 at The Four Seasons Hotel.


I will need to finalize the agenda by next week in order to begin promoting
the conference.  For marketing purposes, all I need at this stage is a
heading for your section followed by a few bullet points to describe the
contents of the discussion.

Also, we would welcome any suggestions you may have on inviting speakers to
help you discuss topic.

I will be in the office all week and can be reached at 212-332-2559 or let
me know any suggestions you may have via email.

Again thanks and regards,
Liz

This is a proposed margin agreement from Pacificorp.  We are out of the money 
over $250mm and they are getting nervous.  Tracy and I are trying to get them 
to sign an EEI but they are dragging their feet.  Let's discuss a strategy 
for moving forward.   

If this agreement is not bad from a legal perspective than I am okay with 
moving forward with some changes to the credit levels.  However, if it is not 
acceptable we should put pressure on them to sign an EEI.

Let's discuss.

Mike,

     I noticed that there is not an indemnity provision in the WSPP
Agreement and that the Limitation of Damages section (Section 21 entitled
""Liability and Damages""), excludes ""direct"" damages.  I was wondering if
there was ever a discussion/vote on these issues.

		 Subject: MPLP Capacity Charges

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION HAS BEEN PREPARED AT THE REQUEST OF COUNSEL:

Per the voicemail I left you yesterday concerning the billing of capacity 
charges by Consumers for electric service provided by MPLP:

Background

MPLP went into service on October 1, 1995 and provides service under a PPA 
for a term that ends September 30, 2030.  Capacity charges are billed under 
Section 10(a) of the PPA, which references a schedule of capacity rates 
provided as Exhibit D.  Exhibit D:  (1) shows Consumers' avoided cost rates 
for 35 years and (2) converts these rates into the specific rates applied 
under Section 10(a).  Presumably, any QF that signed a contract with 
Consumers for a facility due to go on line in 1995 would be subject to 
payment under the same avoided cost rate schedule, although the way these 
rates were manipulated to achieve any particular agreement might vary from 
project to project (i.e., in the case of MPLP, the rates are ""backloaded"" 
over ten years before levelizing for the remaining term of the PPA).

Consumers', which ""self-bills"" under the PPA, began applying ""Year 2"" 
capacity rates under Exhibit D on January 1, 1996 and implemented subsequent 
increases on January 1 of 1997, 1998 and 1999.  January 1 rate increases were 
not anticipated by the partnership.  However, there is no definition for 
""contract year"" under the PPA and Exhibit D shows rates by ""Year"" without 
specific reference to what constitutes a ""Year"" (i.e., ""contract year"" vs. 
""calendar year"").  Based on Consumers' past actions, it would appear that 
their interpretation of the PPA has been that Schedule D sets rates that are 
effective in a particular calendar year.  (NOTE FROM A RATE GEEK:  This would 
generally jive with the manner in which the avoided cost rates are determined 
and scheduled.  That is, it's unlikely that Consumers ran a new avoided cost 
study each time it entered into a contract with a QF.  Rather, one could 
interpret Column (b) of Exhibit D to lay out the avoided cost rates in effect 
in calendar year 1995, 1996, etc.)  Further to this interpretation, Section 
10(a) also lays out the manner in which total capacity charges are adjusted 
""if for any calendar year, beginning with the second calendar year after the 
calendar year during which the Commercial Operation Date occurs..."" the 
project fails to achieve a 60% ""Contract Capacity Factor"" (which is 
determined based on results for any calendar year).  Based on Consumers' 
action and this language, the partnership remained silent on the 
interpretation leading to the rate increase.

As a result of restructuring legislation passed in June 2000, Consumers now 
operates under a ""fuel cap""; that is, its Power Service Cost Recovery (PSCR) 
rate is frozen.  Accordingly, whereas costs incurred under the PPA were 
previously a pass-through (i.e., via Consumers' PSCR and/or base rates), 
Consumers now has a strong incentive to minimize purchased power costs as any 
savings will, in theory, flow directly to shareholders.  

Issue

It should come as no surprise that Consumers' recently concluded that it has 
implemented capacity rate increases erroneously.  While no action has been 
taken to date, Consumers has indicated in the course of discussing the 
reverse tolling transaction for MPLP that it does not intend to implement a 
rate increase on January 1, 2001 but will defer the increase until October 1, 
2001.  There was no suggestion that Consumers would attempt to reconcile past 
capacity rate billing differences (i.e., ""backbilling""), but we need to 
assume that they will go after this value as well.  

Three side notes on this issue:

To the extent rates were erroneously applied in the past, it would appear 
that these costs to Consumers would have been recovered from ratepayers; Mike 
Mazowita has indicated that he's seen regulatory filings that would support 
this point.  Accordingly, it would appear that Consumers would face some 
regulatory issues to the extent it considered ""backbilling""; it's not clear 
yet how these would play out in light of the currently effective fuel cap.

We identified this issue during due diligence on MPLP and modeled capacity 
charges on a going forward basis in a manner that reflects a contract year 
interpretation that has capacity rates running from October 1 to September 
30.  Accordingly, we have minimal exposure on value but for the issue of 
backbilling, however...

We need to know what rates should be in effect January 1, 2001 in order to 
structure a reverse tolling transaction.  It goes without saying, but this is 
an untimely issue in the context of reverse tolling discussions with 
Consumers. 

Legal Questions

Do we have a valid claim that Consumers is required to implement a capacity 
rate increase on January 1, 2001?

Does Consumers have a claim to value lost (i.e., backbilling) as a result of 
the manner in which rate increases have been previously applied?

To the extent that Consumers does have a claim on backbilling, do we have a 
right to recovery from MCN as we were not the owner of the facility during 
most of the period of time during which rates may have been applied 
erroneously?

Do we have any claims against Dynegy as the MGP of the asset?  That is, did 
they have a fiduciary responsibility to (1) pursue/resolve the issue when it 
first came up or (2) reserve for future claims by Consumers based on a 
different (an potentially correct) interpretation of the contract?

Let me know when you'll be prepared to discuss this and I'll pull together

Mike,

     I noticed that there is not an indemnity provision in the WSPP
Agreement and that the Limitation of Damages section (Section 21 entitled
""Liability and Damages""), excludes ""direct"" damages.  I was wondering if
there was ever a discussion/vote on these issues.

I do not remember any discussions on indemnification.  As to the exclusion
of direct damages, we did discuss that concept.  The intent was that the
21.3 damage calculation would recoup the direct damages (though it doesn't
fully do so as it does not recoup additional adminstrative or legal costs),
It was decided not to add such additional costs to the 21.3 calculation.
If you want to add any of these items to the agenda, please let me know.
If you do so, please send me sample language.
If we could find a fourth we could play doubles assuming that Elizabeth is
coming to the meeting and assuming that there are courts nearby.

I have been out of the loop on WIO for sometime, so I am not well informed on 
the governance.  When last I dealt with WIO, it was to be a standards 
organization with no operational authority.  I don't think there is a problem 
with a stakeholder board in that case.  If however, the board has operation 
authority, not just standards and review of compliance, than perhaps an 
indepent board is required.

Because WIO will be deciding issues involving the primary congested paths in 
the West, I believe the issues to be resolved by WIO may be very important.  
Accordingly, I have argued in-house (to anyone who will listen) that we 
should be arguing that WIO should be independent.  I don't believe that it is 
independent, it's a stakeholder board, like California and the WSCC, both of 
which we have had problems with. 

Historically, a number of people have worked on WIO.  Tom worked on it for a 
while.  Recently, I think Marcie Milner has been monitoring the meetings.  I 
think Steve Walton and DIck Ingersoll may also be following WIO to some 
degree.  Also Jim has suggested to Alan that he might want to be following 
""seams"" issues.  A while ago Marcie asked me to review the governance 
structure.  I told her that I didn't like the lack of independence and 
suggested that we oppose it.  Nonetheless, I believe I was told that we had 
already agreed to it.

Subject: Western Connection Interface (WIO)

Christian,

Earlier this week you asked me to review a stack of documents (proposals and 
draft bylaws) relating to the proposed Western Interconnection Organization.  

Conclusion:  Based upon a quick review of the draft proposal, bylaws, and 
other materials, I see no major objections to Enron voting for the formation 
of the WIO.   The reason to vote for this organization would be to facilitate 
the development of uniform reliability standards and efficient electric 
markets in the Western Interconnection.  However, you should carefully 
consider the fact that the board of directors will be weighted towards 
transmission owners (who will have 8 of the 27 votes).  Power marketers, 
generators, and load-serving entities will only have 4 votes.  14 directors 
establish a quorum and the board only requires a majority vote of directors 
present, so it is conceivable that, for example, 15 directors show up, 8 of 
which are transmission owners, and the transmission owners are able to pass 
any resoultion they wish.  Related to this issue is the inability of one 
membership group, such as the power marketer's group, to be able to veto a 
proposal.  It will take three membership classes acting in unison, plus two 
other votes, to defeat a proposed action by the board.  Unfortunately, 
because I am not personally familiar with the internal dynamics of the WSCC 
membership, I am unable to offer any indication of the how much of a risk 
this presents.  

       Background and Overview
In General:  The Western Interconnection Organization (""WIO"") will be formed 
by consolidating the Western Regional Transmission Association, the 
Southwestern Regional Transmission Association, the Northwestern Regional 
Transmission Association, and the Western States Coordinating Council (WRTA, 
SWRTA, NRTA, and WSCC, respectively) into one organization.  The WIO, a 
non-profit corporation, will assume and perform the functions of these 
organizations, and, eventually, those organizations will be disbanded.

The principal responsibilities of the WIO will be as follows:

 *The WIO will be the primary authority for promulgating regional 
reliability, operating, and procedural standards.
 *The WIO will work to resolve conflicting regional reliability standards, 
and work to develop compatible and efficient practices throughout the Western 
Interconnection.
 *The WIO will have no authority over commercial practices (but may work to 
promote compatible, efficient markets).
 *Provide a process for resolving disputes arising out of WIO functions and 
between WIO members.

Membership:

Any entity meeting the criteria for membership in one of the following 
membership classes may be Member of the WIO.  There are five classes of 
membership:  (1) Business entities owning more than 1000 miles of 
transmission lines, (2) Business entities owning less than 1000 miles of 
transmission lines; (3) Business entities that do not own, control, or 
operate transmission or distribution lines, e.g., power marketers, 
load-serving entities, independent power producers; (4) End users of 
electricity; and (5) Representatives of States and Provinces in the Western 
Interconnection.

 *Each class elects four (4) directors.
 *All of the classes select seven (7) non-affiliated directors, for a total 
of twenty-seven (27) directors.
 
Quorum:  A majority of all members, including a majority in at least three 
classes.  In the case of directors, there must be 14 directors.

Board Decisions:  A board decision requires a majority of the directors 
present.

Standing Committees:  There are three standing committees:  the Planning 
Coordination Committee, the Operating Committee, and the Market Interface 
Committee.  

Committee Voting:  For purposes of voting on recommendations to the board, 
committees are divided into three classes:  (1) transmission providers, (2) 
transmission customers, and (3) States and Provincial Members (which is Class 
5). In order to make a recommendation to the board, there must be a simple 
majority of votes from the transmission provider and transmission customer 
classes.

Termination:  The WIO can be terminated upon a vote of the majority of the 
members.

We are contemplating taking a performance bond as collateral to secure our 
position with Duke.   I would like you to review the language of the 
performance bond from a legal perspective upon receipt.  My concerns are the 
claim process will be slow and will be subject to legal interpretation.  I 
would like to discuss with you the risks associated with this type of 
security.

Thanks,
Bill

Bill,
My corporate insurance people are working diligently on a form of
performance bond that will be acceptable to the insurance companies.
The insurance companies involved, so far, are Fireman's Fund and Traveler's
(both rated S&P: ""AAA"" and AM Best: ""A++"").  I say ""so far"" because we
contemplate needing to have those two insurance companies ""agent"" a deal
that will involve more names.  As soon as I have those names, I will let
you know.

This matter is top priority in Charlotte.

Thanks,
Randy

Andy, can you facilitate setting up a conference call with Bill McCoy and
the respective credit managers of the drafting committee for December 14th

I think Lisa's suggestion is a very positive way to get others involved in
the process as well as working through issues that credit managers may
raise
when they read through the proposed credit annex.

***DESTINATION GUIDES***

Vail
Vail has been synonymous with skiing since the 1960s, and is still=20
rated the best ski area in the United States by many polls year after=20
year. With 4,000 acres of skiable (and boardable) terrain, 25 chair=20
lifts, and a wide range of terrain, it's no wonder this huge mountain
remains popular. And unlike some ski areas, the town of Vail is a=20
destination unto itself, with sophisticated shopping, dining, and=20
entertainment options to keep even complete non-skiers happy.=20

Sydney

Northern Hemisphere. Sydney's an exciting place to visit any time.=20
And with Olympic tourists long gone, and the weather getting=20
beautiful, now's a great time to discover the opera house,=20
picturesque harbor, world-famous Bondi Beach, and more.=20

Taos
Located in the beautiful Sangre de Cristo Mountains, Taos is=20
different from many ski towns you may have visited. Many have the=20
dining and entertainment options that Taos (population: 5,000) has,=20
but few can boast of having a cultural scene quite like Taos. For=20
over 100 years, the town has attracted a growing number of artists,=20
drawn by the distinctive light, desert beauty, and supportive=20
community. Today, about 15 percent of the town's permanent residents=20
are artists. In addition, the rich cultural traditions of the area's=20
Mexican and Native American populations would make this a fascinating=20
vacation spot even if it weren't for the nearby Taos ski area--one of=20
the best in the Rockies.=20

Switzerland
For a winter getaway with a European flavor, Switzerland is the place=20
to be. The Swiss Alps are home to many ski/snowboarding areas, and a=20
wide range of resorts--you're never too far from the mountains in=20
tiny Switzerland. Towns such as Zermatt and St. Moritz are where=20
you'll find the classic upscale European ski-resort experience. Not=20
to worry; you'll also find more modest areas sprinkled among the=20
hyper-glamorous ones. The country's famous cuisine, shopping, orderly=20
cities, and picturesque mountain scenery are year-round treats, and=20
enough to keep anyone busy all vacation long.=20

Florida

year-round--and surprisingly affordable, too. From the trendy good=20

David,

The Supplementary Agreement looks fine.  There needs to be a few changes made 
to the cover sheet with respect to the MAC provision (debt rating) and the 
financial reporting for Party B (AEPSC).  AEPSC does not provide its own 
financials and is not rated.  So, the MAC and financial reporting 
requirements are only required for the 9 utilities.

AEPSC is only on the hook for third-party cross-default along with the 9 
utilities.

I'm sorry that I missed you today...got bogged down with other emergencies.  
But we can always wait for the cp's response and amend the above, unless you 
want to send another version.

Regards,
Tracy

Elizabeth - Good news, bad news.   

I have been confirmed as the co-chair of the committee,  I have been 
confirmed as the co-chair of the committee.
They have agreed to use the Enron Canadian EEI as the starting point, they 
want me to put together a memo describing/explaining the key provisions.
They think a physical or hybrid (whatever that is) is the way to go, most 
still do not agree it is a physical market.
It is a beautiful day with white fluffy snow falling, it is probably around 
-10 celcius.


With respect to bullet number 2 above, do you have anything to give me so I 
don't have to do the work?  Didn't you and Mark prepare something?  Is Andy's 
paper a better starting place?

Doug -- As discussed, attached is a redlined copy and an execution copy of 
the off peak 2002-2004 confirmation letter reflecting the changes taking into 
account that modifications to product definitions are more likely to arise 
from  the efforts of industry participants than via ERCOT action as to the 
protocols or otherwise. The definition of UB itself makes clear this product 
is firm, and the term ""Undelivered"" currently carries the meaning that  Buyer 
must be capable of moving the firm energy from the Delivery Point to more 
than one potential destination.  Please contact me with any questions. --David

Let me try and clear this up.  Based on the email thread, a conference call 
on the 14th is favored.  Since Bill McCoy is speaking at the NYC brown bag, 
my suggestion is to set up the conference call with the parties you 
identified for after the brown bag, which would be sometime after 2pm NY 
time.  I have a call in to Michael Shenberg at Strook, Strook & Lavan to see 
if it would be ok for Bill Fritz, (he's going to lunch) and I to stay at 
their offices for the call.  Otherwise we'd go somewhere else.  I would set 
up the call through our service.  ok?

On another note.  We will find out on the 11th what Southern wants to do for 
the credit workshop in February (January is too early).  Because of turmoil 
in the markets out west, Randy has now asked me to draft a program.  Any 
suggestions would be greatly appreciated.   Also, I am now going ahead and 
planning to do a California workshop for April 20th that would precede the 
EEI Legal Committee conference.

Dear Mark and Elizabeth:

We wanted to send you both a quick note highlighting the tremendous efforts 
that Janice Moore has contributed to two recent opportunities, namely the 
RFPs for Maine and Western Mass Electric standard offer service.   Both of 
these opportunities involved significant legal and commercial landmines that 
Janice was a key contributor in identifying and mitigating.   Unfortunately, 
due to legal/commercial risks and other factors associated with the formal 
RFP processes, we were not able to respond with conforming proposals to 
either of these opportunities.  Therefore, we wanted to make sure Janice's 
significant contributions on both of these efforts were duly recognized, 
despite no commercial deal being struck.  Importantly, we anticipate that 
there will be continued opportunities to acquire some of the wholesale load 
in Maine under commercial and legal terms that are satisfactory to Enron, and 
given her familiarity with our work in Maine to date, Janice will surely be 
able to provide valuable legal support as we pursue those follow-on 
opportunities.

Regards,
John Llodra and George Wood"

Team:

Here are the final versions. A few comments:

I think we should specify 10 cents as our remarketing fee, as opposed to 
leaving it open. I think we need to provide some point to negotiate around. I 
know it may be less than our bid/mid/offer spreads, but I am also concerned 
that what we'd really need to charge would make us too expensive in an RFP 
process anyway.
Optimization of Existing Assets  - Index less 10 cents or just a 10 cent 
remarketing fee. A 10 cent flat fee makes them vulnerable because we could 
remarket at a price worse (for them) than index.
I changed the term to start June 1. If they want us to remarket their 
existing assets before the QSE is set up on June 1, we can discuss with them 
separately.


  


Please send me your comments no later than 10 am Monday. I plan to e-mail to 
TNMP at noon.

Thanks,

Michelle"

Alan,

Attached is the resume of Charles Glizzard, a candidate that would like to be 
considered for a Global Markets legal position.  We should probably consider 
him for the role of Marine Transportation specialist, but it appears his 
skill set also shows an ability to do quite a bit more for us.

Kind regards,
Dan

I'm glad you cancelled.   I agree that the changes are much broader than we 
intended.

More importantly, I miss having not played tennis this week, and I'm going to 
DC this weekend, and likely out next week.  A short interlude but that's all.

On an EEI note, are you/Reliant going to the meeting in Ontario that is 
addressing contract issues in Ontario (Andy is speaking about EEI).  Are you 
supporting the use of EEI in Canada.  I think I have our Canadian office 
convinced to use it with dealers but they would want to ""Canadianize"" it, 
thereby creating an EEI Canadian.  Any thoughts.

PS I am going to WSPP meeting just for the day - Mike Small has mentioned 
playing tennis on Monday morning before the meeting.  Still not going?"

Mitch -- Following our discussions,  attached for your review is a  
""Supplemental Agreement"" (unchanged from what you had reviewed before) and a 
revised draft Attachment A thereto.   Please forward to Frank Hilton, etc. 
for review so that we may now  complete the EEI master.  

I have reviewed the revised final EEI cover sheet (attached below) e-mailed 
to me by you earlier today  and confirm that the CAISO definition has been 
substituted appropriately.  Also attached below is a sample copy of the 
Exhibit B (56 pages, and apparently labelled Exhibit D, to be rectified 
later), contemplated by the Cover Sheet for incorporation of prior 
transactions, identifying open trades as of next Monday December 11th.   

 I look forward to hearing from you.  Best regards, David

Folks,

It appears from the comment below that the NYISO does not intend to revise 
October's bill until February 2001.  This is a very signifigant issue for 
Enron.  Recall that the NYISO intentionally billed for October with the 
incorrect prices for the proxy busses even though the prices had been revised 
on the NYISO web site for some time prior to the bill.  The impact of this 
was that the NYISO withheld about $3,000,000.00 from Enron for October.  In 
addition they have not updated the November bill to reflect revised prices 
and the payment date is approaching.  When asked about this last month, the 
NYISO indicated that they knew they were billing incorrectly and would rebill 
later but that, according to the tarriff, market participants must settle 
there bills as posted.  I believe this to be a blatent abuse of the tarriff 
and that the NYISO is intentionally ""leaning"" on market participants for 
credit.  With year end approaching I believe that there is an emphasis on 
maximizing working capital which makes this even more critical (this point is 
highly confidential).

I believe that if they are not going to address this with the November bill 
than we should be taking the most aggressive response.  Should we put this in 
an intervention to the NYSEG filing regarding payments  to the NYISO or 
should we file separately with FERC requesting as a separate issue?  What 
would get the quickest response?  Can and should we consider legal action 
outright?

Howard,  can you approach the NYISO at highest levels ASAP with this issue 
and find out if there is any intention to address this?  So much for there 
efforts to gain credibility in the Marketplace.

Following Howards inquiry, I suggest that we meet by phone to determine our 
course of action.  We have very little time if we have any hope of confincing 
them of revising the bill with the November billing due around the 15th.

On a similar issue, NYISO is asking us to repay $4.6 million in TCC revenues 
from earlier this year.  I believe that they must revise prices in order for 
them to do this and that they are outside the window for revising prices.

Howard, can you arrange for Sara Shackleton and Shari Stack to get the TCC 
rules that were in effect prior to August as well as any rules around price 
revisions.

Thanks,
Tom.

Response:

Rebecca,
Due to a coding error in calculating ancillary reserves for the 25 hour day
(Oct. 29), hour 1 was not charged on the bill and was overwritten by hour 2 
data
and all remaining hours were shifted up one hour. This error is scheduled to 
be
fixed prior to the October rebill (tentatively scheduled for 2/01).

Dave Evanoski
518-356-6031

Question:
The hours in the Transactions LBMP section are not
agreeing with the hours in the Ancillary section.
It looks like SH01 for 126mw is missing from the
Ancillary settlement file for 10/29/00 and all other
hours are shifted up one hour.  I have attached
a file as support.

Terri;

Attached are two draft contracts.

The first contract is for the Schedule K - Participation Power Purchase,
with a fixed price block of energy for $64 MWh, and capacity at $4,666.67
MW-Month (or $28-Kw season).  The repricing provisions are based off of a
loss of system resources of greater than 150 MW, with the units identified.

The second contract is for the Financially Firm Energy.  I structured this a
little differently than what I originally anticipated, based on a discussion
with Tim and how the ASC views ""financially firm"" accredited products.
Since EPRI wants to be able to accredit this transaction, the best way to
deal with the financial firm energy seemed to be by pulling it out and
putting it into an exhibit.  I'm open to discussion on this if EPMI has a
alternative way that they would like to see.  Also, please note that per our
discussion on Friday, December 1, I added a contingency into this document
that Split Rock and EPMI must enter into a Master Agreement by December 15
or the agreement will be void.

GREAT AUSTRALIAN SHIRAZ
On Monday, December 11th at 7pm, join SPEC's and The
Wine School for GREAT AUSTRALIAN SHIRAZ. We'll taste
and talk about 12 of the best Shiraz wines Australia has
to offer. Topics of discussion will include how Shiraz got
to Australia, how Australian Shiraz developed into the
wine it is today, how Aussie Shiraz differs from Syrah
wines made in France or the US, and the winemaking that
goes into producing the best of these uniquely Australian
wines. The anticipated lineup includes Clarendon Hills
Liandra Shiraz 1998, Langmeil Shiraz 1998, Penny's Hill
Shiraz 1997, Haan Shiraz 1998, St. Hallet's Old Block
Shiraz 1995, Ausvetia Shiraz 1996, Rosemount Hill of
Gold Shiraz 1998, Rosemount Balmoral Shiraz 1997,
d'Arenberg Dead Arm Shiraz 1998, and Penfold's RWT
Shiraz 1997 along with the two giants of Aussie Shiraz,
Henschke's Hill of Grace 1995 and Penfold's Grange
Hermitage 1995. GREAT AUSTRALIAN SHIRAZ will cost
$92.00 per person (cash) with a $10.00 discount available
for 1,000  SPEC's KEY Points. The high cost of this class
is due to the expense of the wines to be tasted. For
directions, reservations, or more information on this
class, please call SPEC's at 713-526-8787. This event will
be held at l'Alliance Francaise, 427  Lovett Boulevard
(on the southeast corner of Lovett and Whitney, one block
south of  Westheimer). The price includes SPEC's famous
5% discount for cash.

DECEMBER 2000 12-UNDER-$12
    Sometimes you don't need a ""great"" bottle of wine. Sometimes you just 
want a cheap bottle and it wouldn't bother you at all if it were to taste 
really good. We're in the same boat. We're always looking for wine that 
tastes like it costs more than it does, preferably wine priced under $12.00. 
So here are twelve of our favorites, all priced under $12.00.

LOUIS M. MARTINI Cabernet Sauvignon, California, 1998  (12x750ml $8.21 
$91.85)  Fine classic California Cabernet nose with notes of dusty oak, 
cedar, tobacco, and lots of fine black and red berry fruit. Super juicy with 
great fruit flavor in the mouth, a dusty, Napa-like texture, and a really 
nice medium-weight feel. The dusty fruit and tobacco notes last to the end. 
Martini is making perhaps the best buy available in a value-priced California 
Cabernet. Solidly Fine. SPEC's Score: 89+ points.

CAPEZZANO Montalbano Chianti DOCG 1997  (12x750ml $10.43 $115.49)  From the 
best modern Tuscan vintage on record, this is a nicely balanced, subtle, 
well-integrated Chianti featuring great cherry fruit and some ripe plum along 
with hints of tobacco and exotic wood. Rich and satisfying in the mouth, it 
is juicy with fruit and flavor. Good length. Finishes dry and slightly chewy. 
Delicious and Fine. SPEC's Score: 90 points.

BOUCHARD Pere & Fils ""Le Chamville"" Macon-Villages, 1999  (12x750ml $9.23 
$102.43)  Crisp, well-focused, nicely balanced Macon Chardonnay featuring 
good tropical and banana fruit with a refreshing citrusy acidity and an 
unexpected but welcome mineral note. Has enough richness to keep it 
interesting. Long and fresh tasting. Very Good. SPEC's Score: 86+ points.

BOUCHARD Pere & Fils ""La Vignee"" Bourgogne Pinot Noir, 1999  (12x750ml $9.23 
$102.43)  This well-balanced Burgundy Pinot Noir shows plenty of cherry fruit 
and hints of earth and mineral that start on the nose and expand onto the 
palate. The flavors are well-focused but there is a good level of richness.  
The finish really lasts and stays fresh to the end. Very tasty cheap Pinot; 
Really Very Good. SPEC's Score: 87+ points.

Ch. de la GREFFIERRE Macon la Roche Vineuse (Vielles Vignes) 1999 (12x750ml 
$10.40 $115.48)  Very nicely structured estate-bottled, old-vine Macon with 
nice mineral and terroir notes and good banana and pear fruit with a fresh 
tropical lime acidity that emerges through the subtle oak component. Quite 
tasty but a little sneaky; this is one of those wines that really grows on 
you while you?re drinking it. Fine. SPEC's Score: 89 points.

OXFORD LANDING Limited Release Grenache, South Australia, 1998  (12x750ml 
$8.86 $98.30)  Here?s a juicy, grapy, peppery, vibrantly fruity Grenache with 
just enough acid to keep it somewhat balanced. No complexity at all but its 
thrill is that it's a real fruit bomb. Quite fresh tasting but also solid and 
satisfying. Quite yummy; Really very good. SPEC's Score: 87+ points.

Ch. MEUNIER St. LOUIS, Corbieres, 1998 (12x750ml $9.45 $98.28) Here?s another 
super value in a 1998 from the south of France. This well-built 
Grenache-dominated red is chock full of juicy black grapy-berry fruit and 
subtle spice with a hint of Corbieres? earthy terroir. The wine is  balanced 
and fresh in the mouth with a fine, medium-weight feel and a softly chewy 
texture. The fruit and spice last through the fine finish. This one has both 
the fruit to handle a bit of spice and the stuffing to handle beef. Served 
cool (58-60o), it may be the perfect fajita wine. Fine. SPEC's Score: 90 
points.

PENFOLD's Koonunga Hill Chardonnay, Southeastern Australia, 1999  (12x 750ml 
$6.57 $73.45)  Really surprising for a value-priced (read cheap) Aussie 
Chardonnay, this Koonunga Hill has plenty of fruit but it is more in the 
green apple and green banana range than it is like the typical Aussie 
pineapple juice Chardonnay. The fruit is well complimented with a welcome 
mineral component and  enough acidity to keep everything fresh and balanced. 
Quite elegant with good length showing mineral-character and fruit that lasts 
to the end. Good food Chardonnay. Fine. SPEC's Score: 88 points.

M. TRINCHERO Merlot, California Coastal, 1997  (12x750ml $8.57 $95.79)  Soft 
textured, juicy, everyday-priced Merlot with plenty of ripe cherry Merlot 
fruit. Fresh and lively and full of flavor in a medium weight, very 
drinkable, well-balanced style. Simple but delicious, it makes a super party 
red. Really Very Good.  SPEC's Score: 87 points.

HOGUE Fume Blanc, Columbia Valley, 1999  (12x750ml $5.75 $64.25)  Very fresh 
tasting, refreshing Sauvignon Blanc with good crisp pear and lemon fruit, 
hints of green melon, and a touch of perfume (and no grassiness). Long and 
lively, it finishes dry. Good as an aperitif or with simple seafoods 
(especially oysters). Think of it as a sort of American Entree Deux Mers. 
Very Good. Spec's Score: 86 points.

MARTIN & WYRICH Moscato Allegro, California, 1999  (12x750ml $9.95 $111.30)  
This delicious Orange Muscat is fresh, bright, and alive with lots of 
perfumed orange blossom and honeysuckle fruit. Surprisingly lively despite 
its sweetness, this wine is quite fresh in the mouth with just a touch of 
frizzante. Long and balanced with a clean, lemon candy-like finish it is very 
refreshing and quite delicious. Fine. SPEC's Score: 88 points.

RAMOS PINTO Ruby Port, NV  (6x750ml $10.96 $60.03) Here?s a juicy, grapy red 
Port featuring a good mix of fruit and fire along with good weight and 
richness. The fruit is in the dark berry and grape juice range with just a 
touch of extra ripeness. This solid, everyday Port has the ability to keep 
for many weeks after the bottle is opened but enough flavor to make sure it 
is drunk sooner. Very Good. SPEC's Score: 87 points.

Special for SPEC's KEY holders: Buy a mixed case consisting of one 750ml 
bottle of each of our December 2000 12-Under-$12 selections for only $99.09, 
a savings of $8.52 over SPEC's already low cash bottle price.

Prices for these items and for the mixed case are good in all SPEC's stores. 
Prices are good through January 3, 2001. The ""12x750ml"" means the wine comes 
in 750ml bottles packed 12 to the case. The first price listed for each 
selection is the cash discounted bottle price. The second price listed is the 
cash discounted case price.

""Spec's""  is a service mark of the Spec's Family Partners, Ltd. and is 
registered with the State of Texas. Prices are subject to change without 
notice. Prices listed include a 5% discount for cash. ""Cash"" includes checks 
and debit cards when you enter your PIN#.

On Friday, about 3:00 pm, the ISO filed for emergency tariff changes, some of 
which are effective as of December 8, 2000 beginning HE 1600, and others that 
take effect Tuesday, December 12, 2000.  As a consequence, we no longer have 
the luxury of waiting until Jan 1, 2001 to start documenting certain costs; 
we must start documenting the verifiable costs to support supplemental energy 
and ancillary services energy bids in excess of the $250 soft cap 
immediately.  I understand that at least some of the traders have been 
informed of these changes, but I thought that it might be helpful for 
everyone to have a concise summary of the main points of this filing.  

1.  The ISO has changed the $250 hard cap on Supplemental Energy bids and 
Ancillary Service Energy bids to a soft cap.  It's similar to the FERC's 
proposed soft cap in its Nov. 1 Order.  Sellers can bid over $250 for 
supplemental energy bids and ancillary services energy bids.   If the ISO 
accepts a bid greater than $250, settlement will be as-bid and subject to 
refund if costs cannot be verified.  SCs must submit cost documentation to 
the FERC, ISO, and California Electric Oversight Board for all energy 
dispatched in excess of the soft cap.  Effective December 8, 2000.

2.  Beginning Trade Day December 12, 2000, the ISO is going to charge SCs who 
underschedule load or schedule generation that does not show up in real time, 
based on each SC's net regional negative uninstructed deviations.  (""Net 
Negative Uninstructed Deviations"" is a new ISO defined term, see below.)  
These SCs will be charged for (1) amounts paid by the ISO to purchase Energy 
from bids above the price cap, and (2) costs for Energy associated with 
out-of-market Dispatch instructions issued due to underscheduling.  

3.  Participating Generators that fail to respond to ISO Dispatch 
instructions will be assessed a penalty equal to double the highest price 
paid by the ISO for Energy for the hour in which the Generator failed to 
respond.  The penalty will not be assessed if the Generating Unit gave the 
ISO advance notice of a de-rate or outage that would limit the Generator's 
ability to respond to a Dispatch instruction.  If the outage or de-rate 
occurs in real-time, then a reason code provided with a decline or partial 
acceptance of an ADS instruction will constitute notice and no penalty will 
be assessed (subject to some additional conditions).  If the ISO has to 
curtail firm load to manage a System Emergency, the Generator will pay an 
additional penalty of $1000/MWh for dispatched energy it failed to deliver.

4.  Bilateral arrangements with the ISO, i.e., out of market purchases, will 
not be altered by the ISO's Amendment 33.

5.  From December 1-5, the ISO paid an average of $5 million per day for real 
time energy.  On December 5th, the ISO paid $36 million and on December 7th 
$81 million.  

6.  The published ex post price will not exceed $250.

7.  There is still a hard cap of $250 on Ancillary Services capacity bids.

8.  Net Negative Uninstructed Deviations:  Penalties for being short in 
real-time (either underscheduled load or generation scheduled in forward 
markets that does not show up) are based on net deviations for each BEEP 
interval, based on an SC's entire portfolio, including Load, Generation, 
Imports, and Exports. 


9.  Action:  We need to start documenting costs of Supplemental Energy and 
Ancillary Services Energy bids immediately.  Much of the groundwork for 
figuring out what information to collect has been done with respect to the 
real-time and services desks, but we need to make sure that someone is 
collecting this information on a daily basis.  For now, I am willing to be 
the point person to make sure the information is collected and filed with the 
appropriate agencies, but eventually  someone from the floor should take on 
this responsibility.  I will be here early on Monday, and we can coordinate 
our efforts then.

Greg stopped by to say that  the in the aftermath of the BPA/Kaiser non-deal 
the following further sub-deals could materialize.

Kaiser already has exercised a 24 hour notice right to sell balance of the 
month energy to BPA at index.  If BPA does not want the index power 
(unlikely) we could buy it from BPA.  No prepay strings.

Kaiser may give BPA 48 hour notice to do a January remarketing deal at an 
unknown price.  I'm not sure if we would purchase the power from BPA.  

Kaiser may give BPA a seven day notice to do a five month deal beginning in 
February which we might consider doing a prepay for.

Alcoa and another company are trying to close a deal by the end of the year 
whereby they are going to purchase a power plant-industrial complex at 
Longview, Washington. (Our origination guys are always working on something 
at Longview and this is probably it.)  As part of the closing, they are going 
to want to shut down part of the site and sell the power on the forward 
market.  There is a  potential that we might buy the power from them through 
BPA and perhaps prepay for it.

I told Greg the legal team, having worked through many of the issues on this 
kind of transaction last week, would stand by to help with any further 
developments. ----cgy "

Subject: Re: FW: optout language for TVA  

Elizabeth -- Three comments to consider:

In the first change, I think that I understand your change, but my impression 
was that ""provided for in this Confirmation"" was referring or tieing 
specifically to the ""deal"" defined in the Confirmation, therefore the change 
to say ""may be agreed to"" seems to weaken that reference.

On the 10th line, does adding the word ""firm"" in front of energy potentially 
conflict with the specific transaction if it is something more or something 
different than a simple firm deal.  Shouldn't the level of firmness be fully 
defined elsewhere in the confirm.

In (b), suggest adding some reference to quantity after your reference to 
timing along these lines:  "" (b)  the starting and ending time and date, and 
the quantity of the release or interruption;""     Since partial quantity 
releases are possible/likely, probably even successive releases (due to 
gradual weather changes)  it would be equally as important to identify 
quantity and timing.  Example:  start with 200 MW for the month, release 50 
MW starting day 10 for balance of month, then another 50 MW over a weekend.

As always, thanks for your assistance. -- David

but before we start using and drop in confirm I will need to see the rest of 
a draft confirm that we use with TVA.

This is a Llodra deal to be closed by 12/31, which he sent to me and to Shari 
(I think she's travelling today?).  It's supposed to be a physical exchange 
of the capacity and output among several NEPOOL nukes in which we and Select 
own various % entitlements (Seabrook, Pilgrim, Millstone 2 and 3).  I gather 
it's ""at par"", since there's no real pricing or $ changing hands unless a 
party defaults.  We seem to have a unilateral sale and unilateral purchase 
agrement w/ Select -- David's counterparty -- don't know whether that will 
cause risk problems.  Who should work on this?

All:

Attached is a first draft of a term sheet covering a nuclear diversity swap 
between us and Select Energy.

Dana/Paul  -- please give me your thoughts on this, particularly as relates 
to the 15-day outage trigger that would put this agreement on hold until any 
unit that is experiencing an ouage > 15 Business Days returns to service.  
From a risk mitigation standpoint, I think we are well off in that we are 
diversifying one unit with two replacement units (actually three since I am 
proposing Mill 2 for Jan-Mar and then Mill 3 for balance of the year).

Ed/Tracy -- what credit issues if any do you see, keeping in mind that the 
contemplated nuke exchanges would be on a unit contingent basis.

Janice/Shari -- any legal comments or issues?

Please call or email me to discuss.   I am out tomorrow PM and traveling all 
day Wednesday.   I'd like to push this forward rather quickly so we can work 
things out quick enough for this to be effective 1/1/01.

Thanks!!

Terri;

Attached are two draft contracts.

The first contract is for the Schedule K - Participation Power Purchase,
with a fixed price block of energy for $64 MWh, and capacity at $4,666.67
MW-Month (or $28-Kw season).  The repricing provisions are based off of a
loss of system resources of greater than 150 MW, with the units identified.

The second contract is for the Financially Firm Energy.  I structured this a
little differently than what I originally anticipated, based on a discussion
with Tim and how the ASC views ""financially firm"" accredited products.
Since EPRI wants to be able to accredit this transaction, the best way to
deal with the financial firm energy seemed to be by pulling it out and
putting it into an exhibit.  I'm open to discussion on this if EPMI has a
alternative way that they would like to see.  Also, please note that per our
discussion on Friday, December 1, I added a contingency into this document
that Split Rock and EPMI must enter into a Master Agreement by December 15
or the agreement will be void.

After I wrote this I was forwarded Steve Hall's summary.  There's some=20
redundancy but hopefully, this provides a few more details.    Also, Mary H=
.=20
and I are informed that on Friday the FERC issued an order that appears to=
=20
approve the ISO=01,s request in full.

Bullet Summary of the ISO's Amendment No. 33 (December 8 Filing):

The following is a summary of the filing made by the ISO.

1) ISO=01,s $250/MWh Soft Cap
a) Summarized: ISO Claims its proposal is identical to the FERC proposed so=
ft=20
cap but raises the soft cap level to $250 from the $150/MWh proposed by the=
=20
FERC: =01&The ISO would replace the current cap on Imbalance Energy bids wi=
th an=20
interim =01&soft=018 price cap based on the price mitigation proposal in th=
e=20
Commission=01,s November 1 Order. The ISO=01,s scheduling system will not r=
eject=20
Energy bids priced in excess of the $250/MWh price cap, but will evaluate=
=20
those bids in price merit order. However, if the ISO issues Dispatch=20
instructions to Scheduling Coordinators for Energy that has been bid in=20
excess of the $250 soft cap, those bids will not set the Market Clearing=20
Price for Imbalance Energy. Rather, those Scheduling Coordinators will be=
=20
paid in accordance with their bids.=018

b) Refund risk and cost documentation above $250. =01&Imbalance Energy abov=
e the=20
level of the soft price cap would be subject to refund, based on subsequent=
=20
review by the Commission. It also should require Scheduling Coordinators th=
at=20
submit such bids to supply supporting cost information to the Commission, a=
s=20
well as to the ISO and to the California Electricity Oversight Board so tha=
t=20
they may bring questionable bids to the Commission=01,s attention.

i) Appears to imply that the proposed reporting requirement is supplemental=
=20
to what was requested by the FERC. See p. 8

ii) Regarding production costs:  fuel, taxes, emission credits, startup cos=
ts=20
are all listed as costs.  However, no mention of noncontiguous scheduling=
=20
costs or reasonable profit.

iii) Quasi safe harbor on opportunity costs:  In a footnote to cover letter=
,=20
ISO states it will particularly scrutinize any opportunity costs in excess =
of=20
10% of the production costs or $25/MWh, whichever is lesser.

c) Useful quote: =01&In light of current fuel prices and the ISO=01,s recen=
t=20
experience in receiving less than a thousand MW of Imbalance Energy bids at=
=20
prices of $150 or less in many hours, the ISO believes that a $150 soft cap=
=20
would be tantamount to procuring all Imbalance Energy on an as-bid basis.=
=018

d) Effective date: 4 p.m. PST 12/8/00.=20

e) Term of this soft cap:  lesser of 3 mo (3/8/01) or whenever the Commissi=
on=20
supercedes it by its own order.

f) Applicable tariff sections.  Section 2.5.23.2 and .3.  See attachments=
=20
A1/B1 to the filing.


2) Participating Generator Penalties
a) Summary: =01&the ISO proposes in Amendment No. 33 to assess penalties ag=
ainst=20
Participating Generators that refuse to operate in response to an ISO=20
Dispatch instruction during a System Emergency or when the ISO is acting to=
=20
avoid an imminent or threatened System Emergency. They would be charged an=
=20
amount equal to twice the highest price that the ISO paid for Energy for ea=
ch=20
hour in which the Participating Generator failed to respond. In addition, i=
f,=20
during that hour, the ISO curtailed Load to manage a System Emergency other=
=20
than Load that has not been designated by agreement or regulation as=20
interruptible, the Participating Generator would pay an additional penalty =
of=20
$1000/MWh for the Energy that it failed to deliver.=018
b) Allowed excuse:  The penalties would not apply if the Participating=20
Generator has notified the ISO (within the hour of instruction), and=20
subsequently demonstrates (documentation within 72 hours) , that its=20
Generating Unit, System Unit or System Resource was physically unable to=20
operate or that operation would violate a legal restriction that could not =
be=20
waived.

c) Applicable tariff sections. Amends portions of 5.6.1 .2 and .3. See=20
attachments A2/B2 to the filing.

d) Effective date: Same as the ISO=01,s new soft cap: 4 p.m. PST 12/8/00

e) Term:  I did not see any sort of sunset provision.

3) Load Imbalance Penalties

a) Summary: =01&Scheduling Coordinators who rely on that  market to serve t=
heir=20
Loads the ISO=01,s costs of obtaining Energy through bids above the propose=
d=20

Elizabeth:

ISDA is holding an Energy conference on March 6th, 2001 at The Four Seasons
Hotel in Houston.  We would be delighted to have you speak again on the same
issues you discussed at our North American Energy and Developing Products
Committee meeting last October at The Regency Hyatt.

Please find attached a DRAFT agenda for the morning discussion for your
information.  I am in the process of finalizing the agenda and would
appreciate advice on selecting bullet points to describe briefly the
discussion on the Comparison of Master Agreements used in North America and
Europe.  I have allowed 45 minutes for the discussion (12:15 PM - 1:00 PM).
In addition, we would welcome any suggestions you may have on inviting an
ISDA member from a another company to help you discuss topic.

 <<elizabeth sager.doc>>

I will call you soon to discuss.

Thanks and regards,
Liz

Thank you so much for modifying agenda and recommending speakers to help
discuss topic.  I will go ahead and officially invite Diane Russo and Harlan
Murphy to speak at conference.

Elizabeth, in regards to Constellation Power, we only invite ISDA members to
speak at our conferences and they are not members.  However, if you think we
need another speaker for your panel, please recommend and we will invite
them.

Again thanks and regards,
Liz

Leslie- Just to let you know that I spoke with Harlan Murphy today and he is 
fine to use the ""agreed"" definition of CAISO Energy on Dynegy Direct. He said 
it should be  on the site in a couple of days. I told him that I would follow 
up w/ him next Mon. to make sure that it was there. 

He said that he still had an issue to sort out w/ you regarding ERCOT. 

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Nils,

We have kept our heat rates constant but changed the MW capacity in the 
summer and shoulders.  This shouldn't affect the $/kw-mo bid or offer so 
nothing has really changed except for the MW.  In answer to your question on 
the turbines.  They were 7B combustion turbines but have been upgraded, 
refurbished and all over rebuilt into a GE 7E equivalent.  I have attached 
your previous proposal with the new capacity schedules for your review.  
Let's revisit our numbers today and see where we stand on the bid/offer 
spread.    Also, if you could send over that tolling language for our review 
as soon as you are finished with it, I would appreciate it.  Thank you for 
working on that all day yesterday.  I will call you later today.

-Joe

This change is acceptable.  Melissa, will you be able to issue the execution 
copy of the confirmation, dated today, and with the ""Not an Offer"" notices 
cleaned out?  This can be signed  here before sending to Calpine, or can be 
sent to Randy Posejpal first, whatever Doug G-S  prefers.  If we'll sign 
first, please let me know when a copy is ready for my initials.  Thanks.

Doug -- As discussed, attached is a redlined copy and an execution copy of
the off peak 2002-2004 confirmation letter reflecting the changes taking
into account that modifications to product definitions are more likely to
arise from  the efforts of industry participants than via ERCOT action as
to the protocols or otherwise. The definition of UB itself makes clear this
product is firm, and the term ""Undelivered"" currently carries the meaning
that  Buyer must be capable of moving the firm energy from the Delivery
Point to more than one potential destination.  Please contact me with any
questions. --David

As feared, the judge denied our motion to compel arbitration.  Liz said the
judge had read all the pleadings and the cases, and he seemed prepared to
rule before argument.  After listening to argument, the judge denied the
motion to compel arbitration because

--  12 other adversaries are pending dealing with similar issues
--  arbitration would interfere with efficient administration of the estate
--  a Discovery Mediator has been appointed to supervise cases
--  not convinced claims I and II are non-core proceedings
--  2 counts of the complaint would be left with him in any event
--  he has discretion.

Interestingly, from the bench, he did not rule that Claims I and II are
core matters, he simply stated that he was not convinced they were
non-core.  We have a right to an immediate appeal.  There are definitely
pros and cons to it.  I'd be happy to discuss them with you in person or do
an email for your consideration.  Let me know which way you'd like the
analysis.

We have only 10 days from the entry of the order to file a notice of
appeal.  I'm not certain whether the order denying the arbitration was
entered today, but if not, it probably will be entered tomorrow.   For
planning purposes, let's assume that our notice of appeal has to be filed
on December 22, which is next Friday.

Wish the results had gone the other way, but it's not over yet!

For those newcomers (and a reminder to the old timers),  there is a

cubicle.  It has a good OCR progam, OmniPage Pro 10, for text scanning.  
Please feel free to utilize the equipment and if you need assistance  feel 
free to contact me--I'm right next door.

As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy=20

 a=20

ched=20
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which sour=
ce=20
would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performan=

Selection Project Team.

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=
ing=20
of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group.  This g=

will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing=

The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary=20

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.=

This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical=

=20
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  T=
he=20
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these tw=

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we=
=20
selected CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional=
=20
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to o=

staffing needs.  The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective=

In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group will b=

Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be=20

What is Managed Services?

		 Subject: Non-Compete Proposal

As you may already know, Scott Healy and I are working on revising the 
existing agreement with AES relating to the Calvert City development site in 
Kentucky.  In connection with that transaction, ENA agreed to non-compete 
language which is virtually identical to the provision set forth below.   The 
current deal contemplates switching from the Calvert City site to our Haywood 
County site in Tennessee.  As a result, AES has requested the following 
non-compete provision.  Please provide any thoughts that you might have.  I 
am available to discuss this with either of you on a moment's notice.



""For the period commencing on the Effective Date and terminating on the 
earlier to occur of (i) the termination of this Project Development Agreement 
or the Purchase Agreement in the event that Purchaser does not purchase the 
Interests or (ii) September 1, 2002, Developer [ENA] (including its 
subsidiaries but only to the extent that Developer owns greater than 50% of 
the voting securities of such subsidiaries) agrees not to pursue for its own 
account the development or acquisition of any power generation project 
(except for any transaction pursuant to which such power generation project 
is purely incidental to the overall transaction and is not a material part of 
the assets being acquired or merged in such transaction) where the point of 
interconnection of such project to TVA's Shelby to Weakley 500 kV 
transmission line is located in Haywood County, Tennessee.""

Elizabeth & Janice:

I put on the fax to you two articles from today's WSJ that I thought you 
would have some interest in if you have not seen the Journal today.

1.  I am assuming that the ENA Credit folks are all over the issues 
pertaining to the effect of the high wholesale prices on IOU counterparties 
that do not have the ability to pass on such higher costs to their retail 
customers, in most cases because the IOU distribution companies are subject 
to a rate freeze under their deregulation laws or, in some other cases, 
because they no longer have ""power purchase"" or fuel adjustment type adders 
in their tariffs to be able to pass through such added expenses, but I 
thought I would just pass this article along since it is clear that the 
rating agencies are going to start scrutinizing these situations very 
closely.  As you well know, this issue has been highly publicized in the CA 
situation, where I believe PG&E and SoCalEd have incurred ""losses"" on the 
difference between their wholesale power purchases and the amount they are 
allowed to sell that power for at retail.  That amount has been reported to 
be over $7B which if the situation continues as it is going will likely wipe 
out a substantial (if not all) of the companies' shareholder equity.  Of 
interest is that the CA utilities have not yet taken these ""losses"" for 
financial statement purposes since they are holding out the hope of a rate 
recovery, a fact that the capital markets are starting to focus on.  From our 
standpoint, as you know, this is not just a CA problem.  Similar, though not 
as dramatic wholesale power spike, problems exist in other parts of the 
country--for example, in New England because of the increase in gas prices 
(and in the Northwest).  Thus, as we are contracting with various IOU 
counterparties (even the straightforward T&D companies (i.e., those without 
generation) that traditionally were looked at as very safe from a credit 
perspective, we will need to be mindful (and perhaps get up to speed) on the 
state regulatory rules applicable to the recovery of wholesale power purchase 
prices by the those utilities, particularly since those counterparties could 
be adversely affected by deals other than ours.

2.  The second article discusses Constellation's contract to purchase of the 
Nine Mile 1 and 2 nuclear interests from some of the co-owners of those 
plants.  You will note that there also is a 10-year buy-back PPA between 
Constellation and the selling IOUs.  We will obtain a copy of the PPAs to see 
if there is anything of particular interest vis-a-vis the questions I spoke 
about the other day with Janice--but my guess is that, since the buyers are 
IOUs, the PPAs will look more like the Pilgrim, Clinton and Oyster Creek PPAs 
that Janice and I spoke about that are fairly ""stripped down"" and don't 
reflect many of the provisions we typically would want.  I'll follow up with 
Janice on this.

Shari:
I was not presently planning on participating.  I previously spoke with
Lisa Groff/Frank Hilton, my credit people participating on this
subcommittee, and we agreed that it was preferable to have the credit
managers and those on this mini-drafting group complete their assignment of
crafting a provision for the larger drafting committee of the EEI contract
to subsequently review.  The larger drafting committee would review to
ensure that the language, phrasing and structure of the document is
consistent with the existing EEI contract, and also have the larger group's
credit personnel involved in reviewing the subcommittee's work.  As a
result, I have not tried to redline at this juncture, because the smaller
drafting committee has not finished its work and created a consensus
document.

I agree that the timing at year end of this effort is really squeezing our
resources.

I am going to be on the call on Thursday  - are you? If so, how are you
approaching it? Are you going to come to the meeting with general comments
or are you going to circulate a redline in advance? Will your credit people
be on the line too?  It is quite a push to fit this in with everything else
that is going on at this time of year. I just wondered how you are treating
this from your company's perspective.

Personally I am going to try and get a redline out in advance of the call.
I will send it to everyone that is on the distribution list below.

Thanks!

Andy,  As discussed, heer is MSDW's proposal for a draft version of a
Collateral Annex that can be used in connection with the EEI Agreement
(it would be advisable for a clause to be included in the EEI cover
sheet incorporating the collateral annex by reference).  We are offering
this draft as a starting point for the industry's efforts to develop an
EEI Collateral Annex.  Please feel free to distribute it and let Ed or
me know if you would like to have a conference call with others to
determine the next steps in getting feedback.  Bill McCoy

Phil's birthday is the 21st, so I was thinking that I might want to have a 
birthday type dinner for him this Saturday.  Some place relatively casual but 
good food (I obviously have put a lot of thought into this).  I was thinking 
about dinner around 7:30.  Are you and Grant interested in joining us?  Julie 
is babysitting for us.  I am going to see if she can come over around 3 so 
Phil and I can also finish our Christmas shopping.  S.

Further to my email of Nov. 29th, Tim has now signed off on the usage of this 
list. Chris Foster ok'd it several weeks ago. 

Tim has asked that both of you let me know of any objections/comments to this 
list by the close of business today. Otherwise,  it will be used from 
tomorrow onwards. As indicated previously, we only plan to send it to 
counterparties who request to have something in writing which details the key 
distinctions between the EEI and the WSPP.  

Thanks, 

Shari and Christian 

___________

1. WSPP Section 10 - Definition of ""Uncontrollable Force"": This definition is 
too broad.   It sets out a litany of events, any one of which may be 
considered an Uncontrollable Force  by a Party seeking to avoid having to pay 
liquidated damages in respect of a Firm Transaction under which it  has 
committed to sell or deliver ""firm"" energy. For instance, it is hard to 
imagine that a ""drought"" is a legitimate excuse to relieve a Party of its 
obligation to deliver Firm Power. How can a drought cause power not to flow? 
What is a ""material shortage""? etc...  In contrast, EEI's definition of Force 
Majeure does not include a lengthy list from which a party could pick and 
choose to its advantage; rather the key to the EEI definition is that it 
characterizes FM as an event that ""prevents one Party from performing its 
obligations"".  

Related to this critically important concept of firm deliverability, where 
precise wording is very important,  is the puzzling existence of Section 25 
of the WSPP Agreement:   

""25. JUDGMENTS AND DETERMINATIONS: 
Whenever it is provided in this Agreement that a Party shall be the sole 
judge of whether, to what extent, or under what conditions it will provide a 
given service, its exercise of its judgment shall be final and not subject to 
challenge.  Whenever it is provided that (i) a service under a given 
transaction may be curtailed under certain conditions or circumstances, the 
existence of which are determined by or in the judgment of a Party, or ... 
that Party's or the Executive Committee's determination or exercise of 
judgment shall be final and not subject to challenge if it is made in good 
faith and not made arbitrarily or capriciously."" 
 
Whatever the intent  of this wording may have been,   what is clear is that 
it could only cause problems  in resolving a deliverability issue.   
  
2.  WSPP Section 27- ""Creditworthiness"".  This clause is too subjective.  It 
would allow one party, for potentially wrong reasons,  to unilaterally 
question the other's financial viability and require it to post collateral in 
an amount which is a ""reasonable estimate of the damages"" to the requesting 
party.  If such collateral is not provided within the allotted time frame, an 
Event of Default occurs. In contrast, the EEI provides for an objective test 
in Section 8.1/8.2 (c) which is based on a set collateral threshold expressed 
in $ and which is likely to be commensurate with the amount of unsecured 
exposure that a party feels comfortable with.  In addition, Enron routinely 
includes an objectively determinable  bilateral ""material adverse change"" 
clause in the EEI Cover Sheet  as a Collateral Posting Event /additional 
Event of Default which would be  triggered by a party's credit rating not 
meeting investment grade criteria or certain financial covenants/ratios.  We 
believe that this combination provides an objectively determinable level of 
credit protection which both Parties can understand and agree to before 
entering into any transactions under the agreement.       

3. All of the following points related to early termination of an agreement 
are very  important to any Non-Defaulting party in the precarious 
circumstances surrounding the termination of a complex trading relationship.  
This is the area where the Agreement is going to have the most potential 
legal significance  to the Parties, and this is an area where the WSPP comes 
up short of the EEI in some fairly substantial ways. 

 Events of Default and Early Termination.   The list of events which can 
become Events of Default is too short.  The absence of important events  
creates significant legal risk.  For instance, Section 22.1(b) speaks to a 
failure by a party to have made accurate representations and warranties as 
required by Section 36.  Section 36 is the Trade Option Exemption. This begs 
the question as to what happens in the event of a breach of Section 37?  
Section 37 is where the parties represent that they have the authority to 
enter into these types of transactions, have all necessary regulatory 
authorizations, etc..  With no Event of Default relating to a breach of these 
Section 37  rep's and warranties, what would one's remedy be in the event of 
a breach of Section 37?  In contrast, the EEI has a clear Event of Default 
based on a breach of rep's and warranties.  And, consider this example:    
the WSPP Agreement does not make it an Event of Default if a Party breaches a 
material covenant of the Agreement.   This basic legal point which appears in 
the EEI agreement is entirely missing.   

In addition to those listed in the WSPP Agreement, the EEI contains the 
following additional Events of Default : Merger without Assumption, Cross 
Default, Default by a Party's Guarantor (breach of rep., failure to pay, 
bankruptcy, expiry of guarantee while transactions are outstanding, 
repudiation of guaranty).  

 Calculation of Early Termination Payment: In order to calculate the value of 
any prematurely terminated transactions occasioned by an Early Termination 
Event, the WSPP requires a party to use a ""market quotation comparison"" 
method and go out into the market and obtain the present value of the 
affected transactions. Any related hedges that the Non-Defaulting Party has 
in place and now no longer needs cannot be included in the calculations. In 
contrast, the EEI,  as supplemented in our proposed Cover Sheet,  would allow 
the Non-Defaulting Party the flexibility to calculate a good faith estimate 
of its Loss by using quotes or internal calculations. The NDP would also be 
allowed to take into account any hedges or breakage costs associated with 
having had to terminate the transactions early as a result of the other 
party's default.  

Another problematic point in the WSPP is in Section 22.2 where it requires 
the Non-Defaulting Party to exercise its right of termination within 30 days 
of learning about an Event of Default. (An event does not become an ""Event of 
Default"" until notice and failure to cure has occurred.) Where  an event has 
been established as an Event of Default,   if the Non-Defaulting Party does 
not call a termination within this timeframe (and, if no extension is granted 
by mutual agreement ), the Non-Defaulting Party forfeits its right to 
terminate.  This unnecessary time restriction can only cause trouble in the 
already difficult circumstances that will exist in a potential termination 
situation.   In contrast, under the EEI, at any time so long as an Event of 
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Non-Defaulting Party has the 
right to designate an Early Termination Date and terminate all transactions. 

4. Governing Law- The WSPP provides for Utah law to govern the agreement in 
most situations. Most physical power counterparties are not located in Utah 
and so are not familiar with this law. We would prefer to have a more 
developed state law govern a power trading contract. The EEI provides for NY 
law which is well suited to handling trading related disputes.  It is 
generally recognized that New York commercial law, expecially in the 
important trading related areas of oral trading and bankruptcy is superior to 
the law of most other states.  The ISDA, for example, uses New York law for 
these reasons.   

5. Dispute Resolution.   The WSPP Agreement invokes arbitration and the EEI 
agreement does not.  We prefer arbitration, however, the WSPP version of it 
is unnecessarily complex.   First, it is not clear under the WSPP Agreement 
that all claims or disputes arising under it are able to be arbitrated.  Some 
disputes can be arbitrated, some cannot.    Our preferred approach would be 
to use arbitration for all claims or disputes.  Then, assuming that a 
permissible dispute is being arbitrated, the WSPP has a complicated mandatory 
""informal"" and then ""formal"" dispute resolution procedure which requires the 
constant involvement of the WSPP Chair and the Chair's pre-chosen list of 
mediators.  We think it would be better to have each party select an 
arbitrator, and then have these two arbitrators select a third independent 
arbitrator with at least 8 years experience in the electricity markets. We 
also think it would be fairer for the dispute to be settled using the 
arbitration methods set forth by the American Arbitration Association. 

6. Payment Netting and Closeout  Netting/Set-off.    A good master trading 
agreement should clearly address both  payment netting and close out netting 
and set-off in separate, explicit paragraphs of the agreement.  They are 
separate topics.    The EEI does this.  Section 6.4 deals with payment 
netting  and  Sections 5.3 and  5.6 deal with settlement netting and closeout 
setoffs.     These unambiguous paragraphs provide very explicit terms under 
which these important concepts are addressed and thus provide  a valuable 
credit management tool on which the parties can rely.   The WSPP Agreement, 
on the other hand, fails to clearly distinguish between payment netting and 
closeout netting/setoff.  Section 28.1 seems to be dealing with payment 
netting and the reference to set off is incomplete and ambiguous as to 
whether or not it applies to closeout setoff.  Furthermore, Section 28.2 
provides that a party that elects to use payment netting must post this 
information on the WSPP homepage ""(once the WSPP Homepage possesses the 
necessary capability).""   What can be posted can be unposted.  This whole 
system of confirming netting seems unnecessarily complicated.   

7. Invoicing- Section 9.5 of the WSPP allows a party to send an invoice 
within two (2) years from the date on which the invoice should have been 
delivered.   In contrast, Section 6.1 of the EEI has no such time frame and 
the parties are encouraged to send out invoices as soon as possible after the 
end of each month.

9. Contested Amounts: Section 6.2 of the EEI provides that in the event of a 
dispute, the owing party pays only the uncontested amount and then tries to 
resolve the discrepancy. On the other hand, Section 9.4 of the WSPP requires 
the contesting party to pay the entire disputed amount upfront and then try 
to resolve the discrepancy. 

10. Breadth of Agreement: The EEI  is  a nationwide document, drafted 
recently, by participants from all parts of the country,  during the most 
recent phase of wholesale deregulation, when a number of typically difficult 
legal issues had already been painfully experienced by companies.        It  
includes definitions for East power products as well as West power products 
(including products transacted for a California Delivery Point as well as any 
other Delivery Point in the WSCC).   The WSPP Agreement on the other hand 
began in the west during the regulated era, and   still contains many 
vestiges of  its origins that are no longer necessary, and, therefore, it 
cannot yet claim the same national scope as the EEI.  For example,  it still 
contemplates the regional  notion of ""Membership,"" in the Western System 
Power Pool.  What does this mean?  Why is this kind of membership necessary?  
What legal value does it have?  Why should a power trading master agreement 
need to have sections such as sections 8  dealing with Organization and 
Administration of various committees?   No other master agreement dealing 
with any other commodity, including the ISDA agreement, contains these 
notions of membership and committee structures and duties in their texts.     "

Attached is the draft which now incorporates some comments Janelle gave me 
today.  Could you please advise as to the following: 

1. The LDC is the Default Provider, not NEPOOL. Are there any additional 
changes you would make because of this? I am sure that Sections 2 and 3 are 
affected somehow. What are your thoughts on the best way to capture this? 

2. In Section 9 under (a), she wants to allude to the fact that if the 
Congestion Management System comes into effect, then we will be ""assigned 
their load"". I kind of get what she is talking about but have no idea what to 
say about it. What would you recommend?

If you want, just fax to me the pages on which you have corrections. My fax 
no is (503) 464-8058. 

Thanks,

Hey Elizabeth.

Well I'm not sure when we will be able to make up the game.  I was out of 
town last week and am in St Louis as I write this to you.  I will be here 
till Friday and then back again on Sunday night until the end of the week.  I 
saw Dan yesterday during lunch and he reminded me of it too... he knows my 
situation so I think he will understand if we end up not playing until the 
new year.  I wish we could play it before then but it doesn't look like my 
schedule will accomodate it... I am also leaving for NY on the 25th for Xmas 
with Bryan's family till the 2nd.  

Hope all is well with you and your family.  Thanks for getting in contact 
with me... I am in way over my head not only with snow tonight :) but with 
work and school.  

Are you going out of town for Xmas?  

Don't practice too much... I haven't played in weeks so I am back to square 
one... I think Dan might have to show me what a racket looks like again!!!!!

Take care and I will keep you up to date on what's happening with my schedule 
and when we can get together.

Char

Hi Charlotte

Hope you had a good trip last week.  Work has been horrendous - power and gas 
prices are decimating my free time - hope EES commercial is not suffering the 
same onslaught.

When would be a good time to play (Dan keeps reminding me to finish up the 
tournament) This week looks bad, but I maybe could play this weekend (less 
preferable) or Monday, Tuesday (need to get baby-sitting but likely doable) 
or Wed next week.  Let me know what works for you.

See ya

Peter, just a follow-up to your email.

1.  I would agree that OPG is mistaken.  After the meeting, Chris and I and 
others started the process of explaining to Joel Sheinfied, a contract 
administrator, why deliveries in a pool situation were not just financial 
settlements but involved a physical commitment to deliver or cause to be 
delivered power.  On this issue I think it would be helpful to present OPG w/ 
a product definition that works with the physical master.  I know Chris is 
already working on this.  From what it sounds like, the Ontario pool is not 
that different from NEPOOL.  In UI, Chris worked on a product definition that 
you could incorporate into the physical master.

2. I also agree that in pools, a fm will only exist when the pool fails and 
there are no deliveries capable of being made (not a single MW flowing).   
This is what we did in UI.  This is what we do in the California pool.  This 
is what we attempt to do in NEPOOL.  I think the EEI fm gets you to the same 
place (nobody could call fm if the pool were making deliveries) but agree 
that the language could be more direct.  With the California product (CAISO 
energy) we expressly modify the EEI fm since there are so many other things 
we also have to fix.  We likely in the future will also modify fm for the 
NEPOOL product but we are still trying to introduce so many other products in 
the US that this is a change for the near future.  In general, fm is unique 
to the product and I believe will change with each product.  When Chris and I 
were talking to OPG we told them that the fm we would be proposing for the 
Ontario product would be just as you stated:  Fm is only possible if the pool 
fails.  Just FYI, the god awful ""Into""product in the US was created by Enron 
for the very reason you stated: we wanted to eliminate fm risk in a non-pool 
market - we did this by obligating the seller to continuously be required to 
change delivery points (and not be allowed to call a fm) within the defined 
control area if for any reason the prescheduled delivery point was 
unavailable.

I think I could 3:30 (deal may be closing, but unlikely - if it did I might 
have to cancel - I would know by lunch). If you want, we could maybe try 
hitting at the HCC (the Houstonian courts are booked, otherwise we could try 
there) - now that I45 is closed, traffic around the MET during rush hour is 
terrible and I wouldn't want you to get stuck.  If this doesn't work, just 
let me know and we can find another time."

As we discussed, here is a first effort at a revised TVA offer letter.  I 
drafted the Into TVA Option as a series of calls tied to the MOPA delivery 
term and quantity - not sure if this anything close to what you all had in 
mind.  Please let me know what shape you all think the offer ought to take 
and we can revise accordingly.

		 Subject: Enron Guaranties for Indian Mesa II PPA & GSPA

Attached are clean and blacklined drafts of the Enron guaranties to be made 
in support of EPMI's obligations under the Indian Mesa II Renewable Energy 
Purchase Agreement (""PPA"") and Green  Premium Sharing Agreement (""GSPA"").? 
The guaranty for the PPA is blacklined against the Enron EPC Contract 
guaranty in favor of the banks which was granted in connection with our 
Cabazon Wind Power Project (the project most recently financed by EWC) and 
the GPSA guaranty is blacklined against the PPA guaranty.  As we discussed 
last week, since the Enron guaranties will need to be in a form that will 
acceptable to our project lenders and equity participants, we thought that we 
should start with a form that was used in our last financing and that was 
negotiated by Enron and the banks.  We plan to use the same basic form for 
the Enron guaranty that will be made in favor of EPMI with respect to the 
seller's obligations under the PPA.  We will forward the draft of that 
guaranty to you later today.  Please feel free to give me a call if you have 
any questions concerning the attached guaranties.  Thank you.

Hi Carol

I don't know of any available nannies but will keep my ears open.  I used a 
service, Nanny Professionals, and was very pleased with the quality of 
candidates they sent over (our nanny has been w us for over 5 years).

Good luck on your search.

ps - Thanks for playing last week.  I look forward to playing again after 
Thanksgiving."

PS - Chris, I agree with your  comment re the EEI copyright  and references - 
I'm not sure what the right answer is - do you want to continue calling it 
an""""EEI Canada""?  Is that OK with EEI? Do you think we should rename it in 
the name of the organization that ""approves"" it?  Is that OK w EEI?  Maybe 
you should discuss at meeting and then we can discuss with Andy from EEI to 
get EEI's approval/consent."

Here is my attempt to flesh out the Escrow Provision. Feel free to mark it up 
all you want,  If you can - mark it up by hand and  fax it to me before you 
go to Ella's school function. (My FAX NO. is  (503) 464-8058.)   I will then 
turn the document around in advance of our call with Gayle McKenzie at Morgan 
Lewis which is confirmed w/ her and has been set up for  2pm Houston time on 
Tuesday. 

If you need to reach me - please call Jan King on (503) 464-8814 or my direct 
number (503) 464-8782. 

Thanks so much for all your help,

At the last EEI meeting there was a strong interest in beefing up the 
collateral provisions of the EEI (what a great idea).  Bill McCoy at Morgan 
Stanley was asked to prepare the first draft, a copy of which I am forwarding 
to you for your review. Please review and let either Shari or I know if you 
have any comments or thoughts - while EEI's message does not indicate when 
comments are due ( I have a call into EEI but have not yet heard back), I 
have asked Shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch 
with EEI within the next week or so.  Thanks for your input.

Andy,  As discussed, heer is MSDW's proposal for a draft version of a
Collateral Annex that can be used in connection with the EEI Agreement
(it would be advisable for a clause to be included in the EEI cover
sheet incorporating the collateral annex by reference).  We are offering
this draft as a starting point for the industry's efforts to develop an
EEI Collateral Annex.  Please feel free to distribute it and let Ed or
me know if you would like to have a conference call with others to
determine the next steps in getting feedback.  Bill McCoy

Hi

We are so bad - we suddenly woke up and realized that Friday is December 
1st.  That means Saturday is the 2nd - Sam's birthday.  SO I'm writing 
invitations now.  Here it is: 

Can Eleanor and Alice join us on Saturday for a train party at the zoo?  
Around 10:00?  We would love to have you all come too, or not, if you prefer 
to  ..... shop.

PS Hope your holidays were, well, a holiday."

Thanks for your message

Mike Small is definitely a better tennis player than WSPP facilitator.  
Coaching seems to be his real passion.

I'm sorry I  can't play Saturday am - it is Sam's 3rd birthday and we are 
scrambling to find a birthday concept.

On a better note, I can play all this week. Any day, any time works for me - 
let me know when you can.

Talk to you soon."

Look for first and only gas station on right and take right turn just before
it onto Lake Street. Look at odometer and 4 miles after you'll come to Elk
Creek Road. (You'll pass into a different county, see West Settlement on
Left.. , Grange Building on right with dairy barn and cows across the street
) Take soft turn onto Elk Creek and round bend over small bridge (vly
creek). we are the first house- second driveway - on the left.. White with
unstained picket fence. The key is for the side door at back. There are two
driveways .. use the second for easy unloading through back.

Our neighbors across the street are Barbara (blonde sister) and Pat
(brunette sister) Dury. (914)254 4360..
Eric Rosen (first driveway on left) 254 4643... ... Stan & Adele Seigel
driveway to right... feel absolutely free to call upon them if you feel the
need.. I'm sure Eric will stop by with his new puppy Clifford.. Karen and
Jim Rauter live on the high road.. (Lake Street extension) 254 4180.. they
have a little boy Julian about Sam's age.. Again please feel free to call
them.. She is the one that has the interesting job with the not for profit
environmental group..

Nearby Attractions : Eric Rosens pond...see his garden too.... Walk down his
driveway until you get to trailer .... garden on right... veer off left past
the trailer into brush and follow path through two fields and see pond on
right.. Good Evening walk to see Great Blue Heron in pond .. His new house..
(I helped design) is on top of the hill....Also Walk up Elk creek Rd.just
watch for fast traffic.. nice views.. walk through little abandoned cemetery
across the Siegels driveway and walk up that hill and through the fields for
nice vistas. Definitely take a bike ride down high road all the way back to
Johnson Farm... In general we feel free to access the creeks through other
peoples property especially if they are not in sight... P.S. the wagon in
the yard is how we get Lucy back to Eric's .. until we go off the road..We
also left our hiking pack if Sam can be carried in it...

Swimming is available at the Pine Hill Lake . .. Go back to Route 28 and
take left go over Pine Hill and see Lake on right.It is a public facility
with life guards and the  ""beach "" looks a little fakey from the road but
the swimming is reallywonderful with a floating dock.. There are some creek
swimming holes but we don't really frequent any though if  you see a bunch
of cars along the road chances are that's one....

In the town of Fleischmanns there is a really nice park with a public
swimming pool, soccer field, tennis courts, basketball courts.. another good
place to hang and play frisbee with the kids...
Other day excursions... Little Pond and Big Pond Recreational areas.. or
hike to Giant Ledge ...see Big Indian turnoff from Route 28 and follow that
road until you come to the first sharp right bend and see parking on
right... Ledge is about 1-1/2 miles... (careful of the edge) a beautiful
vista and a not too strenuous hike.. You can find these places on the maps
of the Park in the Plastic envelope inside the big cluttered mess of a
cabinet in the Living Room .. This is our too busy to put away depository..

For food shopping you should make a pit stop in Boiceville Supermarket on
the left of Route 28 on the way to the house from the thruway.. it is the
cheapest best selection and place to stock for the week. If you arrive on a
Sat. in time to go to the Round barn Farmers Market near Roxbury on Route 30
there are fresh produce and food stands and some times live music in a
wonderful old round barn.. See attached maps....
Also go to Margaretville once you are at house for shopping.... wine store..
cheese store and an A&P... For a special meal stop at the seafood place on
route 28 in Arkville.. He goes to Maine every week for fresh lobster.....

Check out the antiques center in the old theater in Margaretville for good
browsing..
Other towns of interest and beautiful drives... Andes has old hotel with
restaurant and is very pretty.. also has good thrift shop..
Bovina is a beautiful little town with a good cafe style grocery run by
relocated tasteful city folk.. good food!!!

Things about the house.... Unfortunately we have developed a knocking in our
pipes in the bathroom.. don't be alarmed.. just adjust the controls to help
get rid of it..... Also more importantly we donot use the water for cooking
or drinking as it is hard-not so good tasting and has a high salt content-
We use the nearby spring to fill the jugs at the foot of the steps in the
basement.. The Spring is located on the ""high road"" going back towards
Fleischmanns you pass West Settlement where honey stand is.. go over little
bridge then see meadow on left go past this meadow about 100 yards until you
see a stand of tall pine trees on left and there is a wide shoulder on the
left side of the road ... look for the spring on the right side of the road
across from the pine stand.... It is delicious water... The house water is
just fine for bathing and rinsing food...
Also make sure the shower curtains stay closed while you are showering as
the water can escape out the back if you don't close them... Another thing
if there is alot of rain the water will get a brownish tint to it.. If it
gets really bad and you don't want to use it to bathe you can go to the
public
showers at Pine Hill Lake or even ask Barbara across the street if you could
borrow hers...  We have actually gotten an estimate to upgrade the whole
system so if the guy calls while you are there tell him we will contact him
when we return... For clothes washing there is a Laundermat in Margaretville
where you can play frisbee in the field behind the place or go fishing in
the creek while you wait..P.S. My rod is in the basement and the reel is on
top of the Fridge....

Well I think that's the most of it.. I'll call you from Block Island with
our number there. In the case of Emergency call Eric or Barbara or 911...our
fire number is posted on the mailbox... Eric Rosen works at the Cafe on Main
Street in Margaretville in the evenings... (there is a hospital emergency
room on route 28 in Margatretville) If you need to see a doctor for some
reason call Karen to get the name of her pediatrician...
otherwise Dr. Marguerite Collins may be able to help .. she has an excellent
rep.


Have Fun and can't wait to see you !!"

I think the wedding is on for the 23rd.  My mom wants us to stay at a hotel 
while in DC.  I think Bob would likely want us to stay in DC for Christmas 
Day since Chi will be on honeymoon, but I am not real sure on this.  Bob is 
out in OK over New Year's and I will need to go back up the following weekend 
to stay with Mom while Bob is out.  What do you think.

PS My mom is chain smoking - she bought a cartoon of cigarettes with Chi.  
Chi thinks we should just let her make her own choices.  What do you think.

would like to schedule time with you and Mark T to think through how we 
should approach the creation/adoption of a single contract for 
physical/financial(maybe) trading.

Elizabeth:

ISDA is holding an Energy conference on March 6th, 2001 at The Four Seasons
Hotel in Houston.  We would be delighted to have you speak again on the same
issues you discussed at our North American Energy and Developing Products
Committee meeting last October at The Regency Hyatt.

Please find attached a DRAFT agenda for the morning discussion for your
information.  I am in the process of finalizing the agenda and would
appreciate advice on selecting bullet points to describe briefly the
discussion on the Comparison of Master Agreements used in North America and
Europe.  I have allowed 45 minutes for the discussion (12:15 PM - 1:00 PM).
In addition, we would welcome any suggestions you may have on inviting an
ISDA member from a another company to help you discuss topic.

I think it looks great - my only thought really is on the middle section 
relating to cleaning laying out the elements of negligence and a statement of 
the standard to be applied  - I quickly revised your section to give you an 
idea of what I was thinking.  In any event I think you are absolutely on the 
right track.  Good luck and let me know what else I can do.

Lawsuit Filed In San Diego Vs Enron For Power Mkt Abuses

11/29/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A second lawsuit is being filed in San Diego 
Superior Court Wednesday against Enron alleging the company, and others, 
overcharged California consumers more than $4 billion for electricity 
service. 
On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy 
Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO), 
AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy. Both lawsuits are seeking class 
action status and may be consolidated into one complaint. 
The complaints allege unfair trade practices and illegal trust activity. A 
news conference announcing the details of the lawsuit will be held Wednesday 
morning in San Diego.
Enron does not own or operate major generating units in the state, but is 
active in trading electricity here and securing long-term fixed rate 
contracts for large industrial customers. At times, Enron sells power back 
into the California Power Exchange, the market where power is bought and sold 
in the state. 
An Enron representative said he has not yet seen the lawsuit and was unable 
to comment. 
The lawsuits claim Enron and the other energy companies withheld power supply 
last summer, created shortages by selling power out of state and used 
real-time confidential data about power plant activity to drive up prices. 
The lawsuits are an attempt to force generators to refund about $4 billion 
for electricity, the amount consumers were allegedly overcharged. -By Jason

Dear Jane,

Further to our discussions on Friday, I attach a copy of the Energy Trading
Paper prepared by our Washington office.

The paper is relevant to what we are focussing on now with EPSA, and 
discusses:
what is happening in the US and English markets, the legal issues in merchant
power sale contracts, the EEI agreement (on which Enron's EPSA is largely 
based,
or was it vice versa), and compliance issues.

A few of points I found particularly interesting:

* The way in which many of the risks are born seems to be reasonably
settled in the US market/EEI form.  The issue is to what extent Japan
will/should follow the same allocation, on which subject the Enron EPSA seems 
to
be setting the pace, at least for the moment.

* We cannot discount the danger that some of the counterparties in Japan
will in fact become insolvent or choose not to perform.  We have attempted to
cover this in EPSA.

* The treatment of force majeure, particularly non-performance by the
back-to-back supplier/customer, will need more attention as specific fact
situations arise.

* The need for a commercial/legal response system to be in place to
immediately address any failures.

I hope you find the paper useful and, as discussed, I rely on you to 
distribute
it to other persons within Enron who are likely to be interested.

Best regards

Paul Davis

Eric Rosen (first driveway on left) 254 4643... ... Stan & Adele Seigel
driveway to right... feel absolutely free to call upon them if you feel the
need.. I'm sure Eric will stop by with his new puppy Clifford.. Karen and
Jim Rauter live on the high road.. (Lake Street extension) 254 4180.. they
have a little boy Julian about Sam's age.. Again please feel free to call
them.. She is the one that has the interesting job with the not for profit
environmental group..

Nearby Attractions : Eric Rosens pond...see his garden too.... Walk down his
driveway until you get to trailer .... garden on right... veer off left past
the trailer into brush and follow path through two fields and see pond on
right.. Good Evening walk to see Great Blue Heron in pond .. His new house..
(I helped design) is on top of the hill....Also Walk up Elk creek Rd.just
watch for fast traffic.. nice views.. walk through little abandoned cemetery
across the Siegels driveway and walk up that hill and through the fields for
nice vistas. Definitely take a bike ride down high road all the way back to
Johnson Farm... In general we feel free to access the creeks through other
peoples property especially if they are not in sight... P.S. the wagon in
the yard is how we get Lucy back to Eric's .. until we go off the road..We
also left our hiking pack if Sam can be carried in it...

Swimming is available at the Pine Hill Lake . .. Go back to Route 28 and
take left go over Pine Hill and see Lake on right.It is a public facility
with life guards and the  ""beach "" looks a little fakey from the road but
the swimming is reallywonderful with a floating dock.. There are some creek
swimming holes but we don't really frequent any though if  you see a bunch
of cars along the road chances are that's one....

In the town of Fleischmanns there is a really nice park with a public
swimming pool, soccer field, tennis courts, basketball courts.. another good
place to hang and play frisbee with the kids...
Other day excursions... Little Pond and Big Pond Recreational areas.. or
hike to Giant Ledge ...see Big Indian turnoff from Route 28 and follow that
road until you come to the first sharp right bend and see parking on
right... Ledge is about 1-1/2 miles... (careful of the edge) a beautiful
vista and a not too strenuous hike.. You can find these places on the maps
of the Park in the Plastic envelope inside the big cluttered mess of a
cabinet in the Living Room .. This is our too busy to put away depository..

For food shopping you should make a pit stop in Boiceville Supermarket on
the left of Route 28 on the way to the house from the thruway.. it is the
cheapest best selection and place to stock for the week. If you arrive on a
Sat. in time to go to the Round barn Farmers Market near Roxbury on Route 30
there are fresh produce and food stands and some times live music in a
wonderful old round barn.. See attached maps....
Also go to Margaretville once you are at house for shopping.... wine store..
cheese store and an A&P... For a special meal stop at the seafood place on
route 28 in Arkville.. He goes to Maine every week for fresh lobster.....

Check out the antiques center in the old theater in Margaretville for good
browsing..
Other towns of interest and beautiful drives... Andes has old hotel with
restaurant and is very pretty.. also has good thrift shop..
Bovina is a beautiful little town with a good cafe style grocery run by
relocated tasteful city folk.. good food!!!

Things about the house.... Unfortunately we have developed a knocking in our
pipes in the bathroom.. don't be alarmed.. just adjust the controls to help
get rid of it..... Also more importantly we donot use the water for cooking
or drinking as it is hard-not so good tasting and has a high salt content-
We use the nearby spring to fill the jugs at the foot of the steps in the
basement.. The Spring is located on the ""high road"" going back towards
Fleischmanns you pass West Settlement where honey stand is.. go over little
bridge then see meadow on left go past this meadow about 100 yards until you
see a stand of tall pine trees on left and there is a wide shoulder on the
left side of the road ... look for the spring on the right side of the road
across from the pine stand.... It is delicious water... The house water is
just fine for bathing and rinsing food...
Also make sure the shower curtains stay closed while you are showering as
the water can escape out the back if you don't close them... Another thing
if there is alot of rain the water will get a brownish tint to it.. If it
gets really bad and you don't want to use it to bathe you can go to the
public
showers at Pine Hill Lake or even ask Barbara across the street if you could
borrow hers...  We have actually gotten an estimate to upgrade the whole
system so if the guy calls while you are there tell him we will contact him
when we return... For clothes washing there is a Laundermat in Margaretville
where you can play frisbee in the field behind the place or go fishing in
the creek while you wait..P.S. My rod is in the basement and the reel is on
top of the Fridge....

Well I think that's the most of it.. I'll call you from Block Island with
our number there. In the case of Emergency call Eric or Barbara or 911...our
fire number is posted on the mailbox... Eric Rosen works at the Cafe on Main
Street in Margaretville in the evenings... (there is a hospital emergency
room on route 28 in Margatretville) If you need to see a doctor for some
reason call Karen to get the name of her pediatrician...
otherwise Dr. Marguerite Collins may be able to help .. she has an excellent
rep.


Have Fun and can't wait to see you !!"

FYI. This is a pretty paper on legal/risk aspects of power trading. I think 
it would help in training future lawyers/staff.

Dear Jane,

Further to our discussions on Friday, I attach a copy of the Energy Trading
Paper prepared by our Washington office.

The paper is relevant to what we are focussing on now with EPSA, and 
discusses:
what is happening in the US and English markets, the legal issues in merchant
power sale contracts, the EEI agreement (on which Enron's EPSA is largely 
based,
or was it vice versa), and compliance issues.

A few of points I found particularly interesting:

* The way in which many of the risks are born seems to be reasonably
settled in the US market/EEI form.  The issue is to what extent Japan
will/should follow the same allocation, on which subject the Enron EPSA seems 
to
be setting the pace, at least for the moment.

* We cannot discount the danger that some of the counterparties in Japan
will in fact become insolvent or choose not to perform.  We have attempted to
cover this in EPSA.

* The treatment of force majeure, particularly non-performance by the
back-to-back supplier/customer, will need more attention as specific fact
situations arise.

* The need for a commercial/legal response system to be in place to
immediately address any failures.

I hope you find the paper useful and, as discussed, I rely on you to 
distribute
it to other persons within Enron who are likely to be interested.

Best regards

Paul Davis

Sorry to hear about being SICK - the only good there is re-experiencing the 
pure joy of being merely healthy.  After that nothing bad matters.  Would 
love to see you sometime - maybe next week lunch?  The Heights is still grand

Here is another Tolling that Stuart did and reviewed when we were thinking of 
taking back a PPA (in this case we were supplying gas and taking electricity, 
so your deal does not have the same perspective) when we sold the plants - 
this deal never happened and was very convoluted because of lease accounting 
issues. Anyway it may be helpful on your toll.

Hi Liz -- I talked to Grant today and he told me you guys will be heading
to Washington for Christmas and for your sister's wedding.  We wish it
would have worked out for you to come to the big D but understand.  He also
filled me on on your unstoppable ascendancy to the top of the charts of
your club's tennis elite.  I'm not surprised and good luck.  Do you yell
every time you hit the ball yet?

We'll be working on a country weekend in January for us all to get together
in the beautiful Hico, Texas area.  As the realtors say, it is the ""top of
the hill country"".

At the last EEI meeting there was a strong interest in beefing up the 
collateral provisions of the EEI (what a great idea).  Bill McCoy at Morgan 
Stanley was asked to prepare the first draft, a copy of which I am forwarding 
to you for your review. Please review and let either Shari or I know if you 
have any comments or thoughts - while EEI's message does not indicate when 
comments are due ( I have a call into EEI but have not yet heard back), I 
have asked Shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch 
with EEI within the next week or so.  Thanks for your input.

Andy,  As discussed, heer is MSDW's proposal for a draft version of a
Collateral Annex that can be used in connection with the EEI Agreement
(it would be advisable for a clause to be included in the EEI cover
sheet incorporating the collateral annex by reference).  We are offering
this draft as a starting point for the industry's efforts to develop an
EEI Collateral Annex.  Please feel free to distribute it and let Ed or
me know if you would like to have a conference call with others to
determine the next steps in getting feedback.  Bill McCoy

Elizabeth:

ISDA is holding an Energy conference on March 6th, 2001 at The Four Seasons
Hotel in Houston.  We would be delighted to have you speak again on the same
issues you discussed at our North American Energy and Developing Products
Committee meeting last October at The Regency Hyatt.

Please find attached a DRAFT agenda for the morning discussion for your
information.  I am in the process of finalizing the agenda and would
appreciate advice on selecting bullet points to describe briefly the
discussion on the Comparison of Master Agreements used in North America and
Europe.  I have allowed 45 minutes for the discussion (12:15 PM - 1:00 PM).
In addition, we would welcome any suggestions you may have on inviting an
ISDA member from a another company to help you discuss topic.

 <<elizabeth sager.doc>>

I will call you soon to discuss.

Thanks and regards,
Liz

Hi Charlotte

Hope you had a good trip last week.  Work has been horrendous - power and gas 
prices are decimating my free time - hope EES commercial is not suffering the 
same onslaught.

When would be a good time to play (Dan keeps reminding me to finish up the 
tournament) This week looks bad, but I maybe could play this weekend (less 
preferable) or Monday, Tuesday (need to get baby-sitting but likely doable) 
or Wed next week.  Let me know what works for you.

See ya

think the memo of cad is off on cross default too.  i had noted such on my

		 Subject: Revised Memo


From Rick Antonoff:

Following our telephone conversations on Sunday and Tuesday, please find
attached our revised preliminary draft memorandum addressing the bankruptcy
issues that we have been discussing, and incorporating the additional facts
raised during our telephone conferences this week.  Based on our
discussions and the revisions made to the draft Settlement Agreement this
week, our draft memorandum is now based upon the Avista transaction.

Attached are clean and redline versions of the revised draft.  The redline
is marked to show changes from the draft we circulated on December 22,
2000.

We look forward to receiving your thoughts and comments after you have an
opportunity to review the memorandum.

Regards.

		 Subject: Re: Draft Letter

In the interest of time, I am forwarding the attached contract to Kevin 
Hughes, Wanda Curry, Don Black, Ron Adzegary, and Marty Sunde.  Please read 
the attached and confirm that this is your understanding of the  PGET/EPMI/ 
EEMC assignment.  

I am also at this time forwarding to the working group my four main points, 
which I think reflect my main areas of concern under the drafts:

1.  I would like to say  that  the price is the same under the transactions.  
Transaction costs should be dealt with separately. 
2. While we have agreed to take a pass through of the bankruptcy risk,  this 
draft provides that we take on all contract dispute risk.  As I understand 
it, EPMI intends to pass through all risk, such as change in delivery point 
risk, under the contract.  Since EPMI is our sole provider of power to EES 
(other than  the PGET contract), EPMI is in the best position to manage  
general contract risk with its counterparties, as it does today with all our 
physical electricity purchases.  EPMI may  have disputes under contracts for 
many reasons that EEMC is not aware of and will not be in a position to 
influence once the contracts are  assigned to Avista.
3. I assume if EPMI  trades out of  these positions as it manages its own 
portfolio, the credit risk would not follow to subsequent counterparties and 
the EPMI/EES confirm terms would revert to typical confirm language.
4.  I was operating under the assumption that the tax issue would be resolved 
with Steve Douglass prior to signing the main documents.  I am not sure 
whether this issue can be quantified by EES tax today.  Any suggestions or 
ability to resolve/quantify today?  Same concern for the accounting issues.  
My concern here is that if the transaction leaves us in a worse economic 
position as a result of making EPMI whole, this would need to be addressed 
with our business people. 

Elizabeth and JOhn, what are the next steps.

Hi Elizabeth,

I've had a couple of originators approach me about working on asset 
management type deals, optimizing third parties' power assets and/or 
purchase/sale of commodities.  A little birdie told me that you worked on 
something somewhat similiar to that a while back, but the deal didn't go.  
When you have a minute I would appreciate hearing about what you did.

Thanks,

Kay"

fascinated - his doctor chastised him for staring  in the Dr office) - she 
wants an angel puppet, a doll and a car for xmas.  If she asked I would

Confidential - Attorney Work Product/Not Discoverable

A. PGE

I. Termination Rights Based on the Failure to Post Collateral

It is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on PGE's 
or one of its subsidiaries's failure to post collateral as required by the 
underlying contracts"":

1.  PG&E/ENA - Financial ISDA  - Enron exposure $23 million

2.  PGET Power/EPMI - Physical power - Enron exposure $215 million

3. PGE Canada/Enron Canada - Physical gas - Enron exposure $15 million

4.PGE Canada/ENA - Physical gas - Enron exposure $1 million


II. Termination Rights Based on PG&E's Failure to Pay Indebtedness

It is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on 
PG&E's or one of its subsidiaries's default on indebtedness in excess of a 
threshold (either $100 million or $50 million):

1. PG&E/ENA - Financial ISDA - Enron Exposure $23 million

2. PG&E/EPMI Physical Power -Enron exposure ($90 million)

3.PGET Power/ENA - Physical Coal - Enron exposure $200,000

4.PGET Power/ENA - Financial GTC - Enron exposure ($6.2 million)

5.PGET Power/EPMI - Physical power - Enron exposure (out of the money, 
currently used to net other EEMC power master which is net in the money $215 
million - see contract 2 above)

6.PGE Canada/Enron Canada - Physical gas - Enron exposure $15 million

7.  PGE Canada/ENA -Physical Gas- Enron exposure $1 million

8. PGET Gas/Enron Canada - Enron Exposure ($2.3 million)

9.PGET Gas/ENA -Financial ISDA - Enron exposure $ 48 million

10. PGET Gas/ENA - Physical gas - Enron exposure ($25 million)

11. PGET Gas/EES - Physical gas - Enron exposure ($700,000)

Most of the above agreements are supported by a guaranty from PG&E's parent 
(PG&E Corporation) in the amount of $475,000,000.  We have not yet made 
demand on the parent but could do so after PGE or its other unregulated 
subsidiaries failed to pay amounts due.  

Exposures are approximate as of 1/19/01.  Before terminating, we would need 
to verify actual contract language.

B.  SCE Default

SCE is in default of a contract between SCE and EPMI relating to  a power 
sales position which is out of the money to EPMI approximately ($35 million) 
based upon SCE's failure to make payments on debt in excess of $100 million. 
Under contract we could suspend deliveries (limited period) and then 
terminate and accelerate amounts due.  Amounts payable could offset amounts 
owed by SCE to EPMI or its Affiliates including Enron Wind or Portland 
General.

finalizing Shari's move to Portland.  Shari is looking for a ""relocation"" 
package.  HR has been tied up in PRC and is now searching for a package that 
works.   HR has promised me a response today and then I can discuss w Mark H

Hi Shari

I need help as well from JS on those two issues.  On the LDC supply we need 
to understand the relationship between SD Warren, the LDC and NEPOOL - f/m 
and supply obligation will be impacted but I don't know how until we 
discuss.  Also need to understand the possible penalties from taking from 
LDC.  CMS assignment of load I also need to understand - I think it relates 
to getting the necessary NEPOOL credit but? .. I put a call into JS"

Gary,

Attached you will find a November RT (Real Time)  Market Default Invoice 
which was receive by EPMI from the PX this morning.

This invoice was published on the PX Settlement Web Site.  Again, the PX 
failed to notify market participants that this invoice was out there.  
Normally they would send an email out and inform all market participants of 
it's availability.  If Market Participants don't know about this invoice 
being out there they will end up defaulting on their payments.  (That may be 
what the PX wants so they can go after the collateral.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Good luck today! - MO

		 Subject: MPLP PPA Dispute



PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT
DO NOT DISTRIBUTE

Elizabeth:

I looked through the CMS PPA on my return flight to NY.  While I think we 
should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone, I 
nonetheless thought it might be of some help to set forth a few preliminary 
focal points for those discussions, particularly if you don't get to this for 
a few days.  I thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some 
comments as I was thinking through some of the issues/positions.  Also, I'll 
have to run down the conflict issue when I get back into the office, but I 
thought I could generally review the PPA in any event.

In addition, I did not know whether it was ENA's or Dynegy's obligation to 
work on a response to CMS, but I thought it made some sense to see what one 
might look like on paper.  (See  attached).  At this point, however, I'm not 
sure whether MPLP should furnish any specific contract-based rationale in 
writing to CMS as to MPLP's position that the capacity charges should be 
adjusted on a calendar year basis.  You will note that the draft letter 
focuses on the language dealing with the adjustment formula to the Contract 
Capacity Factor (which clearly is done on a calendar year basis), rather than 
the scheduled changes to the stated capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D.  
As noted below, there are some issues underlying this position.

Preliminary Overall Assessment

The PPA essentially is inconsistent on the capacity charge adjustment issue.  
While many of the relevant computations are done on a calendar year 
basis--which generally supports MPLP's position--the effect of adjusting the 
stated capacity charges on a calendar year basis results in two anomalies: 
namely, the stated capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for ""Year 1"" only would 
apply for 3 months, but even more importantly, the capacity charge (on 
Exhibit D) for ""Year 35"" would apply for the last 21 months of the Contract 
Term.  The anomaly ""running in the other direction"" is that, under CMS's 
interpretation, various computations would be made on a calendar year basis 
(e.g., Contract Capacity Factor), and adjustments resulting therefrom would 
be applied ""mid-stream"" (i.e., after 3 months of the alleged ""contract year"" 
).  My overall concern is that an arbitrator may focus on the anomaly 
(described above) that results by applying Exhibit D using a calendar year 
concept (i.e., the 21 month ""Year 35"" issue) since that is a fairly easy 
concept to get your arms around..

More Information/Diligence/Research

Before a definitive conclusion on the issue can be made, we likely would want 
to review or undertake, as the case may be, some additional 
information/diligence/research, such as (which I assume we could generally 
obtain from the Michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e-mail you 
forwarded):

--The Michigan PUC presumably approved the PPA (prior to the first amendment) 
in a published Order.  Was there anything in that Order or the submissions 
(or exhibits thereto, including financial projections) that might provide 
some guidance?

--My guess is that there must be other CMS QF PPAs with the same type of 
pricing structure since this issue essentially would arise in every instance 
where the COD was not a Jan.1.  Do we (or local counsel) know whether this 
may be a ""global"" attack by CMS on these types of PPAs?

--While not directly relevant to the contract interpretation question, 
confirm with local counsel that CMS would have recovered the ""excess"" 
capacity payments from its customers--so that it presumably would have to 
issue a customer refund if it were to prevail on its claims.

--CMS ""self bills"" itself under the PPA.  Has the statute of limitations run 
on any of its claims for refunds for prior years?  Can CMS's prior course of 
dealing be used to support MPLP's contractual interpretation, or is there 
otherwise an equitable argument that CMS should not be able to recover prior 
""overpayments"" (as opposed to prospectively adjusting the capacity 
payments)?  (This could be particularly helpful to try to settle out the 
dispute on the basis that MPLP would concede the issue on a prospective basis 
only).

--The cover letter from CMS suggests that the alleged payment error resulted 
in payments in excess of the avoided cost rate authorized by the PUC.  Isn't 
this determination to be made over the life of the PPA, rather than for any 
particular period?  Assuming CMS's statement is correct, I assume it does not 
affect the validity of the PPA, but only whether CMS can recover the ""excess"" 
amount in rates?

--Do we have any leverage in the event we were to raise this dispute with the 
PUC?  If so, can this be used in the context of trying to work out an overall 
restructuring of the PPA?


Certain Points in Support of MPLP's Position

--The definition of ""Contract Capacity Factor"" provides for a calendar year 
determination and, most importantly, provides for a partial year calculation 
for the year in which the COD occurs that ends at the end of that calendar 
year.  If the capacity charge should be adjusted as of the anniversary of the 
COD date, it arguably would not make sense to have a partial year calculation.

--Sec. 10(a) provides that if in any calendar year the Contract Capacity 
Factor is less than 60%, then the capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D 
""shall be adjusted for the next calendar year as follows.... The capacity 
charges for the following calendar year shall then be determined....  
(Emphasis added).  This section makes specific reference to Exhibit D and 
makes the adjustment effective for the next calendar year, not on the next 
anniversary of the COD.  It arguably would not appear to make any sense to 
apply the Contract Capacity Factor adjustment on a calendar basis, but 
determine the capacity charges on a COD anniversary basis if no adjustments 
thereto are required because the Contract Capacity Factor levels do not 
require an adjustment.

 --NOTE:  The counter-argument, however, is that the foregoing language only 
pertains to the computation of a percentage ""haircut"" or adjustment that is 
applied to the stated capacity charges on Exhibit D, whatever those may be, 
rather than to when the annual stated capacity charges are effective.  That 
is, making this adjustment on a calendar year basis, even though the 
scheduled capacity rates change each October 1, is not necessarily in 
conflict with the rest of the PPA.

--Sec. 2(b) (Effective Date and Term) provides that the Agreement runs for 35 
years ""and thereafter from year to year,"" unless a party gives at least one 
year's notice to terminate which termination shall be effective ""at the end 
of the 35 years or any calendar year thereafter."" (Emphasis added).  Thus, 
for example, if one month after the end of the 35 year term--i.e., October 
31, 2030--a party gave notice to terminate, such termination would be 
effective December 31, 2031, not September 30, 2031 or September 30, 2032 
(i.e., not on the anniversary dates of the COD).  Thus, the PPA contemplates 
in certain respects certain ""stub"" years and certain ""long"" years, a 
contractual scheme that is at least analogous to MPLP's position on the stub 
and long years for the timing of the scheduled changes in the stated capacity 
charges on Exhibit D.

--There are other calendar year based obligations--for e.g., Sec. 13 (and 
Exhibit B) reflect termination payments that, again, are calculated on a 
calendar year basis.  (We should discuss with the commercial people the 
economic rationale underlying the termination payments to see if there may be 
additional support in that respect).  (Note that some other calendar year 
based calculations were eliminated by the First Amendment to the PPA, but can 
still be used to reflect the underlying ""calendar year"" flavor of the PPA 
since the issue at hand existed even prior to the First Amendment).

A Few Additional Points to Note

--The PPA is devoid of default language, LDs, etc.; however, MPLP could bring 
a claim against CMS to arbitration (Sec. 18) for what it believes it is owed 
when CMS does not pay the full capacity charges in 2001 (plus interest as 
provided at Sec. 20) and keep performing under the PPA.

--Although I do not see a significant issue here, let's briefly discuss the 
potential for CMS to try to affirmatively use an ""indication"" of a regulatory 
disallowance pursuant to Sec. 10(c) as a way to attempt to force its 
""contract year"" interpretation of Exhibit D.  While Sec. 10(c) is one of 
those ""old school"" one way regulatory outs, MPLP would undoubtedly use Sec. 
10(e) [requiring CMS to defend the PPA) to prevent CMS's affirmatively use of 
the PUC to support its contract claim.  (In Pennsylvania, PECO, in an 
analogous circumstance, attempted to use a PUC determination as justification 
to attempt to break a PPA with a QF).

Let me know when you wish to follow up.

Shari - 

It looks like Friday afternoon will be the only day i can do the meeting this 
week.  I will check with entergy and see if this works for them.  Before I 
call them, can you give me an updated list of issues we want to discuss and 
who we would like for them have in attendance.  Also, if any documents have 
changed hands since our last meeting that have changed any status, please let 
me know.

Thanks,

Jeanne,

Looks great.  I don't have any changes.

I like your characterization of the ""bond cap"" issue Pat and I mentioned this 
morning.  My bet is that, ultimately, this will drive the CPUC to increase 
the CPA.  Once the legislators figure out that the general fund will not be 
fully reimbursed if the bond issue is less than $10 billion, they will put 
pressure on the CPUC to make sure the CPA is as large as possible.

Steve

EPMI is entering into more and more transactions that are settled against a 
floating, published index price.  Our physical contract does not currently 
provide for what happens if the published source is not available or is 
otherwise materially changed. Under ISDA for financial trading,  this is 
addressed as a Market Disruption Event (MDE).  Under ENA's standard contract 
for financial trading, there is included as a MDE ""the imposition of trading 
limits on the range within which the price of the commodity may fluctuate"".  
What this may mean is that if a cap is imposed on power prices, then in lieu 
of using the capped price to determine the floating price, you would be 
required (under ISDA) to eventually get brokers to determine what the price 
would have been without the cap.

I want to add language to our physical contracts that addresses material 
changes/disappearance of the published prices that would mirror the financial 
trading terms and doubt whether we would want to make the imposition of a cap 
on power prices a MDE.  If you treat the imposition of a cap (say in CA of 
prices to $500 or in NEPOOL to $1,000) as a MDE, then we would be required to 
secure quotes as to what the price would have been without the cap each time 
that a pricing date trades at the cap level.   This only seems fraught with 
litigation risk to me.  Alternatively, if caps are not deemed a MDE, then you 
would always settle against the published prices, even if they are 
""artificially"" determined after the trade was entered into.  While caps are 
not appealing, I think it would be better to not have the imposition of caps 
be considered a MDE.  I have spoken with the financial trading group and they 
will follow our lead on this.  So, depending upon what you both think, we 
will make sure that financial and physical power are treated the same on this 
issue.  

Thanks for your thoughts."

Dave/Billy
 
Our external Counsel are reviewing the authority of FMPA to enter into the 
proposed transaction and will also advise as to the required representations 
and other specific due diligence we will need to conduct prior to entering 
into any such transaction.
 
Please ensure that credit get an early heads up on this proposed transaction, 
Ed Sacks is probably your first point of contact.
 
The form proposed by FMPA envisages a Master Agreement, which falls 
considerably short of what we would expect to see in a Master Agreement. As 
discussed with Billy I am viewing this as a single transaction and any 
discussion as to Master Agreements can be conducted in parallel to the 
proposed transaction. I attach the EEI Master, with Cover Sheet and 
attachments to enable you to commence this process. Please note that this 
does NOT include credit terms.
 
In addition, we can establish the authority, or otherwise of FMPA to enter 
into a Master Agreement at a later date when actually required, rather than 
clouding the issue of the current transaction.
 
Regards,
 
Marcus

Here is a revised draft of the CDWR risk memo.  Events change everyday. This 
morning's paper reports that a rate increase of 40% may be imposed by the 
CDWR as early as today and the new bond issue amount is purported to be 16 
billion (rather than the 10 initially discussed)

		 Subject: Proposed Changes Based on California Energy Shortages

Over the past several months, we have reviewed in detail our trading 
contracts and the companies through which we conduct our trading business in 
California.  In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit 
and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any "" 
future California"", we propose the following changes:

1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All 
Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading 
contracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a 
major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to 
have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best 
advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.

2.     Mandatory Master Netting Agreements For Counterparties With Multiple 
Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have 
multiple masters with a counterparty, a ""bridge"" should be put place between 
the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or 
more masters.

3.     Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.  Merging 
EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient 
from both a credit and legal point of view.

4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event -- 

Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts 
or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes 
will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity 
to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv)substanially improve 
Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range goal is 
conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a single entity 
and a single or limited number standardized agreements.

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

		 Subject: Proposed Changes Based on California Energy Shortages

Over the past several months, we have reviewed in detail our trading 
contracts and the companies through which we conduct our trading business in 
California.  In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit 
and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any "" 
future California"", we propose the following changes:

1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All 
Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading 
contracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a 
major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to 
have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best 
advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.

2.     Mandatory Master Netting Agreements For Counterparties With Multiple 
Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have 
multiple masters with a counterparty, a ""bridge"" should be put place between 
the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or 
more masters.

3.     Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.  Merging 
EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient 
from both a credit and legal point of view.

4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event -- 

Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts 
or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes 
will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity 
to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv)substanially improve 
Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range goal is 
conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a single entity 
and a single or limited number standardized agreements.

Janice,

Another high priority deal.  The attached proposal is for Western Resources 
in order to cover a short position we have in SPP.  Noone will sell us FLD so 
we are agreeing to a system firm deal with one catch.  Western Resources will 
put in reserve 20-25% of the total deal value in an account.  They will then 
reimburse us  up to the amount in reserve, if they cut us.  I have tried to 
lay out as muck detail in the attachment as possible.  This deal would need 
to be closed by Jan 1.  Let me know if we need to meet on this and I will get 
someone from the desk to come along.  I will call you to follow up on this.  
Thanks.

I talked with Jim Steffes about the article below.  He stated that the PA 
company most at risk for a California type problem is GPU because it has 
divested its generation and will be in the market more.  (Maybe this creates 
an opportunity for EPMI selling a hedge product to GPU?)

Tom Chapman--Do you have additional info or insights on this?  Thanks.

Today's Electric Power daily discusses that due to high wholesale power 
prices, many PA customers are switching back to their utility that has capped 
prices.  Does this create the potential for a California situation with the 
utilities in PA?  I put in a call to Jim S too.  Thanks for your help.

Subject: Re: PA wholesale vs. retail prices  

The short answer is yes.  Both Duquesne and GPU have divested their 
generation assets, and both have already suffered problems with their POLR 
service.  

The implicit reason for the GPU-First Energy merger is that GPU has lost 
hundreds of millions over the last two years (and promises to do so 
indefinitely without help) providing POLR service.  First Energy can offer 
both hedging help, but generation in off-peak times (only off-peak because of 
system congestion in PJM).  Enron has an opportunity here to do some good 
things.  However, from a credit perspective, we should be aware that GPU is 
in a risky position.

Duquesne divested of their generation selling their assets to 
Orion/Constellation.  In turn, Duquesne contracted with Orion to provide 
energy to meet their load.  As part of this contract, Duquesne did two things 
that are questionable from a business perspective.  When turning over their 
assets to Orion, they also transferred the FTRs to Orion.  Thus, Duquesne's 
load no longer holds the FTRs making it difficult to hedge transmission 
risk.  Second, Duquesne did not contract for capacity.  For this reason, they 
are having problems joing an RTO because they have no capacity resources, and 
Orion is holding them hostage over this issue--expecting a large capcity 
payment.  Without some rectification, Duquesne is in conflict with both PJM's 
rules and PJM West's proposed rules.

For this reason, there is an opportunity in this effort.

Elizabeth & Christian:  I had trouble forwarding an e-mail relating to the 
same but have copied it below.  It describes a movement by certain CA 
legislators to attempt to enact a ""windfall profits tax"" on electricity 
sellers that essentially would be designed to claw back profits on 
electricity sales.  You will recall this was one of the items addressed in 
our ""pass through"" clause in the proposed CDWR contract.  I know that we, as 
Firm, looked into the various constitutional and other legal issues relating 
to such a tax a few months ago, so let me know if, in your spare time, you 
would like me to pull anything on it.  John

Andy is back now so this is all over to him.  There are lots of issues to 
consider in how all of this moves forward.  Let's just make sure Howard keeps 
Andy in the loop on this as the traders are not expected to understand the

Louise --

Government Affairs was not pushing for this outcome.  The NY PSC seems to 
have adopted this on their own (or with the support of the local utility).   
Howard Fromer (our NY reg affairs guy) indicates that the NY PSC was simply 
looking for a deep market index they could use to establish ""non-switching"" 
customer rates.  Howard has spoken with Dana Davis about publishing off-peak 
and on-peak prices and he said that the Desk could do it.

One other thing.  PGE is looking to transact with EPMI through EOL.  We are 
preparing a filing at FERC that would modify PGE's Code of Conduct to allow 
this.  There is a risk that FERC will use this filing (while small) to look 
again at ""regulating"" EOL.  Remember that APX is regulated by FERC.

I agree that we need to be more coordinated with EOL and state regulators 
(FERC is in the loop and we have had discussions with them).  

Of course, as our involvement in the markets through EOL continues to grow, 
regulators will begin to take a deeper look.

Lisa Yoho and I can come by today to discuss more fully if you'd like.

Subject: Re: NYPSC Adopts Enron Online as Index  

Have we had any interaction with them on this?  This is not good news at all 
(as indicated below) and has regulatory implications for EnronOnline - I 
presume we did not encourage this in any way or have any agreement in place.  

Did we have any involvement in the process at all or is this something one of 
your guys picked up - Anyway Andy Zipper is back today so I am sure he will 
handle this.

Physically they cannot get the prices and we don't (I think) publish power 
indices on EOL. 

I hope we haven't been the people pushing this as that would be a real 
problem and shows immense lack of co-ordination.

Not sure if you had seen this language from the NY PSC.  While great, this 
clearly means that NY PSC commissioners will begin to think alot about how 
EOL  and its relationships with other Enron companies.

Subject: NYPSC approves market-based backout credit for RG&E; Adopts Enron 
Online as Index

Another big victory for Enron in New York! In an Order issued by the NYPSC on 
March 29, the NYPSC has approved a proposal to modify the existing fixed 
backout credit of 2.8 cents per kwh for energy and capacity and replace it 
with a market-based backout credit. The additional retail adder of 0.4 cents 
per kwh would remain.  Load-serving entities (LSEs) will have the option of 
continuing to buy their energy and capacity from RG&E at the market based 
backout credit which will be determined 15 days prior to the beginning of 
each of the two six-month capability periods, and will be based on ""a 
forecast of energy prices derived from Enron Corporation's (Enron) 
EnronOnline trading platform.""  To my knowledge, this is the first occasion 
that a regulatory body has agreed to use Enron Online as an index!  LSEs can 
elect instead to procure their own commodity and get a market-based backout 
credit (MBBC). Under this option, the LSEs will get a market based backout 
credit. However, the Enron online prices for the six months determined as 
above will be reconciled on a lag basis against actual market prices.  The 
PSC has capped the amount of the reconciliation for any LSE to the product of 
the LSE's total load for the calendar year and $0.065 per kwh (PSC staff's 
estimate of RG&E's embedded power supply cost).  (The PSC Order actually says 
$0.015 but this appears to be a mistake since the attached settlement states 
$0.065.) A copy of the PSC's Order is available on its website:

Calif. utilities risk imminent default, S&P warns
(UPDATE: Recasts, adds details, background. Adds byline)

By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern =
California Edison are at grave risk of default and bankruptcy within =
weeks, and are likely to see their high credit ratings fall to low junk =
grades if they do not get regulatory help by Friday, credit rating agency =
Standard & Poor's said on Wednesday.

``S&P is prepared to take dramatic rating action,'' said Richard Cortright,=
 an S&P analyst, in a conference call. ``The ratings are expected to drop =
deeply into speculative grade to reflect the likelihood of imminent =
default.''

The agency assessed the situation as the California Public Utilities =
Commission prepared to meet Thursday to consider whether to allow Pacific =
G&E and Southern California Edison to pass on at least some of their =
skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs to consumers.

Shares of PG&E Corp.(NYSE:PCG - news), the parent of Pacific G&E, closed =
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $20-15/16, down $1-7/16, or =
6.42 percent. Shares of Edison International (NYSE:EIX - news), the parent =
of Southern California Edison, closed at $17-7/8, down $1-1/8, or 5.92 =
percent.

The utilities operate under a rate freeze through March 2002, and are also =
unable to negotiate long-term supply contracts. These factors expose them =
to the vagaries of the volatile spot power market.

Wholesale power recently cost more than $1,400 per megawatt hour, a more =
than 40-fold increase over the $35 per megawatt hour rate last year.

California imposed the rate freeze as part of its deregulation of the =
utilities sector, which was intended to promote competition and consumer =
choice.

Among the options the commission has to remedy the situation are a hike in =
the utilities' price caps.

Even that, however, would constitute a ``band-aid on a bullet wound,'' =
said Ron Barone, who leads S&P's utility group and also participated in =
the conference call.

Californians have already been warned to cut back their energy use, and =
that they may be subject to rolling blackouts.

Cortright said unless the commission offers the utilities significant =
regulatory relief, Pacific G&E and Southern California Edison will be =
dependent on the capital markets for cash infusions, if any are available.

``There are bills that are coming due in January and February,'' he said. =
``We would be naive to think that the capital markets are going to open =
their doors to satisfy (their needs) in the current environment.''

``To be frank,'' he added, ``we are amazed that events have been permitted =
to reach anywhere near this critical stage. It truly is unfathomable. We =
really do need some emergency actions taken now.''

Pacific G&E last completed a big bond sale in October, selling $1.35 =
billion of bonds. Southern California Edison and its parent, Edison =
International, sold an equivalent amount in early November.

Both companies carry ``A-plus'' corporate credit ratings and ``single-A'' =
senior unsecured debt ratings. Pacific G&E's secured debt carries an =
``AA-minus'' rating. Those ratings are considered mid to high investment =
grades.

One trader said Southern California Edison's debt began on Tuesday being =
quoted by price, like junk bonds, instead of by the extra yield they offer =
relative to similar maturity U.S. Treasuries, like investment-grade bonds.

Its 5.875 percent notes maturing in September 2004 were quoted Wednesday =
at about 87 cents on the dollar, yielding about 11.3 percent to maturity. =
No price quotation was immediately available on Pacific G&E's debt.=20

Hello Steve,

Thank you for returning my call.  Attached are two spreadsheets representing 
the exposure we have with the PX and ISO.  There has been no change to the 
receivables due.  PGE did not engage in transactions beyond the expiration of 
the DOE order February 7th.

The only other exposure we have with PG&E is a payable in the amount of 
$704.318 with PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corp for gas we purchased in March.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks...

I attach a summary of the 11 outstanding ECC transactions under ECC's GTC:



In summary, the principal risks are:

Principal Risks:

1. Unexecuted Confirmation Letters on approx. 75,000 GJs per day
2. Receivables (approx. US $25MM pre-petition and approx. US $300K per day 
post-petition)
3. MTM (aggregate negative MTM approx. US $1.9MM)

Please note:

1. I am trying to track down PG&E's back-up paper sent for each deal and will 
update the chart to indicate the differences to their GTCs.  We have found 
only one corresponding PG&E Confirmation Letter (for TAGG #N13588.1/2/3) 
which refers to PG&E's form of unexecuted Master Agreement.  I have 
summarized at the end of the chart the applicable provisions of PG&E's Master 
Agreement form if it were to govern.

2. I have not been successful in tracking down Canadian insolvency counsel 
over the weekend, but will keep trying.

Ben, I'd appreciate anything you have about Enron's claims.  We've discussed 
it with the debtor and it does not contest the energy providers are the real 
parties in interest and don't contest they ought to be represented on the 
committee. As for a meeting, I can't promise I have time for that at this 
point.  I will give you a call Monday or Tuesday.  Thanks.

As I mentioned in the voicemail I left for you today, we will get something 
to you in writing on Tuesday regarding Enron's claims.  The ""back of the

Are you still there?

could you call me?

I urgently need to talk to someone in UST's office.  We represent Enron and 
heard a rumor that a committee will be formed this weekend.  The debtor's 
info regarding Enron's claim is not accurate, and we want the opportunity to 
show what we think the right number should be.

David,

I believe that the ownership percentage in Section 2.11 should be 100%, not 
50%. If we were to sell off any meaningful portion of either subsidiary, we 
would likely want that entity to stand on its own credit; at a minimum, Enron 
Corp. would be due compensation for the guaranty it is providing from the 
minority shareholder(s).  Please call me to discuss if there are objections.

Paul

David, could you please insert a material adverse change clause in our QSE 
agreement with EES.  This is to cover EPMI in the event EES is sold partially 
or wholly to a third  party.  If this occurs, the third party would have to 
negotiate acceptable credit terms with EPMI.  In my meeting with Paul he said 
that this is standard in our other agreements with EES.  This is all we need 
for credit for EES QSE.

Thanks for your assistance, - Mike

To confirm, I am away from the office Thursday April 12 through Thursday 
April 19, but reachable by cell at most times.  As Thursday is the Early 
Termination Date, the following will need to be completed in my absence (with 
Section references to PG&E's Oct. 99 form of Master):

1.  PEGGY/JON:  Unless a replacement deal has been entered into, cut NITs as 
of 8:00 am Thursday morning.

2.  GREG:  Determine an estimate of our (i.e. ECC) costs and expenses as a 
result of the Default by PG&E, including for Canadian and US counsel under 
Section 12.2, and estimating future costs and expenses to be incurred.

3.  CHERYL/JON/GREG:  Determine receivables owing as of the Early Termination 
Date under Section 12.3, noting the portion that is pre-petition and the 
portion that is post-petition. 

4.  JON/GREG:  Obtain quotes from 3 dealers for the Market Value of the 
terminated Transactions under Section 12.4.  Greg needs to sit with Jon when 
the quotes are obtained, on a taped line, following the outline prepared by 
Houston for Portland.  The quotes obtained are to be entered into the log 
sheets prepared by Credit, and returned to Credit.  The calls are to be saved 
and kept by IT on tape/CD.  Quotation confirmation forms are to be completed 
and sent to the dealers providing the quotes, and their return pursued.  A 
single, aggregated MTM/early termination/liquidation amount for the 
terminated Transactions is to be determined by comparing the Market Value to 
the Contract Value and using the Prime Rate as the discount factor under 
Section 12.5.

5.  CHERYL/JON/GREG:  Prepare our claim as the aggregate of 2 (costs and 
expenses), 3 (receivables) and 4 (MTM) above.  Organize documentation and 
quantification in a binder and send copies to Jeff Hodge and Elizabeth 
Sager.  Once Jeff/Elizabeth have approved, to formalize the claim send a 
notice with a copy of our claim and demand for payment to PG&E under Article 
15 of the Master, with payment due on the next Business Day under Section 
12.4(iv).  US counsel under Elizabeth Sager's supervision should then pursue 
recovery through the bankruptcy proceedings, including by exercising any 
direct or affiliate set offs to other positions.

6.  JON/GREG:  If it has not been negotiated and documented before I leave, a 
replacement transaction for the 75MM/day may have to be put in place with 
PG&E, hopefully under our paper (GTC) with whatever amendments (i.e. 
California law) are approved by Jeff Hodge.  We may have to use their paper 
(Master) if necessary and approved by Jeff Hodge to obtain the security 
interest in their receivables - in which case certain (not all) of the 
amendments to their paper that we have been requesting will need to be made.

Peter."

Elizabeth,

I decided this weekend that I would like to go to the conference if there is 
still room.  In addition to the educational benefits, BPA may be sending some 
folks, which would give you and I an additional opportunity to sell  them on 
the EEI in a more relaxed setting (perhaps over dinner?).  Do you have a list 
of conference attendees?    

Also, as you know, we are trying to get an EEI in place with WAPA.  Because 
of the PG&E bankruptcy, WAPA and its customers cannot count on PG&E 
deliveries, and are therefore looking to cover perhaps 500 MW.  However, 
there is a bottleneck in the WAPA organization that is preventing 
implementation of an EEI, and therefore preventing EPMI from getting the 
business.  It would be helpful to know if WAPA is sending anyone.     

Also, if many customers or potential customers are attending, Stewart Rosman 
and possibly other traders may be interested in going to develop business.  
(Stewart expressed his interest.)  What do you think about that idea?

Best,

Steve

I am interested in finding out who is attending the California session that 
you are speaking at.  If enough customers are going it might make sense to 
send someone from middle market to help cover those guys.  Do you think that 
is wise?  I am aware that City of Riverside is sending someone.

Subject: 

In light of the transition of the risk books to ENA, I need your input on 
whether we (EES) should continue to pursue our own master contracts with new 
trading partners.  In certain instances, ENA already has a master in place 
with the counterparty or in other instances (TransCanada Energy Marketing 
USA, Inc. & Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation), ENA Legal is currently 
negotiating a separate master with the counterparty.

The Gas Desk is pressing hard for a number of new masters with additional 
counterparties.  While we are set up to handle their requests, in light of 
the organization changes, it seems this may be unnecessary.  Even where ENA 
does not currently have or is not currently negotiating a master, they may 
prefer that the document be handled by ENA legal and avoid having to assign 
the master to them at a later date.    I would like to have your thoughts 
before I commit resources to handle these requests.

If you prefer that we continue to pursue these new master, we have the 
resources available to proceed.

 Jim

Please let me know as soon as possible if you are aware of any such contracts 
as described below by Sharon Butcher.

""The U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting has 
advised that on May 25, 2001, they will evaluate Enron's subcontracting 
program and compliance on any subcontracting plans in effect on current 
contracts.

This review will cover the last five (5) years.  All Forms 294 and 295 filed 
with the Small Business Adminstration along with the names of each 
Administrative Contracting Officer (U.S. Government employee responsible for 
monitoring the contract) for each contract will be subject to the review.

In addition, total subcontract placement with small businesses, small 
disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and HubZone small 
businesses shall be reviewed.  Further, the amount of indirect or overhead 
costs, if any, apportioned to contract goals is subject to review.

We will also need information on the number of active suppliers Enron is 
currently using in the following categories:  large business, small business, 
small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and HubZone 
business.  The review will cover these figures for one year ago if available.""

Calling brokers to find out what prices would have been is an impossible 
task.  I agree with your assessment.  Unfortunately, caps are not disruptions 
but have become a normal course of business.

Subject: Index Transactions

EPMI is entering into more and more transactions that are settled against a 
floating, published index price.  Our physical contract does not currently 
provide for what happens if the published source is not available or is 
otherwise materially changed. Under ISDA for financial trading,  this is 
addressed as a Market Disruption Event (MDE).  Under ENA's standard contract 
for financial trading, there is included as a MDE ""the imposition of trading 
limits on the range within which the price of the commodity may fluctuate"".  
What this may mean is that if a cap is imposed on power prices, then in lieu 
of using the capped price to determine the floating price, you would be 
required (under ISDA) to eventually get brokers to determine what the price 
would have been without the cap.

I want to add language to our physical contracts that addresses material 
changes/disappearance of the published prices that would mirror the financial 
trading terms and doubt whether we would want to make the imposition of a cap 
on power prices a MDE.  If you treat the imposition of a cap (say in CA of 
prices to $500 or in NEPOOL to $1,000) as a MDE, then we would be required to 
secure quotes as to what the price would have been without the cap each time 
that a pricing date trades at the cap level.   This only seems fraught with 
litigation risk to me.  Alternatively, if caps are not deemed a MDE, then you 
would always settle against the published prices, even if they are 
""artificially"" determined after the trade was entered into.  While caps are 
not appealing, I think it would be better to not have the imposition of caps 
be considered a MDE.  I have spoken with the financial trading group and they 
will follow our lead on this.  So, depending upon what you both think, we 
will make sure that financial and physical power are treated the same on this 
issue.  

Thanks for your thoughts.

Elizabeth/Christi

The following is an e-mail I recieved from Wabash with regard to them looking 
at risk associated with a ""Into"" product and their concern over the RTO 
forcing the designation of firm point resources.

I thought you would like to see this in conjunction with our last 
conversation.

Subject: Network Resource Requirements

Mr. Dalton,

As we have discussed, the control area operators we coordinate with in the
NIPSCo, AEP, IPL, and Cinergy areas are increasingly concerned about the
reliability of transmission and its dependence on expected power flows from
source to sink.  Much of this concern comes from incremental reliability
requirements being developed by ECAR and NERC, along with potentially
substantial fines for failure to comply.  In order for Wabash Valley to
obtain Network Transmission service we must have firm resources that can be
qualified as designated network resources.

We received a document from a control-area operator that defines their
criteria for network resources.  These criteria are defined as follows:

* Network resources do not include any generation that is committed
for sale to another party on a firm basis.

* For a  power purchase to qualify as a network resource it must be
available to the purchaser on a non-interruptible basis.  Power purchases
that can be interrupted by the seller for reliability reasons qualify as
network resources.  This includes power sales that are provided with a
curtailment priority below that of the seller's native load.  Purchased
power that can be interrupted by the seller for economic reasons does not
qualify as a network resource, but purchases that can be interrupted for
extreme economic penalties other than more economic sale or purchase
opportunities qualify as network resources.

* For a power purchase to qualify as a network resource, the purchaser
must have an obligation to take the power.  The obligation to purchase does
not need to be in the form of a capacity payment.  However, if there is no
capacity payment, the contract should include a minimum take obligation.
The Commission does not require an around-the-clock purchase obligation; it
has approved as a network resource a power purchase with a minimum capacity
factor of 80% during on-peak hours and no minimum take in off-peak hours.
How much lower a capacity factor the Commission would permit is not clear.

* The requirement that a network resource be non-interruptible applies
to the transmission service as well as the power supply itself.  Therefore,
a network customer that designates an off-system resource as a network
resource must obtain firm transmission service for the generator to the
system of the network transmission provider.  If transmission from the
generator to the network transmission provider is non-firm transmission
service, the power purchase does not qualify as a network resource.
However, the requirement of firm transmission service does not apply to any
generator that was serving the load on July 9, 1996, because such generation
is grandfathered by Order No. 888.

It may be that your organization can meet these criteria with documentation
of resources and transmission path agreements, so as to not require any
additional ""firmness"" of the power supply you have already proposed to us.
Please take a look, and contact me with any further information you can
provide.

Let me know, also, if you need any else from me.

We are fine with Nolan's changes.

Please note one additional change: Exhibit B, Item 1, the ""Confirmation
Number"" should be corrected to read 403862.

To complete this transaction, the following needs to happen:

1.Enron needs to sign off on our's and Avista's changes and add the correct
references in the second to last ""WHEREAS"".

2.Enron and PGET (Dan Sarti) need to finalize the Enron payment amount under
Section 7.

3.PGET (Dan Sarti) needs to provide our wiring instructions for Section 7.

4.Avista needs to provide its wiring instructions for Section 8.

I will be checking voice mails and, later this afternoon, will check
e-mails, should you have any questions.

We have received a copy of PG&E's comments.  For the most part, we accept
the language.  Only two small modifications:

Change #1: Page 2....second full paragraph.  Replace the word ""refund"" with
""return.""

Change #2: Page 6...last paragraph.  After PGET's wording (which is okay
with us), insert the following: ""The return of AVISTA Collateral by PGET to
AVISTA shall be deemed to be a condition precedent to the consent of AVISTA
herein.""


Other than that....we're okay with all other language.  I'd be interested in
seeing Enron's comments to PGET's version, as well as this revised version
by Avista.

Ed:
I've reviewed these agreements, dated January, 2000 between Southern Company 
Services, Inc. (""SCS"") and each of:  Alabama Power Company, Gulf Power 
Company, Savannah Electric and Power Company, George Power Company, and 
Mississippi Power Company (each, a ""Client Company"").
The agreements are identical.
The agreements are effective until terminated by either party upon written 
notice to the other party.
The agreements contain an obvious blank that was not filled in, but would 
have designated the state's laws that should govern the agreement
The agreements clearly authorize SCS to act for each company to purchase and 
sell electric power for resale and engage in derivative transactions, 
including negotiating executing, performing,  and administering agreements to 
do so, with no limits on the types or duration of such transactions.
The agreements clearly state that SCS has no liability under any such 
agreement, and only each Client Company will be liable under any such 
agreement, whether or not SCS's role as agent is disclosed to the other party 
to such an agreement.  
Based on this review, and since we are still informed that SCS will not 
allocate any trade at the time of the trade, you may wish to authorize 
trading w/ SCS, but only to the extent of the credit of the weakest Client 
Company (assuming that EPMI's maximum exposure is always to the weakest of 
the group).
Please let me know if you need any further input from legal.

Janice

As I believe I have discussed with each of you, Calpine has refused to
produce contract summaries for contracts outside of ERCOT. Its stated bases
are: 1. Enron limited its requests to ERCOT (not true); and 2. customs vary
depending upon the NERC region.

Elizabeth, I would like to prepare an affidavit for you which tracks
paragraph 12 of draft 4 of your affidavit which was faxed to you yesterday
and which adds a sentence which says something to the effect of: ""This
custom and practice of providing a parent guarantee as described above did
not vary depending upon the particular National Electric Reliability Council
(""NERC"") region involved in the contract.""

Please let me know whether this addition presents a problem. I will need to
file our motion to compel on Monday. Bill Ogden and I will be meeting with
Bonnie and Bill Bradford at 1:30 and can coordinate the execution of
Elizabeth's affidavit while we are in the building. I look forward to
hearing from you. Laura Gibson"

Attached are some initial thoughts for discussion on our call.Your views are
appreciated.

Panel 1

WSPP and EEI
At this point, I have seen materials from Bobby Campo. Andy has circulated
to all. Bobby's presentation gives the background and evolution of the WSPP
tariff/agreement. Bobby also provides his conclusions regarding the future
of WSPP.
Since we have seem Bobby's presentation, how should we structure the
remainder of our presentation?

Mike -- Since Bobby is giving a business flavor to the presentation, it may
make sense for you to focus more on legal and regulatory elements. For
example: what is WSPP's current regulatory status? How does that affect its
use? How is it administered/modified etc?.What material changes have
occurred to its terms over time? Where do you see it going?

Liz/Harlan-- How do think you should approach this topic?.It seems to me
that one obvious issue is the distinction between the a tariff based doc and
a standardized bilateral agreement. Regional vs. nationwide also seems
appropriate  Further, I think a discussion of the evolution of the EEI
agreement and some of the reasons for its development would be useful.  For
example, the lack of common bilateral credit provisions and product
definitions in 1998-99.A discussion of documents like ISDA and other master
trading agreements for physicals would also be useful. In addition, since
Dynegy and Enron are major players, your firms perspective on trading
documentation would be helpfull.Does EEI provide appropriate flexibility for
use in varied markets?[[Bobby- can you speak for Mirant here- as you know,
Mirant was an important contributor to the EEI contract].What document does
Enron on-line use? Finally, I think Liz's pitch for the Master-Master may
make sense in this context.

Finally, I think we should leave some time for questions; to comment on one
another's presenations;and , to provide some real world trading issues we
have run into if appropriate.

Panel 2

Let's make a deal

There is a lot packed into this panel and I'm told many of our audience are
not that sophisticated. I think we should approach this as a primer.I will
volunteer to do thevfirst few slides and generally set up the context for
contract specific discussions. How about Dede doing ""set up""-- i.e.
negotiating the cover sheet/elections and optional provisions-- Liz doing
trading mechanics /oral transactions/confirmations/ and(her favorite) ""into""
and Fritz doing all other products.  We can all chime in.


Panel 3


Some of this panel will carry over from the previous panel. For this one,
how about Andy doing the obligations to deliver/receive under the contract
slide with Harlan describing some real world issues her has seem with
delivery points or transmission.Harlan can then do the liquidated damages
and force majeure slides (setting things up in theory). Fritz can bat
clean-up with run through of the examples. Of course, we can all chime in. "

Hi, Liz.  Thank you for the call yesterday.  I am sorry I did not call
back.  I had Andrew till mid-afternoon and had planned to go over to Chi's,
but she went to Dege's uncle's.  Chi and I talked in the afternoon and she
was very sad.  I was pretty lonely myself.

About the car--I went around to different dealerships on Saturday and
couldn't get a clear offer of more than $2000 for it in a trade.  The
temporary tag expires this week, so  I imagine I (or Chi if she wants to)
will have to register it in Maryland to keep it or sell it.  It has a
couple of significant problems that would be clear to a buyer--one rear
window is broken and stuck in the fully open position, and the driver's
seat can not be moved backward.  If both were fixed, (both involve, at
least in part, electric motors--$500??) I think it might sell out of the
newspaper for about $4500.  I will discuss it with Chi.

Do you have any sense as to how long it will take you to complete settling
Mom's estate?  That definitely enters into my thinking about a new car.   I
had mentioned the possibility to you of wanting a loan in April or May--I
think I have managed to postpone my anticipated debt from legal expenses
until December."

By agreeing to pay only for ""reasonable"" offers, DWR left itself a loophole 
big enough to drive a truck through:

""DWR will assume financial responsibility for
all purchases by the ISO in its ancillary services and imbalance energy
markets based bids or other offers determined to be reasonable. Such
determination of reasonableness will be made by DWR on a case by case basis
and communicated to the ISO.""  (Emphasis added.)

Market Notice re Credit Issues

In response to the FERC order of April 6, 2001 re the issue of
creditworthiness, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has
authorized the ISO to make the following statement. To the extent (and only
to the extent) that a purchase is not otherwise paid by any party or payable
by another party meeting the credit standards set forth in the ISO Tariff
(another ""Qualified Party""), DWR will assume financial responsibility for
all purchases by the ISO in its ancillary services and imbalance energy
markets based on bids or other offers determined to be reasonable. Such
determination of reasonableness will be made by DWR on a case by case basis
and communicated to the ISO.  All bids into the ancillary services and
imbalance energy markets will be deemed to be contingent on the acceptance
of financial responsibility by DWR, to the extent not paid or payable by
another Qualified Party.  Unless a supplier is otherwise notified, any bid
accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial support of another
Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this notice.  In addition to the
foregoing, DWR will assume financial responsibility for all purchases
resulting from the issuance by the ISO of emergency dispatch instructions,
to the extent not paid or payable by another Qualified Party.  Payment for
such purchases shall be made according to the rate specified in the ISO
Tariff for emergency dispatch instructions.  The ISO and/or DWR reserve the
right to rescind or modify the foregoing arrangements at any time and for
any reason, including a successful rehearing or appeal from the April 6
order.

As the FERC determined in its February 14 order that DWR is a creditworthy
counterparty, the ISO believes that the foregoing arrangements meet the
requirements of FERC's April 6 Order. Accordingly, the ISO expects that
suppliers will honor their obligations under the ISO Tariff and related
agreements to respond to ISO dispatch instructions.

		 Subject: FW: footnnote each item under Exhibit B



REGARDING THE SETTLEMENT, ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT

Tracy Ngo correctly pointed out volumetric ambiguities on the two original
confirmations between Avista Energy and PG&E Energy Trading.

Let me summarize below:

(1) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 404335 showed Total Volume
of 982,400 MWh's.  PG&E revised the Total Volume to 981,600 MWh.  Avista did
not respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.  Our records show
that the original volume of 982,400 is correct (there was a leap-year day in
year 2000).  The broker confirm and the PG&E revision seem to be both in
error.  Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy and
Enron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh's.  Since this
Assignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommends
language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email from
Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&E and
Enron? Please advise.

(2) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 403862 showed a Total
Volume of 14,400.  PG&E accepted the confirm ""as is.""  The broker
confirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh's.  Therefore, both
PG&E and AVISTA screwed up.  HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh's
should correctly be as per the broker confirmation.  Again, our counsel
recommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see
email from Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to
PG&E and Enron?  Please advise.


To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enron
and Avista.  Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron's
confirm's prevail).  Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.  We
would like to see those confirms in advance if possible.

Lastly, time is of the essense.  We are scheduling power already for January
deliveries....therefore, we must act quickly on this assignment so as to
prevent any problems with scheduling, etc.  I suppose that we could delay
the start dates to February 1st, 2001 if necessary.  Perhaps not a big
issue.

Thanks,
Nolan Steiner

Very interesting.  We are coming to an inevitable point.  The industry wants 
a standard agreement.  Agreement is expressed in the singular.  There cannot 
be two standard agreements, it defeats the whole idea of set off  and 
consistency.  I see the Newport session as perhaps akin to Fort Sumter 
itself.  Somebody has got to step up to the big public plate and fire a 
massive broadside at the WSPP and get it started.  Only one can survive.  Or, 
I can hear that weazely politician saying,  ""why can't we have a ""western

Andy,

We still have some internal work to do before we can say whether there is
any chance BPA will use the EEI contract in the future.  Personally, I think
this depends largely on what the prevailing industry trading arrangements
are, and that seems to be the WSPP agreement right now.  But our eyes and
ears are open.  I will be attending the conference and expect it to be very
informative.  Thanks for sending out the brochure.

Gerit Hull

Here's the final conference brochure.  The last panel of the day has a
comparison of the EEI and the WSPP and what the future holds for each.  If
you were inclined, having your thoughts on which agreement the BPA would
likely embrace in the future would be helpful.  If you speak, you get to
attend the entire conference for free.  Also, please feel free to pass the
brochure on to any counterparties in the west that you think would benefit.
FYI, if there is enough interest we can try to arrange getting additional
rooms at the Four Seasons at the conference rate.  If that is not an option,
there is a Mariott that we have a national account w/ that is only 5 minutes
from the Four Seasons.  If we get enough overflow we will guarantee the
Mariott a block of rooms to get a discount rate.  I

I don't have a final brochure on this, but here is a draft.  I've also
attached my law review article on the EEI Contract.  I can't recall if I
gave you  one at the WSPP meeting in S.F.  Hope all is going well.  If BPA
would like me to do a separate presentation on the EEI Contract, I can
arrange that as well.

REGARDING THE SETTLEMENT, ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT

Tracy Ngo correctly pointed out volumetric ambiguities on the two original
confirmations between Avista Energy and PG&E Energy Trading.

Let me summarize below:

(1) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 404335 showed Total Volume
of 982,400 MWh's.  PG&E revised the Total Volume to 981,600 MWh.  Avista did
not respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.  Our records show
that the original volume of 982,400 is correct (there was a leap-year day in
year 2000).  The broker confirm and the PG&E revision seem to be both in
error.  Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy and
Enron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh's.  Since this
Assignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommends
language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email from
Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&E and
Enron? Please advise.

(2) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 403862 showed a Total
Volume of 14,400.  PG&E accepted the confirm ""as is.""  The broker
confirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh's.  Therefore, both
PG&E and AVISTA screwed up.  HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh's
should correctly be as per the broker confirmation.  Again, our counsel
recommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see
email from Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to
PG&E and Enron?  Please advise.


To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enron
and Avista.  Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron's
confirm's prevail).  Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.  We
would like to see those confirms in advance if possible.

Lastly, time is of the essense.  We are scheduling power already for January
deliveries....therefore, we must act quickly on this assignment so as to
prevent any problems with scheduling, etc.  I suppose that we could delay
the start dates to February 1st, 2001 if necessary.  Perhaps not a big
issue.

If PG&E's LOCs are related to the now cancelled long term power trades, they 
clearly should not be renewed. What are the SCE LOCs for?

I spoke with Richard and we will have to renew.  He is currently trying to 
get the PX bankruptcy court to allow us  to take back our security in light 
of the FERC ruling re chargebacks, but due to uncertainty of the FERC ruling, 
court has not been willing to allow us to remove. Richard continues on the 
case.  In the meanwhile, the PX/bankruptcy court will not allow the LC's to 
expire without drawing down.  So we should go ahead and renew.

Rogers wanted the confirms out by 9:00 this morning.  Otherwise, can we get

Shari Stack had agreed to confirm non-firm deals with Entergy Services under

term deals.  Well, now we have two options that they want to confirm under 
the WSPP.  We do not have any other existing agreement with Entergy 
Services.  I have dropped in the language Shari prepared for the month long 
deal.  Can someone take a look at these and see if this will confirm the deal.

George,
We have been watching this ""border state"" very closely to see where they are 
going to go and it looks like we need to shore up our proactive mitigation 
maneuverings.  The muttering is getting to a pretty bitter level up there 
across the Columbia. You'd better take a ride up that way and have a look.

FYI

Seattle City Utility Racks Up $92 Million in Power Purchases in March
Jim Brunner , The Seattle Times

( April 17, 2001 )



Apr. 16--Seattle City Light spent a record $92 million buying power on the 
market in March, more than any month in its 91-year history.

City Light officials say the cost of buying power for local residents and 
businesses eclipsed the previous records -- $84 million set in February and 
nearly $80 million in January.

To put that in perspective: In 1999, before the current power crisis, the 
utility's total power bill for the entire year was $90 million. ""We're 
spending that every month now. The dollars that are involved are staggering,"" 
said Paula Green, deputy superintendent of City Light.

It's a cash hemorrhage brought on by Washington's drought, which means less 
water in the reservoirs at city-owned dams. That increases Seattle's need to 
purchase electricity on a market where prices have zoomed to unprecedented 
levels.

Adding to the frustration for Seattle city officials is the fact that most of 
that money is flowing to out-of-state utilities and power brokers who are 
profiting enormously from the energy crunch.

Last month alone, the bill from Enron, a Houston-based corporation, was $25.5 
million, putting it well ahead of the No. 2 seller, California's Sempra 
Energy, which sold $7.4 million worth of electricity to City Light.

City Light still gets most of the 1,200 megawatts necessary to serve its load 
from city-owned dams and from its contract with the Bonneville Power 
Administration (BPA). The utility buys only about 15 percent of its power on 
the market. But that thin slice now accounts for more than 90 percent of its 
power costs.

Part of the explanation for March's record power-buying binge was City 
Light's recent decision to store up extra water behind Ross Dam on the Skagit 
River instead of spilling it through the dam's power turbines.

In a normal water year, City Light officials would be spilling water for 
energy and expecting it would be replaced with spring runoff. Now, they're 
saving the water so it can be spilled later to help salmon runs and to 
generate power for Seattle this summer, when energy prices are expected to 
surge even higher, to more than $400 per megawatt hour.

""We're insulating ourselves. By putting out one eye now, we're avoiding 
cutting off our head later,"" said Bob Royer, City Light spokesman.

Seattle ratepayers are feeling the pain, with a 28 percent City Light rate 
increase so far this year. More rate increases are likely on the way.

Higher rates have also led to plant closures and layoffs in Bellingham and 
Spokane.

Meanwhile, Enron's revenues more than doubled last year, to $101 billion. Its 
stock prices surged to end the year at $88 a share, up from $44 the year 
before. The stock was trading at $57 a share last week.

""It doesn't just feel unfair, but immoral that these major companies like 
Enron are making billions of dollars at the expense of everyday people and 
businesses,"" said City Councilwoman Heidi Wills, who chairs the Council's 
Energy and Environmental Policy Committee.

""There's this enormous transfer of wealth from our ratepayers to the 
shareholders of these companies,"" Wills said.

Northwest leaders have called for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to 
impose price caps. But opponents say price caps would do nothing to encourage 
the construction of new power plants, or energy conservation.

Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman, said it's unfair to fault the company for 
selling power at prices dictated by the free market. ""Enron is providing 
electricity to a market that needs it,"" Denne said. ""It's unfortunate when 
regulators are pointing fingers, looking to fix blame, when this is a problem 
of supply and demand.""

The company hails from President George W. Bush's home state of Texas, and is 
one of the top ""soft money"" donors to political campaigns. Enron and its 
executives gave $435,000 to the Democrats and $1.2 million to Republicans 
last year, according to Common Cause.


Its chairman, Kenneth Lay, has consistently been one of the top donors to 
Bush's presidential and gubernatorial campaigns.

Enron doesn't own a lot of dams or power plants. Instead, the company makes 
money as a middleman -- buying power from utilities and then reselling it for 
a profit. The company, formed in 1985 from the merger of two pipeline 
companies, has become the largest trader of wholesale electricity in North 
America.

Part of its success in the energy market stems from its groundbreaking use of 
the Internet to make buying electricity as easy as ordering a book online. 
You just point, click and spend.

""It's easier than Amazon,"" said Steve Lewis, a power marketer with City 
Light, demonstrating the company's Web site. It lists available power 
""products"" and the asking price for both buyers and sellers.

Lewis and other power marketers monitor City Light's projected power needs 
and then use the phone or Internet to schedule electricity for the next hour, 
next day or months ahead. They try to find the best price available, but it's 
clearly a sellers' market.

Utilities routinely buy power that used to cost $30 per megawatt hour for 
more than $200. At times last month, City Light was buying power for $450 a 
megawatt hour. And it's not because the cost of generation has gone up.

""This is pure profit,"" said Green, deputy superintendent of City Light.

There is evidence that the Northwest is in some ways being hit even harder 
than California, whose experiment with deregulation is blamed for roiling the 
power markets. A recent analysis found that Pacific Northwest utilities are 
paying the highest prices in the nation for the next-day delivery of 
wholesale power.

However, regional utilities also sell power for extraordinarily high prices. 
In fact, some of the highest average prices paid by City Light last month 
were to neighbors.

Puget Sound Energy, Western Washington's largest electric utility, charged 
City Light the highest average price of any seller last month, at $303 per 
megawatt hour, according to City Light's preliminary billing estimates. 
Spokane's Avista Energy charged $281.

That compares with Enron's average price of $173 per megawatt hour and an 
overall average of $194.

The BPA, by comparison, charges City Light $22 per megawatt hour.

City Light typically relies on local utilities more when it needs power 
delivered immediately. And prices for short-term deals can be higher 
depending on the time of day. The city has only a long-term contract with the 
BPA.
D
 espite the record-setting month, city officials hope they'll be in better 
shape before the year is out. Mayor Paul Schell has taken to calling Oct. 1 
Seattle's ""energy independence day"" because that's when the city will begin 
receiving more hydroelectric power under a new contract with the BPA.

The historically cheap BPA power, combined with a contract with a gas-fired 
power plant in Klamath Falls, Ore., should reduce the city's reliance on the 
open market, city officials say.

But the BPA, too, has been stricken by higher market power costs and may have 
to increase its rates to City Light by 250 percent. The City Council has 
already agreed to pass those higher costs on to Seattle ratepayers although 
it's unclear how much that would raise the bill of the average person.

Even at a higher rate, City Light officials regard the BPA power as a good 
long-term strategy for getting power costs under control. If they succeed, 
the rate increases approved this year could eventually be rescinded.

Until then, local ratepayers will have to keep writing bigger checks to City 
Light with the knowledge that some of their money will find its way to Texas.

As some of you may have seen through the e-mail system, Enron Corp. has begun 
a payables and procurement initiative under the name ""iBuyit.""  The 
initiative involves the implementation of an on-line procurement and payables 
system, the central focus of which will be to enable Enron to better track 
vendor expenses and overall costs. 

The implementation of the payables portion of the system will occur on May 1, 
2001 and will be applicable to all organizations supported by Houston-based 
Accounts Payable processing centers (e.g., our Legal Department).  I have 
been asked to be the stakeholder for this project for the Department and have 
been working with Dina Snow and Carolyn George (as the Department change 
agents) to get up to speed on this program and its impact.

Given that this program will present a marked changed in the manner in which 
we will be coding, reviewing and approving invoices for payment, it is 
important that each of you have an overview understanding of the system and 
how it will function.  This, in turn, will aid you in determining the best 
process to be implemented within your particular group for use of the 
system.  To assist in this general understanding, the iBuyit group prepared a 
system demonstration running through the functionality of the system and 
answering some general questions as to its use.  I believe it provides an 
appropriate overview and have provided the below link to the demonstration 
location:

http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/iBuyitPayablesPresentation.ppt

Mark has asked that I speak on this program a bit at the upcoming OGC meeting 
(Monday, 4/23) and answer any questions you may have.  In the interim, if 
there are any questions about the program or the system's functionality, 
please do not hesitate to call me.

I have asked my asst, Twanda Sweet, to set up a conf. call on this for 
Friday. Jim is right--we need to be prepared for anything. Bill- I heard 
today that PG&E has sent us a letter or otherwise communicated to us that 
they are looking for a letter from us on valuation and are going to challenge 
our setoffs. Any news?

I don't want to make a pest of myself, but I'm curious as to how the process 
of closing out the terminated contracts is coming.  In particular has Enron 
completed the process of obtaining quotes so that the amount of the 
Termination Payments is set.  I'm concerned that PG&E would be more likely to 
hit the LC's once the amounts have been set.  We'll be ready to file 
something if they try that, but I'd like a heads up so that we know the 
possibility is out there.

After you and I talked, we did these confirms and faxed them out.  As for a 
meeting to discuss the agency issues (and, secondarily, the EEI Master), I'm 
asking Keegan Farrell to coordinate the schedules of the following people and 
set up a meeting w/ Entergy.  In light of my future plans, it's not necessary 
for me to be there.
Here are the Enron people (Keegan: get some dates/times when all of these 
people can meet):
Elizabeth Sager
Rogers Herndon
Ed Sacks

The Entergy name(s) should come from Rogers. (Keegan: After you get the Enron 
people's schedules, if you haven't heard from Rogers, call him for the 
Entergy contacts, then call them and coordinate the meeting.)

This is another one of those agencies that we have no documentation 
evidencing the ""authority"" to transact on behalf of the utilities.  EPMI 
continues to trade a significant volume of trades in both the term and daily 
mkt.  Given that the option premium is prepaid, we should not hold the 
confirm up.  We do however need to arrange a time to meet with the 
counterparty to get everything resolved.  Rogers has mentioned in the past he 
is available and will arrange a conference call.  My calendar is open, so 
please let me know which atty we should be coordinating this through.

Janice, can you look at it as soon as you get off the conference call.  
Rogers wanted the confirms out by 9:00 this morning.  Otherwise, can we get 
Elizabeth to look at it.  Sharen dropped the language into the confirm that 
Shari had drafted for the previous deals with Entergy confirmed under the 
WSPP.  We have used this language in the past with the only difference being 
these are options.

Shari Stack had agreed to confirm non-firm deals with Entergy Services under 
the WSPP.  Then she reluctantly agreed to use the WSPP for a few month long 
term deals.  Well, now we have two options that they want to confirm under 
the WSPP.  We do not have any other existing agreement with Entergy 
Services.  I have dropped in the language Shari prepared for the month long 
deal.  Can someone take a look at these and see if this will confirm the deal.

Thanks!

Tracy,

Yesterday at the EEI conference I had lunch with Sierra Pacific's credit, 
risk, and power contracting folks.  Their credit person (Pamela Hirts) is new 
and was very interested in learning how to manage credit and risk through the 
EEI.  I think they might be receptive to negotiating an EEI with Enron.  If 
the bankruptcy rumors are true, we want to make sure that we have the EEI 
setoff language in place.

Stop by today and we can coordinate our efforts.

Steve

Rhonda,

Can you confirm for me the forms of confirmations that we have been using to 
confirm our physical power transactions with both Sierra Pacific Power and 
Nevada Power?  We do not have a ""golden"" master agreement, so I believe that 
the transactions are probably confirmed under the WSPP.

Given the bankruptcy noise for both utilities, I'd like to be able to get our 
arms around all of our documentation.  Please advise as to the timeliness on 
getting this information and if we need to pull legal/credit resources to 
assist or if you are not the point of contact on this matter.

Thanks,
Tracy

Attached are suggested changes to the Long Description to more closely align 
the Into product in the EEI with the EOL Into product.
 
The Force Majeure relief for this particular product has been clarified to 
ensure that Force Majeure relief is not available in the event that non-firm 
transmission is scheduled. 
 
If we add the EEI definition of Force Majeure, the applicability or otherwise 
to certain products would need to be set out in the Long Description. At this 
stage, since we are focusing on the Into product, I would propose that the 
GTCs remain the same, until we make the more widesweeping change to bring EOL 
in line with EEI.
 
When you are back lets meet to discuss how  best to take this forward.
 
As to the broader change to reflect the EEI, we will need to consider how to 
deal with the issues on the Cover Sheet. The credit terms are probably not 
something that we can achieve ""click"" approvals of just yet, however the 
changes we would like to see to the EEI could obviously be included as part 
of the ""click"" and accept concept on EOL.  I will be giving this further 
thought and will make some recommendations when I have had the opportunity to 
go through the documents and the issues which will need to be addressed.

 As a preliminary point, is it your understanding that, provided we display 
the  attribution to the copyright owners on the Website, we will not need to 
obtain any further licenses? This is not clear on the face of the document 
which does not envisage that the document will be displayed as part of a 
website's terms and conditions, capable of acceptance. Is there a licence I 
could have a look at, for example? I am concerned that the digital rights may 
still be retained by the copyright owners, however having regard to the 
tremendous exposure and endorsement the document would receive by being used 
on EOL, I would hope that any licenses, if required, could be concluded 
quickly and at no cost to EOL.
 
Regards,
 
Marcus

Davis is moving at warp speed on bonds, too.  (No doubt this is connected 
with the state being placed on credit watch.)




Calif Pwr Bond May Be Delayed Until Aug - Gov. Advisor 


Updated: Friday, April 20, 2001 03:29 PM?ET 


?




NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--California's planned issue of $12 billion to $14 
billion in revenue bonds to finance the state's cost of buying power could be 
delayed until August, an advisor to Gov. Gray Davis said Friday. 
The issue for now appears to be proceeding on schedule, but delays could come 
from regulatory appeals by California's utilities, which have objected to the 
details of plans to service the debt with revenue collected from their 
ratepayers, the advisor said. 








?

""We hope it will be done this summer,"" said the advisor. ""I think (the state 
treasurer) has said June. It might slip to July or August."" 
The advisor said the issue's timing is ultimately up to State Treasurer Phil 
Angelides. A formal timeline for the issue hasn't been set, but a 
spokesperson for the treasurer said Angelides' June target hasn't changed. 
""That is still our operating goal,"" the spokesperson said. ""We have not 
revised those or pushed those back because of the appeals."" 
The state plans to use the revenue from the bonds to stretch out its costs of 
buying power in lieu of California's hamstrung utilities and to repay the 
state's general fund for power already purchased. The state has spent $4.4 
billion in general fund money on power since mid-January, a number growing by 
more than $70 million a day. 
The general-fund outlays technically are loans that carry interest charges. 
Nevertheless, delays in the bond issue may bring increased pressure from 
those concerned about the state's exposure, the advisor said. 

California's Department of Water Resources, which is handling the state's 
power purchases, will need to cover 41% of the 192 million megawatt-hours 
expected to be consumed by the state's largest utilities in 2001, the advisor 
said. 
The DWR's long-term contracts cover just over a third of that total, leaving 
the department to buy 48 million megawatt-hours of electricty - 25% of the 
utilities' demand - in the spot market, the advisor said. 
Western power for delivery this summer is trading at $400/MWh to $500/MWh, 
and power for the fourth quarter is trading at $200/MWh to $300/MWh. 
The DWR's spot-market purchases will fall to 14% in 2002, according to the 
Davis team's projections, the advisor said. 
As reported, Angelides has said that with power prices at $250/MWh, the 
planned bond issue will only cover the state's power purchases through 
September. The details of the DWR's power contracts and revenue requirements, 
however, haven't been released. Davis' advisor said they point to a much 
lower cost of power, one that can be managed with a bond issue in the lower 
end of the $12 billion to $14 billion range and without higher rates. 
""We project the financing mechanism will actually be in surplus by 2003,"" the 
adviser said. ""We do have the tools to moderate this."" 
If prices rise to ""unreasonable levels,"" the state may opt to turn the lights 
out rather than pay them, the adviser said. 
""At some point, a decision will be made as a policy matter whether to pay the 
extra price or do a rolling blackout,"" he said. 
Outsiders are less optimistic than the state. Analysts continue to question 
the state's projections, and ratings agencies have put California's credit 
ratings on watch for a downgrade in light of the mounting power costs. 

Massive wholesale power costs have already crippled the state's two largest 
utilities, which haven't been able to recover $14 billion from customers, 
whose rates are frozen. PG&E Corp. (PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy-law protection April 6, and Edison 
International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California Edison is insolvent. 
Last week, Southern California Edison and the DWR reached a memorandum of 
understanding under which the state would buy the utility's transmission 
lines and help it issue bonds to recover its uncollected power costs. 
The governor's negotiators plan to submit drafts of legislation need to 
implement the agreement to lawmakers next week. The drafts include 
authorization for the utilities to recover their power costs through bonds 
backed by a specified portion of their rates, authorization for the state to 
buy the utility's transmission lines and a variety of amendments to existing 
laws needed to facilitate the deal. 
""We will deliver the draft legislation to the Legislature early next week,"" 
one of the governor's legislative advisers said. 
The MOU requires the Legislature to act by Aug. 15, but Davis hopes to get 
the package through in four to six weeks. That may be optimistic. Republicans 
fiercely oppose the plan, as do a number of key Democrats who see it as a 
bailout. As reported, a number of lawmakers think ratepayers might be better 
off with Southern California Edison in bankruptcy. 
Davis met with lawmakers this week and is talking with the Senate leadershp 
to put together a small team to work through the bills, the legislative 
advisor said. The governor's negotiators are also in talks with lawmakers to 
add the measures to existing bills, namely a transmission-line buyout bill 
introduced months ago by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton and a broader 
bill introduced by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg. So far, however, the 
governor hasn't found a backer. 
""We are having discussions, but we haven't identified the vehicle or the 
authors at this point,"" the legislative advisor said. 
Lawmakers have said the terms of the state's agreement with Southern 
California Edison will have to be altered, raising another roadblook for the 
deal. As reported, Edison has said the agreement must pass ""as is,"" although 
the governor has expressed a willingness to negotiate. 
The governor's adviser said Friday any changes would have to maintain the 
balance of interests struck in the MOU. 
""If the Legislature wants to improve on it, it must keep that balance,"" he 
said. ""(The governor) doesn't want the balance to be tipped in either 
direction."" 
The governor's negotiators began discussions Monday with Sempra Energy (SRE, 
news, msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric for a similar deal, but had nothing 
to report. 
The parties were to meet again Friday and next week, and the governor hoped 
to reach agreement in the ""next several weeks,"" the advisor said.

	LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Edison International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern 
California Edison will go into bankruptcy if state legislators don't approve 
a deal for the state to buy the company's transmission lines, an Edison 
executive told reporters Friday. 
	""It's the agreement or bankruptcy. Legislators need to understand the 
consequences of having no agreement,"" said Bob Foster, SoCal Ed's senior vice 
president of external affairs. ""We've had almost a year of instability and 
chaos, and having 2-3 more years of uncertainty isn't the way to handle 
public policy.""

	It wasn't immediately clear if Foster meant SoCal Ed would declare 
bankruptcy, or if he thought the utility would be forced into bankruptcy by 
creditors if legislative approval of the deal falls through. 
	Gov. Gray Davis is having a tough time convincing legislators to accept the 
deal, which must have legislative backing in order to be implemented. 
	As previously reported, several key lawmakers have said the deal would need 
to be heavily amended before it could pass. 
	
	The terms of the deal, signed last week by Davis and Edison International 
Chief Executive John Bryson, call for the state to buy SoCal Ed's 12,000 
miles of transmission lines for $2.76 billion and to allow the utility to 
issue bonds backed by ratepayers so that it can recoup $5.5 billion in 
unrecovered power costs. 
	Davis told Senate Democrats Wednesday he would consider amending the 
agreement based on their input, and asked the lawmakers to appoint a special 
committee to work with his administration on possible revisions. 
	Foster said that while small changes may be acceptable, the meat of the 
agreement must not change. 
	""I'd be foolish to say you can't change a word, but the fact is that the 
essence of the agreement must stay the same. It's an integrated, balanced 
agreement and it must stay that way. If you pull something out, you need to 
add something in,"" Foster said. 
	The deal's ""essence"" ensures the utility will eventually become creditworthy 
again, Foster said. 
	As reported, some lawmakers have said ratepayers and taxpayers may be better 
off if SoCal Ed declares bankruptcy, especially now that PG&E Corp. (PCG, 
news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has sought bankruptcy-law 
protection and is no longer negotiating with the state. 
	""I still don't see how ratepayers could be any worse off with (SoCal Ed) in 
bankruptcy than they would with the governor's plan,"" State Sen. Debra Bowen, 
D-Redondo Beach, said Thursday. Bowen is chairwoman of the senate energy 
committee. 
	Bankruptcy would be worse than any perceived shortcomings in the SoCal Ed 
agreement, Foster said, and the utility will spend the next week trying to 
educate lawmakers on why that is so. One reason is that the state may need to 
purchase more ""net-short"" power to keep the lights on if the utility's 
contracts with small generators, or qualifying facilities, are rejected by a 
bankruptcy judge 
	""Twenty-seven percent of our customer demand is met by qualifying facility 
contracts. If those get rejected, the state's net-short expands from its 
current 32%...Also, our distribution systems are old and require a 
substantial amount of investment (to keep running). If we go into bankruptcy, 
there'll be no investment,"" Foster said. 
	
	Foster said he thought legislators' skepticism about the deal was partly due 
to lack of knowledge about its intricacies. 
	""I believe when members fully understand what this agreement is, they will 
understand it's decent and preferable to bankruptcy. The agreement is 38 
pages but it's packed and requires explanation...there are real benefits here 
for the state,"" Foster said. 
	Foster also said it wasn't yet clear whether the deal would require another 
rate hike on top of the 3-cent-kilowatt-hour increase passed by regulators 
last month. That's partly because regulators haven't yet determined how 
revenue from that rate hike will be divided between the utility and the 
state's Department of Water Resources for its power purchases. 
	""We need to understand how the present rates will be allocated, and that 
depends on what the DWR is going to need. Under some assumptions we will be 
able to fit the deal under current rates. If we can get qualifying facility 
costs to a manageable level and the DWR can clearly indicate what it needs in 
revenue going forward, it's possible,"" Foster said.

Great memo!

Just a couple of notes.

B 1 (b):  I think the master gas contract form includes Affiliates on 
non-defaulting party side--see end of Article 4.

If a Triggering Event occurs, the Notifying Party may (at its election) set 
off any or all amounts which the Affected Party owes to the Notifying Party 
or its Affiliates (under this Agreement or otherwise) against any or all 
amounts which the Notifying Party owes to the Affected Party (either under 
this Agreement or otherwise).

B 2 (f):  The analysis is based upon Enron default.  If counterparty default 
analysis is used, Enron benefits; and don't all contracts at least have all 
transactions terminating if bankruptcy is the triggering event?

		 Subject: Draft PG&E Letter



PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

Elizabeth:

Attached is draft of the termination payment letter with a few suggested 
changes, but nothing major.  I tried to include a blackline, but it seemed to 
get corrupted so I don't know if it will be of much use to you. A few notes:

(1)  I did not have the various contracts with me when I reviewed this, but I 
have asked Jim if he could make sure I did not make any inaccurate statements 
as well as input the few contract section references that are open and the 
information on the Canadian termination.  (However, I was not sure whether 
you wanted Peter Keohane to input the relevant information on the Canadian 
side.).

(2)  In light of PG&E's letter to us, I thought we may want to make some 
short statements about the affiliate set off rights under the Bankruptcy Code 
in the termination letter.

(3)  I modified some of the language on the CalPX liabilities.  I didn't have 
my exposure sheet with me, but I thought I recall that we were both owed 
money from the CalPX  and that we had some risk on the chargeback liability 
depending on how FERC ultimately comes out on the issue.  As you know, the 
FERC decision about 3 weeks ago prohibited the CalPX from proceeding with the 
chargeback ""under these circumstances"" or some type of language like this, 
but it seemed to have punted the final resolution of the issue until at least 
the commandeered contract valuation issue had been resolved--thus, although 
perhaps not likely, it seemed to me at the time that FERC gave itself an 
opening to reconsider the chargeback issue after the valuation determination 
had been made.

(4)  While I bracketed the language, I thought we may want to affirmatively 
and briefly set forth the business reason why EPMI is holding the direct 
access claim to at least give them something to think about.  As we have 
discussed, PG&E's likely reaction will be that we are using unsupportable 
self help to not pay them anything on the termination of the 3 power 
confirmations by claiming a set off for the negative CTCs.  To the extent we 
can articulate a short business rationale for EPMI having that claim, it may 
at least make them pause as to whether our business rationale arguably could 
prevail.

(5)  We note in the letter certain claims we have against PG&E that we are 
not setting off--e.g., the ISDA termination payment.  We also reference the 
claims held by EPMI through the CalPX, even though we are not ""terminating"" 
any ""contracts"" in that respect.  I assume that we do not want to reference 
in the letter the claims held by Portland General which ""route"" through the 
CalPX and the ISO, even though we are not claiming rights of offset for 
those.  PG&E will be put on notice of those when we put in Portland's claims 
as part of our proof of claim with the bankruptcy court.

 I'll plan on getting together with you to review this tomorrow afternoon.  
Lastly, I have not read the decision yet, but I saw that the DC Circuit 
upheld FERC in all respects in the PCA case so since our contracts do not 
have to be on file, they can be terminated without waiting for the 60 day 
period to expire.  That should reduce another potential challenge to the 
power contract termination.

Thanks.

John

Seems that Rogers isn't as keen on this meeting as credit and legal had 
thought.  This is what Keegan got back when she tried to set the meeting on 
his calendar.  It's not really going to help much for me to stay in the 
middle of this, but it seems pretty clear to me that Rogers has a different 
view of where this was left than than you guys had.  The most efficient thing 
might be a quick phone call from Elizabeth to Rogers -- which might get the 
whole thing back on track.

Keegan -

Thank you for forwarding this e-mail.  Please pass on that I do not need to 
meet on the agency issues relating to Entergy again.  I have done this 
several times and unfortunately, nothing is ever resolved.  If legal/credit 
would like to meet with Entergy, have them provide me with a list of specific 
issues and proposals, people from Entergy they would like to meet with and 
some proposed dates.  I will try to arrange the meeting with Entergy from 
there.

Thanks again,
Rogers

	BankruptcyDaschle Says Bankruptcy Reform Stuck 
As Party Roles in Conference Still in Limbo

Bankruptcy legislation (S. 420/H.R. 333) that separately passed the Senate 
and House earlier this spring remains in limbo, as the Senate still cannot 
agree on how to proceed to conference with the House, Senate Minority Leader 
Thomas Daschle (D-S.D.) told reporters April 23. 
The question of party representation in conference continues to stall efforts 
to bring the issue of bankruptcy reform to a close. Democrats, who occupy 
half of the Senate's seats, are insisting upon equal representation in 
conference, while Republicans oppose it. 
Efforts to forego a conference with the House are unlikely to succeed given 
House leadership concerns about a number of controversial amendments the 
Senate made to S. 420 before passing it. In particular, many Republicans 
object to provisions opposed by President Bush that are intended to make it 
harder for debtors to shield assets by purchasing expensive homes in states 
that bar creditors from seizing the homes in bankruptcy auctions. 
""There has been no resolution yet,"" Daschle said. ""I would say that I think 
both [Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.)] and I and our staffs are 
working to try to resolve his concern, which is what do you do in a tie ... 
You know, I think what happens in a tie is [that] you just keep talking until 
you break the tie."" 
Daschle said he is looking for an ""opportunity to break through,"" but has yet 
to find one. Regardless, Daschle said he does not think ""tie votes are all 
that big a problem, either in conference or in committee."" 
With Daschle voting in the affirmative, the Senate March 14 approved 80-19 a 
cloture motion Lott filed late March 12. Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), the 
bill's most outspoken opponent, argued passionately against cloture and Sen. 
Harry Reid (D-Nev.) foiled an attempt by Lott to secure unanimous consent to 
prepare the bill for a conference with House members after the bill passed 
the Senate March 15. 
In general, the bills aim to force more bankruptcy filers to file under 
Chapter 13, which requires some repayment of debts, instead of Chapter 7. The 
bills are a copy of last year's conference report worked out between the 
House and the Senate, which former President Clinton pocket-vetoed in 
December.

I am working with Sarah to put into place an LC reimbursement facility which, 
among other things, will allow for the placement of lcs to support trading 
activities. I wanted to find out what requirements you were faced with in 
placing lcs -- prescribed forms of the lcs and timing in particular (i.e., 
how much time is available after demand for Enron to place the lc, and 
whether physical delivery was required to meet such request, as well as how 
business days was defined in your respective documents). As with all things 
Enron, time is of the essence. Thanks, JNE"

REGARDING THE SETTLEMENT, ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT

Tracy Ngo correctly pointed out volumetric ambiguities on the two original
confirmations between Avista Energy and PG&E Energy Trading.

Let me summarize below:

(1) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 404335 showed Total Volume
of 982,400 MWh's.  PG&E revised the Total Volume to 981,600 MWh.  Avista did
not respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.  Our records show
that the original volume of 982,400 is correct (there was a leap-year day in
year 2000).  The broker confirm and the PG&E revision seem to be both in
error.  Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy and
Enron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh's.  Since this
Assignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommends
language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email from
Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&E and
Enron? Please advise.

(2) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 403862 showed a Total
Volume of 14,400.  PG&E accepted the confirm ""as is.""  The broker
confirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh's.  Therefore, both
PG&E and AVISTA screwed up.  HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh's
should correctly be as per the broker confirmation.  Again, our counsel
recommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see
email from Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to
PG&E and Enron?  Please advise.


To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enron
and Avista.  Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron's
confirm's prevail).  Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.  We
would like to see those confirms in advance if possible.

Lastly, time is of the essense.  We are scheduling power already for January
deliveries....therefore, we must act quickly on this assignment so as to
prevent any problems with scheduling, etc.  I suppose that we could delay
the start dates to February 1st, 2001 if necessary.  Perhaps not a big
issue.

Thanks,
Nolan Steiner

Attached is a resume from Les Adams, who is a friend of Bob Williams.  He saw 
the ad in the Texas Lawyer and contacted Bob about how to apply.  His resume 
does not indicate law school grades, but when I asked, he said he doesn't 
remember specifically since it has been 20 years, but that he seems to recall 
a B average, which was around top 20%.

Let me know if you want to talk with this applicant.

Dear Michelle: 

As we discussed, Bob Williams indicated that you would be willing to review  
my resume for the wholesale marketing position you are trying to fill. ?In 
my  
experience with The Coastal Corporation prior to the merger, I handled a 
very  
diverse range of marketing issues, from antitrust to collections, and have  
drafted marketing contracts for everything from coal to catalyst (and of  
course, oil and gas). 

I have attached a resume and cover letter. ?Please don't hesitate to call if  
I can provide you with any more information. 

Regards,  

Les Adams

This is still very much a work in progress, but this is where things stand 
tonight.  The Atlantic City Electric EEI Master was executed this afternoon 
(and the Enron Corp. guarantee is completely negotiated, too) so that we can 
actually get all signed up w/ a confirm if we win the 300MW bid on Friday, so 
it's no longer on the list.
Let me know if you'd like to discuss any of this.  I'm planning to leave all 
the files in my office when I go, and to update the power contracts database 
w/ comments about outstanding issues as one of the last things I do next week 
before I go.

text insert, which is subject to review and approval by Doug Gilbert-Smith

traders indicate.    

""Transmission Contingent.  If Seller is unable to secure the transmission 
required for this Transaction on a DC tie line across the ERCOT system border 
(""DC tie""),  or transmission on such DC tie is curtailed in a manner 
affecting Seller's delivery hereunder, then Seller at its election shall not 
be required to deliver the affected portion of the Energy and, in the event 
of that election by Seller, neither party shall be liable to the other 
hereunder for failure to deliver/receive such Energy."" 

I will be attempting to confirm this treatment with Doug and Clint today if 
possible,  and I or one of them will confirm that this text is to be inserted 
in pertinent confirmations."

We continue to receive a number of notices of motions, which my assistant has 
been sending to Jeff.  We have received a number more.  Should I continue to 
send to Jeff or to Richard or just discard them.  My concern is to ensure 
that we have notice of these proceedings and attend where appropriate.  If 
you are comfortable that you receive notice of proceedings affecting Enron 
generally, I would just discard what I receive here.  If it is possible that 
ECC is receiving notices in Calgary that are not going to Houston, I should 
fax them down to you as I receive them.

Subject: FW: footnnote each item under Exhibit B



REGARDING THE SETTLEMENT, ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT

Tracy Ngo correctly pointed out volumetric ambiguities on the two original
confirmations between Avista Energy and PG&E Energy Trading.

Let me summarize below:

(1) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 404335 showed Total Volume
of 982,400 MWh's.  PG&E revised the Total Volume to 981,600 MWh.  Avista did
not respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.  Our records show
that the original volume of 982,400 is correct (there was a leap-year day in
year 2000).  The broker confirm and the PG&E revision seem to be both in
error.  Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy and
Enron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh's.  Since this
Assignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommends
language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email from
Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&E and
Enron? Please advise.

(2) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 403862 showed a Total
Volume of 14,400.  PG&E accepted the confirm ""as is.""  The broker
confirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh's.  Therefore, both
PG&E and AVISTA screwed up.  HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh's
should correctly be as per the broker confirmation.  Again, our counsel
recommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see
email from Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to
PG&E and Enron?  Please advise.


To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enron
and Avista.  Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron's
confirm's prevail).  Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.  We
would like to see those confirms in advance if possible.

Lastly, time is of the essense.  We are scheduling power already for January
deliveries....therefore, we must act quickly on this assignment so as to
prevent any problems with scheduling, etc.  I suppose that we could delay
the start dates to February 1st, 2001 if necessary.  Perhaps not a big
issue.

Thanks,
Nolan Steiner

Elizabeth:

I agree that it's probably better not to attend the conference.  After our 
conversation I, too, concluded that it would be awkward---just too much 
explaining to do!

I had a great time at Whistler and in Vancouver, but I'm glad to be back.  
This week is going to be exciting.

Mark H. gave me a call re offices on Friday.  I will try to follow up with 
him today.

I hope all is well with you.

Best,

Hello, attached below is an example of a monthly option and a daily option.  
The only difference being one is exercised once a month and the other is 
exercised daily.  The times that options are exercised varies by delivery 
point and whether the option is daily or monthly.  We can send you a list of 
these rules if needed.



Let me know if you need anything else.

Based upon the additional information you have provided to me, I have revised 
our draft of EPMI's damages calculation.  Please review it ASAP, as I would 
like to be able to send it to our outside counsel this afternoon.  Also, 
there are a couple of blanks/question marks:  Doug, you indicated that you 
thought you could calculate our sales price per MWH for sales to LCRA during 
the months of June-September 2000 by getting an index price from your 
analyst.  Also, are we quoting natural gas prices in mcf or mmbtu?  Please 
call with your comments.  Thanks.

Chris, the simple fact, which we know from past experience and which OPG is 
missing, is that there is a large segment of counterparties who for various 
reasons (logistics/scheduling fixed-priced physical requirements for term 
with a with a marketer; corporate authorizations for physical transacting 
only; industrial culture; commercial sophistication; etc) will only want to 
transact physically.  To ignore this is to ignore a large segment of the 
market.  

If OPG wants out of the process I nonetheless urge you to continue as I am 
confident that once the market opens, or gets closer to opening, they will 
realize this.  If they want to compete fully in the trading business they 
will come back to what the industry is using for physical settlement, which 
is the EEI form you will have developed.

I also think that OPG is missing the point on physical settlement.  As we 
discussed the IMO is merely the pool settlement mechanism.  That does not 
mean that the underlying transaction cannot be a physical bilateral which 
allocates physical settlement risk as between the parties for physical 
delivery obligations (such as for failure to deliver; increased costs and 
prudential support for failure to deliver even where the IMO mechanism makes 
up the deficiency volume; force majeure; volume management; etc).

I think it can be said in all markets that in many cases the distinctions 
between physical and financial trading can be distinctions without a 
difference, but nonetheless there are some real distinctions and more 
importantly, even if there are no differences, certain counterparties will 
only want to deal in what they believe to be a physically settled product. 

So it seems you are close with the other counterparties, and I suggest you 
just march on with them if OPG does not want to participate further.

Peter."

 Pacific Gas & Electric Company
 77 Beale Street
 San Francisco, CA

 Attention: [                  and Lawrence C. Witalis]


      Re:  Contract Termination Payment Calculation Discussions

 Dear Sirs:

           As you know, pursuant to its rights under the Master Power
 Purchase Agreement between Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (""EPMI"") and
Pacific
 Gas & Electric Company (""PG&E) (collectively, the ""Parties""), dated
October
 9, 2000 (the ""MPA""), EPMI elected to terminate the 3 power
transactions
 thereunder as a result of the bankruptcy filing made by PG&E on
April 6,
 2001. Such notice of termination was delivered to PG&E on April 9,
2001.
 Additional contract terminations either became effective
automatically as a
 result of PG&E's bankruptcy filing under the terms of the particular
 contract or were elected by certain affiliates of EPMI, namely Enron
Canada
 Corp. (""ECC"") and Enron North America Corp. (""ENA""), as provided in
the
 relevant termination notices furnished by ECC and ENA to PG&E.
EPMI, ECC
 and ENA are referred to collectively herein, as appropriate, as
""Enron,""
 and the various contracts and/or transactions thereunder between
PG&E and
 Enron that were terminated are referred to as the ""Contracts.""

           Pursuant to such contract terminations, Enron provided
written
 notice to PG&E, as reflected in a letter dated April 24, 2001
(including
 all applicable supporting materials and calculations), of the
applicable
 termination payment calculations due and owing to Enron or PG&E, as
the
 case may be, under the Contracts.  Under each of the Contracts, once
the
 non-defaulting party, in this case Enron, furnishes the calculations
of the
 termination payments, the defaulting party, in this case PG&E, is
obligated
 to notify the non-defaulting party within a specified time frame
whether it
 disagrees with the non-defaulting party's termination value
calculations.
 For example, under Section 5.5 of the MPA, PG&E (as the defaulting
party
 due to its bankruptcy) is obligated to furnish EPMI within 2
business days
 of receipt of EPMI's calculations a detailed explanation of any
dispute it
 may have with Enron's termination payment calculations.  The other
 Contracts provide for different time periods by which the defaulting
party
 must respond to the non-defaulting party's calculations.

           At our meeting on April 25, 2001, we agreed to extend the
time
 period by which PG&E must provide notice to Enron of its dispute, if
any,
 with the termination calculations furnished by Enron under any of
the
 Contracts (a ""Dispute Notice"") in order to permit further
discussions
 between the Parties (the ""Settlement Discussions"") concerning (1)
the
 methodology and/or procedures employed by Enron to make such
calculations
 and the supporting material therefor and (2) a possible settlement
between
 the Parties with respect to the amount and nature of the Parties'
claims
 under the Contracts and the treatment thereof on an aggregate basis.
In
 order to provide the Parties with sufficient time to negotiate a
possible
 resolution, the date by which PG&E shall be required to furnish any
Dispute
 Notice shall be extended to [May 25, 2001] (the ""Initial Extension
 Period""), or such later date as may be agreed by the Parties,
including any
 extension as may be effective during the period that any settlement
 agreement that may be executed by the Parties in connection herewith
 (""Settlement Agreement"") may be under consideration by the
Bankruptcy
 Court.

           During the Initial Extension Period, Enron agrees to
maintain in
 full force and effect for the benefit of PG&E all five letters of
credit
 with respect to its obligations under the MPA (including the letters
of
 credit from Banca di Roma, in the amount of $7,000,000; from Banca
 Commerciale Italiana, in the amount of $5,750,000; from Bayerische
Hypo-und
 Vereinsbank AG, in the amount of $30,000,000; and from Banca
Nazionale del
 Lavorno, in the amounts of $44,000,000 and $13,500,000,
respectively),
 subject to the rights of EPMI to replace or provide substitutes for
such
 letters of credit, to assure payment by Enron of the termination
payment,
 if any, due from it to PG&E under the MPA.  In the event that the
 Settlement Discussions have not resulted in the execution of a
Settlement
 Agreement by [May 15, 2001], but the Parties are continuing to
negotiate in
 good faith with respect thereto, Enron agrees to extend for a period
of no
 less than __ days any letter of credit that shall be due to expire
within
 __ days after the end of the Initial Extension Period and Enron
shall
 promptly provide PG&E with confirmation of such extension.  In the
event
 that the Parties successfully conclude a Settlement Agreement and
such
 agreement is submitted to the Bankruptcy Court for approval, the
Parties
 anticipate that (1) such Settlement Agreement will include a
provision
 requiring the maintenance of letters of credit by Enron during the
period
 the Parties are awaiting Bankruptcy Court approval and (2) the
aggregate
 amount of the letters of credit will be reduced, as mutually agreed
by the
 Parties, to more closely match the agreed-upon amount of the
settlement
 amount due from Enron.

           In the event, for any reason, the Parties cannot reach
closure on
 a Settlement Agreement, or any such Settlement Agreement is agreed
to by
 the Parties but ultimately is not approved without modification by
the
 Bankruptcy Court, and thereafter PG&E issues to Enron a Dispute
Notice
 under the MPA, PG&E shall not make, or cause to be made, a draw
under the
 letters of credit securing Enron's payment obligation under the MPA
until
 (1) the amount of the applicable termination payment due to PG&E has
been
 finally determined pursuant to the terms of the MPA and (2) Enron
shall
 have failed to make payment required by it pursuant to Section 5.4,
subject
 to Section 10.12.

           The Parties further acknowledge that, in connection with
the
 Parties' desire to attempt to negotiate the terms of a Settlement
 Agreement, the Parties anticipate that they will simultaneously
commence
 negotiations concerning new master gas purchase and sale agreements
 pursuant to which ENA and EEC, respectively, would sell and PG&E
would
 purchase natural gas, including under term (as opposed to only
daily)
 transactions to the extent mutually agreed by the Parties.
Notwithstanding
 the foregoing, neither PG&E nor Enron shall be obligated to enter
into any
 such agreements or transactions, it being acknowledged and agreed by
the
 Parties that any decisions or commitments with respect thereto shall
be
 subject to the sole discretion of each of the Parties and no
contract or
 commitment shall occur or be deemed to have occurred until the
applicable
 terms and conditions have been agreed to and definitive agreements
have
 been executed by the Parties.



           If the foregoing accurately reflects our mutual
understandings,
 could you please execute a copy of this letter and return it to me
via
 facsimile at your earliest convenience, with a hard copy by
overnight mail.
 Thank you.

    Subject:  RE: PG&E and Enron Stand-Still Agreement

    Elizabeth:

    Four points.  First, I can't call up an attachment to your
e-mail; can
    you
    please resend it?  Second, I believe that the PG&E and Enron
    representatives
    at the meeting agreed that Enron would keep the LCs in place
    month-to-month
    for the entire period until a settlement is reached and approved
by the
    Bankruptcy Court; of course, if negotiations break down, that
    month-to-month
    requirement could end, but the LCs were a principal comfort point
for
    PG&E
    going forward, and your changes in this portion of the draft may
be
    unacceptable to us (again, I'll have to review them to be
certain).
    Third,
    I recall that we agreed generally, if not specifically, that we
would
    give
    ourselves breathing space to reach an agreement, without an
    artificially-imposed ""window"" as you call it, and I do not think
such a
    window is advisable at this time; PG&E is perhaps even more eager
than
    Enron
    to resolve the Termination Payment issue, and our discussions can
always
    be
    truncated if talks stall, but I do not think such windows do much
to
    promote
    cooperative efforts generally.  Fourth, I think PG&E was very
clear in
    its
    expectation that, as part of these discussions, Enron would both
enter
    into
    new Master Agreements with PG&E and into sales of gas on
commercially
    reasonable terms.  I recall no disagreement from anyone on
Enron's side
    of
    the table to this proposition, and think the draft I sent to you
    captures
    the gist of what PG&E would like to see.

    Admitterdly, without reviewing the mark-up I'm shooting blind a
bit
    here.  I
    mention these points mainly as background for my request that you
check
    in
    with the Enron reps who attended the meeting to see if perhaps
your
    comments
    are off the mark.  After I've read your mark-up and you have done
this
    minor
    bit of due diligence, we can talk, tomorrow hopefully, in an
attempt to
    resolve whatever differences we actually may have on the terms of
the
    stand-still agreement.  I very much hope any such differences are
more
    minor
    than your comments suggest, as otherwise this might not be a very
good
    start
    for our clients' efforts to reach an amicable resolution.

    I look forward to talking tomorrow.  Please suggest a time.

    Thanks.

    Larry

       Subject:  Re: PG&E and Enron Stand-Still Agreement



       Larry:  In accordance with our conversation late last week, I
am
    enclosing
       a revised draft of the proposed standstill agreement that was
    discussed on
       Wednesday.  My comments primarily involve the following:

       (1)  As you and I discussed last week,  I thought it made
sense to
    specify
       a reasonable date by which Enron and PG&E shall have reached
closure
    on a
       settlement agreement on the contract termination and related
claims.
    I
       proposed a one month period to do that.  If the parties can't
come
    to an
       agreement in that time period, then the ""mechanics"" in the MPA
for
       resolving a dispute dealing with the calculation of the
termination
    payment
       would be ""reactivated.""  Obviously, if we are making progress,
the
    parties
       can always extend the date.  I felt it was appropriate to
specify
    the
       window period to make sure that everyone is focused on
attempting to
    get a
       prompt resolution.  Assuming a final settlement agreement is
agreed
    upon,
       the conditions of the extension of the ""stay"" would be
embodied in
    the
       settlement agreement itself  (as opposed to this letter).

       (2)  Enron agreed at the meeting that it would keep the LCs in
place
    while
       the parties were working to see if a settlement agreement
could be
    reached,
       and that requirement is reflected in our revisions to the
letter.
    Thus,
       the revised letter provides that Enron will do this for the
""Initial
       Extension Period"" (i.e., to May 25, 2001).  Your draft had
provided
    that
       Enron would be required to keep the LCs in place even if no
    settlement
       agreement were to be reached.  My view is that any requirement
to
    maintain
       the LCs beyond the Initial Extension Period and any conditions
with
    respect
       thereto, if agreed to by Enron, should be part of the final
    settlement
       agreement executed by the parties, rather than as part of this
    letter.
       Also, we note that, as a contractual matter, the MPA does not
    require the
       non-defaulting party to keep in place any security in favor of
the
       defaulting party when, as a result of a termination, the
    non-defaulting
       party owes a payment to the defaulting party.  See Sec. 5.5.

       (3)  Your draft of the letter provided that Enron ""agrees"" to
enter
    into
       new master gas agreements and consummate term transactions on
    ""commercially
       reasonable terms.""  The revised letter specifies that Enron
agrees
    to
       negotiate with PG&E in these respects simultaneously with the
    negotiations
       towards a settlement agreement, but any commitment on Enron's
part
    to
       effect a contract or transaction with PG&E will only arise as
a
    result of
       the parties' execution of the definitive transaction documents
(as
    opposed
       to this letter), the execution of which shall be in the sole
    discretion of
       each of the parties.


       Please call me at your convenience to discuss any questions on
the
       foregoing or on the revised letter.  Thanks in advance for
your help
    in
       moving this forward.

    Agreement






       Ms. Sager:

       Attached is my draft of an agreement memorializing the
parties'
    respective
       commitments as we negotiate the amount of the Termination
Payment
    and of
       other claims Enron may have against PG&E in Bankruptcy Court.
I do
    not
       have
       your mailing address; yet, PG&E would like to receive
assurance soon
    that
       Enron agrees with the terms of this proposed letter agreement.
    After
       reviewing the draft, please indicate Enron's agreement by
return
    e-mail to
       me.  Or, please call me (415-973-3817) to discuss.

       Thanks.

Subject: Easier for EPMI/EES to purchase from industrials

Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from 
industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The 
industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC 
(subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for 
the industrials). 

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used 
primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be ""public utilities"" 
subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell 
power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice 
under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice 
filing).  
  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; 
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing 
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while 
they are selling at wholesale.
 -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the 
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of 
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from 
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these 
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be 
separate from our big quarterly reports.
 -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any 
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial 
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless 
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to 
purchases from industrials in WSCC.


____________________________________
On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to 
purchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.  As the attached order 
indicates, the effective date of the EPMI and EES rate schedules is March 6, 
2001.

Attached is the suggested template for physical power confirmations as 
discussed.

 As you know the ""Confirmation Letter"" is defined in the GTCs as being in the 
form attached as Exhibit A to the GTCs, any changes to the confirmation that 
the counterparties can expect to receive should also be reflected on the 
Website in Exhibit A.
 
Kind regards,
 
Marcus

Hello, I wanted to make sure I understand where the new language is to be 
inserted in our EOL GTC confirmation letter.  Bob Bowen was telling me they 
are putting the new paragraph at the beginning of the confirm letter.  The 
only problem I see is that we have the trade date and the energy type (firm 
energy, etc.) in the first paragraph as well.  We also already have language 
in the last paragraph about returning the confirm to us within 2 days.  

Please look at the following template and let me know where you would prefer 
to see the language added.  We are planning on changing our templates 
tomorrow morning.



Thanks,
Melissa

Subject: FW: footnnote each item under Exhibit B



REGARDING THE SETTLEMENT, ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT

Tracy Ngo correctly pointed out volumetric ambiguities on the two original
confirmations between Avista Energy and PG&E Energy Trading.

Let me summarize below:

(1) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 404335 showed Total Volume
of 982,400 MWh's.  PG&E revised the Total Volume to 981,600 MWh.  Avista did
not respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.  Our records show
that the original volume of 982,400 is correct (there was a leap-year day in
year 2000).  The broker confirm and the PG&E revision seem to be both in
error.  Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy and
Enron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh's.  Since this
Assignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommends
language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email from
Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&E and
Enron? Please advise.

(2) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 403862 showed a Total
Volume of 14,400.  PG&E accepted the confirm ""as is.""  The broker
confirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh's.  Therefore, both
PG&E and AVISTA screwed up.  HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh's
should correctly be as per the broker confirmation.  Again, our counsel
recommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see
email from Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to
PG&E and Enron?  Please advise.


To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enron
and Avista.  Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron's
confirm's prevail).  Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.  We
would like to see those confirms in advance if possible.

Lastly, time is of the essense.  We are scheduling power already for January
deliveries....therefore, we must act quickly on this assignment so as to
prevent any problems with scheduling, etc.  I suppose that we could delay
the start dates to February 1st, 2001 if necessary.  Perhaps not a big
issue.

Thanks,
Nolan Steiner

Liz,

The attached draft Asset Management Agreement (clean and latest marked copy 
received from Milbank Tweed) documents essentially two separate 
transactions.  Article 2 governs EPMI's duties as an administrator and 
overseer of NCPH's contractual and physical assets.  Article 3 governs EPMI's 
obligations to market power and capacity from the 2 NCPH plants.    I am told 
by the key originator, Heather Kroll, that EPMI has a number of these types 
of transactions in place and/or in the works.

The primary reason for my call to you last week was to confirm that EPMI is 
not regulatorily or otherwise prohibited from engaging in the 2 separate 
types of transactions described above.  Any thoughts you may have on the 
subject would be very much appreciated.

Thanks,
Steve Van Hooser

Subject: Sysco

Attached below is the Sysco contract revised as discussed together with a 
redlined version marked to show the changes from the version sent to Sysco.  
The revisions reflect the points negotiated with Sysco and ""lessons learned"" 
from the current situation in California.   Sysco has not yet seen these 
revisions.

The following list summarizes the significant issues for presentation to the 
organization (including Don Black and Sean Holmes) and/or reflect differences 
from the standard form.

Section 3.4  has been revised to make it bilateral except for subsection (d) 
which remains applicable only to EESI.  The standard form permitted only EESI 
to exercise a right of termination.  Accordingly, subsection (a) has been 
revised to delete the phase addressing the tariff risks which is now 
addressed in the revised definitions for Distribution Charges, Transition 
Charges and Special Utility Charges.  
Revised Section 3.4 provides that a change in ""Utility rates or Taxes is not 
a change that allows a party to invoke the provision.  
Revised Section 3.4 provides the parties with a right to terminate the 
contract for convenience after the 36th month.  An Early Termination payment 
based on the ""cost to cover"" is applicable.  
Sysco is permitted to close a facility under new Section 3.5 and pay the 
Early Termination Payment applicable to the closed facility based on the 
""cost to cover.""
Sysco is permitted to substitute facilities under new Section 3.6 and 
transfer the consumption volumes applicable to a facility that is Closed, 
Disposed, or Non-Controlled as long as the substituted facility has, in 
EESI's reasonable opinion, substantially similar load profile and consumption 
of, and demand charges for power as the facility for which it is being 
substituted, and is served by the same utility.
Consistent with the form, Sysco's consumption outside of the 90%-110% 
Anticipated Usage band would result in Sysco's paying the additional costs 
resulting from the difference between the contract price and the market 
price.  However, under the revised contract (Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2), if 
the price difference results in cost savings, a credit will be issued to 
Sysco.  We should confirm that we have the capability to make these 
calculations.  Also under the revised contract, the 90%-110% band is 
calculated for groups of facilities served by the same utility (the Facility 
Group).
Section 4.5 has been revised to obligate Sysco to post a letter of credit (at 
EESI's request) if Sysco Corporation's credit rating falls below investment 
grade.  The letter of credit would be in an amount equal to (i) the amount 
equivalent to the Early Termination Payment as of the date of the requested 
letter of credit; plus (ii) three months receivables.

Please do not hesitate to contact either Mike Smith or me with questions.  dwa

		 Subject: CLE Seminars

I am sure you'all have all the CLE you probably need, but just in case you do 
not, there is an easy way to catch up!  You can earn CLE credits through 
several websites on the internet!  The advantage of this is that all you need 
is a computer with an internet connection.  You can ""attend"" when you want, 
24 hours a day, from your home or the office!   Some will allow you to log 
your time which enables you to break away from the ""seminar"" to finish at a 
later time.   There is a fee in most cases.  You can register on-line or by 
phone, and can charge it to your credit card with either registration 
method.  

The websites I know about are listed below.  There are probably more if you 
do an internet search for ""CLE"".

http://www.texasbarcle.com
http://www.abanet.org/cle/clenow/
http://www.cle.com
http://www.law.legalseminars.com
http://www.cle-net.edu
http:/www.cleonline.com

The first two listed are on the Texas Bar and American Bar Associations' 
websites.

John:  Following up on your voice mail, attached are revised drafts of the 
Confirm and the Master Agreement.  Please note that, as you may recall, 
Elizabeth Sager is out of town today and I have not been able to catch up 
with her to get her views on the things set forth in your e-mail to me, or 
with Christian.  However, we had a brief conversation after our call 
yesterday about some of the points on your ""list"" and I have tried to 
generally work with what you have proposed on a few of the points in light of 
my conversations with Elizabeth and Christian.  Since I have to leave the 
office within an hour or so today, I thought I would forward some proposed 
language on some of the points for your consideration with the hope of 
expediting the process.  These drafts, therefore, are subject to Enron's 
review and comment.

Please call me if you wish to discuss.

John

FYI - Here are copies of the final documents for the PGET/Avista transaction 
that are being sent out for signature tonight.  Thanks for everybody's help 
in getting this done.  I will be out tomorrow but can be reached at home 713 
853 6349 or on my cell phone 713 854 5747 and will be checking messages.   
Travis and Tracy will assist in gathering all the fax signatures and refaxing 
to all parties.

Remember - EPMI is required to wire the payment to PGET ($115,714.50) and WE 
NEED TO GET WIRE INFORMATION FROM PGET.  Also PGET must release cash 
collateral to Avista - we should follow up to make sure this happens.

Thanks again.

Sorry I did not get back in touch w you earlier - my mom passed away over the

be back (definitely out the week of 15th).   I look forward to playing and

Dear Chris, 

As discussed with my colleague Tracy Ngo, attached please find a draft 
agreement which would cover the proposed arrangement between EPMI, MEGA and 
PGET. It is in a form acceptable to both PGET and EPMI. If the arrangement is 
to go ahead, please give me any comments from your attorneys ASAP.  Also, if 
it goes ahead, we will need to know the details of the master agreement 
between MEGA and PGET, and receive a copy of the relevant transaction

Mark --

Attached is PG&E Core's response to Enron Canada's comments (sent in March)
on the Core Gas Supply Contract.  We have been able to incorporate many of
your suggestions.

In addition to Enron's suggestions, I have made some additional revisions,
some stylistic, some substantive, which I believe improves the draft.

I have highlighted the revisions in Word's ""Track Changes"" (Word 2000),
based on the original draft sent to Enron Canada earlier this year.

In addition, we recieved Enron Canada's modification suggestions for a
pre-pay arrangement.  We have incorporated many of EC's suggestions there as
well.

Please don't hesitate to give me a call, at 415-973-6659, to discuss and to
move this to conclusion.

Thank you,

Dave Anderson, PG&E Law Dept

Subject:  Enron Canada Corp. Comments on the PG&E Form of Master

Pursuant to your meeting at our office yesterday, Peter Keohane asked me to
provide you with a brief list of key issues/amendments relating to the
Pacific Gas and Electric Company form of Master Gas Purchase and Sales
Agreement (the ""Master"").  In this regard, we have tried to restrict our
comments to those of our concerns which are most important to us.  Please
be aware that these comments are subject to Enron Canada Corp. (""Enron
Canada"") being satisfied with all other matters which were discussed during
the meeting (i.e. set-off issues, credit issues, issues relating to the
Confirmation and Amendment to Gas Supply Agreement, the security and
inter-creditor agreement and the side letter agreement currently being
negotiated with Travis McCullough of Enron North America Corp., etc.).

Our concerns, in the order of the Master, are as follows:

1.Verbal Agreements.

We need to ensure that the agreement contemplates the fact that agreements
(whether they be for Baseload Gas, Multi-month Gas or Swing Gas) will be
binding upon the parties agreeing to the terms of the transaction (i.e.
determination of the buyer/seller, the DCQ, the period of delivery, the
delivery point, etc.) regardless of whether the transaction has been
reduced to writing.

This should be a relatively easy fix to:
a.   s.2.1 of the Transaction Procedures,
b.   modifying a number of definitions in Article 1 so that they do not
refer to ""as agreed upon in Exhibit A"" or ""as set forth in Exhibit A"" but
refer to ""as agreed      upon by the Parties"";
c.   modifying the definitions of ""Baseload Gas"", ""Multi-month Gas"" and
""Swing Gas"";
d.   modifying sections such s.4.1, s.5.1, s.6.1, etc. accordingly.


2. Confirmation by Seller.

In connection with the issue above, the confirmation procedure should be
amended such that ""Enron Canada"" (as opposed to ""Buyer"" in s.1.1 and 1.17
and as opposed to ""PG&E Core"" in s.2.3) ""may"" confirm the transactions.
This change is in line with issue number 1 above and allows for the
potential for Enron Online transactions.

Please note, the Exhibit A will need to be slightly modified to account for
this change.


3. Canadian Delivery Points

Enron Canada requires s.4.2 to be amended such that transactions with ""at
the border"" delivery points will be deemed to occur on the Canadian side of
the border.  The section should state:

     ""The Delivery Point for any Gas sold and purchased at Easport, Idaho
     or Sumas Washington by Seller or Seller's Transporter to Buyer or
     Buyer's Transporter shall be on the Canadian side of the international
     border at the interconnection of Kingsgate, British Columbia and
     Huntington, British Columbia, respectively, where Buyer will take
     title of the Gas, unless otherwise agreed.""

4.   Invoicing.

Enron Canada requires that the clause "", subject to receiving a confirming
statement from Buyer's Transporter for the quantity of gas actually
delivered,"" be deleted from the second sentence of s.7.1.  Further, the
second to last sentence of s.7.1 should be replaced with the following:

     ""If actual quantities are not available by the billing date, billing
     and payment will be prepared based upon the scheduled contract
     quantities.""

In this regard, s.7.4 should also be deleted.


5.  Enron Canada Credit Support.

In s.8.1, any guarantee provided by Enron Corp. must be construed and
enforced under the laws of Texas.

Secondly, Enron Canada requires the following clause to be inserted at the
end of the first sentence of s.8.2:

     "", provided that Enron Canada shall only be required to provide
     assurances of payment in the event that PG&E Core's net exposure to
     Enron Canada under all Transactions under this Agreement exceeds US
     $ (to be determined upon completion of credit analysis)"".


6.  Force Majeure

Enron Canada requires the removal of s.11.1, s.11.2 and s.11.3 relating to
""Force Majeure"".  These sections are to be replaced with the following:

     11.1   Suspension   for  Force  Majeure.   This  Article  11  entitled
     Non-Performance  is  the sole and exclusive excuse for non-performance
     permitted  under  this  Agreement,  and all other excuses at law or in
     equity  are waived.  Except with regard to payment obligations, in the
     event  either  Party  is  rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force
     Majeure  to  carry  out  its  obligations  under this Agreement, it is
     agreed  that  upon  such Party's giving notice and full particulars of
     such  Force Majeure to the other Party as soon as reasonably possible,
     such  notice  to  be confirmed in writing, then the obligations of the
     Party giving such notice, to the extent that they are affected by such
     Force  Majeure,  shall  be  suspended,  from  its inception during the
     continuance  of  the Force Majeure for a period of sixty (60) Days, in
     the  aggregate,  during  any  twelve-Month  period,  but for no longer
     period.   After  the  sixtieth  Day, the Parties shall be obligated to
     perform.


     11.2      Force Majeure for Transactions with a Delivery Point at NOVA
     Inventory  Transfer  (""NIT"").   If  the  Delivery  Point  is NIT, this
     Article 11.2 shall apply.  ""Force Majeure"" means only an interruption,
     curtailment  or prorationing by NOVA of NIT service, which affects all
     NOVA  shippers  who  had  nominated for deliveries or receipts to take
     place  by NIT on that Gas day.  On any Gas day or any portion of a Gas
     day  that there is a Force Majeure and either Party provides notice of
     the  Force  Majeure  to  the other, Seller shall deliver to Buyer, and
     Buyer  shall  receive from Seller, that percentage of the DCQ which is
     equal to the percentage amount of Gas which according to NOVA had been
     nominated  by  all  NOVA  shippers  for  NIT  and  which  NOVA  is not
     interrupting,  curtailing  or  prorationing  on  that  Gas day or that
     portion of a Gas day.


     11.3       Force  Majeure for Transactions with a Delivery Point other
     than  NIT.  If the Delivery Point is other than NIT, this Article 11.3
     shall  apply. ""Force Majeure"" means only interruptions or curtailments
     of  firm  service  at the Delivery Point(s) by Seller's Transporter or
     Buyer's  Transporter,  regardless  of  whether  Buyer's Transporter or
     Seller's  Transporter is declaring any event of force majeure.  On any
     Gas  day  that  Force  Majeure  applies,  both Parties' obligations to
     deliver  and  receive Gas shall be reduced by the same percentage that
     Buyer's  Transporter  or  Seller's  Transporter interrupts or curtails
     firm service at the Delivery Point(s) on such Gas day.""

Please note, the reference to Article 11.2 in s.11.4 should be amended to a
reference to Article 11.1 once the changes indicated above are made.


7.  Liquidated Damages Calculation

The calculation of liquidated damages in s.11.4 uses the highest daily
price and lowest daily price ""in the index below"".  However, I could locate
no reference to an index below to make the calculation.  As are result, we
need to specify an index.

We should probably insert a provision to deal with circumstances in which
the index ceases to be reported or there is a material change in the
formula for or method of calculation is changed (as per the recent CPGR
AECO ""C"" Daily Index changes).


8.   Eligible Financial Contract Representation

As a supplement to the provisions of s.12.6, Enron Canada requires the
following provisions to be added to the Master:

     ""12.7      Eligible Financial Contract.  This Agreement, all
     Transactions under this Agreement, and any guarantee thereof as
     applicable, each and together constitute an ""eligible financial
     contract"" under and in all proceedings related to the Bankruptcy and
     Insolvency Act (Canada), the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act
     (Canada) or the Winding-up and Restructuring Act (Canada), as the same
     may be amended, restated, replaced or re-enacted from time to time,
     and will be treated similarly under and in all proceedings related to
     any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law (regardless of the
     jurisdiction of application or competence of such law) or any ruling,
     order, directive or pronouncement made pursuant thereto.""


9.   Assignment

Enron Canada requires the assignment provisions of s.14.1 be replaced with
the following:

     ""14.1      Transfer  or  Assignment.   Neither Party shall transfer or
     assign  this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other
     Party,  which approval may be withheld or given entirely at the option
     of  such Party; provided, however, either Party may transfer or assign
     its interest hereunder to an affiliate, subsidiary or to any person or
     entity  succeeding  to  all or substantially all of the assets of such
     Party,  all without the prior written approval of the other Party, but
     no such assignment will relieve the assigning Party of its obligations
     hereunder.""


Further, a new s.14.3 should be inserted stating:

     ""14.3      Enurement.   This  Agreement  shall enure to and be binding
     upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties hereto.""


10.  Canadian Law Issues

Enron Canada requires the first two sentences of s.17.4 to be replaced with
the following:

     ""This Agreement shall be governed by and construed, enforced and
     performed in accordance with the laws in force in the Province of
     Alberta, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, and each
     Party hereby submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
     of the Province of Alberta.""

     For the purposes of this Agreement and all Transactions hereunder,
     unless otherwise specified, ""dollars"" and the symbol ""$"" means dollars
     in the lawful currency of Canada.


11.  Representations

Enron Canada requires the following section to be inserted in Article 17 ?
Miscellaneous:

     s.17.8     As  a  material inducement to entering into this Agreement,
     including each Transaction, each Party, with respect to itself, hereby
     represents  and warrants to the other Party, continuing throughout the
     term  of  this  Agreement  and  on  the  date that each Transaction is
     entered into, as follows:

(a)  there are no suits, proceedings, judgments or orders by or before any
court or any governmental authority that materially adversely affect its
ability to          perform this Agreement or the rights of the other Party
under this Agreement;
(b)  it is duly organized and validly existing, and it has the legal right,
power, authority and qualifications, and has obtained all necessary
consents and        regulatory authorizations, for it to conduct its
business, to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder and under each     Transaction;
(c)  (i) each Transaction shall constitute a ""commodity contract"" or an
""OTC derivative"" or such other similar term as defined pursuant to the
securities          legislation in force in Alberta and British Columbia
and pursuant to the securities legislation of any other jurisdictions
having application to the          Transaction, and
     (ii) it is a ""Qualified Party"" within the meaning of paragraph 9.1 of
Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc.#394043 and paragraph 1.1 of the
British        Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order BOR 91-501, in
any such case, as amended, restated, replaced or re-enacted from time to
time, and      pursuant to any equivalent order or other enactment made
pursuant to the securities laws of Alberta, British Columbia and any other
jurisdictions having     application to the Transaction;
(d)  the making and performance of this Agreement are within its powers,
have been duly authorized by all necessary action and do not and will not
violate   any provision of law or any rule, regulation, order, writ,
judgment, decree or other determination presently in effect applicable to
it or any provision of its    governing documents; and
(e)  this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid, and binding act and
obligation of it, enforceable against it, in accordance with its terms,
subject to bankruptcy,   insolvency, reorganization and other laws
affecting creditors' rights generally, and with regard to any equitable
remedies, to the discretion of the court           before which proceedings
to obtain such remedies may be pending.


Please give me a call when you have the opportunity to discuss the above.
You can reach me at (713) 345-2520 for the next few weeks and you can reach
Peter Keohane directly at (403) 974-6923.


Yours truly,

Mark Powell

Elizabeth,
Your deposition has been rescheduled for Wednesday, June 13, 2001, at 10:00 
am.  I understand from your assistant that you are available on that date.  
(I remain hopeful that we will have the matter resolved by then, but we were 
not in a position to indefinitely postpone rescheduling the depo, and we 
pushed it out about as far as we reasonably could).  Please review the 
subpoena duces tecum that was attached to your original deposition notice to 
determine whether you have any responsive documents that have not been 
previously produced.  In particular, please determine whether you have any 
notes, calendar entries, or contract negotiation files that have not been 
previously produced.  If you have any responsive documents that you believe a 
covered by the attorney-client privilege or attorney work product privilege, 
please let  me know about them anyway, so that we can make sure to disclose 
them properly to preserve the privilege.  Also, we will need to schedule a 
deposition prep meeting, assuming the deposition goes forward.  Please let me 
know when you have a couple of hours to meet with me and outside counsel to 
prepare.  If you have time available on Thursday, June 7, that would be a 
good time to try to schedule it.  Otherwise, let me know your availability.  
We will do what we can to make this as painless as possible.  Thanks.

Another day, another subpoena.  This one is from the CPUC's investigation and 
is directed to the CAISO.  Based on the requests in this subpoena, it looks 
as if the CPUC is not looking at the power marketers, but is focused on the

It looks like de-registering as an ESP is, in fact, a good option.  It would 
certainly make life easier from a compliance standpoint.  Christian, would 
you run this by your business guys just to make sure that they don't plan to 
serve small commercials under 20 KW?   Thanks!

Janet,

EPMI originally registered with the CPUC as required because EPMI was the
entity who actually contracted with all of Enron's retail customers for
service, including residential and small commercial, as well as larger
customers.  Later, EPMI transferred virtually all its customers to EES, who
was also registered as an ESP.  Our information is that EPMI still serves at
least one industrial customer -- the Can Fiber plant -- as well as possibly
others.  We agree that EPMI could reduce its regulatory compliance burdens
by deregistering as an ESP, so long as it did not intend to serve any
customers under 20 kW.  As I explained, EES has occasionally found it
necessary to serve customers of less than 20 kW in order to obtain larger
accounts.  This is not a problem with certain chain stores, ie. a fast food
restaurant, where several stores are over the 20 kW limit and a few are not.
In that situation, the CPUC has clarified that compliance with the small
customer consumer protection rules is not required,  However, EES has also
been asked to serve residential customers, such as employees and executives,
in order to get a large customer account.  We would not advise serving any
such customers without a valid ESP registration.  If, as you suggest, EPMI
is,and expects to remain, in a position where it will not consent to serve
such small customers, then de-registration is an option.  Please let us know
if there is anything further we can do to assist you in this matter.

Mike:  Per my voicemail, I am forwarding to you an email from an attorney
at LeBoeuf.  As mentioned, LeBoeuf has been helping us develop an overall
compliance plan for meeting the varied retail regulatory requirements in
the states where EPMI sells to industrials.  They came up with the
suggestion, as discussed further below, of having EPMI deregister as an ESP
in California, and instead become a non-registered ESP.  I understand that
EPMI could still sell to large industrials under this classification.
First, can you remember the historical reason of why EPMI registered as an
ESP to begin with, but with the qualification that it only intended to
serve large industrials?  There may have been an important strategic
decision to do so.  Second, is there any reason why EPMI should not
deregister as an ESP and become a non-registered ESP?
I look forward to hearing from you.  Please feel free to call me at
713-345-7400.

                    02:19 PM









Janet,

As you know, EPMI is currently classified with the California Public
Utilities Commission (""CPUC"") as a ""Registered ESP"" (ESP # 1086).  EPMI may
want to consider de-registering with the CPUC and, instead, benefit from
classification as a ""Non-Registered ESP"".  I have confirmed that an ESP
must only register with the CPUC prior to serving residential and small
commercial customers.  The CPUC defines a ""small commercial customer"" as a
customer that has a maximum peak demand of less than 20 kW per meter for at
least 9 billing periods during the most recent 12 month period (See
C.P.U.C. o 331(h) and PG&E Tariff, Rule 22).  As EPMI has indicated in its
license application that it only intends to serve large commercial
customers and, per our discussions, does not have immediate plans to serve
small commercial customers, EPMI may elect to de-register and become a
Non-Registered ESP.
     The primary advantage of de-registering is that EPMI, as a
Non-Registered ESP, would no longer have continued reporting and compliance
requirements with the CPUC, including the annual submission of a standard
service plan filing, application update and license renewal.  Additionally,
as a Non-Registered ESP, EPMI would no longer have the ongoing obligation
to notify the CPUC within 5 days of changes in address or phone numbers and
to notify the CPUC of all other ""material changes"", including changes to
officers and directors, within 60 days.  I have confirmed with a contact at
the energy division of the CPUC, on an anonymous basis, that a Registered
ESP can de-register with the CPUC by sending a letter to the address below
requesting cancellation of ESP registration status.
               California Public Utilities Commission
               Energy Division - Electric Service Provider Registration
               Fourth Floor
               505 Van Ness Avenue
               San Francisco, CA 94102
Our source at the CPUC also confirmed that the CPUC exercises no regulatory
jurisdiction over a Non-Registered ESP.  Non-Registered ESPs, however, can
file a complaint at the CPUC against a jurisdictional utility over issues
dealing with the utility's compliance with its tariffs with respect to
ESPs.

     Please note that while Non-Registered ESPs do not have ongoing
reporting and compliance requirements with the CPUC, both Registered ESPs
and Non-Registered ESPs must submit various environmental compliance
filings with the California Energy Commission and, if participating in the
Green-e Program, make additional filings with the Center for Resource
Solutions.  For additional information on these reporting and compliance
requirements for Registered ESPs and Non-Registered ESPs in California,
please refer to the LLGM website at
http://web-2.interliant.com/llgm/ENRON/llgm.nsf.

		 Subject: PGET/Avista Transaction - final documents

FYI - Here are copies of the final documents for the PGET/Avista transaction 
that are being sent out for signature tonight.  Thanks for everybody's help 
in getting this done.  I will be out tomorrow but can be reached at home 713 
853 6349 or on my cell phone 713 854 5747 and will be checking messages.   
Travis and Tracy will assist in gathering all the fax signatures and refaxing 
to all parties.

Remember - EPMI is required to wire the payment to PGET ($115,714.50) and WE 
NEED TO GET WIRE INFORMATION FROM PGET.  Also PGET must release cash 
collateral to Avista - we should follow up to make sure this happens.

Thanks again.

  Dear Elizabeth,

Please find attached the draft form termination letter, coupled with a Notice 
of Settlement Amount, that you requested.  Please note that we recommend that 
these form letters be used merely as guides as the contracts that Enron has 
entered into with the PG&E entities all provide for varying procedures for 
termination.  Therefore, each contract should be referenced prior to sending 
out a termination letter.

Additionally, Jim Huemoeller and I believe that it would be best that one 
person be responsible for preparing the various terminations, or in the 
alternative, have such person review each termination letter so that there is 
consistent wording and so that the Enron and LeBoeuf persons responsible for 
monitoring the PG&E situation are certain which contracts are being 
terminated.

Please let us know if you have any questions, or if we can be of further 
assistance.

Best regards,

Christina L.C. McDonald

Duke Energy Releases Average Prices Charged for Electricity in California
Average Price of $76 Per Megawatt-Hour for 2000, $136 for First Quarter 2001
CHARLOTTE, N.C., June 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK - news) today 
released average prices the company charged over the last 15 months for 
wholesale electricity in California. The average prices of $76 per megawatt- 
hour charged in 2000 and $136 per megawatt-hour in first quarter 2001 are 
well below average spot market prices for the same periods.

``Clearly by selling the vast majority of our electricity into the forward 
markets through long-term contracts we have demonstrated that low average 
prices can be achieved for California's consumers,'' said Jim Donnell, 
president and chief executive officer of Duke Energy North America.

``The way for California to stabilize prices is to enter into long-term 
contracts at fixed prices. We continue to work with the California Department 
of Water Resources to negotiate long-term contracts to help the state avoid 
purchasing power on the volatile spot market. Just last July, we offered to 
sell 2,000 megawatts to the state at a fixed price of $50 per megawatt-hour 
for five years. The state did not act upon our offer,'' Donnell said.

Duke also reported that the highest price charged during first quarter 2001 
was $3,880 per megawatt-hour. That price was for less than 1/10 of 1 percent 
of the volume sold to California by the company in first quarter 2001 and 
reflected the significant credit risks associated with selling power through 
the California Independent System Operator (ISO) to Pacific Gas & Electric 
(NYSE: PCG - news; PG&E) and Southern California Edison (Amex: SCEQ - news) 
at that time.

``The few sales made at the highest price reflected the fact that the parties 
receiving the power were insolvent and would likely declare bankruptcy. In 
determining the price to charge, we took into account the likelihood that we 
would only be able to collect a fraction of the sales price if PG&E filed for 
bankruptcy protection. Obviously our concerns were valid because on April 6 
PG&E did file for bankruptcy protection and we still have not been paid,'' 
Donnell said.

``On March 26 we said that if we are paid we will not seek to collect the 
portion of the price charged for the poor credit risk,'' Donnell added.

Donnell emphasized Duke Energy's commitment to California -- citing the 
company's announcement in 1998 of its intention to add additional generation 
in California. Duke has currently under construction a 1,060-megawatt plant 
and eventually could add as much as 1,500 additional megawatts. He also said 
Duke Energy's California power plants generated 50 percent more electricity 
in 2000, providing 15.8 million megawatt-hours versus 9.5 million in 1999.

Duke Energy supplies just over 5 percent of California's electricity from 
four power plants in the state with a capacity of 3,351 megawatts -- enough 
energy to serve about 3.4 million households.

For more information about Duke Energy's California operations, our 
modernization projects and our perspective on the state's electricity crisis, 
see our Web site at www.Duke-Energy.com/California.

Duke Energy, a diversified multinational energy company, creates value for 
customers and shareholders through an integrated network of energy assets and 
expertise. Duke Energy manages a dynamic portfolio of natural gas and 
electric supply, delivery and trading businesses -- generating revenues of 
more than $49 billion in 2000. Duke Energy, headquartered in Charlotte, N.C., 
is a Fortune 100 company traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the 
symbol DUK. More information about the company is available on the Internet

still need an extra-memory capacity printer in order to print. Please let me

Broadmore being listed in Tennis magazine as one of the top 10 places to 
play.

Elizabeth:  Not to add to your woes, but I am forwarding an e-mail from 
Michael re: SoCalEd which, as you know, could go the same route as PG&E in 
the not too distant future in light of the fact that its MOU with the State 
is not going anywhere.  We probably need to revisit our SCE exposures, 
including seeing whether we can get a better handle on what we may have 
running through the PX and ISO and any update on the ""commandeered"" contract 
(under which, I presume, we are still obligated to sell to CDWR (if I 
remember correctly the chain of events)). Also, we probably need to start 
thinking about extending the standstill letter with PG&E and dealing with 
renewing the LOCs on the EPMI power termination payment liability?  I have 
not heard anything on the PG&E front in this respect this week in terms of 
whether any further ""settlement"" talks have taken place.  Give me a call 
whenever you come up for air.  John

Ben:


Can I get in touch with one of your senior bankruptcy people in Los
Angeles?   We need to begin to acquant ourselves with one of your
partners there (I assume they would file in Los Angeles).  It would
appear to me that Edison will file shortly.    I want to assure that we
have a shot at the committee there.

Peter:

This note will confirm my voice mail to you.  I have spoken with LeBoeuf on 
this and I think we are all right here.  Remember that PG&E is responsible to 
pay post-filing, but pre-termination gas bills as post-petition obligations.  
That would explain somewhat the action taken by PG&E since the filing was 
made on April 6.  I do not think there would be a problem in sending a letter 
that would reserve our position as to the remainder of the pre-petition 
invoice, but would leave that up to you.  If you decide to go in that 
direction, I would like an opportunity to take a look at that letter.

Trust all else is well.

Jeff

Hi Peter

Pacific Gas and Electric paid us for gas purchases on May 25 for April 
production.
They paid amounts larger than the post bankruptcy invoice totals. 


Here are the details:

1. Pre Bankruptcy invoice for April 1-12 deliveries.

  4136SA   852,780.50 US

  Payment Rec'd  458,687.37 US

 It appears that they paid 53.787% of the pre bankruptcy invoice.


2. Pre Bankruptcy invoices for April 1-12 deliveries

  4120SA   2,033,749.68 CDN
  4138SA   2,797,179.00 CDN
     ------------------
  Subtotal  4,830,928.68 CDN

 Post Bankruptcy invoices for Apr 13-30 deliveries

  4139SA   3,425,804.71 CDN


 Total all sales for April production

     8,256,733.39 CDN

  Payment Rec'd  6,024,238.66 CDN


 It appears that they paid 53.787% of the pre bankruptcy invoice.


Please let me know what you want me to do with the excess payment.
Thanks
Cheryl

Northeast Utilities (agent for CP&L, Western Mass, etc.)
Bangor Hydroelectric Company

As you know, I've already gotten some of the wheels rolling on these 
counterparties, but the work isn't finished yet on any of them.  And Green 
Mountain just filed a new tariff.  Is this something that I could ask Marcus 
to work on with me?  (I understand from Genia that he's now in our group and 
is looking for work.)  Thanks.

Regards,
Janice

Subject: California sues PG&E over its reorganization

The California AG and PUC have petitioned FERC to vacate its order approving 
PG&E's recent reorganization.  Obviously by this reorganization, PG&E is 
attempting to shield its assets in the event of a bankruptcy.  I'm wondering 
if we should become active in this case, to protect our interests in the 
event of a bankruptcy.

I spent the better part of this week learning something new, which at my
age is not easy.  In fact, just about everything at my age is getting
more difficult.  But I wont  bore you with the details.  The new thing I
learned was how to be an Examiner on the Board of Examiners for this
year=0F's California Governor=0F's Quality Education and Development Award
(CalQED).  Its an annual shindig for companies, health care
institutions, and schools to compete for the honor of shaking the Gov=0F's
hand, and hearing that your (pick one: company, non-profit, school,
health care institution) are world class.  Being an examiner of the
written applications, and working with a team of peer examiners is all
pro bono on my part.  I am wondering what the hell I got myself into.
I=0F'll tell you more about it some other time.

Speaking of world class, I got two top notch letters this week that I
want to share with you.  One from Ken Lackey of Edison Mission Marketing
and Trading, regarding the May 25 overscheduling on the Silver Peak
intertie by 2900 MW (see Lori Eckman=0F's note to me in last week=0F's
Burrito), and a reply to Ken=0F's letter from George Sladoje, CEO of the
PX.

Ken, who I have known for several years, is a person who doesn=0F't speak
out unless something really bothers him. Ken wrote:

=0F""Since Day 1, I've always wondered what mechanism was in place to
protect against this scenario [overscheduling on an intertie], or if
this scenario would be regarded as a market implementation flaw or
""feature"".  I always figured it was a feature, simply because I didn't
think that a hole this large would be unintentionally overlooked.  I
also figured that this feature was available for use by market
participants and that if it became overused, that it would eventually
come under scrutiny by the market compliance police.  I also wondered if
people could use this to change spreads in such a way as to improve
their overall positions.  I also figured that for the most part there is
no such thing as ""artificially"" high prices since  in my opinion the
market design itself is somewhat artificial.   But now I know the
truth..it's a flaw, it was overlooked and there is no
protection...amazing.

=0F""I certainly do not agree with [George] Sladoje's interpretation of the
PX tariff (that overscheduling across a path constitutes improper
implementation of a generator schedule, which therefore constitutes a
violation of the tariff).   Also I believe that it is completely
inappropriate for the burden of proper functioning of the market to rest
on the shoulders of the market participants (i.e. if someone types in an
incorrect schedule in their PX Trade Application, the market should not
blowup) .  The responsibility of a properly functioning market lies with
the market operator (PX) itself.  PX software should validate that the
proper mechanics have been used by the market participants.

=0F""By the way, it wasn't us who caused this situation, and of course we
would prefer to pay low PX energy prices rather than high, but if we
review this situation and retroactively recreate prices, then perhaps
all other cases in which congestion at tie-points caused high prices
should also be reviewed to see if they are ""real"".

=0F""By the way, typically, I would not respond to this sort of thing due to
time constraints, however, some of our recent involvement in other
ISO/PXs has highlighted the contrasts between California and other
ISO/PXs.  Each of them, including California, has its strengths and
weaknesses, however, it's in California where the unusual is the norm.=0F""

I sent Ken=0F's letter to George, and his staff at the PX, and George wrote
back the following:

=0F""Because the incident of May 25 is the subject of an official
investigation by the PX Compliance unit, I cannot comment on the
specifics of this matter at this time.  It is likely that the CalPX
Market Monitoring Committee will be involved in the investigation and
the results will likely be presented to the CalPX Board of Governors.
As to the issue of a design flow in the overall California marketplace
--- we are currently reviewing this issue and have requested that the
ISO do the same.

=0F""I disagree with the assertion that CalPX Tariff provision 3.3.2 does
not apply here.  In all major exchange operations the institution not
only provides a forum for trading, but also monitors the activities of
its members, both currently and after the fact.  The participants are
expected to follow the rules.  At one of my previous employers, as an
example, (the Chicago Board of Trade), a suspected abuse or a compliant
from another member or customer results in an investigation by the
Office of Investigations and Audits (the counterpart of CalPX=0F's
Compliance unit).  Depending on the nature of the issue, the
investigation results are presented to the Floor Governors Committee,
Business Conduct Committee or the Financial Compliance Committee.  These
bodies then determine if additional investigation is warranted and if
the issue requires Board of Director action.

=0F""Similarly, the CalPX has the obligation to investigate and take actions
against participants who violate tariff provisions.  Our recently filed
sanction=0F's protocol formalizes the process further and describes a
series of penalties which can be imposed.  Therefore, we believe our
tariff does provide adequate protection.

=0F""Finally, as to whether a comparable event has occurred in the past ---
this will be part of the investigation process and a review of market
design.  Obviously, impact schedule submissions above ATC limits have
happened as a result of free and open markets.  Congestion has become an
almost regular occurrence.  The real issues under investigation in this
incident are magnitude, intent and materiality of impact on our
marketplace.=0F""

Thank you, both Ken and George for those comments.  I am sure we will
hear from other members on the issue.  Lori, don=0F't be silent.  You
started this thing.

Speaking of market design (segues, I am very big on segues this week),
old warrior, dear friend,  and defender of the just, Carl Imparato had a
few things to say about the ISO=0F's proposed utilization of ex post GMMs.
Carl wrote:

=0F""Yesterday, [the ISO Market Analysis Unit] stated that not implementing
after-the-fact GMMs would be a departure from the original vision of the
California market structure.

=0F""Ex post GMMs were NOT a part of the market structure.  When I was at
PG&E and we were developing the tariff in early 1997, no one (not at
PG&E, SCE or any other market participant, to my knowledge) ever
advocated ex post GMMs, and they were NOT included in the tariff.   I
don't recall the words ""state estimator"" (for calculation such GMMs)
ever being uttered by anyone in a WEPEX stakeholder meeting.

=0F""It was only somewhere in mid-1997, when Alex was working on UFE
equations, that Alex (I believe) suddenly came up with the proposal for
ex post GMMs, and the proposal was taken by ISO very quickly (before it
had ANY discussion in SCUG or any other forum), and was adopted by the
ISO Board (or whatever group passed for the Board at that time).
Immediately thereafter, virtually everyone in SCUG .  We were ignored.

=0F""But even in early 1998, we informally agreed that, in light of the
facts (that after-the-fact GMMs were not part of the original ""deal""),
after-the-fact GMM implementation would be given low priority and we
would be given opportunity to discuss this issue before ISO moved
forward.=0F""

I remember those discussions, Carl.  I wonder if deals made in 1998 have
any meaning today?

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The SCE Pilot Forwards Program, a continuing saga for WPTF,  popped up
again this week.  I visited with Commissioner Bilas on Monday to
encourage him to stay the course, and support the ALJ=0F's preliminary
decision to reject SCE=0F's Application, and cancel the hearings on legal
and procedural grounds.  Dick said that he supported that notion, but he
couldn=0F't guarantee that all his colleagues would.

Alas, two days later, Commissioner Joe Neeper, who clearly had too much
time on his hands this week, issued a public statement which is long,
but here is a taste:

=0F""ALJ Hale=0F's Proposed Decision (PD) is structured so that a ""Yes"" vote
will terminate the proceeding and a ""No"" vote will continue the
proceeding to hearings and ultimate resolution.=01;=01; I have concerns wit=
h
the PD.=01; However, I do not intend to issue an alternate because, should
my concerns not be addressed, I have the option to vote ""No"" which would
have the same effect as the alternate I otherwise would have written....

=0F""If we vote to allow this application to move to hearings, we can later
determine whether the Application should be approved on overall policy
grounds.  The PD dismisses the Application on the grounds that does not
comply with what is known as the buy/sell requirement for utilities to
sell all of their generation into, and purchase all of their energy
needs for their bundled customers out of, the PX.=01; I agree with the ALJ
and the Assigned Commissioner that the Application also must be
compatible with the buy-sell requirement in order to be approved, and
that this threshold decision is therefore necessary.....

=0F""The PD concludes that the Application makes SCE=0F's customers more
vulnerable to market power abuse.=01;In viewing the comments of parties, I
find the concern about market power abuse to be expressed best by
Western Power Trading Forum (WPTF) in its opening brief.=01; WPTF states on
page 7 that, under SCE=0F's proposal, ""ESPs will no longer be able to
compete with utilities on the basis of short-run incremental costs in an
open setting"" as envisioned by the PPD.=01;Thus, ""ESPs would find it
increasingly more difficult to compete with an Edison price which was
neither derived from a transparent PX price nor reflective of the retail
market in which ESPs must participate.""  ... The PX price is determined
in an open setting, and would continue to be determined in an open
setting under SCE=0F's proposal....I cannot find that the proposal would
violate the PPD by necessarily leading to abuse of market power.  Market
power concerns should be considered, and weighed against consumer and
other interests.=01; These issues certainly can be explored in greater
depth as policy matters in hearings.

=0F""I do not believe the Application by SCE is in violation of the
Commission=0F's Preferred Policy Decision.=01; The merits of the Applicatio=
n
should be considered through the hearing process and voted upon by the
Commissioners. =0F""

Well, Mr Neeper, justice isn=0F't free.  A hearing is expensive, and what
your are doing is raising the ante of staying in the
game,unnecessarily.  That supports the incumbents (UDCs), and hurts us.

At the time I am writing this Burrito, I do not know if the Commission
took action on this matter today, or punted it to the July 8 meeting.
I=0F'll keep you posted, next week.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

I am sure most of you have seen the press releases which came out last
week.  First, Dynegy and Illinova are merging, and, second, NEV is being
purchased by AES.  Both Dynegy and NEV are Voting members of WPTF.  I
was going to send Illinova a solicitation letter to join WPTF, but now I
think I=0F'll take that off my =0F""to do=0F""list.

In the NEV deal, the AES Corporation announced that it  has entered into
a definitive agreement to acquire New Energy Ventures  in a transaction
valued at approximately $90 million. AES will acquire all of the
outstanding shares of New  Energy Ventures from its current owners,
UniSource Energy Corporation. and New Energy Holdings, L.L.C. (which is
owned by senior  management of New Energy Ventures).

This is an incredible coincidence.  I was just telling someone, I think
it was Dan Douglass, that we ought to give a special award to Nancy Day
of NEV, who is a big fan of the Burrito, and quite possibly, although I
am not certain, one of the senior managers of that lucky corporation.
Well, heck, she has been at NEV from the beginning, so she deserves all
the financial success in the world, and we wish her well.   I just want
to share with all our Burrito readers that WPTF, a tax-exempt,
non-profit corporation, Tax ID 94-3296987, right here in the State of
California, soon to be a CalQED award winner, is looking for donors for
the soon-to-be-announced Executive Director=0F's fund.  Some of you might
not know about this new [slush] fund. It is intended to provide all the
necessary tools and ancillary needs of late night policy pow wows
attended by the usual wonks and otherwise homeless lobbyists who invade
my private hotel room during the WPTF general meeting, and who want to
discuss high level stuff all through the night.  What=0F's an executive
director to do?  So, Nancy, I was just thinking, we could launch this
program in your honor, with your name all over the thing, and get this
very important and much needed program in place.  At least it will pay
for a hotel room for Curtis who consistently falls asleep during these
meetings on my hotel-room couch while Beth Emery is lecturing him.

By the way, if, God forbid, the deal falls through, then forget I wrote
all this.

Have a great weekend.  Think quality.

		 Subject: Draft DASH for CMP Standard Offer Deal

John, thanks for the update. I sat down with John Lavorato and Dana Davis 
this morning to review the deal and get John's approval under the current 
terms. He has approved the deal in it's current form however, to the extent 
that we have any material change in the terms I'll need to be sure he's OK 
with the changes in advance of any binding committment with Central Maine. 
This is definitely a deal we want to do and given the anticipated 
acceleration in the negotiations and possible execution, we need to be sure 
that we're able to react and transact quickly. Dana Davis is obviously on 
point for all pricing. For all others who have involvement here - please 
ensure that you're on board with your piece of the deal as is, and available 
to focus on any negotiated changes that may come up over the next couple of 
days. Berney Aucoin will be on point for coordinating and managing all 
internal pricing, approvals, etc., so be sure that Bernie can get ahold of 
you if he needs to.  

Also, for the DASH signatures, why don't you move both Kevin and I to 
""Regional Management"" and let Ader and Davis sign for Origination and 
Trading. 

Thanks and good luck!

Subject: Draft DASH for CMP Standard Offer Deal

All:

As some of you may be aware, we are in the process of negotiating with 
Central Maine Power Company regarding the assumption of a portion of their 
wholesale obligations associated with their Standard Offer Service load in 
the State of Maine, covering at least March 1, 2001 - Feb 28, 2002.   We are 
currently in the process of negotiating a contract and transaction terms.  
They are simultaneously discussing same with other suppliers.  At this point, 
there are a number of outstanding items (including numerous contract items 
and credit arrangements).  However, we expect that the pace of the 
negotiation process will be very quick over the next 1-3 days.   As an 
example of how quickly things might move, CMP has indicated that the Maine 
PUC is poised to hold deliberations and approve CMP's signing of a contract 
within 24 hours of CMP/Enron agreement on contract terms (with updated firm 
pricing to be supplied just prior to PUC deliberations and held open for 
about 2-3 hours).

Key members of our negotiating team on this deal are as follows:

Origination/Marketing:  John Llodra, George Wood
Legal:  Janice Moore
Regulatory/Governmental:  Daniel Allegretti
Commodity Structuring:  Jim Meyn, Zach Sampson
Credit:  Edward Sacks, Tracy Ngo

Attached below is a draft of the DASH for this prospective deal.  Items 
subject to change or still under negotiation are noted.   While this DASH is 
prepared assuming we obtain a multi-year extension swaption, there is a 
chance it may end up being a single year deal for the period Mar 1, 01- Feb 
28, 02.   My intent in sending the DASH at this time is to familiarize you 
all with the aspects of the deal at this point in time, to enable us to move 
quickly to get internal approvals in the event we reach final agreement with 
CMP over the next couple of days.  Once agreement is reached with CMP on 
outstanding items, a revised DASH will be circulated.  Please feel free to 
call me at 978-449-9936, or Jim Meyn/Berney Aucoin in structuring (5-3223, 
3-4784) if you have any questions on the commercial structure or valuation to 
date.  Thanks.

Regards
John

I have attached ready-to-file drafts of the letters necessary to terminate 
EPMI's Participation Agreement with the CalPX.  In addition to the letter to 
the CalPX, I am reasonably certain that a FERC filing is required to 
terminate the Participation Agreement because it is a power purchase/sale 
agreement, the form of which is on file with FERC.  Just to be safe I 
prepared the transmittal letter, notice of termination, and notice of filing 
necessary to file with FERC.  Among other things, I requested waiver of the 
60-day notice period.

I'll wait for further instruction before doing anything else on this matter.

Dear Elizabeth:

     How are you?  You still owe me one for missing my panel last October!
We've been doing some work for EBS, which has been very interesting.

     We have a client that is interested in trading SO2 and NOX allowances 
with
you guys.  I would appreciate it if you would send me copies of the agreements
you use so I can forward them to our client.  Thanks.

Just to be sure we are working with the ""latest form"" of Enron guaranty, 
could you get from Tana the most current swap one and the check it agaianst 
the one we use for EEI - I would think they should be the same;  if not, lets

Subject: State Restructuring: CA PUC Adopts DWR Regulations,
Re-Regulates Utility Generation


California PUC Adopts DWR Regulations, Re-Regulates Utility Generation
DWR power to go only to SCE and PG&E customers, for now
Obligates SCE and PG&E to make DWR whole for its unrecovered costs
Re-regulates all generation retained by the 3 IOUs
Each to file cost-based rates
Rate base to be net depreciated book value, less recovered stranded costs
The California PUC adopted emergency regulations for the delivery and
payment mechanisms the state*s Department of Water Resources (DWR) will use
in fulfilling its electric purchase and sale obligations under emergency
bill AB 1X.  Under the provisions of AB 1X, which the PUC apparently had
confidence would be enacted without significant change, the PUC requires the
DWR to sell the power it purchases directly to the retail end use customers
of Southern California Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E).
Since the law requires the PUC to ensure that DWR recovers all of the costs
of its power purchase program and yet also limits the recovery to only an
allocable portion of the utilities* currently frozen energy charges, the PUC
recognizes the possibility that DWR*s costs may not be fully recovered at
certain times.  The PUC makes SCE and PG&E liable to pay any shortfalls to
ensure DWR recovers its costs on as current a basis as possible, but
suggests it is open to further consideration of this policy.
URG Assets Re-Regulated
The PUC orders the three utilities to each make *Advice Letter* filings to
establish cost-based rates for their URG.  The rate set will be made
retroactive to whenever the utility stopped bidding its retained generation
into to the PX, which SCE and PG&E said they stopped doing on 12/28/00.  The
two utilities said they stopped participating in the PX day-of and day-ahead
markets on 01/19/01.
The PUC directs the utilities to calculate their cost of capital-related
revenue requirements using the amounts in their respective Transition Cost
Balancing Accounts (TCBA) as the rate base.  The TCBA reflects the net book
value of utility generation assets less the recovery of those assets*
stranded costs.  The PUC will allow utilities to record in a memorandum
account the difference between this reduced rate of return component of
revenue requirements and their last PUC authorized rate of return for the
same assets, for possible future use in adjusting the TCBA-based rates.  The
amounts in these memorandum accounts will represent the difference between
their current allowed returns and what they *may have earned had these
generation costs been recovered under traditional cost of service ratemaking
in place prior to restructuring.*  The cost-based rates so determined, the
PUC says, would comply with the principle that ratepayers pay just and
reasonable rates, and as costs change would be subject to adjustment.
The PUC decides that SCE, PG&E, and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) should
use their *utility retained generation* (URG) in the following order, to: 1)
serve their existing customers at cost-of-service based rates; 2) sell power
at cost-based rates to other California investor-owned utilities; and 3)
sell or barter excess power from URG to minimize future costs.  The PUC
directs that if any surplus generation exists, it should first be offered to
other California IOUs at cost-based rates, with any net proceeds to benefit
in-state ratepayers.  URG consists of utility-owned generation and long-term
purchased power contracts.
Since the December 15, 2000 order from the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) ending the investor-owned utilities* obligation to sell
all of their energy produced through the Power Exchange (PX) and buy all of
their energy requirements from the PX (the so-called *buy/sell
requirement*), utilities had no regulatory direction for using and pricing
their retained generation.  In lieu of an evidentiary hearing, because of
the need to protect the public interest during this time of nearly
continuous Stage 3 supply emergencies, the PUC now provides this direction.
The PUC makes SDG&E a party to the URG aspects of its order, while the PUC
does not apply the DWR delivery and pricing rules to SDG&E, at this time.
The AB 1X law does not exclude SDG&E*s retail customers from receiving DWR
power, but the PUC opts not to require DWR power to go them at this time.

In this interim order adopted on 01/31/01, the PUC says it does not end the
rate freeze, set an interim valuation, or otherwise provide a basis for
ending the rate freeze.  As far as it addresses the pricing and use of
utilities* retained generation, the order only sets an interim basis for
pricing the power utilities continue to produce and provide to their
customers since the effectively defunct PX no longer fulfills this function.

Residual Pricing of DWR Power
Because of the provisions of AB 1X, which was enacted the day after the PUC
adopted its order, the PUC must price DWR power residually, or as a
percentage of what each SCE and PG&E retail end use customer currently pays
them for energy.  The utilities* energy charges are currently frozen at
different levels for each utility and each customer class.  The percentage
is calculated by dividing (1) the amount of power provided by DWR and
delivered by the utility, by (2) the total amount of power generated or
purchased by the utility and the amount of power in item (1).  The amount of
power purchased by the utility includes purchases from QFs and others for
resale, as well as any energy they purchase in the ISO*s real time market.
This percentage or ratio will be calculated daily.
The PUC provides the following example, if a utility generates and purchases
750 MWh of power and delivers along with it 250 MWh of DWR power for a total
of 1,000 MWh, each customer owes DWR 25% of the energy charge in their rates
for the power they used that day.
Utilities will collect these amounts from customers on behalf of DWR and
hold the amounts in trust for DWR.
As the law requires the calculation of the amounts to be collected on the
basis of the megawatt hours DWR actually purchases and delivers, while
calculating the amounts it is entitled to recover from utilities* retail
customers in dollars of costs, there is a built in potential for DWR*s costs
to be under recovered, depending on how the actual price DWR pays for each
MWh matches up with the utilities* existing, frozen energy charges.
The PUC says that making the utilities liable for any shortfall in the
recovery of DWR*s costs *satisfies the legislative concern that the State
recover the funds expended.*  If the two cash-strapped, nearly bankrupt
utilities are liable for substantial amounts to make DWR whole, these
amounts would likely only add to the approximately $12 billion in unpaid,
overdue purchased power costs they have already accumulated.
Following the provisions of AB 1X, the PUC sets the DWR price of power upon
resale as equal to DWR*s purchased power costs, plus administrative costs,
transmission and scheduling costs, and other related costs, less any
overpayments DWR may subsequently recover from suppliers.
Again following the provisions of AB 1X, the PUC directs DWR to retain title
to its power until sold to the utilities* retail end use customers, and
reminds that under the new statute *neither the full faith and credit nor
the taxing power of the State of California may be pledged for the payment
for any obligation.*  The PUC orders the two cash-strapped utilities to
deliver DWR power to retail customers and directs the utilities to take no
ownership or other interest in DWR power, acting only in an administrative
capacity as billing agents for DWR.
The PUC*s interim order is posted on its web site at:

stabilization cases, Application numbers 00-11-038 and 00-11-056, of which

Subject: State Restructuring: CA PUC Adopts DWR Regulations,
Re-Regulates Utility Generation


California PUC Adopts DWR Regulations, Re-Regulates Utility Generation
DWR power to go only to SCE and PG&E customers, for now
Obligates SCE and PG&E to make DWR whole for its unrecovered costs
Re-regulates all generation retained by the 3 IOUs
Each to file cost-based rates
Rate base to be net depreciated book value, less recovered stranded costs
The California PUC adopted emergency regulations for the delivery and
payment mechanisms the state*s Department of Water Resources (DWR) will use
in fulfilling its electric purchase and sale obligations under emergency
bill AB 1X.  Under the provisions of AB 1X, which the PUC apparently had
confidence would be enacted without significant change, the PUC requires the
DWR to sell the power it purchases directly to the retail end use customers
of Southern California Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E).
Since the law requires the PUC to ensure that DWR recovers all of the costs
of its power purchase program and yet also limits the recovery to only an
allocable portion of the utilities* currently frozen energy charges, the PUC
recognizes the possibility that DWR*s costs may not be fully recovered at
certain times.  The PUC makes SCE and PG&E liable to pay any shortfalls to
ensure DWR recovers its costs on as current a basis as possible, but
suggests it is open to further consideration of this policy.
URG Assets Re-Regulated
The PUC orders the three utilities to each make *Advice Letter* filings to
establish cost-based rates for their URG.  The rate set will be made
retroactive to whenever the utility stopped bidding its retained generation
into to the PX, which SCE and PG&E said they stopped doing on 12/28/00.  The
two utilities said they stopped participating in the PX day-of and day-ahead
markets on 01/19/01.
The PUC directs the utilities to calculate their cost of capital-related
revenue requirements using the amounts in their respective Transition Cost
Balancing Accounts (TCBA) as the rate base.  The TCBA reflects the net book
value of utility generation assets less the recovery of those assets*
stranded costs.  The PUC will allow utilities to record in a memorandum
account the difference between this reduced rate of return component of
revenue requirements and their last PUC authorized rate of return for the
same assets, for possible future use in adjusting the TCBA-based rates.  The
amounts in these memorandum accounts will represent the difference between
their current allowed returns and what they *may have earned had these
generation costs been recovered under traditional cost of service ratemaking
in place prior to restructuring.*  The cost-based rates so determined, the
PUC says, would comply with the principle that ratepayers pay just and
reasonable rates, and as costs change would be subject to adjustment.
The PUC decides that SCE, PG&E, and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) should
use their *utility retained generation* (URG) in the following order, to: 1)
serve their existing customers at cost-of-service based rates; 2) sell power
at cost-based rates to other California investor-owned utilities; and 3)
sell or barter excess power from URG to minimize future costs.  The PUC
directs that if any surplus generation exists, it should first be offered to
other California IOUs at cost-based rates, with any net proceeds to benefit
in-state ratepayers.  URG consists of utility-owned generation and long-term
purchased power contracts.
Since the December 15, 2000 order from the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) ending the investor-owned utilities* obligation to sell
all of their energy produced through the Power Exchange (PX) and buy all of
their energy requirements from the PX (the so-called *buy/sell
requirement*), utilities had no regulatory direction for using and pricing
their retained generation.  In lieu of an evidentiary hearing, because of
the need to protect the public interest during this time of nearly
continuous Stage 3 supply emergencies, the PUC now provides this direction.
The PUC makes SDG&E a party to the URG aspects of its order, while the PUC
does not apply the DWR delivery and pricing rules to SDG&E, at this time.
The AB 1X law does not exclude SDG&E*s retail customers from receiving DWR
power, but the PUC opts not to require DWR power to go them at this time.

In this interim order adopted on 01/31/01, the PUC says it does not end the
rate freeze, set an interim valuation, or otherwise provide a basis for
ending the rate freeze.  As far as it addresses the pricing and use of
utilities* retained generation, the order only sets an interim basis for
pricing the power utilities continue to produce and provide to their
customers since the effectively defunct PX no longer fulfills this function.

Residual Pricing of DWR Power
Because of the provisions of AB 1X, which was enacted the day after the PUC
adopted its order, the PUC must price DWR power residually, or as a
percentage of what each SCE and PG&E retail end use customer currently pays
them for energy.  The utilities* energy charges are currently frozen at
different levels for each utility and each customer class.  The percentage
is calculated by dividing (1) the amount of power provided by DWR and
delivered by the utility, by (2) the total amount of power generated or
purchased by the utility and the amount of power in item (1).  The amount of
power purchased by the utility includes purchases from QFs and others for
resale, as well as any energy they purchase in the ISO*s real time market.
This percentage or ratio will be calculated daily.
The PUC provides the following example, if a utility generates and purchases
750 MWh of power and delivers along with it 250 MWh of DWR power for a total
of 1,000 MWh, each customer owes DWR 25% of the energy charge in their rates
for the power they used that day.
Utilities will collect these amounts from customers on behalf of DWR and
hold the amounts in trust for DWR.
As the law requires the calculation of the amounts to be collected on the
basis of the megawatt hours DWR actually purchases and delivers, while
calculating the amounts it is entitled to recover from utilities* retail
customers in dollars of costs, there is a built in potential for DWR*s costs
to be under recovered, depending on how the actual price DWR pays for each
MWh matches up with the utilities* existing, frozen energy charges.
The PUC says that making the utilities liable for any shortfall in the
recovery of DWR*s costs *satisfies the legislative concern that the State
recover the funds expended.*  If the two cash-strapped, nearly bankrupt
utilities are liable for substantial amounts to make DWR whole, these
amounts would likely only add to the approximately $12 billion in unpaid,
overdue purchased power costs they have already accumulated.
Following the provisions of AB 1X, the PUC sets the DWR price of power upon
resale as equal to DWR*s purchased power costs, plus administrative costs,
transmission and scheduling costs, and other related costs, less any
overpayments DWR may subsequently recover from suppliers.
Again following the provisions of AB 1X, the PUC directs DWR to retain title
to its power until sold to the utilities* retail end use customers, and
reminds that under the new statute *neither the full faith and credit nor
the taxing power of the State of California may be pledged for the payment
for any obligation.*  The PUC orders the two cash-strapped utilities to
deliver DWR power to retail customers and directs the utilities to take no
ownership or other interest in DWR power, acting only in an administrative
capacity as billing agents for DWR.
The PUC*s interim order is posted on its web site at:

For your convenience, attached is an MS Rich Text Format file containing
this analysis and full summary.
Citation: The PUC approved its interim order, Decision 01-01-061, adopting
emergency regulations on the delivery and payment mechanism for DWR power
and directing utilities on the use and pricing of utility retained
generation on January 31, 2001, in SCE and PG&E*s consolidated rate
stabilization cases, Application numbers 00-11-038 and 00-11-056, of which
SDG&E is a party.

We closed two option deals with TVA last week.  They have sent the following 
comments on our standard confirms. 

Dave - Rogers has already commented on the 16 hour call.  His comment was 
that this is a 16 hour call, all or none, not up to 16 hours.  Secondly, the 
option is exercisable in 50 MW blocks (increments of 50MW) not a minimum of 
50 MW.  Please look at the rest of the language and let me know your 
thoughts.  Thanks.

Ed-  there are some credit additions on page 3 under credit assurance.  Let 
me know what you think.

Thanks guys.

-Joe

David,

TVA's proposed credit assurance language should be amended to reflect our 
standard language with the downgrade event being established at BBB- or 
Baa3.  Also, your redline should also delete any subjectivity which provides 
the TVA the unilateral right to call for additional or replacement 
collateral.  In looking at historical agreements (i.e. master options 
agreement), our standard credit provisions have been accepted.  I will 
forward another email with their prefered gty form.  It appears that we 
currently have outgoing gtys; however, they govern certain agreements like 
the Master Options Agmt.  Comments or questions, please call.

Hi John

Thanks for the  offer but despite what you say, your legal prowess is still 
far more important to me - I would likely have ceased working long ago w/out  
LLGM.  I rode up on the elevator with Jeff Skilling and he asked me if I 
still liked my job.  I first asked if I had a choice and then confessed it 
could be better.  I don't think I won many points with him, particularly when 
I asked him if he liked his job.  Oh well, any connections there?

I'm sending out documents tonight on the utility exposure by confirm to you 
and Jim.  I can talk to you and Jim about that as well as offset with the 
commandeered positions anytime on Wed morning.  Let me know what time works 
for you."

The discussion regarding the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 with 
Ken Raisler of Sullivan and Cromwell has been scheduled for 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. 
in Sandalwood Rooms A & B of the downtown Hyatt Regency Hotel (sorry, we will 
not be serving lunch).

Attorneys and legal specialists in the swaps/Enron Net Works group are 
strongly encouraged to attend.

Each of the attorneys should have already received a package that includes 
the complete text of the CFMA, as well as the text of the Commodity Exchange 
Act, black-lined to show how it has been revised by the CFMA.  Please let me 
know if you have not received this package.

Sometime next week I will give Ken a broad outline of topics we would like to 
cover.  Please e-mail me with your thoughts in this regard.  Thanks -- Bob

Hi Cregg

Got your email - I don't know of any openings now but will certainly keep my 
eyes and ears open, and if I hear of anything I will let you know.  Good luck 
to you in your search - with your self realizations in tow (cynicism is 
always appreciated and confidence is a boon) , I'm sure an even better 
opportunity will present itself.

Hi John 

You must have told CA to take a rest while you were in Florida - all was 
quiet and now my office is now clean (I didn't know what to do with my time 
so....).  Now that you are back,  I'm wondering if my peace and quiet will be 
shattered. Meanwhile,  I hope you and your family had a wonderful break.

And back to work, we are meeting on Tues morning at  900 Houston time to 
discuss block forward trades - do you think you can participate?  If not, no 
big deal.  Talk to you soon."

Elizabeth,  Here are my comments.  Need you to add an Insurance Section.  
Also, throughout the PPA I asked you to add comments or clarify a few 
sections.  If you can add your comments today, lets meet first thing 
tommorrow to discuss (leave me a message tonight and I will come in early to 
read before we meet).  I didn't bother with the Green Sharing Agreement since 
we have not completed going through it with Wind.

Thanks, - Mike

EPMI/Comed capacity deal was never filed (EPMI has no current requirement to 
file). The owner of the facility never filed anything on the assumption that 
there was an oral, short term arrangement.  FERC requires approval for 
assignments in excess of $50,000.  Does this help?"

Hi Andy

I will speak on any panel, but my preference would be the  1st panel and I 
would speak on the CA experience and how EEI helps.  Also, I'd be happy to do 
products on day 2.  Hope all is well and look forward to seeing you soon.

PS Thanks so much for the plant - it is resting comfortably in my office and 
reminds me of all the times at EEI meetings and the wonderful friends I have 
met during this process."

Andy

I would be happy to do product/Into discussion as well.

I'll talk to Tracy but don't think she can make it from Portland to speak.  
If you need a speaker for the credit support annex I could help or maybe 
another Houston based credit person (I'll check to see if we have any any one 
available)

I'll be out of the office on the 7th (I'm speaking at ISDA as well as eye 
surgery in am so..   but I'm sure David Portz could show you the Enron 
building. His number is 713 853 9239.

There is an internal political risk that if we send out this letter the way 
it is written, Legal will be blamed for terminating a lucrative trading 
relationship.  I would like to manage this risk by putting back into the 
letter a bunch of self serving nonesense that will make it easier for the CRC

things we could talk about on Tues.  An unproofed draft of the brief 
presentation will be sent to you by my assistant.  Please feel free to mark 
up, delete or supplement.  On Mon when we talk and divy up parts , each 
person can then finish out the presentation as they want it.  .

 Dede I'll call you on Monday at 930 and then we can conference Harlan in.   
Thanks for everybody's help and have a great weekend."

I understand that the procedure for getting a flat screen is to request, 
possibly plead, although not confirmed, with your supervisor and if he/she 
agrees, to send a copy of the email to Janette Elbertson, who will then 
permit the release of a flat screen to such poor wretched individuals.
 
Following the above procedure, please could I have a flat screen? At the 
moment I have borrowed one as the procedure stalled at the first hurdle last 
time due to ""masterly inaction"".

CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY/CLIENT INFORMATION
NOT DISCOVERABLE

Two years after PCA's bankruptcy, we received a demand letter from PCA.  PCA 
claims that EPMI owes PCA $15,126,445.16 for damages resulting from EPMI's 
wrongful termination of transactions in June 1998.  This amount appears to be 
based on PCA's calculation of the forward values of the terminated trades, 
and certain ""preference payments"" that PCA claims were made to EPMI.  This 
claim is in its preliminary stages.  I will update you with further 
information as soon as we get a handle on what the Trustee is really 
seeking.  As you will remember, we currently have a proof of claim pending 
against PCA for over $5 million dollars representing our unpaid receivable 
amount.

Bill

In connection with this matter, it would be very helpful if you could have 
someone gather the following information:

1.  Date and amount of last payment made by PCA, splitting the relative net 
amounts owed to and from EPMI (I would assume that payment for April 
deliveries was made - accordingly, I would assume that the last payment we 
received from PCA would have been around May 20th).

2.  Total amount of MWH delivered to PCA but for which PCA never paid for.

3.  The details of how you calculated the net MTM exposure of the terminated 
transactions (pursuant to an email to me dated July 27, 1998 you had 
calculated the MTM as of July 7, 1998 at $3,772,939)

As always, thanks for your help."

		 Subject: Cinergy and Enron Transaction



 Attached is a draft of the three party agreement between PGET, Enron
and Cinergy.  My understanding is that it is with respect to 75 MWh and I
have drafted it accordingly.  I have used the format which we and Enron have
previously used.

 In addition to your review of the Agreement generally, I need
specifically a copy of the two confirms for the Enron/PGET transactions
being terminated and I need to know the settlement payment.  Also, the
appropriate reference to the existing Enron/Cinergy needs to be included.
What will be the effective date for the assignment/termination?  I know we
want to sign this tomorrow, but how quickly can it be implemented.

 Please forward internally within your organization as necessary to

I'm not sure - I kind of think we need to keep going to some of these 
meetings, if nothing else to educate the industry and to listen to the 
western crowd.  With limited resources we will need to figure out which ones 
but ...  Talk to you later

Dede Russo plans to prepare a presentation on the optional provisions that 
were assigned to members of the drafting committee last October.  Other than 
the CAISO Firm Energy and Patty's arbitation provisoin, we have not received  
additional language.  Dede is going to put together a handout by next 
Tuesday, if she does not receive any provisions from those listed below, she 
will use Reliant's language.  It would be presented for illustrative 
purposes, but could sway the audience.  Here is your chance to get your 
organization's preferred provisions out at the conference.  So, send your 
draft provisions to me and Dede by cob on Friday 3/16 please.  For those who 
may have forgotten, these are the assignments:

Prior Transactions:  Liz
Unilateral Contract:  MartyJo (sucessor in interest to Buddy Broussard)
New Taxes:  Fritz
Reg Out:  Randy/John
New Products:  Dede will handle this
Collateral Annex:  will be a separate panel

Dear Elizabeth:

Here are several sections of the current protocols.   These are from the ones 
filed Jan 5, 2001 and from what i understand are the ones that were adopted 
by the PUCT.   You may want to verify that with Jean Ryall

Section 16.2.5 is the credit section.  I will send you the other information

In order to standardize confidentiality agreements within the Power Group, at 
Elizabeth's request, please use the following forms.

1.  Unilateral Confidentiality Agreement - Counterparty Protected. (Form 
location:  Power Forms Database)  (To be used prior to commencing a trading 
relationship when EPMI needs to evaluate the prospective CP's financial, load 
or other similar information.  Thereafter, the confidentiality provisions in 
the Master and, if applicable,  the Confirmation, should protect 
Transaction-specific data. )

2.  Unilateral Confidentiality Agreement - Enron Protected.  (Form location:  
Attorney Forms Database, Document No. 1100.2).  (To be used when only EPMI is 
supplying confidential information.  Note:  This is the standard Finance 
Group Form and needs to be tailored first, i.e. by changing the Enron 
entity's name to ""EPMI"", by defining the ""Transaction"", etc...)

3.  Bilateral Confidentiality Agreement.  (Form Location:  Attorney Forms 
Database, Document No. 1100.3) (To be used when  two-way confidentiality 
protection is required.  Again note that because this is a standard Finance 
Group Form, it must be similarly tailored.  It also contains an optional 
Chinese Wall provision.)

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at x57400."

Bruce and Mike:

Attached please find the most recent versions of the Frontera Energy 
Marketing Services Agreement and the companion Master Power Purchase and Sale 
Agreement.  Eric and Frank asked that I forward these to you.  Please be 
advised that these are still under review at TECO, but reflect the most 
recent discussions concerning this arrangement.

You will note that I have made some changes to the Master Power Purchase and 
Sale Agreement to reflect the relationship being established under the Energy 
Services Agreement and to harmonize the terms of that agreement with the 
overall business relationship being established.  Please recognize that there 
are likely to be further revisions following additional review.

I look forward to concluding this arrangement in the next several days.

** PRIVATE **

Set forth is a brief summary of my call with John Pirog last night.  Overall, 
I felt we made a lot of progress.  At the end of the call, Pirog said that 
prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was possible, but at the 
end he said that he thought we could probably work through a number of the 
issues and he said he was going to send some sample language for our 
consideration on a few of the points.  We said that we would be begin to 
modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts we spoke about and 
that we could then ""compare notes.""  He said that CDWR viewed the Enron 
Contract as an important one and he said he would be back to us fairly 
quickly.

Material Regulatory Change Provision.  Pirog said CDWR would be willing to 
accept such a provision if it were limited to an event that adversely affects 
CDWR's ability to perform under the contract, most particularly its ability 
to pay for power.  (Such an event likely would be a CA legislature or 
regulatory generated change).  Pirog said he thought that CDWR would agree to 
a termination payment if this occurred, although they may not want the MRC to 
be characterized as a ""default"" (which should not be a problem from our 
standpoint).   CDWR would not be willing to protect EPMI for a change (e.g., 
in law) that materially affects EPMI's business, but does not adversely 
affect CDWR's ability to make payments to EPMI.  (For example, a new CA law 
that requires sellers into CA to turn over all their books and records to the 
CPUC).  Further, as we anticipated, he said CDWR was not willing to be on the 
hook for a termination payment for an event outside its control, such as a 
FERC change or Federal Legislation that adversely affects us.  However, he 
did say that CDWR might entertain a ""no LD walk right"" for EPMI if such a 
change adversely affected it.  My sense is that ultimately Pirog/CDWR will 
back track on that since such a change could occur when our contract is 
heavily in the money to CDWR and this would allow us an out without paying 
LDs.

Early Walk Provision.  He reiterated that CDWR would not extend the Option.  
With respect to the early walk away right that has been offered, it was 
discussed that this could be structured in such a way that EPMI could walk 
from the deal (without receiving or paying a Termination Payment) up until a 
date certain (September 1 and September 30 were mentioned by me as 
possibilities, although Pirog said that other suppliers had a shorter window) 
(our request is based on the gloomy news that has been eminating from the CA 
Treasurer's office about the bond issue), provided that if the bonds were 
issued earlier than that, the walk away right would terminate; that is, EPMI 
would not be free to walk if CDWR was able to issue bonds with an investment 
grade rating prior to the Drop Dead Date.

Termination Payment Due Date.   Pirog said CDWR cannot shorten it from 180 
days.  He said all other suppliers have lived with that.  Pirog is 
sympathetic to our concerns, but said that the ""bond guys"" are already 
nervous about only having 180 days (if they had to issue bonds to pay the 
LDs).

Suspension of Delivery.  Emphasizing our concern with the 180 days, I 
requested that CDWR provide some flexibility on our right to suspend 
perfromance in the event of an event of default and, perhaps some other 
events, such as a bond downgrade.  Pirog said he thought CDWR could work with 
us on that.

Downgrade not a Default.  CDWR was not willing to have a bond downgrade an 
event of default.  However, he said CDWR would be willing to consider having 
a Downgrade Event a ""no LD walk right"" for EPMI and perhaps an event 
justifying EPMI in suspending deliveries.  In other words, a Downgrade Event 
would be treated like an Event of Default, but no termination payment would 
be owed and EPMI would have the flexibility to suspend performance.  Pirog 
also discussed adding a covenant that CDWR would attempt to secure a Credit 
Rating with respect to the claims paying ability of the Fund in the event 
that no bonds were issued.  That is, if no Bonds were outstanding and the 
Fund did not have an investment grade rating, we could terminate, but without 
LDs.

Cross Defaults.  This clearly is one of CDWR's hot buttons, and we will not 
be able to get this is my sense.  However, when asked about the idea of a 
Cross Default Out w/out a termination payment, he stated that he would like 
to discuss that further with CDWR.

LD Calculation Methodology.  Pirog said it was very unlikely CDWR would 
accept our proposed language.  He said they are striving for consistency 
among contracts and said their proposal is viewed as more ""objective.""  My 
sense is that we will need to get comfortable with it in general.

Arbitration.  In general, Pirog did not have a problem, except for the 
following: a desire to limit it to contractual claims only (i.e., no tort 
actions, extra-contractual disputes, etc. would be subject to it).  Also, 
holding hearings in New York City was not well received, and a request was 
made that all three arbitrators be neutral.  I would think that the situs 
issue will be a big one for Richard Sanders in light of the political 
environment if a dispute were to arise.  My general sense, however, is that 
this is not a ""deal breaker"" for CDWR.

Assignment.  In general, he understood the nature of our changes on this 
issue and said they were reasonable although he caveated that on this issue 
as well they are looking  for some consistency.  We were again asked if 
assignment back to the IOUs would be acceptable, even though he knew what our 
reaction would be.  Pirog offered to provide us sample language, which we 
said we would look at.  We stated that conceptually this would be a difficult 
sell in light of the environment.  He did not elaborate on how stringent the 
assignment standards are in the other deals.

New Govt Charge Pass Throughs.  A pass through of some governmental charges 
was considered to be okay, but he said our proposed language was too broad.  
Pirog offered to provide some examples of acceptable language on this.  He di 
agre, howeve, that if for example, CA imposed an excess profits tax, that it 
was fair for us to be protected from that.

Legal Opinions.  Pirog did not think that a legal opinion from Hawkins would 
be forthcoming, although he did say that he would look into whether or not 
they would be providing one on the bonds.  Also, he said it was a possibility 
that the California Attorney General would issue the opinion on the bonds, so 
we might possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from Hawkins.  
Realistically, it likely will be very difficult to get this before we have to 
extend the option; perhaps, we can put in a covenant on CDWR to get us that 
before our walk right expires.

Additional CDWR Covenants.  Pirog stated that the additional covenants we 
have requested are conceptually okay with him, but need to be discussed 
internally with CDWR.

Pro Rata ""Spread"" Amortization.  Pirog had not reviewed the idea of 
amortizing the Credit Amount over the four year term, and said that he would 
run it by CDWR.

CDWR Information.  Pirog said he would follow up with CDWR on how often it 
plans to give suppliers financial information.  He was resisting our request 
for monthly information, although I pointed out that we really only wanted 
information that frequently in the beginning of the transaction as things 
start to fall into place.

Let me know when you wish to follow up.

John

My goldfish died this weekend - He was with us for over 6 months.  A trusted 
companion for me in the early morning as he sang sweet ""O's"", he looking for 
food and me looking for peace of mind early in the morning before the days' 
voices began.  

Another day today looks like another week which is how this whole past month 
feels.  Hopefully this to will pass.


Looking forward to talking to you soon and seeing you in early April.







ps - Great work on WAPA;  I get the distinct sense that no matter what, CDWR 
will close.   I hear Skilling told Portland that he loves trading and 
promises resources.  Oh my."

All:

Here is a rough first cut at a DASH for a potential deal with NSTAR to serve 
their Default Service.  Jim/Zach - please fill in all relevant numbers 
relating to volume/pricing, etc.   Also - please begin to get RAC in the loop 
with respect to this position and VaR impacts, etc.  Others - please review 
pertinent sections and edit/expand as appropriate.

Timing on this will likely be quick from this point and thus I would like to 
try to have a completed draft by COB today or first thing tomorrow.  We have 
a call with NSTAR tomorrow AM to negotiate the contract, and assuming all 
goes well there, we could be asked to sign a binding agreement by as early as 
Wednesday.

Please call me to discuss.  978-449-9936.  Thanks

John

Another QSE Agreement that is not as high a priority as TECO but needs to get 
to the New Power Company as soon as possible in order to get them into the 
Pilot Program.

Thanks for your assistance with this while David is out.

I haven't stopped crying since I got your email .. Of course I've been crying 
everyday, several hours a day for months now, so it is hard to tell whose to

(maybe you will happen upon another fine hour like when I accidentally killed 
our goldfish on Sunday) or to pick up the ladder."

Just wanted to let you know that all the great work in Blue Range is paying 
off in the US - citing Blue Range, a Houston bankruptcy court correctly 
decided that a gas contract was a forward contract relative to the US safe 
harbor provisions.  If you want a copy of the opinion let me know.

Hope all is well.

		 Subject: Revised Draft


John:  as per your request, attached are revised drafts of the Confirmation 
and Cover Sheet, which are blacklined against the respective documents from 
the short-term deal.  I recognize that you are still reviewing certain 
questions/points with CDWR and there may be some items reflected in this 
draft that neither you nor CDWR has ""signed off"" on.  Nonetheless, in certain 
cases I thought it made sense to provide you with specific contract language 
on some of the points we discussed so that you could clearly see what we may 
be proposing on a particular item.

Please note, in particular, the following:

--on the LD calculation, we reverted to your proposed language on obtaining 
multiple market quotes, etc.  However, after talking to Enron this evening, 
we would like to propose that if quotes cannot be obtained despite the 
parties' good faith efforts to do so, then only in that circumstance would 
the calculation be based on the Non-Defaulting Party's losses.  While, based 
on the product Enron is selling, we anticipate that quotes will be readily 
obtainable, we think it makes sense to revert to the Non-Defaulting Party's 
loss calculation in the highly unlikely event that quotes are not obtainable 
despite using all efforts to do so.  I know that you expressed some 
reservations the other evening that this process potentially could be subject 
to some manipulation.  This is not so.  If CDWR was the Defaulting Party and 
it disputes the loss calculation made by Enron, such dispute would become the 
subject of arbitration.  In such case, the Non-Defaulting Party's would have 
to furnish its historical and current power curves to prove its case.  Since 
those same figures necessarily are needed by Enron to report its trading 
positions on a day to day basis as part of its normal business operations and 
such information feeds directly into its financial reporting statements and 
other relevant financial information, etc. that becomes, in part, part of its 
SEC filings, in a discovery proceeding this information would be very 
transparent.

--with respect to the situs of any arbitration proceeding, Enron strongly 
believes that it is only fair to both parties that this be conducted in a 
neutral site.  The draft provides for New York City, although Enron is open 
to other possible locations.

--the revised draft reflects only the $127/MWh alternative scenario since you 
indicated that, preliminarily, you felt that CDWR would not be likely to 
choose the alternative structure we had discussed.

--we would like to further discuss the effect of an adverse federal 
regulatory change.  I'm sure you can appreciate this in light of the current 
environment, although we would think that freely negotiated bilateral 
contracts would not be subject to the types of changes being discussed.  
Enron is not seeking a termination right with LDs, but would like to further 
discuss a termination right without compensation in the event of a major 
adverse federal development affecting the contract.

--we have dropped our request that Enron have the right to suspend 
performance in the case of a Bond downgrade event.  However, we think it is 
appropriate that if that circumstance occurs, that the due date for payments 
by CDWR should shorten to 7 days and if the Bonds are subsequently upgraded 
that the payment schedule would revert accordingly.

--you requested that we propose a limit on the right of a Non-Defaulting 
Party to suspend its performance in the case of a Default by the Defaulting 
Party.  We included a 60-NERC day limit on such right in the revised draft.  
This is important to Enron as we discussed, particularly in light of Enron's 
acceptance of the 180 day period on the timing of a Termination Payment 
which, as you know, is unheard of in the power sale (or virtually any other) 
arena.  (Nonetheless, we fully understand the position enunciated by the bond 
people on this point).

--on assignment, the Enron commercial people cannot agree to a pre-approved 
right of CDWR to assign the contract to the IOUs.  As we discussed, it may 
very well be the case that at the time any assignment were to be effected 
that Enron may already be at the limit of its overall exposure with those 
counter parties.  It can't be in a position where such an assignment could 
cause it to violate those limits.

--we included an outside date by which Enron must decide whether or not to go 
forward of the first to occur of (1) September 30, 2001 or (2) seven days 
after the Bonds are issued.  You had indicated that CDWR might be willing to 
consider such an ""outside date"" as long as (i) the $127/MWh pricing was in 
effect from April 1 and (2) Enron had to act very shortly after the Bonds are 
issued.  We have proposed 7 days for this.

--in concept, we probably will be ok with the alternative of securing a 
credit rating for the Fund (as opposed to the Bonds), although we have 
referred that question to the credit people to make sure.

--in light of your response about opinions not being provided by outside 
counsel, we modified the confirmation to request that the opinions could be 
from the AG, or if CDWR cannot do that, then from the GC of CDWR.  We felt 
that this would not involve additional work since these presumably will be 
rendered in connection with the Bonds and we provided that they generally 
would be provided to us after the Bonds are issued.

I think the foregoing represent most of the items we had discussed.  Please 
let me know when you wish to discuss.  Also, it may make sense for our next 
call to have the respective Enron and CDWR commercial folks on the call since 
it may be the case that many of the final decisions involved may be 
commercial ones.

Lastly, please note that while we have discussed most of the points addressed 
in the revised drafts with Enron, in order to expedite the process, we are 
sending these drafts simultaneously to you and Enron.  Thus, it is possible 
that Enron may have further modifications or changes to the documents.

Thanks.  We look forward to working with you to finalize the requisite 
documents.

John

To All:

We will hold a meeting of the contract working group at EEI's offices on 
October 9, 2000 from 10am to 4pm.  Lunch will be provided.  We tried to 
schedule a meeting around Power Markets 2001, but EEI does not have space 
available for a large group that week.  A detailed agenda will be sent out 
before the meeting.

If anyone still wants to advise the drafting committee about issues they want 
to address, please do so.  It would be helpful for the drafting committee to 
see what customized terms are being added to your cover sheets.  Please 
forward them to me if you want to help us.  Enjoy the rest of your Summer!

Elisabeth:

I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among 
other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its 
jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) 
made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades 
through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact 
on our standard reps relating to the ""trade options exemption"" and as to the 
parties being ""eligible swap participants"" (are they still required)?  Is 
there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

Mark, Elizabeth & Christian:  I thought you would find this blurb describing 
an article in today's LA Times of particular interest, particularly taking 
into account the magnitude of the talked about rate increases by the 
distribution utilities.  The article does, however, make the link between the 
size of the  possible rate increases and the possibility of a voter 
initiative in CA which, as you know, is an issue that still is on the table 
with CDWR under our proposed contract.  John

CALIF.'S PUC CHIEF TO URGE RATE HIKE
     California's top energy regulator is quoted as saying she
will recommend hiking electricity rates as soon as tomorrow, with
consumers seeing higher utility bills in May, this morning's Los
Angeles Times Reports.
     Dealing directly with grave projections regarding the cost
and supply of power as summer approaches, Loretta Lynch,
president of the California's PUC, noted the rate hikes,
estimated by some sources at 20- to 50-percent, will be
structured so that large energy users, including residential
consumers, will pay the most. Such a structure, she hopes, will
force consumers to save. ""We need to move forward, and the PUC
has substantial evidence [to justify a rate hike] that it didn't
have 90 days ago,"" Lynch, appointed by Gov. Gray Davis to head
the commission, is quoted as saying. Lynch is not apt to take
such a step without the Democratic governor's approval. Davis has
repeatedly noted his opposition to any rate hikes, but Davis
spokesman Steve Maviglio declined to comment, and Lynch would not
elaborate on any talks she had with Davis (Los Angeles Times,
Mar. 26, San Francisco Chronicle, Reuters, Dow Jones Newswires,
Mar. 24 http://www.latimes.com ).

Our current estimate of PX credits thru Mid March is ~$570MM including the 
$269MM we transferred to EPMI in Dec.  I don't expect the rest of March to be 
large, but I'll get you an update asap.

John:  Following up on your voice mail, attached are revised drafts of the 
Confirm and the Master Agreement.  Please note that, as you may recall, 
Elizabeth Sager is out of town today and I have not been able to catch up 
with her to get her views on the things set forth in your e-mail to me, or 
with Christian.  However, we had a brief conversation after our call 
yesterday about some of the points on your ""list"" and I have tried to 
generally work with what you have proposed on a few of the points in light of 
my conversations with Elizabeth and Christian.  Since I have to leave the 
office within an hour or so today, I thought I would forward some proposed 
language on some of the points for your consideration with the hope of 
expediting the process.  These drafts, therefore, are subject to Enron's 
review and comment.

Please call me if you wish to discuss.

John

Here is a brief memo prepared by Dan Watkiss relating to the relationship 
between TVA transmission and marketing.  N

 I will call you later to discuss TVA letter. Kevin does not want to make 
offer to sell at market based rates.  Also want to discuss if there is any 
way we can challenge TVA on the hourly tag problems of last week.

Talk to you soon.

ES--Bob Madden may be interested in this.  If TVA is not formally separated, 
then TVA control area saying it will not retag when EPMI changes the source 
(from ENSE to AEP, for example) and TVA marketing not taking us as an 
upstream if we do that are really interconnected.  Maybe Bob can come up with 
something.

Bill--Does TVA ever buy transmission on any other TP's system?  It must not 
or it would have to file it Practices as a OATT with FERC.  Does TVA just buy 
or sell at its border?  Thanks.

Hi Carol!

Thrilled to hear all is going well.  I would love to play tennis anytime 
(hopefully sooner rather than later so I can take advantage of  that 
lingering fatigue that takes months? years? to abate).  We can play at the 
Met either around lunchtime or sometime after 4:00.  Weekends would also 
work.  Can you play next Tuesday or Wednesday?  Call or write.

See you soon

Elizabeth:

We followed up on our discussions last week regarding the consequences of a 
possible bankruptcy of a municipal counterparty and our ability to terminate 
and liquidate our positions in such event, without regard to the generally 
applicable automatic stay.  Attached is a brief memo discussing this issue.  
The principal points to note are as follows:

(1) Municipalities, if they were to file for bankruptcy, do so under Chapter 
9 of the Bankruptcy Code (""BC"")--e.g., Orange County, CA.

(2) The ""forward contract"" exception to the automatic stay found in Sec. 556 
of the BC presently is not explicitly made applicable to filings pursuant to 
Chapter 9.  As you recall, Sec. 556 allows termination of a forward contract 
because of the commencement of a bankruptcy case notwithstanding the general 
prohibition for termination of executory contracts for such grounds in Sec. 
365.  This appears to have been an oversight when Sec. 556 was added to the 
BC in 1982 (according to the National Bankruptcy Review Commission) and 
probably has not been a ""high on the agenda item"" to correct due to the fact 
that Chapter 9 bankruptcies are relatively rare.

(3) It appears that the other amendments to the BC dealing with forward 
contracts are applicable to Chapter 9, such as Sec. 362 (b) (6) which allows 
the non-defaulting party to setoff or settle without regards to the stay if 
there is an existing default other than an insolvency event.  Also note that 
Colliers on Bankruptcy, the ""Bible"" in this area, suggests that one can 
nonetheless make the argument that the forward contract exception can be read 
to apply to Chapter 9 filings under present law (see also the discussion at 
(6) below)--although it is uncertain whether a bankruptcy court would accept 
this argument to effectively write something into the statute.

(4) There currently is pending legislation that has been passed by both the 
House and the Senate (and is now the subject of a joint House/Senate 
Conference Committee) that would make it clear that the forward contract 
exception to the automatic stay shall apply to Chapter 9 bankruptcies.  
Adding Sec. 556 to Sec. 901 (the section delineating which sections are 
applicable to Chapter 9 bankruptcies) is not controversial and should survive 
the joint conference committee since similar provisions exist in both the 
House and Senate bills. These provisions are part of the overall legislation 
making fundamental changes in the BC (that has received a lot of press and 
which is controversial in terms of how it treats individual consumers filing 
for bankruptcy).  Our sense, however, is that the bill will be passed and 
signed by President Bush.

(5) Assuming the amendments to Chapter 9 filings are enacted, under the 
existing bills they would first become effective for bankruptcy cases filed 
after 180 days after the legislation is signed by the President.  Thus, to 
the extent that ENA has existing contracts with municipalities, ENA would be 
permitted to exercise its termination and liquidation rights thereunder 
without regard to the automatic stay as long as the municipal counter party 
does not file within 6 months after the date the legislation is signed.

(6) It is worth noting that the legislative committee reports describing the 
changes provide that Congress is ""clarifying"" that the forward contract 
provisions of the BC apply to municipal bankruptcies, noting that these 
provisions ""by their terms are intended to apply to all proceedings under 
Title 11"" (which includes Chapter 9 proceedings).  The Senate Report  goes on 
to say that:  ""Although sections...556...provide that they apply in any 
proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, this subsection makes a technical 
amendment in chapter 9 to clarify the applicability of these provisions.""  
(Emphasis added).  Thus, this committee language would appear to support an 
argument that Sec. 556 applies to Chapter 9 bankruptcies under Congress's 
interpretation of existing law--obviously, the hoped for result from ENA's 
standpoint.

(7) For your information, when Orange County, CA, filed for bankruptcy the 
County filed under Chapter 9.  The investment pool that held the derivatives 
and other financial contracts initially also made a separate filing under 
Chapter 9. This filing was dismissed, essentially on the basis the investment 
pool was not eligible for relief under Chapter 9 because it did not qualify 
as a ""municipality"" and it had not been specifically authorized to file under 
Chapter 9.  The dealers and brokerage houses terminated and liquidated their 
positions shortly after the initial filing, based on their belief that the 
investment pool's use of Chapter 9 was improper.  Their terminations and 
liquidations were not undone.

(8) Lastly, as mentioned above, you should note that even if Sec. 556 is not 
applicable to Chapter 9 filings under existing law, if ENA terminated a power 
contract with a municipality prior to the filing date for a reason other than 
the act of filing a bankruptcy petition (e.g., a bond downgrade; failure to 
post collateral; a cross default; the existence of a condition where the 
counterparty is ""unable to pay its debts as they come due,"" etc.), ENA would 
be permitted to proceed with the liquidation of its position (and it could 
exercise any set off or settlement rights) without regard to the automatic 
stay.

Hopefully, the pending legislation will be passed and the concern as to the 
applicability of Sec. 556 to municipalities will be completely eliminated 
within a relatively short period of time.  In the interim, particularly 
during the upcoming summer (when prices in many locations will be highly 
volatile and certain parties' credit positions could fluctuate rapidly and 
materially in some cases, particularly if they are filling open positions in 
the spot market), it may make sense to alert our credit group to be 
particularly vigilant in their monitoring of the ongoing financial condition 
of our municipal counterparties so that we preserve as much flexibility as 
possible with respect to exercising our termination rights under the 
contracts on account of defaults other than the filing of a bankruptcy 
petition by or against our counterparty.

Please give me (or Carl, 303 291-2630, or Jim, 303 291-2632) a call if you 
want to follow up on any of this.

Thanks.

John

Here are proposed responses to these discovery requests:

Request for Admission - Admit that CPSC agreed to go forward with the 
transaction proposed in the July 30, 1999 letter absent a guarantee from 
CPSC's parent company.

Answer:  EPMI objects to this request in that it is vague and ambiguous, 
particularly in its use of the term ""agreed to go forward.""  Subject to and 
without waiving this objection, EPMI denies this request.

Interrogatory - If your answer to the preceding request for Admission is 
other than an unqualified admission, state in detail the basis for your 
denial or qualification of the admission.

Answer:  EPMI objects to this interrogatory for the reasons stated in its 
response to the preceding request for admission.  Subject to and without 
waiving this objection, EPMI states that CPSC made no apparent effort to seek 
LCRA's consent to an assignment as contemplated by the July 30, 1999.  In 
telephone conversations in the late afternoon of the last day for the parties 
to have entered into such an assignment pursuant to the terms of the July 30, 
1999 letter agreement (which conversations were initiated by EPMI several 
days earlier) CPSC indicated that it would begin to negotiate an assignment 
without a parent guarantee, but CPSC did not, in fact, agree to an assignment 
before the expiration of the time period contemplated by the July 30, 1999 
letter agreement.  After that time had expired, CPSC did not continue 
negotiations with EPMI.
Let me know what you think.

Hi Harlan

Hope your enjoying your fortuitous timing - since you've been gone we haven't 
seen below triple digits and there is no relief in site.  In that vain, I'd 
love nothing more than to pull you back for nothing less than an Into 
meeting.  I spoke w Kevin Presto, head of East trading, and he has proposed 
that we all get together no earlier than the end of next week, with 
afternoons and Tues or Thurs being the best days.  He would propose that he, 
Rogers Herndon and John Zufferli attend.  Let me know what days would work 
for you.

Happy trails

David and Elizabeth,

Here are the redlined versions of the NSP amendments.  The changes are 
straight forward.  The only thing that I found was that they only changed the 
date in one of the agreements...they should probably be changed in both.  
Please review and resend to me at your earliest convenience.  Our goal is to 
execute tomorrow.

Thanks,

Elizabeth,

As I said in my voice mail message, attached below are the LOI, Power Supply 
Term Sheet, and QSE Term Sheet for Green Mountain Power.  Also attached is 
the QSE Services Agreement that we are using with New Power Company.  I have 
accepted all changes made by David Portz and Michelle Parks and rejected the 
changes made by New Power Company.

Thanks,
Chris

Thanks for your voice mail.  In case you are wondering what my former 
secretary and long time friend thinks of me .... This goes with a bigger 
story I will tell you about sometime when I can.  Talk to you later.

this made me think of you...


  All in good humor:
  A man in a hot air balloon realized he was lost.  He reduced
altitude and spotted a woman below.  He descended a bit more and shouted,
""Excuse me, can you help me?  I promised a friend I would meet him an hour
ago, but I don't know where I am.""
  The woman below replied, ""You are in a hot air balloon
hovering approximately 30 feet above the ground.  You are between 40 and 41
degrees north latitude and between 59 and 60 degrees west longitude.""
  ""You must be an engineer,"" said the balloonist.
  ""I am,"" replied the woman.  ""How did you know?""
  ""Well,"" answered the balloonist, ""everything you told me is
technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information,
and the fact is I am still lost.  Frankly, you've not been much help so
far.""
  The woman below responded, ""You must be a manager.""  ""I am,""
replied the balloonist, ""but how did you know?""
""Well,"" said the woman, ""you don't know where you are or where you are
going.  You have risen to where you are due to a large quantity of hot air.
You made a promise which you have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to
solve your problem.  The fact is you are in exactly the same position you
were in before we met, but now, somehow, it's my fault.""

Calpine says PG&E in breach of power contracts
(UPDATE: updates with company comments to analysts)
SAN JOSE, Calif., April 9 (Reuters) - Independent power company Calpine Corp. 
(NYSE:CPN <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=cpn&d=t> - news </n/c/cpn.html>) said 
on Monday that bankrupt utility Pacific Gas and Electric was in breach of 
contract after failing to make some $267 million in payments and it would 
seek prompt court action to secure payment or be freed from its energy 
contracts.
ADVERTISEMENT

<http://rd.yahoo.com/M=183981.1387645.2975805.1320407/D=fin/S=7811756:LREC/A=6
31358/R=0/*http://www.hrblock.com/taxes/partners/yahoo/index.html >
``Right now there is breach of contract'' for power Calpine has provided 
Pacific Gas and Electric, Calpine senior vice president Lisa Bodensteiner 
told an analysts teleconference. 
``We are filing motions this week with the bankruptcy court to direct PG&E to 
pay us. If it doesn't decide this, we will then ask the court to relieve of 
us of our contacts and let us sell to the open market,'' she said. 
San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine said in a statement earlier Monday it was 
confident PG&E would be able to pay Calpine's 11 qualifying facility 
subsidiaries (QFs) for past-due power sales. 
Calpine's 11 QF plants, which generate around 600 megawatts of power from 
small natural gas-fired and geothermal plants, are part of a fleet of 
qualifying facilities that can produce up to about a third of all the power 
generated in California. 
As of March 31, Pacific Gas and Electric owed a total of $643 million for 
power the QFs have supplied to its customers, according to the California 
Public Utilities. 
PG&E must assume Calpine's contracts in its bankruptcy proceedings for them 
to continue, Calpine said. 
PG&E Corp. (NYSE:PCG <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pcg&d=t> - news 
</n/p/pcg.html>) unit Pacific Gas and Electric Co., California's largest 
inverstor-owned utility, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday 
after piling up around $9 billion in wholesale power costs it has not been 
able to recover due to California's 1996 deregulation legislation. 
Calpine senior vice president Jim Macias told analysts that if PG&E ``were 
dumb enough'' not to affirm the contracts, Calpine could make an extra $380 
million selling the energy tied up in its QF contracts with PG&E on the open 
spot market. 
``We are in constant discussions with state municipal utilities and the state 
to sell our power. We are very confident we will be able to move this energy 
should the contacts be rejected,'' Macias said. 
He estimated spot electricity prices in the state are currently about $260 
per megawatt hour. 
A Calpine spokeswoman said Monday the company's QF facilities operated when 
California declared power emergencies, but could not comment on whether they 
operate when an alert is not called. 
In addition to the $267 million currently owed, San Francisco-based Calpine 
also holds a long-term $68 million note receivable with PG&E for energy 
deliveries from 2003 to 2014, but that the note is note yet due. 
Calpine, which said it did not expect the $267 million PG&E owes it to grow, 
said the utility had paid 15 percent of what PG&E owes it for energy 
delivered in December and January, but had not paid anything since. 
Calpine, which has its own natural gas storage reserves in Sacramento, 
Calif., also said it expected to make payments to its gas suppliers.

Hi Dale,

Please see tradersnewspower.com.  This will be the official website where the 
Cinergy Hourly Index will be posted.  Do we need to make any changes to the 
language and when will we be able to see this product on our stack manager?

Hope you had a good weekend.

Thanks.

To all:

I've put together a slide presentation that can be used for the 10am (Let's 
Make a Deal), 11:15 (When the Deal Does Not Go Down); 1:30 (Show Me the 
Money); and 2:30 (Major Meltdowns) panels.  Please feel free to edit, 
supplement, comment or suggest alternatives.  I am assuming that Harlan and 
Elizabeth will have other handouts for the 8:30am panel.  Mike Small's 
handout is attached.  I also plan to add:  the model tariff and service 
agreement, slides concerning the EEI contract development process, a page 
showing the location of the eei contract website, and list of upcoming 
activities.  Please let me know if there is anything else you think should be 
added as a handout (preferably something that does not need to be created 
from scratch).

Patty, in addition to the attached slides, Bob Viola said he was comfortable 
with using John Varholy's presentation, but wants to discuss further.  I've 
asked Marvin Goldstein if he intends to use his forward contract and 
bankruptcy memo for his presentation.   Its attached.  Shari Stack said she 
will finish up her presentation and send it to you  today.  Contact info for 
your panels:  Bob Viola 617-912-6256 (rviola@edisonmission.com); Marvin 
Goldstein 212-806-5629 (mgoldstein@stoock.com); Mike Small 202-393-1200 
(small@wrightlaw.com); and Shari Stack 713-207-5233 
(shari_stack@reliantenergy.com) .  If you need Marvin's hotel number I can 
try and get it, he's on vacation this week.  He did not return a message I 
left yesterday.  David has a conference call scheduled for Friday for his 
panels and hopefully, you can set one up for yours this week.

Looking forward to speaking w/ you this week.

The chargeback provisions for PJM are contained in Paragraph 15.2 of the PJM 
Operating Agreement.  As it relates to PJM Members being chargeback for 
another Member's default the paragraph states in part

""...the PJM Board may assess against, and collect from, the Members not in 
default, in proportion to their Weighted Interest, an amount equal to the 
amount that the defaulting Member has failed to pay to the Office of the 
Interconnection, along with appropriate interest, but such assessment shall 
in no way relieve the defaulting Member of its obligations, and shall confer 
upon the Members Committee the right to recover the assessed from the 
defaulting Member.""  (Note that upper case denotes defined terms in the 
Operating Agreement)

I will fax a copy of the section of the Operating Agreement pertaining to 
default to Ed Sacks and request that he forward a copy to Rhonda and 
Elizabeth if desired.  If you would like a copy of the entire Operating 
Agreement (all 160 pages) it can be found on the PJM website at www.pjm.com 
by clicking on ""Manuals and Documents"" on the Home page (left side), then 
under ""PJM Agreements"" clicking on ""Operating Agreement, PJM Interconnection, 
L.L.C.""  

Note that in light of the recent defaults in PJM, there is a subgroup in PJM 
reviewing the existing credit policy in PJM and will recommend changes to the 
policy if required.  I will forward you information from this group as it is 
available and ask that you review it and comment."

Ok to incorporate language referring to ERCOT/West product that we trade 
under EEI (West firm should already be handled and ERCOT confirms talk about 
product but without definition).

OK maybe to modify transmission contingent but need to clarify why with 
Harlan and then advice/discuss w traders.  We do not commonly use those 
definitions"

After looking at this I realize it may not be as helpful as I thought - 
certainly would need to add more analysis on the delivery obligations like FM 
and other rights to interrupt.  Call if you have any questions (713 853 6349).

ps  if you get a chance I would love to see the form PGE used in addition to 
the WSPP - I think you said it was PGE 11.

Thanks
Have a great weekend.

Andy,

We still have some internal work to do before we can say whether there is
any chance BPA will use the EEI contract in the future.  Personally, I think
this depends largely on what the prevailing industry trading arrangements
are, and that seems to be the WSPP agreement right now.  But our eyes and
ears are open.  I will be attending the conference and expect it to be very
informative.  Thanks for sending out the brochure.

Here's the final conference brochure.  The last panel of the day has a
comparison of the EEI and the WSPP and what the future holds for each.  If
you were inclined, having your thoughts on which agreement the BPA would
likely embrace in the future would be helpful.  If you speak, you get to
attend the entire conference for free.  Also, please feel free to pass the
brochure on to any counterparties in the west that you think would benefit.
FYI, if there is enough interest we can try to arrange getting additional
rooms at the Four Seasons at the conference rate.  If that is not an option,
there is a Mariott that we have a national account w/ that is only 5 minutes
from the Four Seasons.  If we get enough overflow we will guarantee the
Mariott a block of rooms to get a discount rate.  I

I don't have a final brochure on this, but here is a draft.  I've also
attached my law review article on the EEI Contract.  I can't recall if I
gave you  one at the WSPP meeting in S.F.  Hope all is going well.  If BPA
would like me to do a separate presentation on the EEI Contract, I can
arrange that as well.

One hundred and forty two hours ago, I wandered into the Houston Casino, not 
really sure why other than a free floating anxiety that could only be 
appeased by attending to the ministerial tasks in life that so frequently 
make us forget how good life is.  So after a rousing game of tennis on Friday 
morning while my children were frolicking with Dede's 3 children at the 
Houston Country Club, I tackled my desk and made head way to no where. After 
trashing 457 emails, I opened the the 458th.  And then it came to me.  An 
epic. A history. A sense of time, commitment and value. A place where my 
roots are (as you all know, my mom and dad are buried in a family graveyard 
200 feet from the only barn not burned in the Shenandoah valley during the 
Civil War and which was used a Yankee hospital).  And of course there is the 
hope of sustaining energy to cope with this lackluster, stressful career in 
the Casino. 

And the Gods must have seen this coming too.  Being meager and always wanting 
to commit small, I sought only volume 1 of the opus.  Not to be found.  
Plenty of volume 2s and 3s but not a volume 1 to be found.  Other than in the 
sole, 3 volume set, neatly packages in the box, high up on a lonely shelf.  I 
knew I was on the right track when the person behind me tried to grab it out 
of my hands.  I fought and won.

I'm now on page 32 having met Jefferson Davis and Dear Abe.  At this rate 
I'll be finished in about 4 years, a true history of the war.

May Shelby be with us all  providing sustaining .......

I'm sure there's a scholar out there who has already published that big 
magnum opus on ""Dogs in the Civil War.""  However, Shelby Foote doesn't 
mention a single dog in his work and so the topic hasn't entered my 
imagination.  Your name is Patrick Cleburne.  I'm sorry about the gender 
thing, but your spirit and behavior is the same as his and you're going to 
have to go through this reading cycle bearing my comments about his behavior. 
I'll try to work in some dog analogies if I can.  Cleburne was a German 
Shepherd if there ever was one.  I would have hated to be across that line 
looking at his formation over there.   ----cgy

Christian,

Isn't there some canine hero/heroine that is mentioned in one of the history 
books?  I would prefer waging the battle as a four-legged soldier, North or 
South it doesn't matter, we are here just to serve our Masters.

One hundred and forty two years ago today, the great great great grandfather 
of Stacy Dickson, a guy named Edmond Ruffin, when other sober minded men held 
back, stepped up to touch a burning torch to a big cannon pointed across the 
Charleston harbor at Fort Sumter and touched off the great Civil War. His 
rash temper caused him to play directly into Lincoln's hand and forever after 
it would be said:  ""The South started the war.""   On this anniversary day, 
Clyde Durham, itinerant journeyman energy attorney,  touches off his third 
consecutive reading of Shelby Foote's great American Iliad about that war, 
this reading giving him more sustaining energy to cope with his lacklustre, 
stressful career in the Casino than any other theraputic activity he has yet 
found.   The Civil War imagery and analogies  will be flowing soon.  I see 
Elizabeth as a daughter of old Virginia with the Sager homestead right there 
in the Valley where much of the action took place.  I'm not sure where your 
folks would have fit in Genia, but you will soon be  assigned the proxy name 
I can't think of at the moment, the Irish warrior who fought for the South.  
Unfortunately I am on the North side.  I hope this won't cause serious 
professional difficulties for us as we wade through the epic battles and 
their respective corporate analogies. ----cgy

Dynegy has requested a meeting with us to discuss what an ""Into Product"" is 
and how this product works with what is currently going on with transmission 
and how it may be impacted by future changes in transmission.  Attendees from 
Dynegy will include Griff Jones (Dynegy's head of trading), Matt (whose last 
name I didn't get) and their lawyer Harlan Murphy.  If you think somebody 
else should attend or if you want them to come over here, let me know and I 
can talk to Harlan.  Assuming the meeting stays scheduled, I will schedule an 
internal meeting to briefly go over the EEI Into definition before we meet 
with Dynegy.

As you are aware, in connection with the EEI effort we worked extensively 
with a large group of industry participants to define  what an Into Product 
is.  Dynegy and PECO were the two companies that were very outspoken against 
they way the product ultimately got defined.  Dynegy put on a big dog and 
pony show before a large group of industry participants trying to argue that 
EEI's Into product was flawed.   Their position, while not completely 
expressed, hinges on the concept that if you sell an Into Product and are 
making deliveries on firm transmission, then the Seller will always be 
excused from performance if the firm transmission gets cut for any reason (in 
general, this is contrary to EEI which obligates the Seller to go to another 
interface unless the cut was due to Buyer's use of non firm transmission when 
firm was available or due to Buyer's attempt to move the energy away from the 
receiving control area).  Dynegy's approach was driven by the fact that they 
have extensive generation and that the vast majority of their deals go 
physical.  At the time, we suggested that if they were worried about cuts in 
firm transmission, then they needed to sell a transmission contingent 
product.  Dynegy's concept was rejected at the EEI meetings.

I hope that the meeting will accomplish the following goals:

1.  Get Dynegy to agree to trade Into with us under a common Into definition 
- Dynegy will not sign an EEI with us because of the Into definition.  We 
trade Into extensively with them, but clearly do not have a common 
understanding of what we are trading.  Critical to clear up this ambiguity.

2. Secure Dynegy as an advocate of EEI - Because Dynegy was so vocal against 
EEI's Into definition, if they now started using EEI, it would further boost 
acceptance of the contract and isolate PECO as the only other major voice 
against the Into definition.

3. Reexamine the Into Product as it is currently drafted and consider what 
will happen as access to transmission changes - Because the Into product is 
such an important part of East trading today, it is critical that internally 
we all agree how it should operate. Additionally, it is critical that we 
start thinking about how the Into product will be affected by changes in 
transmission, such as the advent of RTOs (with long term Into deals we may 
want to consider addressing what happens if the receiving control area goes 
into an RTO)

Call me with any questions/thoughts.

Thanks
Elizabeth

I spoke with Richard and we will have to renew.  He is currently trying to 
get the PX bankruptcy court to allow us  to take back our security in light 
of the FERC ruling re chargebacks, but due to uncertainty of the FERC ruling, 
court has not been willing to allow us to remove. Richard continues on the 
case.  In the meanwhile, the PX/bankruptcy court will not allow the LC's to 
expire without drawing down.  So we should go ahead and renew.

Hi Carol

My home number is 713 864 4023 - weekends would work fine so give me a call 
any time.  

This heat is unbelievable. I've become weak in body and have recently only 
played inside at the Met - I'm playing this weekend outside for the first 
time in weeks - I'll probably get killed.  Just FYI  I will be out of town 
next weekend but around after that.  Anytime you want to play, just give me a 
call.

Lucky you - as I struggle at my desk dealing with the fallout from extreme 
volatility in Western power prices,  I can think of nothing more pleasant 
then holding a newborn (they never cry and don't eat that much - right?), 
luxuriously watching the drama unfold at the US Open.  Go Davenport.  Lets 
hope Martina fares as well.

Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.

Elizabeth

Attached is a draft letter setting forth Enron's damages in connection with 
the termination of certain commodity forward and swap positions with PG&E.  
In lieu of sending out multiple letters and then aggregating the exposures  
for set off purposes, I thought it would be more understandable if we put all 
the matters in one letter.  For each product line,  I thought we could attach 
all the relevant information (I'm not sure if this is making it too easy for 
the court but it seems like the right thing to do). Each commodity line then 
would assemble the following and attach as an Appendix to the letter:

1.  Copy of Master Contract or applicable GTC
2.  Copy of transaction confirmations
3.  Copy of termination notice sent to PG&E
4.  Chart summarizing key commercial terms of transaction(s)
5.  Chart summarizing unpaid receivables and invoices for same
6.  Chart setting forth termination payment calculation for each terminated 
trade
7.  Paragraph describing methodology used to determine termination payment 
valuation (eg - 4 quotes secured, threw out high and low and averaged middle)
8   List showing quotes secured (entity, person, time and amount) and the 
extent available, written confirmation of such quote

I will be out of the office the rest of this week but will organize a call 
for early next week in order to finalize the PG&E package.  

Thanks for all your help.

The libor curves are calculated using market data at the close of the day for 
swap instruments namely the libor cash rates (published on Telerate page 
3750), eurodollar curve (prices published on Telerate 910) and the swap curve 
(prices published on Telerate 19901). The interpolated spot curve is 
calculated using a boot-strapping methodology. Discount rates can be 
calculated from these published zero rates by using the formula d(t) = 1

receivables issue with respect to the post-bankruptcy/pre-termination period 
in the calculation.  Also, please note that there are still some brackets in 
the draft.  Again, I'm not sure how the blacklining will come out since it is 
always a struggle doing it remotely.  John

From today's Gas Daily:


=01+Three strikes=01, bill hits California

California Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza,
a Democrat, will introduce a bill today that will
make it a felony for any energy supplier in California
to engage in a conspiracy to drive up prices
or manipulate the market.

The bill would apply to any company selling
gas or electricity into the state or to any of the
state=01,s utilities, said a spokesman for Cardoza.

Under terms of the proposed legislation,
offenders would be subject to California=01,s ""three
strikes"" law, which sentences convicted felons
to jail for life after three offenses. Directors, officers
or any other employees associated with
market manipulation of a company would be
subject to this bill, the spokesman said.

Cardoza will introduce the bill at a press
conference today at 2 p.m. Pacific time. CD

 No easy solutions to crisis

The crisis in California is far beyond short-term
fixes parading as potential solutions, and
there is no turning back for deregulation in the
state, according to a report released yesterday
by consulting firm Andersen.

California has no choice but to forge ahead in
repairing the damage that ill-planned deregulation
measures have caused, the Energy Crisis in the
Western U.S.: Lessons for navigating regulatory
and market minefields report says. ""There=01,s a common
wisdom that knows you can=01,t unscramble the
egg,"" said Matt Smith, head of Andersen=01,s North
American energy consulting practice. All that can
be done is correct the mistakes, he added.
In addition, steps must be implemented to
prevent the spread of the California ""virus"" to
other states=01, electricity marketplaces, Smith said.

""To begin, in our view, the energy crisis in the
western U.S. has produced formidable challenges
for utility industry regulators, state and federal
policymakers, and industry executives,"" Smith said.
""The virus spawned in California requires new strategies
to contain and reverse the damage.

""The implications for the development of
competitive energy markets go far beyond the
western United States. Unfortunately, California
has taught the nation that regulatory and political
barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis.""

The proposed solutions put in motion by
federal and state regulators, as well as California
policymakers, have only led to an increasingly
uncertain market and tension among those
working for a viable resolution, the report says.

""In reaction to the breakdown, many of
California=01,s political leaders now prefer to abandon
deregulation,"" the report says.

The report concludes that power shortages
and blackouts are inevitable this summer. The
deregulated marketplace, which took a year to
throw off track, will more than likely take a number
of years to put right, the report says. MCM

Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20
California Assembly
has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the=
=20
state=01,s current
energy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane=
d=20
heavily on a
report prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility=
=20
Southern California
Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.

But the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natu=
ral=20
Gas -- is not
ready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i=
t=20
recently presented
as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.

As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP=
UC=20
are pointing
the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde=
r=20
prices through
affiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against =
El=20
Paso is The Brattle
Group=01,s study of the California market.

Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman=
=20
of the
California Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20
Group=01,s market
study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not=
=20
caused by normal
market forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during=
=20
which Assembly
members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in=
=20
the California
market.

El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor=
t=20
presented to
legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence=
=20
of factors, not a
conspiracy, caused the price run-up.

Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa=
so=20
to conduct
work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20
concluded that the
increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the=
=20
main culprits in the
California gas price imbroglio.

Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,=
=20
said he
""didn=01,t see any smoking gun"" in either report.

""We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20
Study and a little
on the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20
legislature is the best
place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies,"" Campbell=20
said. ""I believe FERC
is looking at this situation "" and it would seem to me that that=01,s the=
=20
appropriate place.""

Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to=
=20
give support
to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. ""It=01,s being pushed=20
basically by the Public
Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion"" by=20
pipeline companies to
push up gas prices in California, he said.

The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20
assembly when
it had failed on the federal level: ""There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus=
t on=20
natural gas but on other
things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the=
=20
finger elsewhere for
the problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein=
g some=20
of that with the
public utilities commission.""

Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20
prices is a different
matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se=
em=20
to have taken
on a life of their own.

The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily=
=20
litigated effort to
force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20
participants. Following
on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out=
=20
The Brattle Group
report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20
major pipelines that
serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.

Several parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the=
=20
requested data
contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20
process to move
forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting=
=20
access to evidence
(GD 4/23).

Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their=
=20
case. The commission
recently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a=
=20
large block of
pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20
addressing the California
Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th=
e=20
California border
controversy obviated the need for more investigation.

The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a=
=20
hearing into
whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv=
e=20
up the price of gas
delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place=
=20
this summer. (RP00-

In Carey Jordan's deposition today, he mentioned that Paul Posoli was

Enron employee and current Calpine employee named Jeff Rawls recommended 
him.  What, if anything, do you know about Jeff Rawls?

1.? Members of the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Subcommittee 
opened? hearings today on the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between 
Southern California Edison Company (SCE), Edison International (EIX), and the 
California Department of Water and Power (CDWR).? Testifying on behalf of SCE 
were SCE Vice President Bob Foster and Ann Cohen.? Additional hearings will 
be scheduled next week at which time the subcommittee will hear from 
representatives of the Governor, the Attorney General, and CDWR.? Among other 
things, committee members questioned the wisdom of acquiring the transmission 
system, particularly on an ""as is"" basis, the price to be paid, alternative 
structures that would not require an acquisition by the state, and the rate 
of return on new investment in the utility. 

2.? Also in Sacramento, the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price 
Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market is scheduled to continue its 
investigation Thursday on market manipulation.? 

3.? Governor Davis' representatives have been negotiating a transaction with 
Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the 
utility's transmission assets.? The Governor's representatives expect to have 
an agreement within one to two weeks. 

4.? Also today, Governor Davis announced the appointment of Richard Sklar to 
head a team that will speed the construction of power plants in the state.? 
The ""Governor's Generation Implementation Taskforce"" will work to bring 
electrical generation facilities on line by coordinating state permitting, 
siting, finance, design, and construction efforts in a ""one stop shop."" 

5.? At its open meeting this evening, the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC) approved an order addressing market monitoring and 
mitigation for California wholesale power markets.? Based on the FERC staff 
presentation and discussion during the meeting, it appears that the market 
monitoring and mitigation plan for California includes the following:

(1)? a requirement that all generators which entered into a Participating 
Generator Agreement with the ISO, and all non-public utilities in California 
that sell into the ISO's real-time market or use the ISO transmission grid, 
must offer all available electric capacity during all hours to the ISO 
real-time market, except for hydroelectric units.

(2)? all public utility load serving entities in California must submit 
demand bids in real-time markets during all hours.

(3)? all sales by market participants that have been granted authority by the 
FERC to sell power at market-based rates are subject to a refund condition to 
prevent anti-competitive bids into real time markets.

(4)?? the ISO is required to submit weekly reports to the FERC on scheduled 
outages and bid data to facilitate market monitoring.

(5)?? all sales into the ISO real-time market during a period of reserve 
deficiency (i.e., during Stage 1, 2 or 3 emergencies) will be subject to 
price mitigation.? The FERC order will include a formula that the ISO will be 
required to apply for purposes of calculating a proxy price for all such 
sales.

The order will also enhance the ISO's ability to coordinate and control 
planned outages. 

The mitigation plan will be in effect for a one-year period, and will be 
subject to periodic review.? The FERC is also requiring the ISO and the 
investor-owned utilities to submit a filing by June 1, 2001, to form a 
Regional Transmission Organization (RTO).? If an RTO filing is not submitted 
by that date, then the market monitoring and mitigation plan will terminate 
automatically.? The FERC is also directing the parties to work with RTO West 
(an RTO approved for the Pacific Northwest) to develop a plan for including 
California within RTO West, with a goal of ultimately creating one RTO for 
the entire western interconnection.? Finally, the FERC is instituting an 
investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act with respect to 
wholesale power sales throughout the western interconnection.? Apparently, 
potential refund liability would apply to wholesale power sale transactions 
in the western interconnection entered into for a period of 24 hours or less 
and made when reserve deficiencies are 7.5% or less.

FERC also approved the formation of RTO West, an eight-state RTO combining 
the transmission assets of nine utilities in the Pacific Northwest.? The FERC 
asked the RTO to make a submission to it by December 1 of this year on its 
plans for including Canadian transmission and widening the scope of its 
operations in a broader regional system. RTO West first submitted its plans 
to the FERC last October. It includes nine electric utilities serving eight 
western states with some 50,000 miles of transmission lines. The nine 
utilities include Avista, BPA, Idaho Power, Montana Power, Nevada Power, 
PacifiCorp, Portland General Electric, Puget Sound Energy and Sierra Pacific. 
The states where the RTO West would operate are Washington, Oregon, Idaho, 
Nevada, Utah and parts of Montana, Wyoming and California. 

A more detailed analysis of the FERC orders will be provided in tomorrow's 
update.

Larry:  In accordance with our conversation late last week, I am enclosing =
a=20
revised draft of the proposed standstill agreement that was discussed on=20
Wednesday.  My comments primarily involve the following:

(1) As you and I discussed last week,  I thought it made sense to specify a=
=20
reasonable date by which Enron and PG&E shall have reached closure on a=20
settlement agreement on the contract termination and related claims.  I =20
proposed a one month period to do that.  If the parties can=01,t come to an=
=20
agreement in that time period, then the =01&mechanics=018 in the MPA for re=
solving=20
a dispute dealing with the calculation of the termination payment would be=
=20
=01&reactivated.=018  Obviously, if we are making progress, the parties can=
 always=20
extend the date.  I felt it was appropriate to specify the window period to=
=20
make sure that everyone is focused on attempting to get a prompt resolution=
. =20
Assuming a final settlement agreement is agreed upon, the conditions of the=
=20
extension of the =01&stay=018 would be embodied in the settlement agreement=
 itself =20
(as opposed to this letter).

(2) Enron agreed at the meeting that it would keep the LCs in place while t=
he=20
parties were working to see if a settlement agreement could be reached, and=
=20
that requirement is reflected in our revisions to the letter.  Thus, the=20
revised letter provides that Enron will do this for the =01&Initial Extensi=
on=20
Period=018 (i.e., to May 25, 2001).  Your draft had provided that Enron wou=
ld be=20
required to keep the LCs in place even if no settlement agreement were to b=
e=20
reached.  My view is that any requirement to maintain the LCs beyond the=20
Initial Extension Period and any conditions with respect thereto, if agreed=
=20
to by Enron, should be part of the final settlement agreement executed by t=
he=20
parties, rather than as part of this letter.  Also, we note that, as a=20
contractual matter, the MPA does not require the non-defaulting party to ke=
ep=20
in place any security in favor of the defaulting party when, as a result of=
 a=20
termination, the non-defaulting party owes a payment to the defaulting part=
y.=20
 See Sec. 5.5.

(3) Your draft of the letter provided that Enron =01&agrees=018 to enter in=
to new=20
master gas agreements and consummate term transactions on =01&commercially=
=20
reasonable terms.=018  The revised letter specifies that Enron agrees to=20
negotiate with PG&E in these respects simultaneously with the negotiations=
=20
towards a settlement agreement, but any commitment on Enron=01,s part to ef=
fect=20
a contract or transaction with PG&E will only arise as a result of the=20
parties=01, execution of the definitive transaction documents (as opposed t=
o=20
this letter), the execution of which shall be in the sole discretion of eac=
h=20
of the parties.


Please call me at your convenience to discuss any questions on the foregoin=
g=20
or on the revised letter.  Thanks in advance for your help in moving this=
=20
forward.

Ms. Sager:

other claims Enron may have against PG&E in Bankruptcy Court.  I do not hav=

your mailing address; yet, PG&E would like to receive assurance soon that
Enron agrees with the terms of this proposed letter agreement.  After
reviewing the draft, please indicate Enron's agreement by return e-mail to
me.  Or, please call me (415-973-3817) to discuss.

Thanks.

Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from 
industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The 
industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC 
(subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for 
the industrials). 

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used 
primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be ""public utilities"" 
subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell 
power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice 
under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice 
filing).  
  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; 
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing 
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while 
they are selling at wholesale.
 -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the 
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of 
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from 
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these 
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be 
separate from our big quarterly reports.
 -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any 
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial 
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless 
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to 
purchases from industrials in WSCC.


____________________________________
On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to 
purchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.  As the attached order 
indicates, the effective date of the EPMI and EES rate schedules is March 6, 
2001.

million to the California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) and has had a 
""prospective condition"" placed on its authority to sell power at market-based 
rates for a year as part of a stipulation and consent agreement.

The agreement, which FERC approved Monday, was in response to a mid-March 
order that directed Williams Energy and AES Southland Inc. to show cause why 
they shouldn't be found in violation of the Federal Power Act (FPA) for 
allegedly engaging in actions that drove up prices in the California bulk 
power market and potentially compromised the reliability of the transmission 
gid. The two companies entered into the agreement with FERC's Market 
Oversight and Enforcement Section to resolve all the issues in the show-cause 
order [IN0I-3-001].

Specifically, the agreement calls for Williams to refund $8 million of the 
$10.85 million in additional revenues it received when two AES generation 
units, designated as reliability must-run (RMR) units, failed to provide 
immediate service to the Cal-ISO in April and May. The ISO was forced to call 
upon other non-RMR units and pay a much higher price (near or at $750/MWh) to 
Williams. Williams is the exclusive marketer for power from the two AES 
plants at issue --- AES Alamitos LLC and AES Huntington Beach LLC in Southern 
California. The Commission also conditioned Williams' market-based authority 
such that it will have to bear the financial cost of replacement power if a 
RMR unit is unavailable at any time over the next year.

Significantly, the agreement does not find that either Williams or AES abused 
their market power in California. It rejected the California Public Utilities 
Commission's request to impose penalties --- over and above refunds --- on 
the companies. Moreover, the agreement does not put an end to the ""formal, 
non-public investigation"" that FERC ordered in mid-March into violations 
arising out of the conduct of Williams and AES.

Mark

Attached is the draft memo. After you have had a chance to review, please 
call me with your thoughts/comments.  I would also like to briefly speak with 
John Klauberg about ""East Coast"" municipalities to make sure he thinks this 
policy works in the east as well.  John is going to call me early this 
afternoon.  Also, to the extent you think we should highlight financial 
trading policies like I have done, I would like Mark to review what is 
written (he did confirm that this is financial trading's policy).  Finally, 
it would be very helpful if I could get your thoughts on to whom we should 
distribute the memo.



Thanks

Provided there is no other documentation which the counterparties have agreed 
to which sets out the form of the Confirmation, it may be easier to change 
the definition of Confirmation Letter, simply to state that a letter will be 
sent confirming the Transaction, leaving us the flexibility to decide what 
the form and substance of that document should be from time to time.

I have checked the site today, and we do not show Exhibit A on the website 
(if it is there, I sure can not find it....).  Do you all (Legal) think that 
we should going forward since we are going to eliminate sending the GTCs with 
our confirms?

Thanks

Attached is the suggested template for physical power confirmations as 
discussed.

 As you know the ""Confirmation Letter"" is defined in the GTCs as being in the 
form attached as Exhibit A to the GTCs, any changes to the confirmation that 
the counterparties can expect to receive should also be reflected on the 
Website in Exhibit A.
 
Kind regards,
 
Marcus

Hello, I wanted to make sure I understand where the new language is to be 
inserted in our EOL GTC confirmation letter.  Bob Bowen was telling me they 
are putting the new paragraph at the beginning of the confirm letter.  The 
only problem I see is that we have the trade date and the energy type (firm 
energy, etc.) in the first paragraph as well.  We also already have language 
in the last paragraph about returning the confirm to us within 2 days.  

Please look at the following template and let me know where you would prefer 
to see the language added.  We are planning on changing our templates 
tomorrow morning.

I've received requests to convene a meeting of the Drafting Committee.  The 
purpose of the meeting would be to reach closure on the optional product 
definitions and other provisions (esp. the credit annex) that would be made 
available on the EEI website.  We should also discuss how to rectify the 
numerous typos that have been identified on the cover sheet and the GT&Cs.    
Would meeting sometime during late May or during June pose a problem?  I am 
also pretty much open during July and the first two weeks of August. I've 
attached a calendar w/ dates I'm not available.  If you could print the 
calendar; fill dates you are not available and fax to Patricia at 
202-508-5673 by COB Friday we can come up with a meeting date.  My first 
choice would be to have the meeting in D.C., but would be willing to go to 
another location.

FYI, John Varholy and I will be speaking at a conference on competitve 
electricity markets from 5/7-5/10 in Zagreb Croatia hosted by USAID.  I'll be 
talking about U.S. standard commodity contracts and John will be discuss EFET 
and Nordpool.  Also, I'll be speaking in Houston on May 15 at Energy & Power 
Risk Management 2001 on the EEI.  If you want to talk about the drafting 
commitee meeting I'll been in the office for the rest of the week and then 
out for two weeks.

I would like to acknowledge David Portz for his hard work and diligence in 
drafting and actively supporting the negotiation of the Green Mountain Power 
all-requirements transaction in ERCOT.   David worked long hours ensuring all 
tight timelines were met and facilitated quick contract turnarounds on 
numerous occasions.

In addition to Green Mountain, David has exhibited the same hard work and 
diligence on other Texas transactions (San Antonio, misc. QSE contracts, 
etc.)"

Attached is a copy of section 8.3 from the EEI agreement.? I'm told that to 
get the security interest created by this section, a party would have to 
perfect their interest by making a UCC filing in a variety of states.? 

Are people doing this?

I haven't seen the ruling, but this sounds like bad news for PG&E 
creditors.---sch

Judge tosses out PG&E lawsuit
BY BAY CITY NEWS SERVICE 
A federal judge has thrown out a lawsuit filed against the state Public 
Utilities Commission by PG&E, which had sought to remove rate caps in the 
wake of the company's bankruptcy. 
The ruling, issued by U.S. District Judge Thomas Lew in Los Angeles, was 
announced by San Francisco City Attorney Louise Renne today. The lawsuit had 
originally been filed in the city, but was consolidated with a similar one 
filed by a Southern California utility company. 
Removing the rate caps, imposed by the commission before the utility filed 
for bankruptcy in mid-April, might have allowed Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
to retrieve up to $10 billion from state ratepayers. 
The utility, charging that its financial problems were due in part to the 
rate caps, filed the lawsuit the Monday after its Friday bankruptcy filing. 
Earlier today, CPUC President Loretta Lynch said the lawsuit was ``directly 
challenging the PUC's regulatory authority over PG&E.'' She compared the 
suit's argument to a company wanting to recuse itself from public safety or 
environmental regulations merely because it had filed for bankruptcy. 
``We believe clearly that our regulatory authority continues unabated,'' 
Lynch said. "

Bustamante Sues 5 Power Firms, Alleging Price-Fixing Conspiracy 
Courts: Lieutenant governor and a legislator file on behalf of taxpayers. 
Industry official says claim is 'totally without merit.' 
By JULIE TAMAKI, Times Staff Writer
SACRAMENTO--Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante sued five big power generators Wednesday 
in a bid to recover billions in taxpayer money. 
Filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, the lawsuit accuses the power 
producers and 14 of their executives of engaging in a price-fixing conspiracy 
that has drained California's treasury. 
The companies are Duke Energy, Mirant Inc., Reliant Energy, Williams Energy 
Services and Dynegy Inc. 
""This energy cartel has basically scammed California taxpayers by 
manipulating the energy market out of billions of dollars,"" Bustamante said. 
In filing the lawsuit as private citizens on behalf of state taxpayers, 
Bustamante and Assemblywoman Barbara Matthews (D-Tracy) are betting on a Los 
Angeles jury to find that the companies colluded to manipulate the state's 
energy market--a conclusion federal regulators have yet to draw. 
The lawsuit comes on the heels of a proposal by Duke Energy to the Davis 
administration that all state investigations and lawsuits into the company's 
pricing activities be dropped in exchange for monetary concessions. 
Bustamante said he would only consider withdrawing his suit if the companies 
agreed to return all of their illegal profits. 
Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley described the legal action as another 
example of the deteriorating business environment in California. 
""The allegations are false, defamatory and totally without merit,"" he said. 
""We will vigorously defend ourselves."" 
The lawsuit, which is available on Bustamante's Web site at 
<http://www.ltg.ca.gov>, contends that after the generators gained control of 
19 power plants in California, they began setting electricity prices and 
exerting ""market power"" to drive them up and keep them high. 
The latter feat was accomplished in part by withholding supplies, the suit 
says. Consequently, California's spending on electricity is expected to jump 
from $7 billion in 1999to as much as $70 billion this year. 
The document accuses the companies of raising their prices even after Davis 
declared a state of emergency Jan. 17, and it cites a report by state 
officials that the five companies acted like monopolists 98% of the time they 
sold power to the California energy market. "

Bill may have already asked, but can we get the balances for the ISO/PX 
amounts we are showing?  PG&E has asked for the balances and the application 
of partial payments to reconcile against their records and the ISO/PX records 
which they have requested through the Bankruptcy court.    We need to review 
this with Lisa Mellencamp & Liz Sager prior to sending.

credit terms







Becky:
Here's a revised cover sheet that includes everything we've discussed so
far (including the clause I sent you yesterday), plus credit terms.  These
terms have been based on general discussions b/w your credit people and
ours.  If you can get agreement quickly from your credit department, we can
execute this agreement this week.  If there are any questions, please have
your credit person get in touch w/ Ed Sacks directly (713-345-7712) or call
me if there are problems w/ anything at all.
As I mentioned this morning, the guarantee we have now from American
National Power, Inc. says that it will expire this month, so we'll be
needing an appropriate amendment.  May I suggest that you amend it to use
the language in Enron's standard guarantee, as follows:
          Guarantor  may  terminate  this  Guarantee  by  providing written
     notice  of such termination to Counterparty and upon the effectiveness
     of  such  termination,  Guarantor  shall  have  no  further  liability
     hereunder,  except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph.
     No  such  termination  shall be effective until five (5) business days
     after  receipt  by  Counterparty  of such termination notice.  No such
     termination  shall  affect  Guarantor's  liability with respect to any
     Transaction  (as  defined  in the Agreement) entered into prior to the
     time  the  termination  is  effective,  which Transaction shall remain
     guaranteed pursuant to the terms of this Guarantee.

I have not been able to obtain a copy of this guarantee from our files, but
we also need to check to be sure that it covers power purchase and sale
transactions of ANP Marketing Company.
Friday is my last day at Enron, and it would be most efficient if we could
wrap this up before then.  Thanks so much for your kind assistance.

Regards,
Janice

North Carolina Power Holdings, LLC is a wholly owned sub of ENA and owns some 
power plants in NC.  On March 26, 2001, NCPH sold a daily call option for May 
through Dec 2001 to Carolina Power & Light Co. in March, and promised to 
deliver an Enron Corp. guarantee.  But it hasn't been delivered yet, and the 
counterparty has asked about its status.  The guarantee is attached -- 
standard form, describing the transaction.  Would you please date it and have 
it executed early week of May 7 and have it delivered to Genia Fitzgerald for 
delivery to the counterparty (Genia, the file is on your chair -- Paul Radous 
has been in touch w/ CP&L on this recently).  If you have any questions, 
please call Steve Van Hooser ( EB3877, ext. 37238).  Thanks so much -- hope 
to be in touch soon.

Alas, no agreement to execute at this point.  We have come a long way, 
however, and only 2 serious issues remain open.  (All the others are at least 
mostly resolved -- see my 5/1/01 revision w/ marginal notes made during my 
5/2/01 meeting w/ them.)  This file is in my office with all the others.

XOM requires that all of its contracts contain 2 provisions, both of which 
are problematic for Enron.

(1)  The Federal Contractor Supplement -- exhibit F to the EEI Master -- is 
designed to assure XOM's compliance w/ the U.S. federal government's 
requirements imposed on all government contractors.  There are 2 categories 
of requirements:  environmental laws compliance and small business 
participation in federal govt purchases of goods and services.  Since XOM has 
adoped a ""General Commercial Plan"" to comply with such requirements, XOM has 
promised the U.S. govt that ALL its contracts will contain these provisions.  
And that's what the auditors from the U.S. government would be looking to 
ascertain in a review of XOM's compliance.  As for Enron, we do engage in 
business w/ the U.S. govt, but we have not adopted a ""General Commercial 
Plan,"" so we have to address these issues on an ad hoc basis.  Taking the 
last paragraph of this Supplement as an example (addressing the use of women 
and minority owned businesses by Enron in supplying services to XOM under 
this contract), at this point, Enron isn't really prepared to undertake such 
things and all those I dealt with on this seem a bit nervous about Enron's 
ability to comply.  I've communicated w/ Michelle Cash, George Wasaff, and 
Cathy Riley (at Calvin Eakins direction) on this topic, and I asked Cathy 
Riley to have her director, Calvin Eakins, phone me to discuss this further, 
but he did not call.  And there does not seem to be a very good solution to 
this.  XOM has suggested revising the language in Sec. 10.13 (based on my 
5/1/01 draft) to add a final sentence ""The Federal Contract Supplement is 
attached as Exhibit F and each Party shall comply with such requirements to 
the extent appplicable.""  This certainly takes care of all of XOM's concerns, 
but I'm not sure this gets Enron all the way where we need to be.  See, for 
example, Dave Nutt's markup of the environmental provisions (in the file), 
and Cathy Riley says there are no exceptions or exemptions to the small 
business requirements.  We might be able to get some outside expertise on 
this or get Sharon Butcher to help resolve it.

(2)  Limitation of Damages -- Article 7 waives consequentials, etc. for both 
parties.  XOM insists that this provision must carve out damages resulting 
from the ""gross negligence and/or willful misconduct attributable to its 
managerial and senior supervisory personnel"".  You can see the full details 
of the provisions they're looking for in the XOM language in sec 10.4 (same 
draft), the extensive indemnity language which they added in the last round 
and which we generally don't mind giving them.  But this impacts Article 7 
because the Enron version of the waiver expressly states that the waiver 
applies to indemnities, and, of course, XOM will not tolerate any exceptions 
to the liability of each party (yes, it's mutual) for the gross negligence of 
its managers, etc.  There's a true story behind all this that dates back to 
the EPA emissions requirements on Reformulated Gasoline (RFG).  Mobil hired a 
lab to do the testing, the managers of the lab company encouraged the testing 
staff to ""fudge"" the results, tons of RFG hit the market that was not in 
compliance, and a huge black mark on Mobil and zillions of dollars lost were 
the result.  And the contract provided that the lab's damages were limited to 
the testing fees, and apparently, that worked for the lab company.  So, it's 
a deal breaker for XOM  b/c they say that if Enron's managers decide to turn 
off the lights at all the refineries for some specious reason, they need to 
have proper recourse against Enron.   I''ve argued with them about this, 
based on the nature of this contract, the power trading business, etc. but to 
no avail .....  It would seem that Enron's language in Art. 7, w/ the 
following rather narrow change, might work for both parties, but it's up to 
you, now.
 UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR 
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST 
PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR 
CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE provided, however, that 
nothing in this Article 7 shall be interpreted to limit either Party's 
liability under Article 10.4(b).  
Let me know if you have any questions about this.  
Regards,
Janice

Elizabeth and Christian:

This morning I spoke with Geritt Hull, Bonneville's trading lawyer, about 
putting an EEI in place between Enron and BPA.  He said there was ""no 
interest"" in using the EEI at this time.  Before, the agency resisted using 
the agreement because it was unfamiliar with the EEI.  Now, however, the 
agency has reviewed the EEI---and decided it didn't like what it saw.  This 
""review"" appears to have consisted of (1) an internal legal meeting and (2) a 
meeting this morning between Geritt and Dave Mills (who heads BPA's trading 
floor).  After a first look, BPA has the following concerns about the EEI:


1.  If BPA does some transactions under the EEI, it will then have two 
different agreements.  BPA prefers having one standardized agreement (WSPP).

2.  The Schedule M provisions are unfavorable to governmental entities.  The 
WSPP does not have these additional obligations.  

3.  Tracking of credit/mark to market exposure is a concern for BPA because 
it does not have systems in place to do this.  I explained to Geritt that 
these provisions would be for BPA's benefit.  BPA need not calculate these 
amounts day-to-day; it could wait until it hit the ""nervous nellie"" standard, 
and then do the calculations, at which time, if the thresholds had been met, 
it could call for more collateral.  This seemed to help; BPA had seen this 
part as a burden---""oh, we'll have to start doing daily mark-to-market 
calculations!""

4.  ""This agreement seems to favor marketers.""  I reminded Geritt that BPA is 
a marketer, too.  ""Well, we haven't been selling much lately.  We're buyers 
now."" (This is a disconcerting because at this time of year BPA is usually 
spilling water for salmon AND selling lots of extra power).  

5.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the head of BPA's trading floor, 
Dave Mills, is opposed to the agreement because he doesn't want to use a 
second master.


I asked Geritt who could say ""yes"" to the EEI and he said, ""Dave Mills, if 
anyone.""  But he also said that ""like everything at BPA, a decision like this 
would be part of a broad consensus.""  

Geritt has been charged with preparing an analysis of the two agreements.

Next Steps

Christian has suggested that we ask Greg Wolfe and Holli Krebs to put 
pressure on the BPA traders to use this agreement.

I am taking Geritt to lunch on Wednesday.

----Steve

   





Geritt said that BPA has given the EEI an internal review and decided not to 
made the following conclusions:

1.  Using the EEI

Do we need a pre-meeting?   Quite honestly, Dynegy's position is not 
unreasonable - it forces the sinking utility to assume the transmission risk.
I understand the EEI position and long term it is definitely the right answer 
from a liquidity and MTM accounting standpoint and I will clearly support 
that position in our discussions with 3rd parties.

The ultimate goal for ENA is to go away from Into products completely and 
trade power within zones of RTO's or ISO's where transmission and congestion 
is managed by an independent operator with all transmission costs passed on 
to the load."

Elizabeth -

I had a conversation with Carol yesterday about her new responsibilities 
helping the trading desk.  She mentioned that it was still up in the air as 
to her exact responsibilities and mentioned a staff meeting tomorrow.  I was 
hoping you could clarify for me (and I am sure everyone in Portland) if she 
will be dedicated to the West or also be working on East projects.

Crisis: Democrats, GOP fail to agree on a $13-billion emergency bond, putting 
California at risk of running out of funds this fall. 
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, JULIE TAMAKI, Times Staff Writers
SACRAMENTO--California will not be able to reimburse state coffers the 
billions spent buying electricity during the energy crisis until August at 
the earliest, which will leave the state perilously close to running out of 
money this fall. 
Democrats and Republicans failed to come to terms Monday on emergency 
legislation that would authorize up to $13.4 billion in bonds to repay the 
state budget, leading Democrats to push forward with a last-gasp strategy. 
The Legislature's ruling party outflanked the minority GOP by introducing an 
identical, nonemergency measure that required only majority approval, not 
two-thirds passage. It was approved by the Assembly Monday evening on a 49-29 
vote, and is expected to receive final Senate approval Thursday. 
Though it guarantees California taxpayers will eventually be repaid in full 
for electricity purchases made to supply private utilities, the Democrats' 
action carries a series of negative consequences for the state as it seeks to 
escape the energy crisis. 
The nonemergency bill will take a minimum of 90 days to become law after the 
special session ends, effectively leaving the general fund with a massive 
hole as lawmakers prepare the state budget over the next two months. 
""We can't sell the bonds as quickly, and will probably need a contingency 
budget,"" said Assemblyman Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek). 
Keeley said lawmakers will probably have to prepare a spending plan with 
different levels of funding--one from July, the time the next fiscal year 
begins, to whenever the bonds are eventually sold. Lawmakers may also have to 
consider a worst-case scenario: the possibility that the bonds will not sell. 
""If [investors] don't buy the bonds,"" Keeley said, ""the situation we're in is 
very, very dire because the general fund would be repaid very, very slowly."" 
State Treasurer Phil Angelides had hoped to borrow $4.13 billion to partially 
repay the budget until bonds could be issued, but lawmakers said the new 
legislation will make that impossible. Angelides' tentative deal to borrow 
the money from several Wall Street firms expires today. The deal required 
authorization on the bonds, because bond proceeds were to be used to repay 
the loan. 
""The Assembly Republicans' refusal to support emergency legislation puts the 
state's fiscal integrity at great and continuing risk, and does serious harm 
to essential services from education to public safety to health care,"" 
Angelides said in a statement. 
The delay also means that Gov. Gray Davis will fail to keep his promise to 
repay the budget and take the state out of the energy buying business by the 
end of June. That is crucial, because many of the contracts to purchase 
electricity that the Davis administration signed contain language that may 
make them void if financing is not secured by July 1. If the contracts 
evaporate, the state will be forced to buy even more power on the expensive 
spot market to avoid blackouts. 
Davis plans to replenish state coffers and stop using taxpayer money on power 
purchases by floating a record bond issue, which would be repaid by utility 
ratepayers out of their monthly bills. But the bonds cannot be issued until 
the bill in question takes effect. 
In a statement, Davis also accused Republicans of ""obstructing the solution"" 
to the state's electricity problems, saying ""their decision to play partisan 
politics with the energy crisis seriously complicates the budget process and 
could ultimately threaten our economy."" 
So far this year, California has spent more than $5 billion from the budget 
buying power for the private utilities that were too financially strapped to 
continue doing so. 
Most critically, the measure will leave a dangerously narrow window of time 
for the bond to be issued so the budget could be reimbursed before state 
coffers begin to run dry in early fall. The $12.5-billion bond is expected to 
be the largest in American history, and experts say it will require a 
significant sales effort. The Democrats' bill authorizes a slightly larger 
amount in case the bond issue needs to grow. 
Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D--Sherman Oaks) said he will continue 
working with Republicans in hopes of passing legislation to authorize the 
bonds sooner. 
""I'm still holding out an olive branch to Republicans,"" Hertzberg said. 
Lastly, the bill's final passage will kill, temporarily at least, hundreds of 
energy-related bills now winding their way through the Legislature. That is 
because, for the bill to become law as quickly as possible, Democrats would 
have to adjourn the current special legislative session on the energy crisis. 
Democrats are vowing to quickly approve a host of important bills this week 
before the session is closed down. And Davis is expected to immediately call 
another special session, said spokesman Steve Maviglio, so most of the 
remaining bills could be reintroduced. 
Nonetheless, the process would slow down passage of numerous 
measures--especially for Republicans, who may have a harder time getting 
their bills through both houses a second time. Republicans hold only 30 of 
the Assembly's 80 seats, and 14 of the Senate's 40 seats, making them a 
distinct minority. 
Without question, the Democrats' move represents a ratcheting up of partisan 
politics on the energy crisis. 
Republicans held up the initial legislation in hopes of forcing Davis and his 
Democratic colleagues to alter their financial plan to get the state out of 
the crisis--even if it meant scaling back the next state budget. 
Davis has proposed borrowing the $12.5 billion to repay the budget and cover 
future power purchases over the next two years, which would allow his next 
state budget to move forward unimpeded by the crisis. 
GOP lawmakers, who are convinced that the size of the bond will need to be 
increased to finance Davis' plan, countered last week with a proposal to 
essentially gobble up most of the state's projected surplus by writing off $5 
billion in electricity purchases and borrowing less in bonds for future power 
buys. 
But Democrats balked at the Republican proposal, saying California had far 
too many needs in education, law enforcement, transportation and health care 
to permanently spend $5 billion on electricity. Furthermore, they said, using 
taxpayer money instead of electric rates to cover power purchases would favor 
big business. 
""Today, we take a bitter pill to fix a problem we all know needs to be 
fixed,"" Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza (D-Merced) said.

FYI. Certain aspects of this presentation will relate to PPA's/tolling 
agreements/interconnection studies and agreements  relating to Enron 
developed generation assets from which we intend to purchase power, etc.  

The cost/benefit would probably be marginal for you, but I will be there, and 
will get you any interesting handouts.

Subject: Asset Financing - Structured Finance Presentation

We are planning a presentation on certain structure and contracting issues 
related to power plant asset financing on Thursday, May 10th.  The 
presentation will include lunch from Treebeard's and will begin at 11:30.  We 
have scheduled 2.5 hours for the presentation; it may be shorter, depending 
on the number of questions. 

We plan to include the Portland folks by video-conference.   If you know of 
others who would benefit from this presentation, please pass on this 
invitation; I have not intended to exclude anyone who may want to attend.  If 
there are others at remote locations, please let me or Dina Snow know so that 
we can arrange for video-conferencing.  John, I asked Shirley for the names 
of your contracts folks and have included them; I still have no information 
as to whom else you want to include.  Therefore, please forward this to your 
team members as you see fit.

Please RSVP to Dina Snow at X57099 or by e-mail to dina.snow@enron.com by 
Tuesday, May 8th.

We will e-mail the conference room location when it is confirmed.


Thanks,

Rose

Attached is the latest draft with my comments and additional drafting. We 
need to be certain that Kevin Presto is clear as to the Products and the 
risks that we will be taking going forward.

In addition, as we discussed with Consumers this morning, from a scheduling 
perspective, we need to be comfortable that the time limits will be as per 
Eastern Prevailing Time and not Central Prevailing Time. If we are, then we 
need to change the Into Cinergy definition in EEI to address this.
 
As part of managing this process, as you know my wife is expecting our first 
child and with the due date having been passed I am on ""baby alert"" which 
could mean me leaving at any minute. I have therefore started to copy 
Elizabeth Sager on the negotiations and she, or another member of the team 
will be in a position to start running with this, in the event that it is not 
signed before I leave.

Steve/Christian,

The attached file is a draft of an asset management agreement prepared by Stu 
Zisman.  The later version obviously contained more negotiated points, so I 
think this one is more helpful.

I'm working on a transaction now which involves serving load as well as 
selling power. I found this one helpful for issue identification and 
exculpatory language, however.  


Kay

Marcus,

I spoke with two of our schedulers and they inform me that it is ok to 
utilize the term Eastern Prevailing Time to cover deliveries at MECS or Into 
Cinergy.  There is no issue on a 16 hour block since.  The problem usually 
happens when there is an off peak 8 hour block and there is confusion on the 
hour extending into midnight.

Elizabeth, 
Carol and I had a  conversation (with Justin Boose mostly listening in) about 
how best to coordinate her much welcomed support for West Desk EEI deals and 
out of that conversation I would like to propose that we send the following 
message to Tim and the Mid-Marketers.  The message is designed to enforce a 
kind of teamwork discipline and approach to EEI work that Steve, Justin and 
me have been developing here.  Obviously the message will not be sent until 
you and Carol are happy with it, and my suggestion is that you, Elizabeth, 
should send the message.  

Mid-Marketers:
The legal team supporting West Desk Trading has been strengthened by the 
addition of Carol St. Clair of ENA's Houston legal department.  Carol is 
going to concentrate on negotiating high priority EEI Agreements.  We are 
trying to build an improved process  for supporting EEI negotiations that 
involves a teamwork approach among a team of lawyers working together  along 
the following lines.  The idea is to create a steady processing of all EEI 
agreements at one level,  while at the same time,  having the flexibility to 
keep our most experienced trading attorneys working on our highest EEI 
priorities at any given time. The highest priority EEI agreements will be 
those where we are trying to get new, long term business. 

Justin Boose of Stoel Rives will have the responsibility to drive Stage 1 and 
Stage 2 of the EEI process. 

Stage 1 is all internal steps required to send a Cover Sheet including credit 
terms to the Counterparty.  These steps will involve getting the credit work 
sheet from Credit to our paralegal, Genia Fitzgerald and getting the Cover 
Sheet including the credit terms from Genia, proofreading it and identifying 
who to send it to.  

Stage 2 is harassing the Counterparty and, in cooperation with Mid-Marketers, 
getting the right people from the CP  to look at our Cover Sheet and reply 
with comments.  

Christian and Carol will be primarily responsible for Stage 3 of the EEI 
process, with Steve Hall also involved in this stage from time to time as 
other priorities may permit.  

Stage 3 is driving  the negotiations from the completion of Stage 2 to 
closing. 

Pat Boyston will be asked to join Stage 3 to help address all muni issues and 
to close out other issues as well from time to time.  Eventually Justin will 
grow into providing Stage 3 support. 

The critical credit liaison function will be made by the responsible attorney 
as the process moves to completion, with Legal taking the responsibility to 
drive the overall process to completion. 

We believe this kind of disciplined approach by this team should provide an 
enhanced level of support for EEI negotiations day in and day out if 
everybody recognizes   who is expected to do what during the three Stages. 
Christian has the responsibility to see that either he or Carol or Steve are 
concentrating on the highest priority EEI negotiations at any given time. 

Support for EEI negotiations is only part of the legal work that must be done 
for the West Desk and prioritizing the other work will be handled by 
Christian and Steve, working with me in Houston.  ----E. Sager.

final terms to be shown to 
New Power, and I will refine the document into shape suitable to be sent 
out.  Note -- I am uncertain how the confidentiality obligation in Section 
7.2 should be stated in view of the possibly converging relations of ENA 
Wholesale with EES, and therefore desire that it be stated as narrowly as can 
be done while addressing New Power's main concerns and stating an EPMI 
obligation with clear and livable boundaries.

An excerpt from a recent article:  
""Davis - who told reporters Monday that the state ""is at war"" with 
Houston-based generators - is expected to meet with representatives from a 
dozen energy companies Wednesday to discuss ""unpaid debts, credit issues and 
the supply of power."" Those generators include Mirant, Williams and Duke 
Energy. 
At the meeting Wednesday, Davis will attempt to get the generators to take a 
haircut on hundreds of millions of dollars of power bills owed by PG&E Corp. 
unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International unit Southern California 
Edison. In exchange, a person close to Davis said, the governor may promise 
to veto the windfall profits tax bill if it reaches his desk."" 


Generators Warn Of Blackouts If Calif OKs Windfall Tax Updated: Tuesday, May 
8, 2001 07:19 PM ET 
By Jason Leopold 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Legislation to place a windfall profits tax on sales 
of electricity into California will deter investments in new generation and 
drive power out of the state, raising the risk of blackouts, wholesale-market 
power suppliers said Tuesday. 
""It would be totally counterproductive and prolong California's misery for 
years to come,"" said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power 
Trading Forum, an industry group. ""New plants in California wouldn't get 
built, and existing plants would cease operating. There would be blackouts 
all day long"" 
On Monday, the Senate passed, by a vote of 25-12, a bill to tax at 100% sales 
of electricity into California above $80 a megawatt-hour. A separate windfall 
profits tax bill with a three-tiered rate system is moving through the 
Assembly's committees and could come up for a vote in the full house later 
this week. Electricity priced at $60/MWh would be taxed at 50%, sales of 
power over $90/MWh would be taxed at 70% and electricity sales over $120/MWh 
would be taxed at 90%. 
Gov. Gray Davis has said he is ""open"" to the concept of windfall profits tax 
on electricity sold into California, but hasn't said whether he supports the 
bills moving through the Legislature. 
Generators said they would seriously consider scrapping plans to build 
much-needed new generation in California if the measure is signed into law. 
""We do have some concerns on how (the bill) would affect new generation,"" 
said Mirant Corp. spokesman Chuck Griffin, whose company is investing about 
$500 million in new power plants in Northern California. ""We have said all 
along that before we are able to build this generation we need to make a good 
assessment of the business environment in the state, and the (windfall 
profits tax) is certainly a factor."" 
Tim Thuston, managing director of government relations for Williams Cos., 
said a windfall profits tax is ""confiscatory"" and the state is trying to 
circumvent the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
""I can tell you we think its a very poor idea,"" Thuston said. ""I'm 
speculating, but I think any time a state starts seizing profits it would 
deter investment in that state."" 
Duke Energy, a power supplier investing more than $600 million in new power 
plants in California, wouldn't comment on how the tax would affect its plans. 
Mirant - following Williams' lead - supports short-term regional price 
controls if they would bring stability to the state's wholesale power market, 
Griffin said. 
""We have expressed that we may be comfortable with some form of temporary 
price mitigation in order to get through this crisis,"" Griffin said. 
But the base prices for electricity written into the windfall-tax bills are 
much lower than generators' actual costs, Ackerman said. 
""Today's gas prices are much higher than that,"" he said. ""Everybody would 
automatically sell out of state."" 
Lawmakers Unmoved 
Lawmakers aren't overly concerned with negative implications if the measure 
becomes law. 
""If the price for rolling out the welcome for generators is 10 to 30 times 
more than Californians paid for power last year, then we ought to build our 
own plants,"" said state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Redondo Beach, and chairwoman of 
the Senate energy committee. ""The state's motto is 'Eureka,' not 'Welcome to 
California, please come gouge us.'"" 
Paul Van Dyke, press secretary to state Sen. Nell Soto, D-Ontario, who is 
sponsoring the windfall profits tax bill in the Senate, said ""there's no 
evidence that leaving things the way they are now will be better."" 
""California has a limited policy chest, and federal energy regulators are not 
moving fast enough to solve the problems,"" Van Dyke said. ""California needs 
to build up its tool chest. So at the end of the day, whether we solve this 
problem through windfall profits or a negotiated agreement with the 
generators, the bottom line is consumers cannot be gouged."" 
Davis - who told reporters Monday that the state ""is at war"" with 
Houston-based generators - is expected to meet with representatives from a 
dozen energy companies Wednesday to discuss ""unpaid debts, credit issues and 
the supply of power."" Those generators include Mirant, Williams and Duke 
Energy. 
At the meeting Wednesday, Davis will attempt to get the generators to take a 
haircut on hundreds of millions of dollars of power bills owed by PG&E Corp. 
unit Southern California Edison. In exchange, a person close to Davis said, 
the governor may promise to veto the windfall profits tax bill if it reaches 
his desk. 
The governor's office wouldn't comment on the substance of the meeting 
Wednesday. 
Wall Street analysts said the measure could have severe effects on 
California's economy if it passes and will pressure generators' shares as the 
bills move through the Legislature. 
""We expect weakness in (generators) shares with California exposure,"" Dan 
Ford, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said in a research note Tuesday. ""A 
windfall profits tax bill will motivate generation developers to remove 
existing and new capital to other states and potentially destroy California's 
already softening economy."" 
Ultimately, however, Ford expects the bill to be used as a bargaining chip 
rather than passed. 
The tax also raises regulatory questions, several lawmakers said. In essence, 
California is attempting to set wholesale power rates, which are governed by 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
A FERC commissioner wouldn't comment directly on the issue, but told Dow 
Jones Newswires that the state has ""no jurisdiction on wholesale power rates 
and does not have the legal authority to adjust rates set by FERC.""

Elizabeth:  PG&E cannot accept the added language as you have presented it;
as you well appreciate, it arguably would have the effect of diminishing
PG&E's current rights.  I have accepted your changes and provided a revision
that I think more fairly preserves each party's status quo rights.  Please
keep in mind that PG&E already is agreeing to a modification of the LC
drawing events as an accommodation to Enron.  In light of that and of our
need to cooperate and move forward, I hope you can leave things as they
appear in this revision.  I'll try to call you tomorrow to confirm.  And,
thanks for attending to this.  Larry

Elizabeth:  Good to hear from you.  David Anderson is immersed in the
agreement, and he should be the one youwork with on it (415-973-6659;
dwa@pge.com).  By the way, we seem to have stalled a bit on finalizing the
stand-still agreement, which, as I last understood it, had only one
remaining issue, namely, the wording of the drawing provision for the LCs.
Can we get that one behind us, also?  Thanks.  Larry

Ms. Sager,

The printer that was originally recommended by the IT technician for Genia 
FitzGerald is not capable of handling her printouts.  He has determined that 
she needs a larger printer and he recommends the following:

 Black/white Network Printer HP 4100N in the amount of $1,503.00

If this meets with your approval, please forward this message to Janette 
Elbertson.


Thank you,

Steve/Christian,

The attached file is a draft of an asset management agreement prepared by Stu 
Zisman.  The later version obviously contained more negotiated points, so I 
think this one is more helpful.

I'm working on a transaction now which involves serving load as well as 
selling power. I found this one helpful for issue identification and 
exculpatory language, however.

Liz,

For some reason I didn't get your voicemail.  I'll stop by this afternoon to 
double check that you are OK with the EPMI entity in the role of  Asset 
Manager/Marketing  Agent in the North Carolina Power Holdings transaction 
that we are structuring with AIG/Highstar.

Please disregard the following message.  I did get your voicemail. The AMA 
that we are doing started with basically this form and has been pretty 
watered down as to the decision process we must follow.  Thanks for your help.

Attached is the final version of the Standstill Agreement that Larry Witalis 
and I have been working on. As has been discussed, the Standstill Period 
would be until June 20th, the LCs would be extended until June 29th and the 
draw condition re 20 day expiry would be deleted.  

Please review the attached and let me know if this would be OK to execute 
tomorrow and send to PG&E for signature.  

Bill -  please confirm the amounts of the LCs.

Dear Elizabeth,

Attached is the Mid-C Call Option Confirmation you reviewed this morning.
Many of the changes you suggested were quite valid - thanks for that!

The only modifications that we would prefer not to accept were the ones to
""Delivery Point"" and in the last line of the ""Description of Transaction"".
Regarding the former- we would rather not place specific parameters as to
how to chose the replacement DP (this goes for all of our counterparties,
not just Enron).  Which DP will be similar to the original DP in terms of
homogeneity and liquidity to us or to Enron is truly subjective, and
furthermore we would not want to agree to stricter parameters with Enron
than with other counterparties . The reality is that the parties are likely
to disagree on the replacement DP when and if this event occurs, and thus
the method for resolving this and any other dispute is arbitration under
Section 10.2  of the EEI Master.

Please let me know if the attached revised draft Confirmation will be
acceptable to you.

Thanks,

Shari

Marketers:

Christian and I are pleased to announce that we have developed a short-form 
standardized agreement for the Services Desk to use with its customers based 
outside of California that are producing unit-contingent energy, e.g., Geneva 
Steel, Potlatch, and Morrow Power.  



1.  You can use this short, pre-approved agreement for new generator 
customers for whom you intend to market unit-contingent energy on a daily 
basis.  If you want to buy firm energy from your customer, or do a term deal, 
then you will need to upgrade to an EEI Master Agreement or make other 
arrangements.

2.  You can send this agreement out to customers by simply asking Jan King 
(nicely) to change the names in the agreement to conform to your prospective 
customer, and then sending out the updated version.  As a matter of courtesy, 
copy Christian, Tracy, and me on the e-mail you send to the customer.

3.  Tracy says that as long as these agreements are for daily purchases of 
unit-contingent energy outside of California, she will not require credit 
information from the customer.  However, it is important that Tracy be kept 
in the loop on these deals.

4.  By clarifying the credit standards and providing an off-the-shelf 
agreement that you can send over, get signed, and then schedule power for the 
next day with, I believe we will be able to win more business by reducing the 
internal review time for this low-risk, high-margin business.

5.  We invite your suggestions to improve this agreement.  Jan will always 
have the most recent version.

6.  Our next project is to develop a similar agreement for California 
generators.


Regards, 

Steve

Tim,
The short answer to your question is:  ""sort of.""  Let me explain. 

 The perfect tax clause would say:  if there is ever a tax, you (meaning the 
other guy) will always pay it and we will pay nothing.  Obviously a contract 
containing  this kind of clause will not be signed by anyone. 

 So, a further, compromise type step is to say:  ok, if there is ever a 
future tax, and it is materially painful, and we can't work out a way of 
dealing with it among ourselves,  then we will terminate the contract and 
split the termination payment for mark to market exposure 50-50. A clause 
containing this kind of language has been used in the past, but it is not 
part of the EEI or WSPP, for example, and one cannot say it is widely in 
effect in our agreements. 

What the standard power contracts end up doing is compromising. They dodge 
the issue and I am not sure that a perfect bilateral contract could do any 
better.    They basically say that if there is ever a tax, either existing or 
future,  the Seller will pay it if it falls on the transaction before the 
Delivery Point,  and the Buyer will pay it if it falls on the transaction at 
and after the Delivery Point.  The poor innocent Delivery Point is forced to 
be the arbitrary fulcrum upon which tax allocation must precariously teeter.  

What the standard language forces us to do is anxiously hope that in every 
transaction we ever do that we will be on the side of the Delivery Point that 
will save us from the tax.  The other guy is in exactly the same boat.  

When a price cap is actually  imposed, whether it be called a price cap by 
the FERC or called windfall profits tax by California, there are two 
fundamental legal questions:  1.  Should we keep doing business at all?  2. 
Do our contracts protect us from the tax in respect of our existing 
business?  The Legal group (Elizabeth, Steve and me, keeping contact with 
Mark Haedicke) are working through an  analysis of this situation and are 
trying to get the Tax Department's  input which is very important and which 
we must ultimately be guided by.  My suggestion to you at this point is that 
we should not just plunge ahead doing long term deals in California, but 
should pause and make sure we have thought this thing out very carefully.  We 
will try to help as much with this big issue as soon as we can.  ----cgy

do our contracts have any standard language referring to the allocation of 
future tax burdens.  specifically, if california implemented a gross receipts 
tax whereby any revenue that we receive in excess of $60.00/MWh would be 
subject to a 50 percent tax.

David,

As this document stands, it is okay.  With respect to the QSE agreement, we 
will need to reinstate the New Power Holding's MACs since a $1MM line of 
credit will be extended to them under that agreement.  Those MACs were 
eliminated from the EEI since Enron is not extending credit under that 
agreement.

I attach a draft dated 5/10/01 of a Two Way Cash and Letter of Credit Form of 
Credit Support Annex to be used with EEI Masters.  Because the Draft Annex is 
based on the form  used by the Swap Group, I have also attached a version 
marked to show changes from the Swap Group's form.

While preparing this I also reviewed the Credit Annex draft prepared by 
Morgan Stanley and Shari Stack's comments on it.  Unlike the MS draft, mine 
doesn't contemplate any kinds of collateral other than cash and letters of 
credit (which is what EAS wanted, I believe.)  In addition, Shari had posed 
the question of whether any defaults under the Credit Annex itself should be 
made Events of Default under the Master Agreement.  Although my initial 
reaction is that we should not add any such additional defaults under the 
Credit Annex as Events of Default, please think about this question as you 
review the draft.

I look forward to your comments.
Janet

Tennis plan looks great.  Total time 1 hour 35 minutes.  No problem.  I 
played  last night with Grant and 2 other guys (only the second time I've 
ever played doubles with Grant) - my forehand/backhand down the line won some 
respect (thanks to our practice sessions no doubt) but my net game continues 
to be wobbly, shaky, timid, erratic , random.... in a word, pitiful.  So here 
is to continued improvement - See you at 1130 on Thursday, court 1.

Also Genia sent you by email our EEI cover sheet last week but she just left 
me a message saying you may no have rec'd it.  Did you get it?  If not I'll 
resend.  Just let me know. Thanks"

I have it on very good information that the Credit Dep't is staging a 
""workathon"" this week and Bill B. has promised Elizabeth that if we give her 
our top 5 CP's for whom we need credit input/info (credit worksheets, 
follow-up calls, etc.) - we will have the information we need by the end of 
the week.  Some in Credit have even brought their sleeping bags to the 
office. They appear to be taking this very seriously! 

So..... Elizabeth asked that we each give her the names of our top 5 
Counterparties for whom we need Credit input/info. We need to give her the 
names by 10 am tomorrow (Tuesday).

Attached each of you will find a document that explains the timing and
objectives of the Accounts Receivable/Accounts Payable Reconciliation Project
that will be conducted by Arthur Andersen.  If you are not aware of the review
or have not been contacted by myself , I will be contacting you within the 
next
day or so to establish a convenient meeting time to discuss one of the key 
areas
of the project which relates to the statute of limitations.  We will be 
looking
at the term that balances have been in AR and AP, and we want to make sure we
understand the legal rights related to these balances for the specific
commodities and industries that you support.  We should only need to meet 
about
30 minutes or less.

If you have any questions prior to our meeting time or me contacting you, 
please
feel free to give me a call at ext. 6-6275

Thank you for taking time to review the attachment and I will be in contact 
with
each of you if we have not yet spoken.

Subject: NiMO

All:

Attached for your records is a copy of the final version of the proposal 
letter that went out to NiMo last week.




Also attached below is a first set of clarification questions I receved from 
Navigant regarding our proposal.   Responses to these questions are due no 
later than Weds 5/16 and we will be working to respond to these in an 
appropriate fashion.   You will see that the questions are rather shallow and 
do not really provide any sense as to their reaction to our proposal.  I have 
left msgs with the folks at Navigant so that I may speak with them in an 
attempt to cut to the chase and discern what NiMO's true intentions are at 
this point.  I do not want to waste time answering these questions and 
marking up the proposed contracts if they ultimately will decide to take 
another course of action.   My hope is to get a mtg with NiMO ASAP and 
short-circuit the RFP process as soon as possible.

Please provide any comments on the attached questions by Monday so that we 
can decide our form of response by Wednesday.  Kay - you will note they 
requested markups of the Transacton Docs -- let's continue holding off until 
I can get a better read if it will be worth the effort.  Ed/Paul - note the 
questions on how much credit requirements we have assumed.  I don't know how 
much more clearly we can state the fact that we require a claim on ALL of 
NiMOs assets, but any appropriate elaboration on this would be appreciated.

John

Elizabeth:  No sign of the document yet.  Are you sending a siignature-ready
copy on Enron letterhead, or should I simply print off a copy, perhaps
re-addressed from Roy to Mike, and send that to you or to someone else at
Enron?  For the life of me, I can't recall what arrangementswe made
yesterday (I'm getting so much older, it seems, and so rapidly!).  Thanks.

Please find our draft PX/ISO figures.    We have not received the allocation 
of defaults from the ISO (PG&E,SCE et al).   They did however estimate the 
PG&E portion at 80%.  If this was the case, this would put EPMI's PG&E claim 
at approximately $39.8 million (($41,504,394 + $19,263 + $8,253,866)  x 80%).

Elizabeth:  No sign of the document yet.  Are you sending a siignature-ready
copy on Enron letterhead, or should I simply print off a copy, perhaps
re-addressed from Roy to Mike, and send that to you or to someone else at
Enron?  For the life of me, I can't recall what arrangementswe made
yesterday (I'm getting so much older, it seems, and so rapidly!).  Thanks.

I have it on very good information that the Credit Dep't is staging a 
""workathon"" this week and Bill B. has promised Elizabeth that if we give her 
our top 5 CP's for whom we need credit input/info (credit worksheets, 
follow-up calls, etc.) - we will have the information we need by the end of 
the week.  Some in Credit have even brought their sleeping bags to the 
office. They appear to be taking this very seriously! 

So..... Elizabeth asked that we each give her the names of our top 5 
Counterparties for whom we need Credit input/info. We need to give her the 
names by 10 am tomorrow (Tuesday).

Here are my thoughts so far:

1.  Initial Legal Team -- Jeff Hodge, Jim Keller, Carol St. Clair, Aaron 
Rothwarg

2.  Spot Check the Forms -- over the next week

3.  Conform Forms to ENA Forms -- over next two months

4.  Develop Form Approval Process -- dual approvals by EES and ENA

5.  Develop Deal Approval Process -- deals above a certain size (or material 
variations from the form) would require concurrent EWS approval

6.  Request List of Major Contract Concerns from Traders -- items that cannot 
be hedged"

morning and said her job has been eliminated.  She's freaking out!  

Did you find a restaurant for your mom and sister? I didn't get the voice 
mail until this morning.  I'm so sorry. I don't know any vegetarian 
restaurants though.

David - 

Please review the insert that Entergy provided.  They have requested that the 
Into Entergy System Border includes... ""from an interface that has sufficient 
ATC posted that will allow for the purchase of Daily Network Designated 
Resources on the Entergy Transmission System.""

I am ok with this b/c the def of an into product requires firm trans to be 
avail to sink into the CA (Entergy in this case).  In the event firm is not 
avail, then supplier can take LD risk associated with non-firm trans.

Entergy agreed with this interpretation.

Also, because this is a large deal for them, they need to get approval from 
higher levels.

Please provide me with some feedback as this deal is critical to my trading 
position/strategy.

Thanks,
Rogers

Give me a call on this - I was thinking either Marcus Nettelton or Carol St

Due to the size of this possible transaction, I thought I would keep you in 
the loop on its status.

We submitted a bid with caveats as to its non-binding nature, and suggested 
an alternative structure.  In response, Navigant issued questions. John 
Llodra has compiled answers, which appear to be fine to me.

 We  (Legal) have been instructed to standby, awaiting commercial guidance as 
to whether we will be going forward.  I believe Klauberg has either cleared 
conflicts or initiated the process, so if we go forward, he should be our man.

I will let you know once a go/no go decision is reached.

We have two Summer Clerks coming in this summer which we have hired through 
the Houston Bar Association Minority Recruitment Program.   Majed Nachawati 
will be starting Monday May 21st.  He will be here 6 weeks and Alisha Mahibar 
will start on July 2 and be here the final 6 weeks.  

Enron Corp. also has hired two law summer clerks from UT .  These clerks will 
be doing 4 week rotations throughout Enron and we will have them each for a 
four week  period.  Dates are still being finalized.

Samantha Ferguson, an HBA law clerk from last summer, will again support the 
Global Market group this summer.

I would like to have a point person from each of your groups with the charge 
of getting these clerks involved in the project flow for each group.  My plan 
is to have these clerks work with two groups during their time here with the 
groups rotating during the summer.  Please, consider who in your groups would 
be best suited for this role and provide feedback as soon as possible.  I 
will take this role for the East Origination-Gas Trading group.  Thanks for 
all your help."

California's GO Rating Cut To Aa3 From Aa2 By Moody's Updated: Tuesday, May 
15, 2001 12:03 PM ET 
NEW YORK, May 15, 2001 -- Moody's has lowered the rating on $19.8 billion of 
State of California General Obligation bonds to Aa3 from Aa2. In addition, we 
have lowered the rating on $5.7 billion in lease revenue bonds from Aa3 to 
A1. 
The downgrade reflects increasing financial risks associated with the 
continuing energy crisis, as well as those related to trends in the broader 
U.S. and California economies. The recent setback in securing legislation to 
provide energy purchase bridge financing threatens to compound the risks and 
cost of the energy crisis. In addition, the newly released May Revision to 
the Governor's Budget Submission confirms the substantial revenue 
deterioration that is expected to emerge over the next eighteen months due to 
the weak high technology sector and stock market. The May Revision commences 
what is likely to be a difficult budget debate. 
Delay in External Energy Financing Will Continue to Erode State Financial 
Position 
To date, the state's general fund cash advances for power purchases total 
approximately $4 billion, and these advances are likely to grow very quickly 
in the coming months. Last week, the legislature passed a bill (Senate Bill 
31) authorizing the issuance of $13.4 billion in revenue bonds to fund future 
purchases and repay the General Fund for past advances. Unfortunately, this 
law will not go into effect until late summer, thereby scuttling the state's 
planned interim loan facility which would have provided temporary funding for 
power purchases. Importantly, the bridge financing would have begun the 
process of shifting the source of cash from the state treasury to the credit 
markets, and ultimately to ratepayers. That process is now delayed, and in 
the interim, the state treasury will continue to serve as the source of funds 
for power purchases. 
Net state power purchase advances are running at the rate of over $1 billion 
per month. Moody's estimates that the state's ending cash position will be 
approximately $10 billion at June 30, 2001, including both General Fund cash 
and internal ""borrowable resources"", which represents cash that can be 
borrowed by the General Fund beyond the end of the fiscal year. This estimate 
takes into account expected energy purchases through June 30th. 
In July and August, an additional $3 to $4 billion could be expended from the 
state treasury to purchase power until external financing is secured, 
bringing total General Fund advances for power purchases to almost $10 
billion by mid-August. As a result, the state's cash reserves are likely to 
be significantly depleted by the time long-term financing can be secured. The 
experience of the early 1990s indicates that a substantial portion of 
borrowable resources serve as a source of liquidity. Nevertheless, Moody's 
still anticipates this weakened cash position will lead the state to seek 
external cash flow borrowing for the General Fund in the form of Revenue 
Anticipation Notes during 2002, reversing the trend over the last two fiscal 
years in which the State has not needed to borrow externally for seasonal 
cash flow purposes. The state is expected to release refined cash projections 
later this week. 
Although the state's liquidity position is clearly weakening, we do not view 
the state's current financial outlook as severe enough to lower the rating to 
the A range. And Senate Bill 31 protects the General Fund from future 
energy-related advances by stipulating that after November 15, 2001, the 
amounts required for short-term cash flow power purchases cannot exceed $500 
million in the aggregate. The enacted bill further requires that such amounts 
be repaid from the Department of Water Resources Electric Power Fund within 
180 days. These provisions provide some assurances that DWR will seek rate 
increases to fund its purchases when bond proceeds have been depleted. We are 
currently assuming the state's General Fund may not be fully reimbursed by 
the proceeds of the long-term financing, as such full reimbursement would 
reduce the amount of bond proceeds available for future power purchases, and 
require DWR to seek additional rate increases during 2001. Given the lack of 
consensus as to how to distribute the cost of power between ratepayers and 
the state treasury, it is unclear whether additional rate increases during 
2001 will be politically feasible. 
May Revision Quantifies Expected Deterioration in Revenue Forecast 
As expected, the May Revision to the Governor's Fiscal 2002 Budget Submission 
revised tax revenue forecasts downward by a substantial magnitude, reflecting 
the economic and revenue effect of the weakening economic outlook compared to 
that underlying the Governor's January proposal. In particular, the weakening 
U.S. economic outlook and stock market performance, particularly in the 
technology-oriented NASDAQ market, produce major changes to the income and 
sales tax forecasts. Over the last several years, the percentage of General 
Fund revenues attributable to capital gains and stock options has grown from 
approximately 5% in fiscal 1996 to an estimated 23% in the current fiscal 
year. Based primarily on the downturn in the high technology sector, which 
relies heavily on options in compensation packages, and the sluggish 
performance of the stock market and its adverse affect on capital gains, the 
state has reduced its tax revenue estimate for the upcoming year by 
approximately $5.4 billion, including a $2.7 downward revision in the 
personal income tax. The drop in these sources of income will also temper 
growth in sales tax collections for the upcoming year. In total, the state 
now expects revenues to decline by approximately $3.2 billion year over year 
between the current fiscal year and fiscal 2002. The state has not seen year 
over year tax revenue declines since 1992. 
A number of budgetary actions taken in recent years will aid the state in 
adapting to the weaker revenue forecast. During fiscal 2001, as well as in 
the January proposal for 2002, the budget included substantial non-recurring 
spending items. As a result the base of recurring budget demands in fiscal 
2002 and beyond is lower than it otherwise would have been. The governor has 
proposed to cancel or defer some of these items, seeking to reduce General 
Fund spending by approximately $3.2 billion as compared to the January 
proposal. Spending cuts, however, do not match the revenue decline. Fiscal 
2002 spending is slated to drop by $600 million year on year, a drop of less 
than 1%, while revenues are expected to fall by 4% during the same period. 
Although the revenue forecast is relatively cautious, the target ending 
balance, at $1.8 billion, leaves little cushion for additional bad news. 
The proposed budgetary reductions, along with proposed spending levels for 
recurring items such as education, will likely lead to prolonged budget 
debate in the coming weeks. While such budget negotiations would not 
necessarily adversely affect the timing of the issuance of the long-term 
power bonds, delay could further weaken the state's fiscal position. 
Energy Crisis Compounds Uncertainty in Economic Outlook 
The energy crisis will have economic, as well as financial, consequences that 
add further uncertainty to an already complex economic outlook. The 
Governor's economic forecast calls for the economy to slow through 2002, 
taking a similar if not more slightly pessimistic view than other economists, 
including UCLA, Economy.com, and the economists surveyed by the Western Blue 
Chip. The state posted non-farm employment gains of nearly 4% in 2000, but 
the Governor's forecast expects job growth to moderate to 2.3% in 2001, and 
grow by less than 2% in 2002. Salary and wage income growth, which drives tax 
revenues, is expected to be even weaker than employment trends. The drivers 
of the forecasts include the outlook for the high technology sector, as well 
as the important housing sector. 
None of the economic forecasts explicitly quantifies the impact of the energy 
crisis. The California economy is not heavily dependent upon energy, and 
ranks lowest among states in terms of per capita electricity consumption. The 
industries that drive the California economy are not heavy users of energy 
and it is not a major cost factor for the California industry mix. However, 
uncertainty regarding cost and availability of energy and the threat of 
unreliable power going forward have already damaged the state's business 
climate, reputation, and longer-term growth prospects. In Moody's view, the 
forecasting techniques of the major economic services tend to underestimate 
the potential impact of these difficult to quantify dimensions of the energy 
crisis. 
OUTLOOK: 
Outlook Remains Negative 
At the moment, we expect that the substantial cash resources accumulated by 
the State of California during the expansion of the last decade, in 
combination with the planned long-term energy financing will enable it to 
avert the degree of fiscal damage that would call for the rating to fall to 
the A range. If a reasonably cautious balanced budget is enacted and the 
long-term energy financing completed, the state will still have reasonable 
margins of bondholder protection on its balance sheet. However, if the state 
or US economic outlook weakens further, or if the energy financing stalls, or 
if the enacted budget is only narrowly balanced, the rating could be adjusted 
further. While we expect that the state will be able to structure a viable 
long-term energy financing over the next few months, substantial obstacles 
must be overcome to meet that goal. In addition, the state will need to enact 
a balanced budget that leaves enough cushion to accommodate the remaining 
economic uncertainty not captured in its cautious revenue forecast. Given the 
recent failure to secure the supermajority necessary to enact emergency 
bridge energy financing legislation, we expect that the budget - which also 
requires a two-thirds majority vote - will also be the subject of a difficult 
debate. "

I have it on very good information that the Credit Dep't is staging a 
""workathon"" this week and Bill B. has promised Elizabeth that if we give her 
our top 5 CP's for whom we need credit input/info (credit worksheets, 
follow-up calls, etc.) - we will have the information we need by the end of 
the week.  Some in Credit have even brought their sleeping bags to the 
office. They appear to be taking this very seriously! 

So..... Elizabeth asked that we each give her the names of our top 5 
Counterparties for whom we need Credit input/info. We need to give her the 
names by 10 am tomorrow (Tuesday).

Dan Alleghretti worked with me to put this together, and believes that 
multi-settlement would not be implemented before 1/1/03.  The text is 
intended to balance Buyer's and Seller's intersests so that it can be placed

Hello, Dana Davis (Vice President of trading) just informed me of some new 
language that needs to be added to our confirmation letters for deals done at 
NEPOOL PTF (this is the delivery point).  The language he gave me is as 
follows:

In the event that multi settlement is implemented then NEPOOL PTF becomes 
seller's choice. (I am sure this needs to be worded differently)

I told Dana that I would have to run this language through one of the 
attorneys.  He said they could call him and he would explain further.

He also wants this language added to the NEPOOL PTF product on Enron Online 
(this would not be for NEPOOL ICAP deals, installed capacity).

I copied Marcus on this e-mail but I am not certain if he would be the 
correct person to work on this or not.  Dana would like to start adding this 
language as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Melissa

(red text only):

Special Conditions, paragraph (2) subparagraph (iii) shall be modified as 
follows:

""(iii) that any remedy that EESI may have against EPMI under this Transaction 
is limited by the remedy actually obtained by EPMI under the NYSEG 
Transaction (unless EPMI shall have failed to pay any uncontested amounts due 
and owing from EPMI to NYSEG under the NYSEG Transaction or EPMI shall have 
failed to deliver the Attributes received from NYSEG to EESI, in which case 
EESI shall have a claim against EPMI for the replacement value of the 
Attributes not delivered to EESI)""

If the above referenced change is acceptable please forward to me a revised 
Confirmation Agreement.

Regards,

Richard

		 Subject: XOM

Alas, no agreement to execute at this point.  We have come a long way, 
however, and only 2 serious issues remain open.  (All the others are at least 
mostly resolved -- see my 5/1/01 revision w/ marginal notes made during my 
5/2/01 meeting w/ them.)  This file is in my office with all the others.

XOM requires that all of its contracts contain 2 provisions, both of which 
are problematic for Enron.

(1)  The Federal Contractor Supplement -- exhibit F to the EEI Master -- is 
designed to assure XOM's compliance w/ the U.S. federal government's 
requirements imposed on all government contractors.  There are 2 categories 
of requirements:  environmental laws compliance and small business 
participation in federal govt purchases of goods and services.  Since XOM has 
adoped a ""General Commercial Plan"" to comply with such requirements, XOM has 
promised the U.S. govt that ALL its contracts will contain these provisions.  
And that's what the auditors from the U.S. government would be looking to 
ascertain in a review of XOM's compliance.  As for Enron, we do engage in 
business w/ the U.S. govt, but we have not adopted a ""General Commercial 
Plan,"" so we have to address these issues on an ad hoc basis.  Taking the 
last paragraph of this Supplement as an example (addressing the use of women 
and minority owned businesses by Enron in supplying services to XOM under 
this contract), at this point, Enron isn't really prepared to undertake such 
things and all those I dealt with on this seem a bit nervous about Enron's 
ability to comply.  I've communicated w/ Michelle Cash, George Wasaff, and 
Cathy Riley (at Calvin Eakins direction) on this topic, and I asked Cathy 
Riley to have her director, Calvin Eakins, phone me to discuss this further, 
but he did not call.  And there does not seem to be a very good solution to 
this.  XOM has suggested revising the language in Sec. 10.13 (based on my 
5/1/01 draft) to add a final sentence ""The Federal Contract Supplement is 
attached as Exhibit F and each Party shall comply with such requirements to 
the extent appplicable.""  This certainly takes care of all of XOM's concerns, 
but I'm not sure this gets Enron all the way where we need to be.  See, for 
example, Dave Nutt's markup of the environmental provisions (in the file), 
and Cathy Riley says there are no exceptions or exemptions to the small 
business requirements.  We might be able to get some outside expertise on 
this or get Sharon Butcher to help resolve it.

(2)  Limitation of Damages -- Article 7 waives consequentials, etc. for both 
parties.  XOM insists that this provision must carve out damages resulting 
from the ""gross negligence and/or willful misconduct attributable to its 
managerial and senior supervisory personnel"".  You can see the full details 
of the provisions they're looking for in the XOM language in sec 10.4 (same 
draft), the extensive indemnity language which they added in the last round 
and which we generally don't mind giving them.  But this impacts Article 7 
because the Enron version of the waiver expressly states that the waiver 
applies to indemnities, and, of course, XOM will not tolerate any exceptions 
to the liability of each party (yes, it's mutual) for the gross negligence of 
its managers, etc.  There's a true story behind all this that dates back to 
the EPA emissions requirements on Reformulated Gasoline (RFG).  Mobil hired a 
lab to do the testing, the managers of the lab company encouraged the testing 
staff to ""fudge"" the results, tons of RFG hit the market that was not in 
compliance, and a huge black mark on Mobil and zillions of dollars lost were 
the result.  And the contract provided that the lab's damages were limited to 
the testing fees, and apparently, that worked for the lab company.  So, it's 
a deal breaker for XOM  b/c they say that if Enron's managers decide to turn 
off the lights at all the refineries for some specious reason, they need to 
have proper recourse against Enron.   I''ve argued with them about this, 
based on the nature of this contract, the power trading business, etc. but to 
no avail .....  It would seem that Enron's language in Art. 7, w/ the 
following rather narrow change, might work for both parties, but it's up to 
you, now.
 UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR 
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST 
PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR 
CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE provided, however, that 
nothing in this Article 7 shall be interpreted to limit either Party's 
liability under Article 10.4(b).  
Let me know if you have any questions about this.

Janice

Michelle -- As discussed, attached is a redlined and an execution copy of the 
New Power QSE Agreement, for your review and transmission onwards to New 
Power's Anoush Farhangi.  The document is being cc'd to the EPMI recipients 
you had designated.  For their benefit I direct their attention to the 
confidentiality obligations stated in Section 7.2:  in particular, EPMI will 
be under obligations to keep New Power's scheduling and settlements 
information confidential from EES and EES personnel.
 
Michelle, please note to New Power that: (1) New Power still needs to fill in 
their contact/payments information on Schedule A. (2) the Enron Guarantee 
format was not referenced in the document as Schedule E and Schedule E was 
therefore eliminated.  Per the Credit Support Annex, each guarantee must be 
in a format acceptable to the other party.  (3) The lengthy ERCOT Calendar 
will be kept current on the MIS website, so it was not included as 
'Attachment X' to the document.

Please call me with any questions or comments. --David

Subject: New Power QSE Agreement- execution copy

Michelle -- As discussed, attached is a redlined and an execution copy of the 
New Power QSE Agreement, for your review and transmission onwards to New 
Power's Anoush Farhangi.  The document is being cc'd to the EPMI recipients 
you had designated.  For their benefit I direct their attention to the 
confidentiality obligations stated in Section 7.2:  in particular, EPMI will 
be under obligations to keep New Power's scheduling and settlements 
information confidential from EES and EES personnel.
 
Michelle, please note to New Power that: (1) New Power still needs to fill in 
their contact/payments information on Schedule A. (2) the Enron Guarantee 
format was not referenced in the document as Schedule E and Schedule E was 
therefore eliminated.  Per the Credit Support Annex, each guarantee must be 
in a format acceptable to the other party.  (3) The lengthy ERCOT Calendar 
will be kept current on the MIS website, so it was not included as 
'Attachment X' to the document.

Please call me with any questions or comments. --David

Peter and Kevin's concern with the language you suggested is that NERC=20

Luther King Day, Washington's Day, Columbus Day, and Veteran's Day are all=

Federal banking holidays which are not NERC holidays.  Since they want the=

Peter and Kevin's concern with the language you suggested is that NERC=20

Luther King Day, Washington's Day, Columbus Day, and Veteran's Day are all=

Federal banking holidays which are not NERC holidays.  Since they want the=

Jean -- Could you please determine how (if at all) the Protocols will treat 
these specific circumstances:   When a QSE becomes unable to pay its 
obligations to the  ERCOT ISO, does the ERCOT ISO have any ability (or is 
there any guidance anywhere on whether it will have any ability) to impose 
liability on the remaining functioning QSEs to cover dollar liabilities of 
the defaulting QSE not satisfied by the defaulting QSE's credit support?  
Mike Curry said a while ago that he understood the the new CFO in ERCOT to be 
gearing up to address/resolve this issue.  For purposes of the QSE agreements 
Enron Power Marketing, Inc. is trying to complete  with customers, we are 
seeking as much information on this as possible, when and as available.  I 
understand that in California the ISO sought to impose such liabilities on 
the remaining healthy scheduling entities, which authority remains in 
dispute.  Please call Mike or me to discuss if the substance of this query if 
not clear.

Melanie

In general, Enron would prefer all matters with respect to power go to 
arbitration for all issues.  When we first started trading power we limited 
arbitration because we were uncertain where/how the market was going.  
Accordingly, we limited arbitration to financial matters only.  I only raised 
the issue last week because the scope of arbitration came up in another case 
and we were uncertain whether an issue of proper termination would be subject 
to the arbitration provision or not.  In conclusion, based on today's 
policies (arbitrate everything), I would not think that there would be any 
reason for us to be concerned with preserving  an argument of limited 
applicability of the arbitration language found in the PCA Master.

I briefly reviewed your draft answer and will fax the comments to you shortly.

Thanks

Martha 
I think this message was sent in response to the message you tried to send 
from my computer ( not the old message) ... so I don't think the IT people 
got the message that you tried to send today.

Thanks

Thanks.  Hopefully the request I sent in from your computer will work.  I'll 
give them a call to let them know that you tried to send in your approval and 
the address was correct on the e-mail but you had the delivery failure.

Christi,

We need to meet with David Portz to discuss the risk associated with 
transmission changes as a result of new RTO's.  This morning in Bauhgman's 
meeting I volunteered to work with you and David to prepare draft contract 
language on this issue.

Let me know when you can meet.

Attached please find a Tax Review of California Senate Bill No. 1 (""SB 1X"").  
The Tax Review sets out the practical implication (likely cessation of 
electricity sales and curtailment of investment in new generation assets) and 
constitutional deficiencies of SB 1X.  Please note, SB 1X will not apply to 
sales of electricity made pursuant to binding written contracts executed on 
or before the date SB 1X is signed into law (if ever).  

The California Senate has passed SB 1X.  The California Assembly has drafted 
their own version, Assembly Bill No. 128 (""AB 128X""), which the Assembly is 
presently debating.  A Tax Review of AB 128X is also attached.

We will keep you advised regarding the progress of both SB 1X and AB 128X.  
Please advise if you have questions and/or comments.  Thanks.

Thanks for your message.  I can meet with Jim Derrick on the 30th, and have 
flexibility to attend training on either the 29th or 31st.  One consideration 
is that Christian will be in St. Louis on the 31st and 1st; if Christian 
wants to attend the training session we should hold it on the 29th.

Enron will pay for my travel expenses, yes?

Best,

Steve

Reliant has offered to host the next meeting of the drafting committee at 
their Houston offices.  I have also been asked to set up a drafting meeting 
for the purpose of finishing the collateral annex.   The participants in that 
process would like to hold that meeting in July in Houston.  Reliant is 
willing to host that meeting as well.  Let me know if its ok to take Reliant 
up on their offer to host one or both meetings.  Also, would holding both 
meetings consecutively over two days make sense?    Would July work for both 
meetings for everyone?  Holding a meeting in July will give ample time to 
review suggested language and prepare comments.  Please let me know.

As a starting point for the optional provisions, I've attached the ones Dede 
handed out at our workshop.  We still need an electronic trading platform 
provision (Babak).

Let the pols fix the mess, statewide!

Keep movin', movin', movin',
Though they're disapprovin',
Keep them rates a-movin', statewide.
Don't try to understand 'em,
Just raise, charge, and collect 'em.
Soon we'll be livin' high and wide.
My heart's calculatin',
Nuclear plants will be awaitin',
Be waitin' at the end of my ride.

 (Chorus)
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off,
Shut 'em down, block 'em out,
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off, statewide!
Brown 'em out, black 'em out,
Charge 'em more, give 'em less,
Let the pols fix the mess, statewide! STATEWIDE!! ! Hyaah!!

Calif Controller:State Behind On Long Term Contract Buys Updated: Monday, May 
21, 2001 02:59 PM ET 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California State Controller Kathleen Connell said 
Monday that she anticipates the state will need to issue $4 billion in 
revenue anticipation notes in February, because a $13.4 billion revenue bond 
issue in mid-August will not be enough to cover power purchases. 
The state is likely to spend more on spot market purchases than the 
administration has anticipated because the price of summer power will be 
higher than expected and because the state has secured fewer long-term 
contracts than expected, she said. 
""The administration projected we'd spend $925 million for long-term contracts 
in the first six months (of 2001). We've now spent only $36.4 million on 
long-term contracts of a total $5.1 billion spent on energy purchases - less 
than 1%,"" Connell said. 
It is unlikely that an additional $890 million in long-term contracts will 
flow through her office in the next five weeks, Connell said. "

Melissa  --  The attachment has modified language in response to your 
communication that EOL confirmations (and to a lesser extent, OTC 
confirmations) could not readily be issued confining this language to trades 
flowing on or after 1/1/03.  Accordingly, please have the revised text placed 
into confirmations with energy deliveries to occur at the ""NEPOOL PTF"" 
Delivery Point.  --David

Melissa -- The redlined confirmation below shows the language resolved after 
discussion with Dana as to what is being traded by the market participants. 
Going forward, the insert is to be placed in confirmations with a NEPOOL PTF 
Delivery Point where delivery will occur at or after 1/1/03, including 
confirmations issued in relation to EOL trading.   Please call me with any 
questions.  Thanks. --David

Dana -- Attached is a draft confirmation template with text inserted in the 
Delivery Point section to treat the multi-settlement issue you identified.  
Dan Alleghretti worked with me to put this together, and believes that 
multi-settlement would not be implemented before 1/1/03.  The text is 
intended to balance Buyer's and Seller's intersests so that it can be placed 
in confirmations where EPMI is Buyer or Seller.  Please come back to me your 
comments or I will stop by your desk with a hard copy later this morning so 
that we can discuss.  --David

Sorry about that, I assumed Janice was taking care of it while we were at the

Marcus, he can let me know if he can look at it or if I should re-assign.

		 Subject: New language needed for Nepool trades

Hello, Dana Davis (Vice President of trading) just informed me of some new 
language that needs to be added to our confirmation letters for deals done at 
NEPOOL PTF (this is the delivery point).  The language he gave me is as 
follows:

In the event that multi settlement is implemented then NEPOOL PTF becomes 
seller's choice. (I am sure this needs to be worded differently)

I told Dana that I would have to run this language through one of the 
attorneys.  He said they could call him and he would explain further.

He also wants this language added to the NEPOOL PTF product on Enron Online 
(this would not be for NEPOOL ICAP deals, installed capacity).

I copied Marcus on this e-mail but I am not certain if he would be the 
correct person to work on this or not.  Dana would like to start adding this 
language as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Melissa

Elizabeth,

As punishment for ignoring its pleas for price controls, last week the CPUC 
issued an order requiring the California IOUs to develop market-based rate 
tariffs for their Federal customers, e.g., military installations, federal 
agencies.  The CPUC thinks that by exposing the Federal government to current 
market prices it will cause Bush/Cheney to rethink price caps.  In any case, 
while I think this proposal is unconstitutional under the principles of the 
McCulloch v. Maryland case (states can't tax the federal gov.), I also think 
there might be a business opportunity here for EPMI in helping Federal 
enclaves lock in a fixed price for electricity.  In other words, offer these 
Federal entities a fixed-for-floating deal.  

Stewart Rosman suggested that the best way to handle this would be to offer 
the Federal entities a purely financial deal.  The Federal entities would 
continue to receive physical delivery from their utility but could lock in a 
fixed rate through a financial swap.

Before we get too far down the road on this, what are your thoughts?  Can the 
Federal gov., besides the U.S. Treasury, enter into derivatives contracts?  
While financial deals would appear to be superior because they involve less 
ongoing work (no physical scheduling or real time support), are there 
benefits to a physical transaction?  Any other ideas?

Steve"

Elizabeth, we issued late on Friday (as invoice date was May 20 (Sunday) and 
it was a long weekend) here the April invoices which were hand marked either 
April 1-12 (pre-petition) and April 13-30 (post-petition).  A couple of 
questions:  (i) is there anything more we need to do with these invoices, 
particularly to recover post-petition receivables?  (ii) do we need to send 
copies of the invoices to you or anyone else?

Subject: RE: Sysco Energy Services and Sales Agreement 

The following are my thoughts on the draft (without discussion with Sysco): 

1.? In Section 1.3.2, why should curtailed usage be applied towards Excess 
Usage?? How is EESI at risk if Actual Usage (not including curtailed energy) 
is within the permitted band?? Same comment in Section 2.2.4.

2.????? In Section 3.5, if we don't elect to treat the Facility as a Closed 
Facility for purposes of Schedule 2.0 within 24 months, your draft would have 
us making Deficiency Usage payments forever, which is inconsistent with the 
rationale you provided for requiring a 24 month cut-off.? We assumed that 
after 24 months, if we didn't make an election, we would be required to make 
an Early Termination Payment. 

3.????? In Section 3.6, I will send some changes that reflect the fact that 
we can substitute a Closed Facility with multiple Substitute Facilities, so 
long as we bear any additional costs (which I think is what we discussed).? 
Also, in the last sentence of that Section, we had discussed treating Excess 
and Deficiency Usage situations the same as we usually do, which means that 
EESI might end up owing Sysco money for such Usage.? I'll send proposed 
changes on this point.

4.????? In Section 4.6, the language you deleted still needs to apply to 
(b)(iii), unless EESI is willing to agree to continue to be obligated.

I'll follow up with a mark-up later. 

Thanks.

Jim and/or Marianne;
Could you please remind me what type of deals would be done under this type 
of agreement and how such deals would differ from the deals that are done 
under Electric Energy Services and Sales Agreement for Large and Industrial 
Customers?  Thanks.

[I'll see you at approx. 1  p.m. today right?] 

Re the below, contact the credit group to see if they can speedily resolve 
the credit issues so as to bring the EEI to bear on the transansaction, 
clearly the best result.  Credit will also indicate whether the size of the 
trade is such that they want to insist the trade is done under a completed 
EEI Master, rather than being documented the 'old way' and then brought under 
the EEI Master upon its completion.  If the trade will be completed under the 
Tariff, you'll want to look at the Tariff to see what underlying terms you're 
dealing with (e.g., 1 year limit on term of trade completed under the Tariff, 
availability of LDs for a trade involving LD energy, etc.)

If not already known to you, Genia or Elizabeth may have input on where 
things stood in Janice's negotiations with CP&L.

CP&L has marked up a confirm that we sent to them for a deal that was done 
5/8/2001 to make it subject to their 5/18/98 Tariff agreement.  We are in the 
process of negotiating an EEI Master with them but have some outstanding 
credit issues.  How should I respond to their mark-up?  This was one of 
Janice's files.

Hi Smith

If a six week delay in responding doesn't merit a big I'm sorry I don't know 
what does.  My sincere apologizes in not responding sooner.

We have been looking for a power trading lawyer for about a year.  In March 
Mark H. decided that since we couldn't find one outside that he would bring 
in people internally.  Accordingly, back in April we had 3 internal lawyers 
move into the group.  As a result of this shift,  we are not currently 
looking for additional lawyers for power trading, but if things change I'll 
let you know.  Just FYI, there may be openings in other areas (finance, 
asset  development).  If you are interested, let me know and I'll call you 
back.  Also, I know that power trading lawyers in general are in hot demand  
...  other organizations may be hiring.  I will be up in Portland, next 
week.  Maybe we can talk then

Again, my apologizes on the long delay."

		 Subject: Canadian Form of Physical Power Master Agreement

Please find attached for your information/review the final form of the 
Canadian Physical Power Master Agreement to be implemented and used by Enron 
Canada to trade physical power in Canada.  This form has been created using 
the EEI form of master used by Enron North America, the Canadian gas master 
and the British Energy Power Purchase Agreement.  Wherever possible and 
particularly with respect to many of the procedural provisions, such as 
billing, confirming, triggering events and the miscellaneous provisions, I 
have used the language from the current form of Canadian gas master both to 
create consistency between our Canadian gas and power businesses for our 
operations, systems and accounting groups and to hopefully make it easier for 
our commercial people to market the power paper to counterparties, as it will 
be very similar in many respects to our form of gas master with which many 
counterparties will already be familiar.

Regarding the power products tradeable under this master, further to a 
discussion Peter and I had with Jeff Hodge and Christian Yoder, the products 
described in Schedule A have been created based upon an amalgam of the EEI 
products and the WSPP schedules of products.  Given the uncertainty of how 
exactly the two Canadian markets that are set to open in 2001 will look, it 
was determined best to have a minimum of broadly defined products, which will 
be further defined over time as the markets develop, rather than trying to 
introduce a large number of complex products that may end up neither 
applicable nor appropriate and which would only serve to make negotiations of 
the form with counterpartys more difficult.

I would ask each of you to review the form and provide me with any final 
comments you may have at your earliest convenience so that Enron Canada can 
commence marketing the paper to counterparties.  In performing your review, 
please keep in mind that this master is intended to be an agreement that is 
cross-jurisdictional and, therefor, general in scope and nature and will be 
equally applicable to power trades in Alberta as in Ontario (or any other 
province over time).  Any jurisdictional specific provisions will be built 
into the confirms on a trade by trade basis.  Nevertheless, particularly for 
Rob Hemstock and Aleck Dadson, I do want to ensure that we have not included 
any provisions that may cause Enron Canada any concerns in Ontario or Alberta 
based upon our current understanding of how those two regulatory regimes will 
unfold.

Thanks for your assistance on this matter and I look forward to any comments 
you may have on the document.

Greg

I want to sign Eleanor (and maybe Alice too) up for swim lessons at the
Houstonian.  What is the name of the woman that you liked?

Also, I was looking at a day camp for Eleanor.  There are the ""Kidventure""
camps that look pretty good.  They do one at the Houstonian (Kidventure
does), but it is full already for the 3-4 year olds.  Kidventure also holds
a camp at St. Anne's on Westheimer (it appears to not be religiously
affiliated, if that matters).  There are some slots still available for the
3-4 year olds and the 5-13 year olds if you were interested in Ella also.
I thought Eleanor would be more comfortable initially if she knew someone
since it would be a new place.  Are you interested in signing Sam (and
Ella, although they would not be together) up for a week in late July/early
August?  All this stuff is on the Houstonian web cite under the Youth link.

On another note, we enjoyed dinner on Saturday.  As always, the food and
company were great.  I think Phil drank way too much since he was quite
hungover on Sunday, but other than that, no casualties.  Eleanor slept in
until 8 a.m.  a first for her.  I need to get Julie to keep her up later,
although we were still up at 7 with Alice.

I left my comments in your chair.  I think that we need to decide how these 
provisions work with Article 8 of the EEI Master, particularly Sections 
8.1(c), 8.2(c),  and 8.3.  My vote would be to replace the language in the 
EEI master with the provisions that you drafted so that everything is in one 
place.      Let me know what you think.

Marcus,

Peter and Kevin's concern with the language you suggested is that NERC=20
holidays do not coincide with Federal Reserve banking holidays.  Martin=20
Luther King Day, Washington's Day, Columbus Day, and Veteran's Day are all=
=20
Federal banking holidays which are not NERC holidays.  Since they want the=

power to be scheduled the day before delivery, the language defining busine=
ss=20

PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  
Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts 
were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the 
Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were 
described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 
of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 
2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

Thanks for the note - I had alot of fun on Sat. too.  I'll call you later to 
talk about camps - I was kind of thinking of doing a 1/2 day camp at the MET 
but...  The teachers name for swimming at the H is Lauren ... just call the 
regular number and ask for swimming and then leave message for her. She will 
call you back."

Subject: PX credits & Schedule F in the PG&E bankruptcy

PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  
Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts 
were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the 
Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were 
described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 
of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 
2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

Michael

this is the term sheet that was produced by pacificorp for the outage 
protection.  it looks like it was developed with input from aquila and swiss 
re.  swiss re is generally not interested in doing anything in the est now, 
so that could be the reason behind their ridiculous bid of $200m (which is 
still just heresay).

there is some price, eg $100m, at which this risk is manageable through a 
combination of advance hedging and dynamic hedging as their system 
experiences outages.  we have 8 days notice before having to deliver, so the 
weather-related spike risk is not that severe.

we are doing stochastic modeling of the risk now, and we expect the ""fair 
value"" to be less than $50m.

this is a 3-year deal, and one of the benefits is that they may pay the 
premium up front and expense it by year.

this is a complex structure, so let me know if you have questions.

All of you have expressed an interest in having a collateral annex to use 
with the EEI Master Contract.  A small group began working on an annex last 
winter.  Bill McCoy from Morgan Stanley circulated a ""conceptual"" draft which 
was commented on by a few companies.  Due to the intervening California 
market crisis, the group did not undertake further work.  After our credit 
workshop in Atlanta in March, many of you have asked to bring the working 
group together in order to reach closure on the annex.    As a starting, 
point I've attached Bill McCoy's draft and the comments circulated to date.  
I suggest that we develop a strawman from these documents that would serve as 
the basis for a consensus document adopted at a drafting meeting during the 
summer.  Before that meeting we could collaborate via email and conference 
calls.  Reliant has agreed to host a meeting in July which would coincide 
with a meeting  of the EEI contract drafting committee.  No specific date has 
been set, but many in the drafting committee are leaning towards meeting 
after mid-July.     Please use the attached calendar to show dates you would 
be unavailable in July so we can set a date.  Please fax this to Patricia 
Young at 202-508-5673 or email to pyoung@eei.org

So, we are looking for people who are willing to roll up their sleeves and 
get the job done.  We need the following to do this efficiently:  (1) someone 
to chair the group; (2) people willing to draft language; (3) someone to act 
as ""scribe"" to maintain the working draft and incorporate comments; and (4) 
input on what is drafted.  I propose holding a conference call next Friday to 
select a chair, set a schedule, and make assignments.  Please let me know 
your thoughts on this process.

Just a few comments on the basis of this week's discussion.

1.  Use concept of amounts owed and accrued, but not yet payable

2.  Include deemed designations

3.  Do we want to include concepts of (a) amounts in any currency (or is this 
implied) or (b) amounts in respect of any booking or payment office?

Subject: QSE Liability Query

Jean -- Could you please determine how (if at all) the Protocols will treat 
these specific circumstances:   When a QSE becomes unable to pay its 
obligations to the  ERCOT ISO, does the ERCOT ISO have any ability (or is 
there any guidance anywhere on whether it will have any ability) to impose 
liability on the remaining functioning QSEs to cover dollar liabilities of 
the defaulting QSE not satisfied by the defaulting QSE's credit support?  
Mike Curry said a while ago that he understood the the new CFO in ERCOT to be 
gearing up to address/resolve this issue.  For purposes of the QSE agreements 
Enron Power Marketing, Inc. is trying to complete  with customers, we are 
seeking as much information on this as possible, when and as available.  I 
understand that in California the ISO sought to impose such liabilities on 
the remaining healthy scheduling entities, which authority remains in 
dispute.  Please call Mike or me to discuss if the substance of this query if 
not clear.

Janet, sorry I was unable to return your call today, but I was tied up most
of the day in meetings, one of which was with Powerex.  Though it dealt with
other matters I did have a chance to briefly discuss this matter with
Powerex and I am advised that the issue of the credit annex may be or become
academic.  The original $340,000,000 has been reduced to $240,000,000 and is
to be further reduced as a result of pricing changes.  In addition, Enron is
apparently providing a new or increased letter of credit, which will be
sufficient to cover the reduced liability.  As a result it is expected that
the necessity for the cash deposit will disappear next week, perhaps as
early as Tuesday.  If this proves to be the case, the credit annex will not
be required, thereby making life easier for both of us.  If the foregoing
result does not occur as early in the week as contemplated or if it becomes
necessary for your cash management purposes, Powerex has no objection to
signing a letter extending the interim letter agreement for, say, another 2
weeks (if it becomes apparent that the cash deposit will still be required
after that time we will have to revisit the drafting of the credit annex).

Elizabeth - Since Rogers Herndon has moved on to work on a special project 
for EES and Janice Moore has left, I wanted to revitalize our efforts on 
getting the necessary authority documents that we have discussed so many 
times in the past.  Since our trading volume seems to be picking up, I wanted 
to make sure that an atty is assigned the project.  

Please let me know who that person will be so that I can follow up.

Elizabeth,

Who will be taking over Janice's negotiations with VEPCO?  Their attorney, 
Shelley, called and wanted the new Enron attorney to give her a call.  Her 
number is 804-273-4149.  I apologize that I received this call this morning, 
but am not getting to you until now.

Hi Peter

Pacific Gas and Electric paid us for gas purchases on May 25 for April

1. Pre Bankruptcy invoice for April 1-12 deliveries.

 It appears that they paid 53.787% of the pre bankruptcy invoice.


2. Pre Bankruptcy invoices for April 1-12 deliveries

  4120SA   2,033,749.68 CDN
  4138SA   2,797,179.00 CDN
     ------------------
  Subtotal  4,830,928.68 CDN

 Post Bankruptcy invoices for Apr 13-30 deliveries

  4139SA   3,425,804.71 CDN


 Total all sales for April production

     8,256,733.39 CDN

  Payment Rec'd  6,024,238.66 CDN


 It appears that they paid 53.787% of the pre bankruptcy invoice.


Please let me know what you want me to do with the excess payment.
Thanks

Can you met with Ella's school sometime mid morning on either Wed or Thurs 
next week.

On Colorado, we currently are scheduled to return on Wed the 22nd.  On this 
schedule we would miss parent orientation (Tues) and the kids would miss the 
first day of school which is a half day (Wed). Reschedule?"

I will look into this - Part of the problem is also that I don't have an 
assistant (Brenda left a few weeks ago and my new assistant (Alice)( HOORAY 
), doesn't start until June 1st) who can approve or knows anything about

EEI has been participating in discussion with FASB concerning the application 
of SFAS 133 and 138 to utility power purchase agreements where power is 
obtained to serve load obligations, as opposed to power marketing.  EEI's 
position is that such contracts should be treated under the  normal purchase 
and normal sale contracts exception under SFAS 138, for which derivatives 
accounting treatment would not apply.   Occaisonally a utility may agree to 
bookout certain transactions.  EEI's position is that a bookout is not a net 
settlement of the underlying purchase and sale contract because every party 
must fulfill each and every contractual transaction.  EEI also has maintains 
that even if there is a bookout title passes under the terms of the 
underlying contract.  See attached letter to FASB.

FASB has asked for additional information on the bookout issue.  In 
particular, it wants more information on the passing of title between 
entities in a bookout chain; what are the legal requirements for title to 
pass to another entity in a bookout chain?

FASB also wants to know whether under bookouts are cash payments always 
settled gross with each company paying the total contract price for the 
purchase involved and receiving the total contract price for its sale or are 
there exceptions in normal practice?  I assume settlment in gross does not 
occur in the case of a buyer and seller in the chain whose underlying 
contract(s) provide for payment and/or transaction netting.

The close of the comment period is on Friday, so we are trying to get a 
letter back to FASB asap.   I would appreciate it if anyone in our group 
could comment on the questions FASB asks and/or the letter we previously sent 
to FASB.  Thanks in advance.

Elizabeth,

Following my e-mail of last week sending you a version of a new Dutch law 
governed pro forma Physical Power Master, I have since made some minor 
changes to that version to deal with typos, etc.  I now attach the final 
Dutch law version below, plus an English law version of that document.

Kind regards

Mark

Hi Peter

Pacific Gas and Electric paid us for gas purchases on May 25 for April 
production.
They paid amounts larger than the post bankruptcy invoice totals. 


Here are the details:

1. Pre Bankruptcy invoice for April 1-12 deliveries.

  4136SA   852,780.50 US

  Payment Rec'd  458,687.37 US

 It appears that they paid 53.787% of the pre bankruptcy invoice.


2. Pre Bankruptcy invoices for April 1-12 deliveries

  4120SA   2,033,749.68 CDN
  4138SA   2,797,179.00 CDN
     ------------------
  Subtotal  4,830,928.68 CDN

 Post Bankruptcy invoices for Apr 13-30 deliveries

  4139SA   3,425,804.71 CDN


 Total all sales for April production

     8,256,733.39 CDN

  Payment Rec'd  6,024,238.66 CDN


 It appears that they paid 53.787% of the pre bankruptcy invoice.


Please let me know what you want me to do with the excess payment.
Thanks
Cheryl

Thank you for you birthday call.  I appreciate your calls, even if we don't
get a chance to speak directly.

I was just wondering, do you have copies or negatives of the pictures that
were taken of us with Mom at Bob's house?  I think it was Thanksgiving.  I
would like to see them, maybe get some enlargements.  My friend Austin took
some, but I am afraid he may have lost them--I asked him recently in part
of an e-mail, and he did not answer the question.

Any plans for a visit when we could maybe get to the beach?"

POWER SALES AND TOLLING ARRANGEMENTS
IN TODAY'S MARKET

On Tuesday, June 5, 2001, Baker Botts will be presenting an internal legal
training seminar entitled ""Power Sales and Tolling Arrangements in Today's
Market"" in the main conference room on the 13th floor of our Washington
office, 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue (The Warner).  Bob Bohme, of our Washington
office, will be the speaker for the program.  He will address a number of
drafting and negotiation problems commonly encountered in power sales and
tolling agreements.  Although the program is geared toward lawyers, it may
also be of interest to non-lawyers involved in these negotiations.

$ 30.00 flat fee and then anywhere from $10- $15 an hour after that.

Greg and Peter

Pamela Hickerson called and wanted to know if I would be interested in 
speaking in Calgary in Oct. at seminar her organization is hosting. Greg I 
think you may already be speaking. Is that right?  Would this be a good 
opportunity?  She wants me to speak about US power trading contracts and 
on-line trading.   Any thoughts if this is worthwhile?  Thanks for you input."

I did not know that Greg was speaking to her.  He is out till next week and I 
will follow-up at that time.  I did receive a voice message from her some 
time back regarding the same thing, althoug I do not remember the topics 
being trading contracts or e-trading. In any event, after considering the 
time and effort involved (noting Insight usually requires some form of paper 
to be prepared), any potential value, the commercial requirement for our 
resources, and after discussing it with Milnthorp, I decided not to get 
involved.  If we think it is worthwhile I am open to persuausion.  Regards, 
Peter."

Aha!  Craig Johnstone (rather than Greg Johnston), who is a rather 
ineffectual sort from a local firm Thackray Burgess and who used to do some 
Masters and confirms for us a few years back on a seconded (or more 
accurately an Enron funded sabbatical) basis in the Mary Lee Hopkins days. 
(Lavo knows him well.  In fact Lavo once instructed me to keep hiring lawyers 
until Craig Johnstone ceased showing up here.)  Our Greg is constantly 
getting confused with him, which I really quite enjoy.  Regards, Peter."

Elizabeth,
Below is the one comment from Pacificorp on the CA that I had marked up.  I 
am attaching the markup I had sent to Pacificorp.  Prior to sending execution 
copies I thought you might want to look at it in light of the fact that the 
contingent call option portion of the proposed transactions would likely be a 
physical deal with EPMI.  I am taking the next two days off but will be back 
on Monday.

Glad to help.
Only need one change; I don't have Brent's e-mail address, but  I'll trust 
Sanjeev to forward this:
 
In Section 2, where it says:
""at the time of disclosure or is thereafter  acquired from a source other 
than the Disclosing Party that was not known  to""
add a comma between ""acquired"" and  ""from"".

After a spell of private medical crisis which had the effect of distorting my 
professional schedule, I am, for better or worse, back in the professional 
saddle.  My private life remains, as always, full of much upheaval, creative 
energy and manic playfulness.  My beloved Dona Lisa is going to be fine. The 
trip to St. Louis was not meant to be.  Jan got everything cancelled without 
any loss of money to Enron shareholders.  I am back in the trenches trying to 
get the PacifiCorp EEI done so Harlan can have the pleasure of working 
through the big mother of all call options on JUNE 1, your big kickoff date 
for living happily ever after.  Hope everything went well with Steve down 
there.  I'm looking forward to assessing his reactions to the big E in 
Houston. ----cgy"

What many of you have probably sensed was going to happen has now officially 
been confirmed: As of June 11,  Steve Hall will be changing his status from  
full time Enron-dedicated outside counsel to  full time Enron employee , 
reporting to Elizabeth Sager in Houston. 

 Coming as it does, at a time when trading legal expertise is much in demand 
in the market, this is a very positive event.  Our team will no doubt 
continue to benefit from Steve's significant contributions.  ---cgy"

tolling deal with Allegheny Energy Supply  relating to the

Ajit--regarding the pending rate reduction petition that has been filed at 
the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) by the Office of the Consumer Advocate (OCA) 
against Mid American.  We've been looking at the prudence of intervening and 
being active in the case, based on your suggestion that if the rate reduction 
of $77 million as requested were granted, we might benefit to the tune of 
about $1.2 million on the current customers that we have behind Mid Am.

We are looking at a number of issues,  including the probability of success, 
the prudence of us being on the witness stand if we provide testimony,  the 
effect of the proposed rate design if a reduction is granted, going back to 
the last case to see how much the OCA really won,etc.   The first testimony 
will be filed in  mid June, and we should have a better idea then of what the 
case is really going to look like. 

One threshold question is whether there is any language  in our  contracts 
for the customers  that prohibits us from representing their/our interests at 
the IUB.  I am thinking that there probably is not, but want to make sure.  
COuld you please forward to me and Harry a copy of each customers contract to 
review?  

Vicki/Elizabeth--wasn't sure who these contracts would fall under,  so Jim 
suggested I send to you as well."

For purposes of going forward, attached are the various drafts relating to 
ERCOT product changes we have been discussing:

1.  Re 11:00 am scheduling deadline.   This effort was sidelined because (i) 
it would fix the problem that surfaced with TXU, and (ii) in most instances I 
understand us to prefer the presence of the 11:00 am deadline to cuase the 
sheduling to be wrapped up under potential threat of LDs. 
  

2.  EOL financially firm UB product.  Doug, I believe you want to explore if 
the reference to the B product can be eliminated altogether.



3.  ERCOT wide and Zonal EOL products.  Questions clearly present are: (1) 
uncertain duration of the zones, and what should happen to the commitments of 
the parties when newly defined zones replace the old. The marketplace can't 
even be assured of zonal changeovers each October.  (Buyer serving load is 
most at risk)  (2)  uncertainty over whether the B product classification 
will persist, and what the Opertating guides will say about it or a 
subsequent Firm (LD) product, (3) whether delivery can only take place inside 
a zone, rather than at its border.   Doug you said you were considering 
rolling out an ERCOT wide product and then afterwards offering North and 
South Zones, followed by West Zone if there's market interest. 

 

Please come back to me with any thoughts you have on these draft efforts.

Hi folks.  Marcus Wood recently contacted my about billing matters, and told 
me that Trading has double paid two bills - one in the amount of $9,305.50 
for ""ENA, West Desk Trading"", and in the amount of $52,674.90 for ""ENA, 
California Power Matters"" (perhaps this one is actually Sanders related??).  
Could one of you please contact Marcus and let him know if you want the 
amounts refunded or applied to any particular unpaid matters?  Thanks."

Paul Jaboulet Parallele 45 C""tes du Rh""ne 750 ml.

[IMAGE]


This fifth-generation producer specializes in Rh""ne Valley wines from their 
ideally-situated, carefully tended vineyards. This blend of Syrah and 
Grenache has an intense, complex nose, with aromas of ripe red fruit

its tannic structure and strength are harmonious and remarkable. Long, fruity 
finish.

1999 Frei Brothers Reserve Sonoma County Merlot 750 ml.

[IMAGE]


The grapes for this wine were de-stemmed, but not crushed, to retain a 
substantial proportion of whole berries for fermentation.  This technique 
minimizes bitter tannin extraction in the wine. The wine was 100% barrel aged 
in a mixture of new and prior use French, European, and American oak for 
approximately a year. 


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $12.59
Sale Price: $13.25













Marcelina Vineyards, 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon, Napa Valley 750 ml.

Concentrated blackberry, black cherry and cassis fruit flavors framed by 
smoked bacon, tobacco, cedar notes, and coconut characteristics. Full-bodied 
with a velvety, silky texture and a lingering finish. 


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $19.99
Sale Price: $21.04













Gallo of Sonoma Barrelli Creek Vineyard Zinfandel 750 ml.

[IMAGE]


Our family's Barrelli Creek Vineyard is located in the temperate, Region III 
hillsides of Sonoma County's Alexander Valley; on a site first planted by 
Italian immigrants over a century ago. The low vigor of this vineyard's 
gravelly clay loam soils, in combination with its micro-climate and optimal 
viticultural practices, yield intensely concentrated Zinfandel and Petite 
Sirah grapes loaded with the zesty aromas and flavors of black cherries, 
boysenberry jam, and black pepper.


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $12.82
Sale Price: $13.49













Jim Beam Bourbon 80o 1.75L

[IMAGE]


A bourbon of great finesse and subtle nuance, neither light nor heavy, but 
rather a mellow ""baritone"" of a spirit. It is distinctive not because it is 
different, but because it is perfect. 


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $19.99
Sale Price: $21.04













Belvedere Vodka 80o750ml.

Edna Valley Chardonnay 750 ml.

[IMAGE]


Located just south of San Luis Obispo on California's Central Coast, Edna 
Valley is ideally situated for the production of premium Chardonnay and Pinot 
Noir. Their Chardonnay is full-bodied with smoky aromas of vanilla, oak and 
spice. The mouthfeel is soft and lush, but at the same time intense, with 
ripe flavors of white peach, apple and tropical fruits. A subtle mineral 
component complements the higher acid level, lending structure, balance, and 
complexity.

Lindemans Shiraz/Cabernet, Cawarra 1.5L.

[IMAGE]


Dr. Henry Lindeman planted his first grape vines in 1843 along the Paterson 
River in New South Wales, Australia. His homestead, Cawarra, is named after 
the aboriginal term for ""beside running water,"" and Cawarra Claret was the 
first wine he exported. Today, the Cawarra line commemorates these first 
wines. The Shiraz/Cabernet is easy drinking and approachable with generous 
varietal fruit flavors and aromatic oak in the background.

Elizabeth -- I think this is one that your group would need to initial for 
Bill.  Does it need to be executed by an officer?  If so, Kevin could 
probably sign it.  Thanks.

DD139381.DTL&type=news>
THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha does 
not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it, 
maybe, had he not been saying the other things. 
Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They 
can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and 
yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths. 
Take Enron, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El 
Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the 
minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. 
Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and 
meekly hand over tribute. 
And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that 
their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the 
nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth. 
We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have 
trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping 
gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand 
that energy companies could create ""shortages"" whenever they wanted merely by 
closing plants for ""maintenance""? You bet we did. And did we confuse the 
energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to 
repeal the laws of nature? We did not. 
But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have 
busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is 
everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying 
bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit 
of volunteerism is much praised. 
Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but 
don't. 
AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we 
forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that 
credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using 
energy we didn't need. 
I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the 
river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing 
machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task 
at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but 
never used. 
We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains 
in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You 
wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes he 
can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has. 
Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social 
Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money, we 
kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it! 
Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional 
compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals 
under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get 
away with it! You watch! 
I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active 
villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a 
corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any 
extra money. 
We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We 
send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind, but now we 
see. And we await developments, or create them. 

It would be foolish to mention SUVs. When the brain is ready, the ear will 
hear.
