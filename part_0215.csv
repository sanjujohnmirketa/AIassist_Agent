Gary is going to provide me with a list of OTC products for priority 
trading.  He has been in discussions with tax and structuring in Houston for 
the S. Cone.  The group has considered (i) trading onshore, (ii) trading as a 
sub of Elektro (and can this be a sub of an offshore entity?) and (iii) 
trading offshore.  They have studied the CC5 account requirements and have 
had conversations wtih JP Morgan and BofA.  There appears to be little 
communication with anyone in Brazil and Joe Kishkill is going to Sao Paulo 
next week.  I'll be more specific in a day or so.  I'm still having problems 
tying into the database (this is ridiculous!).  Did you receive my voice 
mail?  SS

Sara,

I will be in the London office next week.  Do you have some time where we 
could get together to flesh out the issues that are still on the table and 
will need to be talked about while I am over there?  Let me know when you are 
available.  Thanks."

Mahesh:

I have a question that needs to be answered on Wednesday morning:

 What company actually employs John Greene?

I am now being told by Instinet that the company employing the trader must 
sign a new confidentiality agreement for the UK terminal (for trading by ECT 
Investments, Inc. through its arranger Enron Investment Services Limited).  
Please advise by email or voice mail

Thanks  Sara

Apologies - I have been out of the office for the past 10 days.

I had asked Cindy in legal to provide you with signature blocks when you 
first asked for it - I will chase her again today.
I will call you this afternoon to discuss the status of the agency agreement 
and any other requirement that you may have - let me know when you are 
available.

Per my email yesterday, we need new credit and a new person assigned.  

I think Rod will handle credit when we dupe the ENA master for 
EnronCredit.com.

Please let me know who will handle.  There are some issues that credit and 
legal can determine before we resend a first draft.

Andy:

In the spirit of ""full disclosure"", I thought I would let you know what ENA 
has agreed to on the ISDA side with various Merrill entities.
ENA has ISDA's with Merrill Lynch International Bank (8/25/95), Merrill Lynch 
Capital Services Inc. (12/2/92) and Merrill Lynch International (8/25/95).
There is no arbitration provision in any of these agreements; there is merely 
silence as to jurisdiction (ENA began negotiating arbitration around 1997).  
All of these agreements contain our standard limitation of liability language 
(in boldface) and all permit some type of assignment to an affiliate (in 
general, without negative tax impact or with sufficient credit support).  All 
of the agreements provide for setoff (including affiliates of non-defaulting 
parties) and all contain confidentiality provisions.

I would therefore propose the following changes to Annex I:

change the margin deadline time to 10:00 a.m. (NY time)
delete Par 9(b) - and you can send your additional no custody required 
language
delete the arbitration provision in its entirety

I hope that you can resond to the remaining issues tomorrow morning so that 
we can finalize docs by the afternoon.  Thanks for your assistance.

Sara

Sara:

Thanks for the additional information and the recommended changes, each of
which we accept.

In order to accommodate the deletion of 9(b), we recommend revising your
number 6 to read as follows:

6. Substitution

 (a) Paragraph 9(b) is hereby deleted in its entirety.

 (b) Seller shall not retain custody of any Purchased Securities
under any Transaction governed by this Agreement.

NOTICES:  Your suggested language regarding notices is potentially
problematic.  Under the Paragraph 13 of the MRA, notices may made orally,
""to be confirmed promptly in writing...."", and confirmation of delivery is
not expressly relevant.  The unquestionable ability to make oral margin
calls pursuant to Paragraph 4 is vital in fast-moving market conditions, and
was expressly included in the standard agreement to avoid any doubt as to
their validity.  In the default context (Paragraph 11), proof of delivery of
written notice is of no concern because the exercise of a party's rights
under that Paragraph is not contingent upon delivery of notice.  Notice must
be given ""as promptly as practicable.""  We believe that the proposed
language could cause confusion or uncertainty regarding the validity of oral
margin calls and would conflict with the operative provisions of Paragraph
11.  We therefore request deletion of your number 8.

NON-ASSIGNABILITY:  As we discussed earlier today, we have a general
aversion to assignments of repurchase transactions due to our regulatory
obligations as a broker-dealers.  For that reason, we must be free to
withhold consent to assignment with confidence that such withholding will
not be challenged as ""unreasonable.""  We therefore request deletion of your
number 9.

We are still reviewing your proposals regarding SETOFF and LIMITED
LIABILITY.  I will also have to review Section 5-1401 of the NYGOL before
commenting on that.

I look forward to the prompt completion of our negotiations.  Thanks again
for the information and recommendations.

Andy Waskow

OK, this is hot off the press.  
Tanya:  our Performance Impairment language limited the collateral call to 
1.1 times outstanding exposure.  The collateral was defined only as Letters 
of Credit and the issuing bank was at least A- S&P rated.  As to the 
Threshold, well, you can read the response.
Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Sara,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  Internally we have been
discussing the main hurdle issues which you and I discussed in our last
telephone conversation.

The results are as follows:
Harvard will not agree to change its Additional Termination Event in favor
of your Performance Impairment clause.  We find this to be too uncertain and
are more comfortable with the certainty of the ratings as set out in our
Additional Termination Event clause.
Harvard believes that it can get comfortable with the idea of Letters of
Credit, however, they must come from a middle single A or better
counterparty and we would like to know who you intend to provide such LOCs
from at the time of contract negotiation.  Harvard will not provide letters
of credit as collateral but rather US Treasuries.
Harvard cannot accept or give cash as collateral.
Harvard is willing to raise the threshold for a BBB+ from $0 to $500,000,
but cannot agree to the increase of $10,000,000 which you have requested.
Harvard cannot agree to Minimum Transfer Amounts of $1 and requires the
threshold and minimum transfer amount table as set out in our CSA to remain
in tact.
Harvard will accept a guarantee from Enron Corp., however, it must be
Harvard's standard with no changes.

Please advise where this leaves us.  I will await your response prior to
addressing issues raised in your facsimile dated 7/20/99.

Regards,
Jo-Ann Bigwood
Harvard Management Company, Inc.

I am reviewing your comments and will have an answer shortly.  I thought, 
however, that you should know that the limitation of liability provision is

Hi Sara

We are Enron Trading Services Inc. (FCM) in New York. We came along with the 
MG purchase and report through London. 

We handle clear/broker US Futures and act as an IB for Enron Metals Ltd. Our 
client base is the Americas with an overlap to Houston. 

We would like for funds and commercial clients to have one Swap document 
including several commodities and Enron units. For example we understand from 
Per that you are working a document for Catequil that should include metal.

Justin

 Could you advise

Thanks
Craig Young

Visit their website at: www.vintageestate.com

Monday, November 20, I have scheduled the following appointments:

Beginning at 4 pm:

Deb - facial, then massage

Sara- massage, then facial

Steve- massage, then !!!!!!!!!!!!

Villagio does not have reflexology.  I didn't know if Steve wanted a facial 
(but if he does, there is no one to do the facial at 5!)
Seriously, check their website for other services for Steve (and you).  I was 
only trying to time all of our services together, but that may not be 
entirely necessary.
I don't know what time dinner is on Monday but I'm assuming it is late enough 
to allow us to change clothes and shower (and wash hair if we feel like it).  
The spa has lot's of availability earler in the day and on Sunday.  So we can 
make changes.  This is particularly important since all changes must be made 
within 24 hours of the service or it gets charged to my credit card.  And I 
really hate unnecessary charges.

On a slightly different note, I am compiling places I'd like to visit since 
we have no itinerary.  Then we can have a tribal meeting to vote.  Big Tiger 
Feather has changed his plans to stay until Tuesday so we'll have two cars.

Bye now!  Love, Sas (the future Miss America over FFFFFFFFFFFFF)"

Sara,

The desk has transacted two five year swaptions.  Do you recall where we were 
on the ISDA?  Negotiations had cooled significantly in light of the 
structured Skeena deal dying; however, now may be a good tome to resurrect.  
I have made the ISDA a condition precedent to exercise of the swaption.  I 
seem to recall the open issue was the definitions for the financial covenants 
of the MAC clause (cross border lease, etc.). I seem to recall that they 
didn't provide us with some of the definitions within the definitions.  I 
will pull my file to see if I can determine where we are.  Please let me know 
what your file indicates.

Thanks."

was recommended by our Calgary office.  Kevin refined the prior information 
and will ""pre-clear"" Paul with authorities for Paul's trip entering through 
Calgary around 8/24/99.  Do you have any comments to the new attachment?  SS

Susan:  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  We have agreed to delete 
the CSA and will return a blackline to you shortly.  You may recall that SITA 
expressly requested that the Enron agreement be governed by English law which 
is why we prepared this document for execution by our affiliate in London 
with the jurisdiction language appearing in the prior draft.  There are still 
issues posed by your markup and we should be able to schedule a conference 
call next week.  Thanks.  Sara

1 - Credit Support Annex :

SITA's position is unchanged. SITA does not wish to have a Credit Support 
Annex.  SITA have asked that ENRON come up with a proposal on the term and 
volume of the transactions on the basis of no Credit Support Annex.

2 - SITA does not provide investment services ancillary to its main

Christian, these guys have their act pretty well together.  I spoke with Burt 
Dunn (his boss was also listening over Burt's shoulder and helping to confirm 
information).

Recently their Board approved a ""general plan"" of the transaction 
contemplated.   They did not do formal Board action in the form of a specific 
resolution, but I think the general approval will likely prove to be 
sufficient.

Here is what they are sending me:

1.  a copy of the ""general plan"" so that we can confirm just what the Board 
saw and what, if anything, might be seriously missing.

2.  a letter confirming the Board vote approving the ""general plan.""

3.  a copy of the resolution adopted by the Board several years ago exempting 
power purchase contracts from public bidding requirements.

4.  material from their Risk Management manual detailing the approval and 
individual authority to enter into provisions with regard to specific types 
of power contracts.

I asked Burt to fax these.  It may take a little while to pull it all 
together, but I expect to see it no later than early tomorrow morning.

Let me know if there is anything else on EWEB.

I just left a voicemail for Tom Grim re: Clatskanie.  I will continue to 
follow-up call him until I get a specific answer to your questions.  I 
acknowledge your 3 this afternoon deadline.

More when its available

revise the confirm and the Lehman trader (Paul Rosica) was going to ""clean

Is Mark Taylor aware of Gary's plans?  I know from my conversations with Mark 
about support for trading in South America that very few people in Enron, 
other than Don and a few commercial guys in Brazil, believe that there will 
be any action to speak of on the trading side in South America.  If Gary does 
anything other than trade from ECT on exchange or through swaps that he will 
have to take into consideration who will provide legal and administrative 
support and from where.

Andrea has not confirmed any meetings with me yet.  But I would not wait too 
long to make the reservations.

Gary is going to provide me with a list of OTC products for priority 
trading.  He has been in discussions with tax and structuring in Houston for 
the S. Cone.  The group has considered (i) trading onshore, (ii) trading as a 
sub of Elektro (and can this be a sub of an offshore entity?) and (iii) 
trading offshore.  They have studied the CC5 account requirements and have 
had conversations wtih JP Morgan and BofA.  There appears to be little 
communication with anyone in Brazil and Joe Kishkill is going to Sao Paulo 
next week.  I'll be more specific in a day or so.  I'm still having problems

Russell:

I spoke briefly with Paul about your long-dated commodity deal and have a few 
comments.

(1)  Have you spoken with anyone on the confirmation desk about preparing a 
draft confirm?  Joe Hunter (X33316) is a good start.

(2)  Paul advises that you will be transacting pursuant to the existing ISDA 
Master Agreement between ENA and CSFB Int'l (name change from Credit Suisse 
Financial Products).  In that regard, you should be sure to add the following 
items to the confirmation and discuss with your counterparty:

 (a)  ENA should be the Calculation Agent for purposes of this transaction.

 (b)  You should provide for ""Payments on Early Termination"" as:  ""For the 
purpose of Section 6(e) of the ISDA Master Agreement,  (i)  Loss will apply, 
and (ii) the Second Method will apply.""

Also, you should obtain evidence of the name change (usually a certificate of 
name change).

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara"

Steve:  80 minute wellness massage

Steve:  the spa didn't have anyone to do a facial after 2 pm so I thought 
you'd like a longer massage.  There are facial appointments available Sunday 
morning and afternoon.  You may want to check the website and change the 
service.  You can have my facial appointment if you like (it's at 4 P.M.) and 
I'll take yours.  

Let me know if you'd like for me to make changes.

Otherwise, see you in wineland.  Sara"

Sara,

An Interest Rate swap was entered into with the above counterparty in October 
1997.  This was part of a large structured Coal deal.  (Coal Capital Co.?)  I 
believe the confirm was created in Legal.   Is it possible for me to get a 
copy of this confirmation?  We are having a real problem getting this 
settlement booked each month, so we want to refer to confirm to see what is 
said.  I am out next week, but could you ask someone to send a copy to Todd 
Warwick?  he is in ENA reporting and is helping me out with this.  Thanks. "

Susan:? Sorry for the delay in getting back to  you.? We have agreed to
delete the CSA and will return a blackline to  you shortly.? You may recall
that SITA expressly requested that theE nron agreement be governed by
English law which is why we prepared thisd ocument for execution by our
affiliate in London with the jurisdictionl anguage appearing in the prior
draft.? There are still issues posed by  your markup and we should be able
to schedule a conference call next  week.? Thanks.?  Sara

Further  to my fax of 3 October we have SITA's instructions.

1 - Credit Support  Annex :

SITA's position is unchanged. SITA does not wish to have a Credit  Support
Annex.? SITA have asked that ENRON come up with a proposal on  the term and
volume of the transactions on the basis of no Credit Support  Annex.

2 - SITA does not provide investment services ancillary to its  main
activities. Do you have any news regarding ENRON on this  point?

Kind regards
Susan  Hopkinson

Per my last e-mail on the Papeis Inapa deal, herewith for your complete 
information a copy of the final form of Deemed ISDA Confirmation very 
helpfully drwan up by Edmund Cooper in London to document the trade between 
EEFT (for ECTRIC) and Papeis Inapa.

May be when you get a few minutes, we can have a chat just to confirm the 
Enron entities involved in paper deals in Europe as there appear to be 
certain people in London who are a little confused on this issue.

Kind regards

Hey, guys:  I'm negotiating a rush ISDA for ECTRIC under the law of England 
and Wales.  I believe that Michael drafted originally.

(1)  submission to English courts and waiver of all objections

(2)  setoff  for all events (excluding affiliates) except for Tax Event or 
Tax Event Upon Merger

Are the foregoing acceptable for ECTRIC?

Your immediate response is appreciated as Michael Moulton wants to book deal 
Tuesday,  Nov. 7.


Thanks.  Sara"

Jane:

If you have time in the morning (Nov. 9 Tokyo), I would like to discuss ENA's 
view of the CSA/Schedule relationship.  In a nutshell, we provide that a 
ratings downgrade is an Additional Event of Default in the Schedule (normally 
a MAC in the CSA).  John's preferance, of course, would be a unilateral event 
triggering an IBJ default (which I am sure would be difficult to negotiate).

I am not certain of the time difference but perhaps you could call me at the 
office after 4 pm (Nov.8 in Houston) and I could then conference in John.  
Alternatively, please feel free to contact me at home (after 7 pm Houston 
time on Nov. 8) at 713-664-3207.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara

		 Subject: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT - 1. Credit matrix and 2. Threshold 
amount 

Dear John,

Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to 
the end.  They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly 
their back / mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in 
place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course.  They 
acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards 
CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank.  They did 
say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do 
so. Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are 
set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask 
them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now.

We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime, if you 
are still willing to do so.  The bank has a credit rating of A, so I guess 
this means US$15 million credit limit.  

On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract 
without a full CSA, I wonder who is best to do this drafting.  I should be 
able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the 
drafting .... Alan, do you have any suggestions?     

Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the 
""Threshold Amount"" definition to US$10 million.  Is there any flexibility on 
this?

Thanks.

Jane McBride

		 Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT

Jonathan,

One thing we might be able to propose is a ""Credit Matrix"" which prescribes a 
Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact - with collateral 
rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each 
counterparty.  We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and 
they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change (MAC) 
clauses.  This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot 
automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs.  We 
are comfortable because as the counterparty's credit quality deteriorates, 
the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases.  I would propose to 
IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA.  Jane and John - is 
it possible to draft these collateral/credit terms into the contract without 
using a full CSA?  (I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a 
CSA).

Rating (S&P)     Credit Line
AA or above    $20MM
BBB+ to AA-    $15MM
BBB     $10MM
BBB-     $7MM
BB- to BB+    $5MM
Below BB-    $1MM

These terms are subject to negotiation.  Once again, the matrix removes MAC 
clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such, but effectively 
reduces the potential exposure we have (or THEY have) to a counterparty with 
diminishing credit quality.

What do you all think?

John

with them again to try and explore why, but I would like to be prepared to 
offer them a solution whereby we don't enter into a CSA, and we would limit 
the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ. My feeling is that we 
would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions (over 2 years) at 
this stage anyway, and would prefer to get the relationship going, as I am 
not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet. They appear to be quite 
willing to discuss all the other points. We can always press for a 
renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals. 
I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate.

What are your thoughts on this, and what limitations would you want to put on 
trades if we do not have a CSA?

Thanks,
Jonathan

John-

During our last meeting with IBJ, we pushed hard for the implementation of 
the CSA.  I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the 
requisite activities relating to the CSA, as we understand that they utilize 
same with certain financial institution counterparties.  We expressed our 
view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in 
our recent conference call.  

IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a non-financial 
institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the 
first.  We requested that they raise this issue with their respective 
superiors.  As you know, their response to our discussions relating to this 
issue was ""In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral 
operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA.""  The legitimacy of this 
statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be 
something entirely different, including the possibility that they merely do 
not want to enter into a CSA with a non-financial institution.  

We will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the CSA with Enron, 
however it is uncertain if this is achievable.

Yes.  I thought you understood as much from our meeting.  I have asked A&K 
repeatedly to add you to the email list.  Also, it was my understanding from 
Mark Taylor that you would be responsible for the ""structured"" equity 
derivatives (with assistance from the swap group as needed).  Please let me

Received a call from Perez lawyer, Javier Casal, saying that they have been 
occupying most of their time in another priority Project and this is why they 
are delayed with their answer on the MSA proposal. He said that they have 
scheduled an internal meeting for next Monday, Aug. 9 to tackle this MSA with 
Enron Corp. and they will contact us asap with their comments.

I told Perez that it was not worth while to delay it further than one more 
month. Casal answered that he took resposability for taking care of this 
matter.

keep you posted.

Hey, Lawyer Daigle:

On November 17, I'll be exercising my wheelchair along the winding roads of 
Napa and Sonoma Valleys.  However, would you two kids be interested in the 
more popular seminar at Galatoires on Dec. 8, entitled ""Dot.com for Seniors"", 
3 hours CLE credit requested?  Please let me know as soon as possible so that 
I can request my cheap senior fare on Southwest Airlines, a reduced rate 
rental car and other freebies afforded through the AARP.  Sara

RMT will be the party transacting directly with international Enron

ENA will be the financial party transacting directly with third parties.  
Does ENA also act directly with non-affiliated Japanese customers (if the

Not really.  I usually ask to be conferenced in when the swap is discussed, 
give my comments to Danny Sullivan only (if A&K is outside counsel) or listen 
to as much as I need to.  It's really your call.  SS

I can.  Do we listen to these even when the topic is not directly swap 
related?

Sorry, a fairly basic question.

Background:

We have two legal entities here in Japan, Enron Japan Corp. (""EJC"") and Enron 
Japan Marketing Corp. (""EJMC"").  EJMC is used just for physical trades for 
reasons of US tax.

The draft ISDA schedule we are working on lists EJC as the Enron trading 
entity.  I am still checking how the lumber, oil and pulp trades will be 
settled but even if they are all to be settled physically, at some stage we 
may want to do financially settled trades with IBJ in which case EJC will be 
the relevant entity.

Question:

If we will be using two Enron trading entities, do we need two ISDAs with the 
counterparty?

Thanks.

Jane,

All trades settled physically should go into Enron Japan Marketing Corp.  
What kinds of pulp, oil or lumber trades are we looking at?  Information on 
this would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
Susan

Dear Susan,

If we were to do any pulp or oil or lumber physical trading in Japan, should 
this be done by Enron Japan Corp. or Enron Japan Marketing Corp.  I am not 
clear on whether it is only electricity or all physical trading which needs 
to go through EJMC.

Thanks.

Dear Paul,

I have just found out that we will be doing back to back trades for other 
Enron companies with IBJ.  IBJ has already been talking with UK and US Enron 
entities re pulp, lumber and oil trading but wants to have its ISDA with a 
Japanese Enron company so we are negotiating it.

What information do I need to give you so that you can check whether we are 
authorized to do such trades?

		 Subject: Joshua Tree Financing Structure

In preparation for the 2:00 p.m. meeting today regarding the Bank of America 
term sheet, please consider the following:

(1) Proposed Trust/LLC Structure.  Trust would own 99% of LLC with ENA as 
managing member owning other 1%.   LLC would purchase/own VPPs.

 Legal prefers the two-tier structure but 

 (i)  would prefer the use of a Delaware business trust with Wilmington Trust 
Company as the trustee instead of a Texas trust to own equity in underlying 
LLC/LP, and 

 (ii) as to the proposed Delaware limited liability company which would own 
the VPPs, asks the tax and commercial teams to consider (a) whether this 
entity might or will derive significant income from Texas based 
properties/operations or otherwise be subject to material Texas franchise 
tax, and (b) if so, whether we should use a Texas limited partnership instead 
of the LLC.

(2) Proposed Certificate and Trust Terms and Conditions.  

Clarify that certificate holders commit to fund their pro rata portion of 
aggregate A and B loans/investments (similar to contribution obligations of 
equity owners of  LLC, i.e., LLC terms expressly provide that Trust and ENA 
must make pro rata (to their respective ownership interests) contributions to 
LLC for purchase price of VPPs].
Identity of A and B holders, e.g., banks get A and [who?] get B?

(3) LLC Terms.

Is proposed 99% and 1% ownership of LLC by Trust and ENA (as managing 
member), respectively, ok?  Same ownership percentages if we use LP?

VPP commercial and legal teams need to determine acceptability of proposed 
terms of:

(i) Master Balancing Agreement between LLC and ENA,  Note re item 1 of 
Mandatory Cost Advances:  only require ENA to make specified expenditures 
where it has control of, or not prohibited by, specific situation or 
governing contract.
(ii) Master Natural Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement between LLC and [need to 
determine correct Enron  counterparty since Enron Gas Marketing, Inc. does 
not exist] (provide for Texas governing law?),
(iii) Master Crude Oil Purchase and Sale Agreement between LLC and Enron 
Reserve Acquisition Corp. (correct counterparty?  provide for Texas governing 
law?), and
(iv) Eligibility/engineering criteria for new VPPs.  Query regarding item 
10:  why can't LLC buy a VPP from a seller in  bankruptcy on a free-and-clear 
basis?

Clarify whether specified New Company Asset Procedures are alternatives (i.e.
, either proposed new VPPs (1) meet specified eligibility criteria as 
certified by ENA or independent third party, or (2) new VPP are approved by 
Engineering Banks (with no objection by majority of Trust certificate 
holders, rather thaneither proposed new VPPs (i) meet specified eligibility 
criteria as certified by ENA and independent third party, or (ii) new VPP are 
approved by Engineering Banks (with no objection by majority of Trust 
certificate holders). 

Enron Corp. Performance Guaranty.  Presumably ""performance"" guaranty is one 
of payment or can be reduced to a pre-agreed payment amount.  Try for Texas 
governing law.  Start with Enron Corp. standard form of guarantee with 
revolver reps and covenants.

(4) Swaps (interest rate and energy price)

Should these be assets of Trust or LLC/LP?  Any related tax issues?
Who is swap counterparty (ENA?)
Is non-ISDA format acceptable?  If so, is Texas law (as opposed to NY law 
typically covering an ISDA) ok?

(5) Production Pricing Flexibility

 Consider consistency between pricing parameters contained in VPP purchase 
documents on the one hand (e.g., Crescendo), and financing documents on the 
other hand (e.g., Master Purchase Agreements under (3) above and swaps under 
(4) above).

		 Subject: Joshua Tree Financing Structure

In preparation for the 2:00 p.m. meeting today regarding the Bank of America 
term sheet, please consider the following:

(1) Proposed Trust/LLC Structure.  Trust would own 99% of LLC with ENA as 
managing member owning other 1%.   LLC would purchase/own VPPs.

 Legal prefers the two-tier structure but 

 (i)  would prefer the use of a Delaware business trust with Wilmington Trust 
Company as the trustee instead of a Texas trust to own equity in underlying 
LLC/LP, and 

 (ii) as to the proposed Delaware limited liability company which would own 
the VPPs, asks the tax and commercial teams to consider (a) whether this 
entity might or will derive significant income from Texas based 
properties/operations or otherwise be subject to material Texas franchise 
tax, and (b) if so, whether we should use a Texas limited partnership instead 
of the LLC.

(2) Proposed Certificate and Trust Terms and Conditions.  

Clarify that certificate holders commit to fund their pro rata portion of 
aggregate A and B loans/investments (similar to contribution obligations of 
equity owners of  LLC, i.e., LLC terms expressly provide that Trust and ENA 
must make pro rata (to their respective ownership interests) contributions to 
LLC for purchase price of VPPs].
Identity of A and B holders, e.g., banks get A and [who?] get B?

(3) LLC Terms.

Is proposed 99% and 1% ownership of LLC by Trust and ENA (as managing 
member), respectively, ok?  Same ownership percentages if we use LP?

VPP commercial and legal teams need to determine acceptability of proposed 
terms of:

(i) Master Balancing Agreement between LLC and ENA,  Note re item 1 of 
Mandatory Cost Advances:  only require ENA to make specified expenditures 
where it has control of, or not prohibited by, specific situation or 
governing contract.
(ii) Master Natural Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement between LLC and [need to 
determine correct Enron  counterparty since Enron Gas Marketing, Inc. does 
not exist] (provide for Texas governing law?),
(iii) Master Crude Oil Purchase and Sale Agreement between LLC and Enron 
Reserve Acquisition Corp. (correct counterparty?  provide for Texas governing 
law?), and
(iv) Eligibility/engineering criteria for new VPPs.  Query regarding item 
10:  why can't LLC buy a VPP from a seller in  bankruptcy on a free-and-clear 
basis?

Clarify whether specified New Company Asset Procedures are alternatives (i.e.
, either proposed new VPPs (1) meet specified eligibility criteria as 
certified by ENA or independent third party, or (2) new VPP are approved by 
Engineering Banks (with no objection by majority of Trust certificate 
holders, rather thaneither proposed new VPPs (i) meet specified eligibility 
criteria as certified by ENA and independent third party, or (ii) new VPP are 
approved by Engineering Banks (with no objection by majority of Trust 
certificate holders). 

Enron Corp. Performance Guaranty.  Presumably ""performance"" guaranty is one 
of payment or can be reduced to a pre-agreed payment amount.  Try for Texas 
governing law.  Start with Enron Corp. standard form of guarantee with 
revolver reps and covenants.

(4) Swaps (interest rate and energy price)

Should these be assets of Trust or LLC/LP?  Any related tax issues?
Who is swap counterparty (ENA?)
Is non-ISDA format acceptable?  If so, is Texas law (as opposed to NY law 
typically covering an ISDA) ok?

(5) Production Pricing Flexibility

 Consider consistency between pricing parameters contained in VPP purchase 
documents on the one hand (e.g., Crescendo), and financing documents on the 
other hand (e.g., Master Purchase Agreements under (3) above and swaps under 
(4) above).

Teresa, as I mentioned, attached is revised term sheet intended to reflect 
latest commercial changes but subject to legal review.  Please particularly 
consider (with commercial and operational teams as appropriate) Engineering 
(eligibility) Criteria applicable to proposed VPPs, and proposed terms of 
Balancing Agreement, Master Natural Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement, and 
Master Crude Oil Purchase and Sale Agreement.  Of course, any other thoughts 
you have are most welcome.

We are having an internal meeting (global finance, accounting and tax) to 
discuss term sheet at 2:00 PM on Friday, 11/10/00 in EB 2868.  

If you can meet with us on Friday or otherwise give us feedback by Friday 
afternoon, it would help facilitate finalization of term sheet and movement 
to drafting of definitive documents.

Sara,
In response to your questions below:

1. Rod Nelson will be handling credit as the deal is now being executed by 
ENA.

2. Tax is being handled by Steve Jacobson in the London office ( he is our US 
tax person )

3. Accounting is Matt Landy

4. The confirmations are being handled by Kim Theriot and John Wilson is the 
trader who will be signing on behalf of ENA. We have a call with them today 
at 3.00pm UK time  so if there is any change I will let you know.

5. We are still waiting for the term sheet / confirms from TD and are 
expecting them this afternoon. I will forward them to you asap.

6. TD have proposed using the 98 ISDA which I believe is already in place 
with ENA and TD Texas.

7. This is just one transaction with 3 individual wti swaps, two of which are 
with Enron, Enron/TD , TD/Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley/ Enron

I will send you the transaction diagram from TD and the ISDA agreement.

If there is anything else you need please feel free to call me on 0207 783 
5404

Regards

I don't know a thing about this deal!  I am expecting Marcus to call me this 
morning for further explanation.  Forgive my ignorance, but what is a CACS?  
Thanks.  Sara

Sara,
Do we need to complete a CACS form for this deal and if so does it need to be 
signed off by London or Houston as ENA are executing the deal ?

Treasa:

Your diagram identifies ""Toronto-Dominion Bank, Toronto"".  
Are we using the 12/18/98 ISDA agreement as a model for a new master ISDA 
agreement?  Did the bank change its name?

I'll wait for the term sheet and the draft TD confirms which you mentioned in 
your email.

All:

PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING BASED UPON MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PARTIES TO THIS 
PREPAY

(1)  The Toronto Dominion (Texas) master agreement with ECT is a restricted 
master.  It was negotiated for a prepay several years ago and is not 
necessarily market (or ENA) standard.  It should be reviewed immediately by 
legal and credit.

(2)  The Morgan Stanley Capital Group master agreement is very old.  IT IS 
NOT AN ISDA .  It is a 1992 Master Energy Price Swap Agreement (limited to 
simple transactions and commodities).  The terminology is not even ISDA 
terminology.  This master has been on the credit/legal radar screen for 
upgrading to an ISDA.  

Rod:  You need to take a look at the Toronto Dominion (Texas) master 
agreement now and we should discuss.

Treasa:  Will there be a rate swap?  Under which master(s)?

Sara and Marcus:

Attached below please find subuser passwords for DynegyDirect so that each of 
you can review relevant products before we let the traders loose.  Sara, Greg 
Whalley and Andy Zipper just called me and are very anxious to get sign off 
to trade financial products.  Marcus, Wade Hicks called me and is anxious to 
trade LPG products.  We have a financial contract in place with Dynegy which 
will govern financial transactions, so it's just a matter of approving the 
products.  However, we do not have a liquids contract in place so you, 
Marcus, need to sign off on the Dynegydirect on-line terms and conditions 
that I sent you before we can commence trading.

If you have trouble logging on, give Sheri Thomas a call -- she has already 
logged on to use the system.  I believe you are going to need to download 
some software to use the system.

Please let me know AS SOON as you have completed your review so that we can 
set up trading.

Regards,

Leslie

Dear Sara,

With respect to our recent exchange of voice-mail messages,
I await to receive from you at your earliest opportunity
a draft of the Amendment to the Credit Support Annex between
Enron North America Corp. and Cargill, Incorporated.

I have also been advised by our Credit Department that we are
to begin negotiations on an ISDA Master Agreement between Enron
North America Corp. and Cargill-Alliant, LLC.  We assume the
ISDA being amended above would serve as a basis for this new
Agreement.  Could you please advise if you will also be handling
negotiation of the Cargill-Alliant, LLC ISDA?

There are TWO (2) Enron affiliates having master agreements with Morgan 
Stanley Capital Group Inc. (""MSCG""):

(1)  ECTRIC has an ISDA Master Agreement with MSCG dated 3/25/99 but 
effective as of 8/29/97

(2)  ECT (now ENA) has a Master Energy Price Swap Agreement with MSCG dated, 
and effective, as of 6/16/92

With respect to the TD (TEXAS) master agreement having a ""RESTRICTED"" status, 
I will need to speak with Rod Nelson.

Sara,
I have spoken to Kim Theriot and she has said that that you are the person 
who needs to sign off on the Master ISDA agreement which TD wish to use. 
Could you let me me know if this is ok,  I need to get back to TD today. Kim 
has confirmed that the ISDA has been fully executed.
Also could tell me which ISDA,  ENA have in place with Morgan Stanley Capital 
Group Inc. Kim says its was executed on 2nd March '99 but I don't know if it 
is the same ISDA as  the one TD want to use.


Regards

Treasa

Treasa:

Your diagram identifies ""Toronto-Dominion Bank, Toronto"".  
Are we using the 12/18/98 ISDA agreement as a model for a new master ISDA 
agreement?  Did the bank change its name?

I'll wait for the term sheet and the draft TD confirms which you mentioned in 
your email.

Sara,

Procter & Gamble has proposed that we start negotiating using their ISDA 
schedule.  Enclosed is a note (that addresses a few critical issues) from my 
business counterpart and a draft schedule.

P&G is the largest buyer of pulp and containerboard in North America - two 
key commodities for our business.  Executing a Master with them is very 
important.  If at all possible, I would like to accomodate their requests to 
negotiate from their schedule.

However, as you know, I am not a lawyer.  Please review and share your 
thoughts with me.  Thanks.

Ed Quinn

Ed-

As promised, I have attached our standard ISDA Schedule.  All bank and 
non-bank
(commodity financial instrument) counterparties with whom we transact have
signed essentially the same ISDA Schedule without non-reliance and set off or
cross default.  As I have discussed previously, I think that it is beneficial 
to
both of us to work directly versus sleeving transactions through a third 
party.
Given our credit limit policies, we will require some form of credit 
enhancement
from you, but I think that cost effective alternatives exist beyond using 
banks
as stand-in counterparties.

I realize that our approach may differ from other companies, but I think that 
we
can dramatically assist in the development of the pulp and paper financial
instrument market.  Certainly, as Enron is an important market maker, we would
like to be in position to transact a significant portion of our volume with 
you.
Net, very positive results for both of our companies.

I will be interested in your response to the attached schedule.

Regards

Roger

Sara,

P&G (largest buyer of pulp and linerboard in orth America) has received Board 
approval to financially hedge pulp using OTCs instruments.  They want to put 
an ISDA in place with Enron.  I will be the contact for the business group.  

P&G's lawyer, Libby Rutherford, has requested that we start where we left 
off.  I told their business representatives that we preferred starting from 
scratch but that you would contact her directly to discuss.  Her number is 
513-983-2513 and e-mail is rutherford.em@pg.com.    

Susan Bailey compared the 1999 negotiated document to our latest schedule for 
our review - see below.  Please give me a call to discuss when you get a 
chance ext 30418.  Thanks.

Ed Quinn

Ed,

Attached is blacklined version comparing ENA's latest version (dated 
8/9/2000), which was sent to Roger Larsh @ P&G and the version dated 
5/25/99.  The biggest difference between the two versions is that the 
8/9/2000 version includes (a) ENA's newest changes, and (b) the inclusion of 
a credit support annex.

Hope this helps.

Thanks Jason,

How long has this request been in Clements hands, that group has a
tendency
to have a slow response time.  Is there no other way we can proceed with
execution of the document while we wait on the Guaranty?  Also, Midcoast
has been transacting at the parent level (Midcoast Energy Resources) and
these trades will need to be assigned to Midcoast Marketing under the
new
ISDA.  I think it would be a good idea to prepare assignment documents
as
well to have the trades moved. Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks.

Do you have a deal diagram?  Is there a commodity swap between ENA and 
Morgan?  
The TD/ENA commodity swap has language regarding ""loan repayment"" and the 
""fee"".  Has Matt seen this?  Shouldn't this be in a separate document?  Also, 
I'm not sure what TD is tyring to net (quarterly payments under the swap with 
other payments due on the same day in the same currency under the Master?).  
Do want TD to be the Calc. Agent for the commodity swap and the rate swap?  
Are you satisfied wtih the Disruption Fallback (which is the same as the 
Master but for the reduction in  Postponement from 5 to 3 days).
I am trying to speak with Rod.

Just to update you:

1.  I think that our travel plans are fairly well set and I know that Kaye 
has spoken with you on several items.
2.  Mark wanted to be sure that in Sao Paulo, meetings were being scheduled 
with outside counsel (which I believe Andrea is handling), with Randy Young 
(can you attend to that please?) and ESA necessary commercials (Andrea 
handling?).
3.  Mark wanted to make certain that we got on Don Black's calendar while in 
B.A.  Could you look into that as well?

For my own edification, who are Luiz Maurer and Orlando Gonzalez?

Please let me know if there is anything elso you need form me. 

I'll bring you up to date on Hickerson shortly.

Thanks,  Sara"

Katherine Harris' decision Wednesday not to allow counties to modify their
vote totals.

Sara, I would like to sit in on this if I can -- I have a 10 a.m. conference

Does the fact that  you put the phrase ""no big deal"" in quotations indicate a

TD has scheduled a conference call with me at 10:30 am Houston time to 
discuss the crude swap (related to the prepay).  Mataly Sahoni (?) said that 
they wanted to discuss some ""credit issues"" and that it was ""no big deal.""

You are welcome to join me.  Sara

P.S.  Bob Bruce (Ext. 57780; EB 3880D) will back me up while I am out of the 
office tomorrow afternoon, Monday and Tuesday. I'll be back on Wednesday, 
Nov. 22.

I am finalizing the negotiation of the ISDA Master Agreement with SITA.  You 
will recall that this is an ECTRIC; master NOT ENA.  SITA has (1) requested 
evidence of EEFT's ability to sign for ECTRIC and (2) confirmation that ""EEFT 
is signing on the basis of their authority under the investment services 
directive"".  Would you please provide directly to SITA's lawyers as follows:

Susan Hopkinson and Sharon Lewis at Lovells in Paris:

Looks like 2/3 of the way down on pg. 2 he clearly says we have a deal

Sara, here's the transcript of a conversation with Bob whereby I mistakenly 
inform him that he needs to post a $240k LC and he doesn't object.  Please 
comment on how useful this will be to our efforts to enforce the deal.  Also, 
as mentioned previously, I called Bob a week ago, left him a message and 
haven't heard any response.  Should I try again?????  What are our next 
steps?   (I'm pulling more tapes to try to find the conversation or message 
in which I tell Bob that he's actually got $250k of credit).



Thanks,
Alan

Tanya:

SITA now insists on having the Termination Currency and the Contractual 
Currency, except as otherwise agreed in any Transaction/Confirmation, as the 
Euro.  They will not agree to USD.  [By the way, SITA's lawyers had already 
agreed to USD]  Effectively, if we agree to this, the trader will need to 
confirm each deal in USD (Contractual Currency) but if we early terminate, 
the currency will be Euro's (Termination Currency).

What do you want to do?  Other than the Enron Corp. guaranty, we are finished.

Yes, I have received your message.  I had lunch with Monty, Keith and my dad 
at the Big G and it was wonderful.  Then I dragged Lawyers Daigle and 
Burlingame to the offices of Gordon, Arata, et al to say hello to Guy Wall.  
We only stayed for a few minutes and the old firm sure looked the same.  The 
weather in N.O. was perfect and I also had dinner at Emeril's and a catered 
meal by P. Prudhomme, both of which were excellent.  Things are rocking along 
here.  I am actually going to have that eye surgery next Friday (I'm 85% 
convinced to do it).  It only takes a short time and I can't drive to the 
clinic myself but I can drive the following day.  Maybe they'll come up with 
something to help my brain.

Back to N.O., I also had drinks with Paul Dubroc.  I guess you heard that 
Neel Roberts has been receiving treatments at M.D. Anderson.  (So is Julia 
Heintz's mother, by the way).  Robert Soniat (a lawyer in N.O.) recently died 
of liver cancer.  

I have been for long weekends to Phoenix and N.Y.  It snowed in Phoenix (it 
was supposed to be 80 degrees) and I caught the 24-hour bug in N.Y.

So, Carson, what's new with you???????????????????????????"

Treasa:  Bob Bruce told me that there was no ""swap"" activity on the prepay 
during my absence.  
Houston is closed down until Monday, Nov. 27 for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Normally, I would ask Joe Hunter on the confirm desk to take a look at the 
confirms.  I marked up the TD confirm to reflect my comments and provide an 
attached ""schedule"" of volumes since I thought it would be easier for you to 
match calc periods, volumes and rate payment dates.  Such a format has worked 
well in other prepaid structures.

If I don't go out of town tomorrow,  you can  reach me at home. My number is 
(713) 664-3207. "

the development of an Argentina Power Book. 

A revised Confirmation has been delivered to the Counterparty which changes 
the Fixed Amounts currency from Argentina Peso to USD; which results in both 
the Fixed and Floating Amounts will be payable in USD.

The Confirmation for the back-to-back transaction between ECT and Enron 
Commericializdora de Energia Argentina is forthcoming.

Brad Deibner, Financial Settlements in Houston, has been provided with a copy 
of all deal tickets and Confirmations , and will be responsible for all 
settlements relating to this transaction. All information relating to 
payments and/or prices should be sent to Brad.

Stephanie:  Hope you had a great Thanksgiving!

Please follow up with this guy.  Looks like he's in London.  We need to 
verify that he's with Harvard, either through Caroline or asking that he send 
a faxed request so that we can see the letterhead, etc.  Also, please keep 
track of the fully executed master.  Thanks.  Sara

Sarah
I have been speaking with Caroline Abramo regarding our trading relationship 
with the President & Fellows of Harvard College.  I am trying to obtain a 
copy of the ISDA that I understand has been signed with them.
I would be grateful if you could forward a copy of this to me.

Thanks for your help

Good Morning Sara,

Hope you had a nice holiday weekend! I wanted to follow up regarding several 
issues.

1) Please provide me with your e-mail authorization wherein you verbally 
approved the ""Right to Terminate"" language for the Merrill Lynch Interest 
Rate Swap Confirmation.

2) I faxed you Bank of Montreal's response to the ""Right to Terminate"" 
language on Friday for the Interest Rate Swap that was originally traded on 
11/3/00.. Please advise with your opinion. I have another trade with the 
identical language from 11/14/00 that I am faxing to you this morning. We 
received it at 5:37pm Friday afternoon.

3) Please advise your opinion on the Termination Agreement for the Default 
Swap with Deutsche Bank dated 10/12/00.

Looking forward to your response.

Regards,

Jorge

Hi Sara,

How are you going - did you have a good Thanksgiving?  Coincidentally 
Thursday was also a holiday here - we were celebrating Respect for the Aged 
Day though.

Actually, Sara, I was wondering how we are going in getting some drafting 
together for the credit provisions discussed recently with John Suttle and 
Jonathan Whitehead.

Thanks and sorry for the trouble.

Dear John,

Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to 
the end.  They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly 
their back / mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in 
place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course.  They 
acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards 
CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank.  They did 
say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do 
so. Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are 
set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask 
them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now.

We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime, if you 
are still willing to do so.  The bank has a credit rating of A, so I guess 
this means US$15 million credit limit.  

On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract 
without a full CSA, I wonder who is best to do this drafting.  I should be 
able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the 
drafting .... Alan, do you have any suggestions?     

Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the 
""Threshold Amount"" definition to US$10 million.  Is there any flexibility on 
this?

Thanks.

Jane McBride

Jonathan,

One thing we might be able to propose is a ""Credit Matrix"" which prescribes a 
Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact - with collateral 
rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each 
counterparty.  We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and 
they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change (MAC) 
clauses.  This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot 
automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs.  We 
are comfortable because as the counterparty's credit quality deteriorates, 
the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases.  I would propose to 
IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA.  Jane and John - is 
it possible to draft these collateral/credit terms into the contract without 
using a full CSA?  (I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a 
CSA).

Rating (S&P)     Credit Line
AA or above    $20MM
BBB+ to AA-    $15MM
BBB     $10MM
BBB-     $7MM
BB- to BB+    $5MM
Below BB-    $1MM

These terms are subject to negotiation.  Once again, the matrix removes MAC 
clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such, but effectively 
reduces the potential exposure we have (or THEY have) to a counterparty with 
diminishing credit quality.

What do you all think?

John

John, Have had a conversation with IBJ re the CSA, and they have asked us to 
consider proposing a solution that does not involve a CSA. I propose to meet 
with them again to try and explore why, but I would like to be prepared to 
offer them a solution whereby we don't enter into a CSA, and we would limit 
the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ. My feeling is that we 
would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions (over 2 years) at 
this stage anyway, and would prefer to get the relationship going, as I am 
not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet. They appear to be quite 
willing to discuss all the other points. We can always press for a 
renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals. 
I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate.

What are your thoughts on this, and what limitations would you want to put on 
trades if we do not have a CSA?

Thanks,
Jonathan

John-

During our last meeting with IBJ, we pushed hard for the implementation of 
the CSA.  I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the 
requisite activities relating to the CSA, as we understand that they utilize 
same with certain financial institution counterparties.  We expressed our 
view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in 
our recent conference call.  

IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a non-financial 
institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the 
first.  We requested that they raise this issue with their respective 
superiors.  As you know, their response to our discussions relating to this 
issue was ""In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral 
operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA.""  The legitimacy of this 
statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be 
something entirely different, including the possibility that they merely do 
not want to enter into a CSA with a non-financial institution.  

We will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the CSA with Enron, 
however it is uncertain if this is achievable.

Virginia:

Hope you had a great holiday!

Pick a day for lunch (not today) and let me know.

Fran's daughter Cole just got engaged.  She's 23 years old.  I thought
that's how old we were!

		 Subject: Re: ISDA Master Agreements

With respect to Deutsche Bank (""""DB""), we have one credit issue remaining, DB 
would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as 
Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat 
hesitant to do so, as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured 
loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement.  Sara and Bill 
Bradford in Credit are supposed to talk to the DB Credit people about this 
remaining issue.

With respect to First Union National Bank, the draft we were working from was 
so old that they agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was 
sent to them on 11/8/00 for review.  Sara is working on that with Susan 
Bailey, another paralegal in our Group.

Tana - can you please give me an update on where you are in the negotiations 
of the ISDA with the following counterparties and confirm which Enron entity 
you are negotiating on behalf of.

We would like to make progress as soon as possible on setting up these legall 
entities, as other tax-driven restructurings are about to be unleashed and 
getting the operational side of the transfer into a new entity will take the 
longest to execute.
shows the step we wish to take.
I have deliberately not placed ECCL anywhere because it is probably moving 
around.
On what basis should we decide whether to create ECHI and ECCI as LLCs or 
Corporations?

Many thanks,

I have spoken with Jeff Blumenthal (US tax) about your request as I think he 
would be better suited to provide your advice.  Jeff cannot make your 
conference call tomorrow but I have forwarded to him this message and your 
diagrams from last week.  If you could provide Jeff with a short description 
of any issues, he will be glad to respond this week.

		 Subject: Corp Prepay

As you are aware TD were concerned about the basis risk embedded in the 
prepaid swap structure . They plan to hedge their Enron exposure by buying 
credit default swaps in the market. However under credit default swaps, only 
a default on debt as defined by GAAP is  included as a credit event, and 
swaps are excluded from this definition .  This basis risk  therefore occurs 
where  Enron defaults on the oil swap but has not defaulted on any debt. This 
does not trigger a payout to TD under their credit protection, their recourse 
will then be through  the Corp guarantee with time delays. 

To mitigate that risk it was proposed that  in the event of an Enron default 
under the prepaid swap, the MTM termination value of the swap would be 
converted into a loan and Enron would automatically default on that loan. 
TD's counsel came back late on Friday to say that they could not give a clean 
legal opinion on this  structure.

We therefore proposed an alternative structure which involves TD and Enron 
entering into a loan of $10.1m at the same time as the swap is executed. This 
loan will  be in the name of Enron Corp. In the event of an Enron default on 
the prepaid swap, this will cross default into the $10.1m   loan and that 
forms the required trigger for TD's  credit default swaps.   The lawyers 
signed off on this last night and Norton Rose are now preparing the loan 
documentation.
They are basing it on the May 2000, 364 day Enron Corp facility and we are 
expecting first draft tomorrow. I will forward this to you when I receive it.


The deal itself is still undefined as TD have  credit approval subject to 
presyndicating the loan to two other banks and putting a certain level of 
credit protection in place prior to executing the trade.
The confirm/term sheet has not changed from two weeks ago and I have 
forwarded Sara's  comments to TD but their focus has been on getting credit 
approval rather than docs until today.  We have not sent a confirm to Morgan 
Stanley yet as we plan to replicate  whatever  confirm we agree with TD.  

I will keep you informed as to TD's progress.

Regards

Mark:

Credit has asked us to pursue trading arrangements on behalf of Enovate.  

At least for the short term, Mark Haedicke told Kay Mann that ENA legal 
should handle Enovate legal work.  That work currently consists of 
establishing documentation for financial trading with third parties.  It is 
not clear what lawyers (ENA or Peoples) will draft/negotiate ISDA masters nor 
have any forms been agreed (but Peoples' lawyers have seen our forms and I 
have seen their forms which are poorly drafted).  Bill Bradford will have the 
final word on Enovate credit.

Credit has asked us to track Enovate masters on our Lotus Notes database.

Do you need to follow up with Mark about us negotiating Enovate's master 
agreements?  Or should we just handle as any other project?

Sara, RMT/NNG was put on hold per Tony Pryor's request pending restructuring 
of NNG.  This restructuring is finished (it involved NNG going from 100% 
Enron-owned to about 98%).  I talked with Tony yesterday on this and he says 
the ISDA may now proceed. Tax has confirmed this is still an RMT deal.

Re the fx trade you mentioned, the confirm desk has drafted a deemed ISDA for 
this that needs fixing. (not sure what they are doing drafting deemed 
ISDAs).  I am working with Melissa Rodriguez on this.  

I do have a voice mail in to Tanya to ask her if credit wants to re-review in 
light of the new NNG ownership structure.  Even though the ownership change 
seems minor, it seems like the procedurally sound thing to do is to run this 
by credit.  Have not heard back from Tanya and will bring this up at 
legal/credit meeting this afternoon.

I will take this over, including the ISDA master.  Susan, in the meantime, 
could you e-mail me the credit review sheet on this if you have one. -- Bob

Sara--  The arbitration set-up is OK, and JVD has approved.  My only comment 
is that eight years experience may be too much to ask, insofar as the third 
arbitor is concerned.   I won't have heartburn if we stick with that, but I 
do suggest that the agreement provide that less experience is acceptable upon 
request by the two arbitors and approval of both parties.

Joe:

Susan Bailey (X34737) will be drafting the TVA master.  I don't think it will 
go out today; maybe, tomorrow.  Please feel free to call Susan (or me) if you 
have any questions. 

Negotiations proceed more quickly when legal has the name, phone number and 
email address for the counterparty's LAWYER (I know you tried!).  If the 
counterparty is truly anxious to trade, the commercial guys will pressure the 
legal department to pay attention to the documents and keep the ball 
rolling.  Otherwise, things will sit around and go nowhere.

Just remember that an ISDA negotiation is USUALLY longer with a governmental 
entity because ENA requires more information (legal opinion, copies of 
statutes, authority in the form of a full Board resolution, etc.) and 
government lawyers may be short staffed.  Sometimes the counterparty will 
hire outside counsel which may go more quickly, but not always.

If a counterparty is totally organized and familiar with financial trading 
documents, the negotiations may end within a week (but I have never seen this 
happen with a governmental).  Otherwise, it simply depends on the issues.

Hi Sara
Would you be available for 1 1/2 hrs on Thursday, 11/30 in the morning to 
meet with Jeff Kinneman regarding Online Trading Platforms.
I would've checked this with your assistant, but I am not sure who it is.
Thank you

1.  Finance deals for total return swaps may not have had such language.
   2.  A couple of masters may have excluded trade option exemption with 
respect to counterparty or used our ""deemed"" language.
   3.  Maybe some of Shari's weather masters excluded commodity items.
   4.  Credit Lyonnais AAA Master didn't address commodities.  Are there 
other AAA masters and/or bank masters like this?
   5.  The paralegals may remember something.

Do you remember negotiating any master agreements for ECT that did not 
contain the necessary elements for trading energy commodity derivatives?  In 
particular I'm thinking about things like the trade opiton exemption 
representations and the commodity derivatives definitions provisions.

Hi Sara,

The Enron entity is

I can evaluate the credit, and also Anna Shaw, Hamish Scutt or Lindsay

Thanks a lot

You have attached a form of confirmation for a very specialized derivative

Sara:  Attached are EWEB's markup of Enron's response to EWEB's proposed
ISDA Schedule.  As we discusssed, in order to isolate the items that remain
to be resolved, I simply ""accepted"" all of your modifications and then
redlined items EWEB wants modified or returned to EWEB's original proposal.

Also, in regard to the Confirmations and our discussion regarding their
execution in connection with authorizing Resolution to be considered by the
EWEB Board on December 5th, EWEB proposes the following language be added to
the end of the first paragraph of each Confirmation:  ""This Transaction will
become effective and enforceable upon the final approval of its terms by the
EWEB Board of Commissioners and issuance of an authorizing legal opinion by
counsel for EWEB.""

As for the remainder the terms of the Confirmation, i.e., the ""deemed ISDA""
portion, EWEB requests that you incorporate any proposed changes included in
our redline to the general ISDA Schedule.

Finally, I understand from Dick Varner at EWEB that he is in the process of
arranging a conference call tomorrow regarding the credit arrangements.
Thanks for assisting in setting this up.

-Jim

Randy/Sara,  

Please confirm if Enron can or cannot execute a financial swap with Aracruz 
Brazil.

Alternatively, we need input on Enron's ability to execute a financial swap 
for pulp with Aracruz's off-shore, Panamanian  subsidiary. 

We are trying to prep for a discussion scheduled for tomorrow, Thursday 
afternoon, Sao Paulo time (4 hours ahead of Houston). 

Thanks your help."

    Is the attachment the form of confirmation that would be employed for a
Enron/SCWC ""contract for differences"" transaction? I pulled it from the ISDA

Jorge:

(1)  Yes, I did verbally approve the Merrill Lynch ""Other Provisions"" section 
of the rate swap (10/26/00 deal).

(2)  Yes, I received your Fax of 11/21/00 from Bank of Montreal with your 
email to the bank.  The language which you sent to the Bank of Montreal 
(""BOM"") was to be based on the Merrill Lynch ""Other Provisions"" section of 
the above rate swap.  In that regard,
 (i)  you inadvertently left out a phrase when you retyped the Merrill Lynch 
language.  However, BOM's subsequent revision is acceptable.
 (ii)  it is not clear to me whether ALL of Paragraph 3 in the original BOM 
confirm is being replaced.  Your message to BOM seems to imply that it is 
fully 
        replaced (which is what we want).  You should definitely verify that 
this is the case in your latest BOM confirm.

(3)  Yes, the Termination Agreement format from Deutsche Bank AG looks fine.  
Just be sure that all transaction references are correct.

Sorry for the delay.  I am trying to identify another lawyer to back me up.

Good Morning Sara,

Hope you had a nice holiday weekend! I wanted to follow up regarding several 
issues.

1) Please provide me with your e-mail authorization wherein you verbally 
approved the ""Right to Terminate"" language for the Merrill Lynch Interest 
Rate Swap Confirmation.

2) I faxed you Bank of Montreal's response to the ""Right to Terminate"" 
language on Friday for the Interest Rate Swap that was originally traded on 
11/3/00.. Please advise with your opinion. I have another trade with the 
identical language from 11/14/00 that I am faxing to you this morning. We 
received it at 5:37pm Friday afternoon.

3) Please advise your opinion on the Termination Agreement for the Default 
Swap with Deutsche Bank dated 10/12/00.

Looking forward to your response.

Regards,

Jorge

Sorry for delayed response.

Tom says below that the invoice is likely to be in French Francs (FF) , 
therefore, I would have thought that having contractual currency as FF (or 
Euro as / when it replaces the FF)  is the most sensible. 

As the early termination value is likely to be calculated in FF or Euro, I 
think that this would not be a problem either.

Please feel free to give me a call if you wish to discuss 207 783 6755

As you are perhaps aware, the Master for this CP has been arranged thru 
Houston.  Would you cast your eye over the comments laid out below and revert 
to either Sara or Tanya with your comments.  
As background, Houston has negotiated all the docs and were intending to

Tanya:

SITA now insists on having the Termination Currency and the Contractual 
Currency, except as otherwise agreed in any Transaction/Confirmation, as the 
Euro.  They will not agree to USD.  [By the way, SITA's lawyers had already 
agreed to USD]  Effectively, if we agree to this, the trader will need to 
confirm each deal in USD (Contractual Currency) but if we early terminate, 
the currency will be Euro's (Termination Currency).

What do you want to do?  Other than the Enron Corp. guaranty, we are finished.

Of course.  You probably forgot that SITA requested both 
settlement'termination in Euros.  SS

How can the contractual currency be USD and the invoicing be in FF as 
indicated below.  I guess I don't really care what currency is used as ECTRIC 
will be responsible for hedging its currency risk with Hickerson; however, 
shouldn't the contractual and termination currency be the same?

Tanya:  Is Lee the right person to approve this change for SITA?  Remember, 
SITA is acutally with ECTRIC (nto ENA) and SITA wanted to settle in Euros.  
Thanks.  Sara

Sorry for delayed response.

Tom says below that the invoice is likely to be in French Francs (FF) , 
therefore, I would have thought that having contractual currency as FF (or 
Euro as / when it replaces the FF)  is the most sensible. 

As the early termination value is likely to be calculated in FF or Euro, I 
think that this would not be a problem either.

Please feel free to give me a call if you wish to discuss 207 783 6755

As you are perhaps aware, the Master for this CP has been arranged thru 
Houston.  Would you cast your eye over the comments laid out below and revert 
to either Sara or Tanya with your comments.  
As background, Houston has negotiated all the docs and were intending to 
trade out of Houston.  This CP has now been handed over to us and all trades 
will be generated from here.
Any help much appreciated.

Tanya:

SITA now insists on having the Termination Currency and the Contractual 
Currency, except as otherwise agreed in any Transaction/Confirmation, as the 
Euro.  They will not agree to USD.  [By the way, SITA's lawyers had already 
agreed to USD]  Effectively, if we agree to this, the trader will need to 
confirm each deal in USD (Contractual Currency) but if we early terminate, 
the currency will be Euro's (Termination Currency).

What do you want to do?  Other than the Enron Corp. guaranty, we are finished.

I just spoke with Bill Bradford and I understand that Bill and Mark 
Tarkington discussed the use of ""Specified Entity"" and agreed, subject to DB 
committee approval, to eliminate the use of Specified Entity in the ENA and 
affiliated masters with DB (i.e., ""Specified Entity:  none"").   Once you have 
confirmed this with Mark, please prepare a final blacklined draft for our 
review and then execution copies of the ISDA Master Agreement.   In 
connection with the final draft, Tana Jones will fax to you minor format 
comments.  [She will also fax to you the electronic trading agreements and 
password applications for London and U.S. based trading.]

The following ENA affiliates will also need to execute ISDA Master Agreements

(2)  Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. (Delaware

(3)  EnronCredit.com Limited (U.K. corporation)"

Bill:  I am resending my earlier message which identifies the correct legal 
entities with which Enron Corp. would like to execute ISDA Master Agreements 
(for the purpose of entering into equity trades).  In addition to the 
entities listed below, we need to include ""Merrill Lynch International"" 
(""MLI"").  ENA just negotiated an agreement with MLI, so the Enron Corp. 
master should be fairly simple.  Also, Clint and Jeff are interested in 
transacting with Toronto Dominion Bank.  In that regard I note that Enron has 
an Interest Rate and Currency Agreement with Toronto Dominion Bank, New York 
Branch.  I'll review this agreement to see if it requires amendment.

Jeff/Clint:  Do want to deal with a specific Toronto Dominion branch?

All:  I will expect that Bill will provide credit worksheets and I'll either 
begin the ISDA process or change ""ENA"" to Enron Corp. on those agreements 
which have previously been sent.

Thanks.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Sara

		 Subject: Enron Corp. ISDA Master Agreements

All:  Before Rod became a Brit, we were working with Enron Corp. treasury to 
put in place some masters in the name of ENA for the following parties:

Bear, Stearns Internaitonal Limited
Credit Agricole Indosuez
CSFB International
Lehman Brother Finance S.A.
Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.
Deutsche Bank

These masters will be used to for equity deals on ENE stock.  The Treasury 
group has concluded together with Rex Rogers and V&E, that Enron Corp. is the 
appropriate swap counterparty for these masters and NOT ENA.

Who in credit will be available to assist me in this process?  Thanks.  Sara

Larry:

According to Steve Kessler (the DB lawyer in New York who is negotiating the 
ENA ISDA Master), London e-commerce issues are normally handled ty the London 
lawyer (Conrad Libischer at 44-20-754-52705).  If  NY trader is also 
involved, then DB must decide on one lawyer to handle password application, 
etc.

The ENA ISDA Master must first be approved by Frankfurt.  I don't know how 
long this takes.

You may want to let the DB trader start the EOL process.

Thanks.  Sara"

Wednesday, Dec. 6.  She did want me to tell you, though, that she'll arrive a 
little later than usual because she has to get some kind of a lab test early 
in the morning.

It's always a good day when Ofelia comes over!

Marcello:

By way of introduction, I am a lawyer with Enron North America Corp.(""ENA"") 
in the derivatives area.  I have read your memorandum of March 17, 1997 which 
was prepared for us and which addressed both physical and financial trading 
issues.

I am also aware of the recent memo which you prepared for Brent Hendry re:  
internet trading.

I have two (2) followup questions for you limited specifically to financial 
trading (NOT VIA INTERNET):

 (1)  Do you have any changes to add to your memo of March 17, 1997 with 
respect to financial trading?

 (2)  Would you modify ENA's Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement (which I 
believe Brent Hendry recently forwarded to your attention)?

I look forward to hearing from you.  ENA is about to execute a trade with a 
Chilean corporate and I will most likely see the trade confirmation in the 
next day or so.  You can reach me via email or by phone at (713) 853-5620.  
Thank you very much.  

Sara

RE:  Alcoa - it's a one-month deal.  The issue is no netting absent a SINGLE 
agreement governing ALL trades.

Please respond about ALCOA and EWEB.  I'll be out Thursday and Friday.

Sara,

I will be out most of today as I am taking a Power Marketing course.  With 
respect to (1) below, the terms of the Alcoa agreement would probably be 
fine, so long as we get a guaranty from Alcoa, Inc.  (2)  How does this 
differ from the standard and/or is it material?

Rgds,

Ed Sacks

ED:

(1)  The Alcoa lawyer wants to adopt the terms of the ENA/Alcoa Inc. master 
for purposes of the December deal.

(2)  EWEB has requested the following provision:

DEFAULT RATE shall mean the lesser of (a) the per annum rate of interest 
equal to the prime lending rate as may from time to time be published in ""the 
Wall Street Journal"" under ""Money Rates"" on such day (or if not published on 
such day the most recent preceding day on which published), plus two percent 
(2%) but not to exceed in total fourteen percent (14%) annually, and (b) the 
maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

Please let me hear from you.  

Sara

Please see attached black-lined version from the 364 day as requested.
Apologies for the delay - Norton Rose experienced some technical difficulties 
in
blacklining.

In terms of the Facility Amount and Term, I have asked Norton Rose to square
bracket both and make it clear on the front page that these two points are 
still
under discussion and may well reduce.  The amounts currently square bracketed
are maximums and are there to give us some flexibility should it be 
required.  I
trust this is satisfactory.

Please give me a call if there's anything else in respect of the loan 
agreement
you need to discuss.  We will update you as soon as possible on syndication

I finally reached Tom Seligson and he will change the guaranty (below) to add 
that ENA may assign the guaranty to any affiliate without the approval of the 
guarantor.

The remaining issue is whether to confirm on our omnibus or create a confirm 
and adopt by reference the provisions of the Alcoa Inc./ENA master.  I have

I am about to finalize comments to the SITA Master ISDA Agreement on behalf 
of ECTRIC.  I need your able assistance with respect to the following:

(1)  SITA has not passed a board resolution authorizing execution of the 
Agreement.  Instead, SITA proposes a certificate stating that its President 
Directeur General or Directeur General have, pursuant to the Articles of 
Association, full power and authority to execute the Agreement or to grant a 
power of attorney to do so.

(2)  SITA has requested evidence of EEFT's authority to sign on behalf of 
ECTRIC.  I have sent a copy of the power of attorney to the lawyer and will 
ask that she direct any questions to you if I am not reachable.

SITA's attorney is Susan Hopkinson at Lovells in Paris.  Her phone is 33153 
674747 and fax is 33147 239612 and email is susan.hopkinson@lovells.com.

I will be out of the office Dec. 7 & 8.  Stephanie Panus if assisting with 
the file.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara"

Thanks for your email.? As regards your  points:
?
(1) I will let you know once the guarantee is  finalised.
?
(2)?I look forward to receiving the power.?  My client told me this morning 
that he has an email from one of your commercial  people saying that EEFT 
will be the counterparty and that ECTRIC is no longer  involved. I had 
thought that EEFT were simply signing on behalf of ECTRIC and  the fact that 
you are sending me a power suggests to me that this is still the  case.? 
However, given your commercial colleague's email to my client there  is still 
confusion regarding the identity of the counterparty which I would be  
grateful if you could clarify. 
?
(3) Thank you.
?
(4) Sita has had executed the certificate (which refers to two boardr 
esolutions) and a power of attorney.? I look forward to hearing from you  
regarding the Tax rep.

Have a nice break

No CSA (claim to have over 40 ISDA Masters none of which contain CSA's! and 
not set up to handle collateral)
Rating downgrade is a Termination Event.  (Maybe they'll agree to our posting 
L/C's 
MUST have cross-acceleration (POLICY).
Guess what else?  NO NETTING (can't handle netting internally)

All:

Enron's treasury group is reviewing some of the extremely high volume master 
swap agreements to see if rehypothecation of collateral is an alternative.  
The Bank of America (""BofA"") agreement is an ISDA but the credit annex is our 
old format.  BofA has agreed with Bill Bradford to replace the existing Annex 
A (Collateral and Exposure Provisions) with the ISDA Credit Support Annex and 
Paragraph 13.  Soma Ghosh is spearheading this effort and she may contact one 
of you to assist in this effort.  

I told Soma that credit would need to provide a credit worksheeet.

I have attached a credit worksheet per Sara's request in order to amend the B 
of A master.  My understanding is that we intend to only amend the existing 
document for holding and use of collateral so that we may be able to 
rehypothecate collateral.  I have tried to construct the worksheet terms such 
that they reflect what is in the current document, but the old document terms 
should govern in the case of a discrepancy.  I will be out tomorrow, so 
please contact Bill with questions.

Thanks,
Tanya

Please run the due diligence on Oregon Steel Mills.  We're looking at 
presenting them both a financial and physical gas contract.  Once you've had 
a chance to propose some credit terms, let's discuss.

We met with OSM and have another meeting scheduled for tomorrow to discuss 
proposed structures hopefully to be followed by specific pricing.  We're 
talking average monthly volumes of 7,300-7,500 MMBTU for approximately 6-8 
months at a price around $10/MMBTU.  I'm sending you this as a ""reminder"", as 
if and when we're able to agree upon pricing and a proposed structure we'll 
need to ""paper"" it by weeks end.  At this time we could be going either 
physically or financially.  Thanks,  John

There is more and more interest amongst our custoemrs in the West in looking 
at Swaps.  I want to be able to show them how the ISA contract fits together 
with the credit support annex and confirmation letter.  I have built a pro 
forma Cofirrm based on the SoCal Water deal you worked on with me.  Can you 
make a pro forma master and credit support annex so we can fax or e-mail 
these to potential clients so we can try to get their interest and encourage 
them to get contracts and credit in place with us?  I know you are hesitant 
to do this, but it would help our marketing significantly.

Thanks

Bruce, 
It does not sound like we will be using the Enron Brazil Power Holdings' 
entity any longer to hold these shares.
We will need to know the entity and work with Legal to get the proper 
documentation necessary to open up an account at the prime brokers. 
Sara is legal and we work with her team to open up authorized new accounts.
Thanks for the update.

Subject: Next steps with Copel shares


Robert and Kay, thanks for all your work on getting the shares moved out of 
Brazil and into the parent CayCos.  I understand that by sometime early next 
week the physical ADR certificates will be returned by BONY to the Enron 
vault.  

Here is what we now need to do:

1. We are going to need to send one certificate back to BONY and split it 
into three new certificates.  Two certificates will be for approximately 
1.25M shares each, the balance for about 5M shares.

2. We need to form a new CayCo and sell or otherwise transfer (capital 
split?) the two 1.25M tranches to this NewCo.  This needs to happen next week.

3.  Pending Dan Boyle's structuring efforts and an affirmative Corp. decision 
(supervised by Joe Kishkill), the two existing CayCos which now own the Copel 
shares will be sold into Whitewing Fund.  That means about 12.5M shares will 
go to Whitewing and the certificates will remain in the vault.  This would 
happen last week of the year--if it happens (there are actually about 
15,443,000 total ADRs--I am approximating in this email).

4. The NewCo shares will remain outside this structure entirely. We will need 
to put one tranche of 1.25M into a brokerage account--Sheila at this point we 
will bring you in for assistance (again, hopefully next week).

5. Robert--we need to work out soon with Sheila, Skadden,and BONY to 
establish an efficient mechanism to convert the full 1.25M share certificate 
to unrestricted ADRs absent and prior an immediate buyer(s)--or we need to 
figure out foolproof mechanics for constantly reissuing new certificates for 
every small sale.  We will then be looking for effective points to sell these 
1.25M shares--and again, Joe Kishkill will provide price/volume targets 
(execution via Gary Hickerson's group who has not yet been informed).  In 3 
months time, we will repeat the process for the other 1.25M tranche.  

Robert--please call me so we can determine: (a) how to set up NewCo/transfer 
shares, and (b) how to work the 1.25M ""unrestriction"" with BONY and Skadden. 


Regards,  Bruce

Sara,
In response to your questions below:

1. Rod Nelson will be handling credit as the deal is now being executed by 
ENA.

2. Tax is being handled by Steve Jacobson in the London office ( he is our US 
tax person )

3. Accounting is Matt Landy

4. The confirmations are being handled by Kim Theriot and John Wilson is the 
trader who will be signing on behalf of ENA. We have a call with them today 
at 3.00pm UK time  so if there is any change I will let you know.

5. We are still waiting for the term sheet / confirms from TD and are 
expecting them this afternoon. I will forward them to you asap.

6. TD have proposed using the 98 ISDA which I believe is already in place 
with ENA and TD Texas.

7. This is just one transaction with 3 individual wti swaps, two of which are 
with Enron, Enron/TD , TD/Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley/ Enron

I will send you the transaction diagram from TD and the ISDA agreement.

If there is anything else you need please feel free to call me on 0207 783 
5404

Regards

Justin:

I am told by Theresa Brogan that Enron Networks requires an account with one 
of the prime brokers frequently used by ENA and other Enron Corp. 
subsidiaries and that you are handling this particular agreement.  ENA has 
negotiated multiple accounts with Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc. and Morgan 
Stanley & Co. International Limited (collectively, ""Morgan"").  We have an 
agreed form of Customer Agreement with Morgan which has been easy to 
duplicate for additional affiliates of ENA.  Also, we screen all agreements 
through credit and risk control (since our resolutions for opening brokerage 
accounts require dual signatures from both the Enron affiliate and risk 
control).

I don't know what your procedure is in London but let me know if we can be of 
any assistance.  Theresa is holding the docs until I hear back from you.

Thanks.  Sara

Please run the due diligence on Oregon Steel Mills.  We're looking at

We met with OSM and have another meeting scheduled for tomorrow to discuss 
proposed structures hopefully to be followed by specific pricing.  We're 
talking average monthly volumes of 7,300-7,500 MMBTU for approximately 6-8 
months at a price around $10/MMBTU.  I'm sending you this as a ""reminder"", as 
if and when we're able to agree upon pricing and a proposed structure we'll 
need to ""paper"" it by weeks end.  At this time we could be going either 
physically or financially.  Thanks,  John

As you suggested, I have spoken with Tanya re. the Credit Support Annexe, & 
she will be sending you a worksheet. 

I have left messages with Teresa re. Mahonia docs. I would be grateful if you

Both ENA (rate) and Enron Corp.(equity forwards)  are seekig master

in June, 2000 and I will fax a copy to you separately.

(1)  With respect to the ENA master, is the ENA credit worksheet still

(2)  With respect to the Enron Corp. master (which will not have a CSA or an 
Enron Corp. guaranty), what cap should we request from Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter & Co.?  Should it be $25MM as requested in the ENA document?

Please let me know.  "

finalized its ISDA Master Agreement and CSA with MSCS.  ECCL is awaiting the 
ENE guaranty.  The lawyer is forwarding docs to me this morning and I

 Tanya, will you be handling credit for both ENA and ENE?  I would like to

you both when I receive.

Matt and Denis:

I spoke with Matthew Flett about an hour ago and he advised that 
EnronCredit.com Limited had finalized its ISDA.  I requested a copy burt he 
has not yet sent it over.  Both ENE and ENA want to execute masters with MSCS 
and we would like to work from your document.

Can you email me a copy?

Dear Sara,

Attached please find our response to the draft Amendment to the CSA
for the above-referenced Agreement.  You will note that I have added
some additional language which our Legal Dept. prefers to include in
Amendments, which I trust will be acceptable to you as well.  As
mentioned briefly over the telephone the other day, I have also
incorporated some changes with respect to Letter of Credit provisions.

The changes to the LC terms are those which our Credit Department is
requiring as a result of a review of Cargill's LC language.  The main
issue is that an LC issued as collateral can no longer be transferable.
I note from the file on our ISDA negotiations that Enron may have
preferred transferability in order to be able to transfer an LC to
its Affiliates.  If this is still the case, we can certainly discuss
options which may specify and limit transferability accordingly.

I look forward to your response at your earliest opportunity.

Regards,
Mara Alexander

Holli:

We need to talk about status.
I spoke yesterday with three EWEB lawyers and Dick Varner.
I have to comment back on the Schedule to the master agreement.  EWEB has not 
yet reviewed the Credit Support Annex and needs to submit their proposed 
legal opinion.  EWEB is reserving discussion of the confirmations pending 
resolution of the master agreement.

Most important, however, is the EWEB legal opinion which will be limited by 
the capacity of EWEB's traders to enter into financial trades at any given 
point in time.  EWEB is insisting that we assume the obligation of knowing 
whether an EWEB trader is authorized to act and how that EWEB trader is 
authorized to act under EWEB's trading policy because, under Oregon law (and 
the law of all states), financial trades executed by unauthorized persons 
(employed by governmental entities) are completely void.  

Your two trades (which began as physical deals and were transformed into 
financial deals) were authorized by EWEB's recent board resolution.  However, 
you cannot rely fully on this resolution for future trades.  Before you ever 
trade with EWEB again, you will not be able to rely upon your past 
relationship with an EWEB trader.  You will first have to conduct some due 
diligence with respect to the EWEB trader and the EWEB trading policy.

ENA has never agreed to this type of arrangement.

Let's schedule a time to discuss the agreement further.  Thanks.  Sara "

		 Subject: Alberta Gas Prepay and Assignment to BTM




As you are aware, we are finalizing the participation of Bank of 
Tokyo-Mitsubishi (BTM) into the Alberta Gas Prepay financing.? 

Recall there are three swaps:

(a) Commodity Swap between Enron Canada and RBC(b) Commodity Swap between 
Chase and RBC(c) Interest Rate Swap between Enron Canada and RBC

We will be participating BTM into the agreements to which Enron is party [(a) 
and (c) above].? As a result of this, Enron will not be re-signing any new 
ISDA's etc.?? However, Section 7 to the ISDA Master agreement governing 
Transfers requires the prior written consent for any transfer of ""any 
interest or obligation"" under the Agreement.? Our view is that the 
participation to BTM does qualify as a tranfer of an any ""interest or 
obligation"", ergo we need Enron's consent.? Attached please find a proposed 
Consent from Enron prepared by my lawyer.? This is the only document that we 
require signed by Enron.? Please take note of the key language contained 
therein:

??????? ""Enron hereby consents to RBC assigning a 50% participation interest 
in the Swap Documents to Bank of Tokyo-???? ?????? Mitsubishi, Ltd., New York 
Branch; provided that (a) RBC's rights and obligations under the Swap 
Documents shall remain ??????? unchanged, (b) RBC shall remain solely 
responsible to Enron for the performance of such obligations and (c) Enron 
shall ??????? continue to deal solely and directly with RBC in connection 
with RBC's rights and obligations under the Swap Documents.""

The commodity swap between Chase and RBC will be ""split"" and each of RBC and 
BTM will have a Swap with Chase for one-half the amount.

Sara(s), please advise whether you are comfortable with our approach and 
whether you require any changes to the Consent.? BTM has reviewed the 
Participation agreement and is moving forward to getting the doc's approved 
internally...we're targeting for a close mid next week (the week of Dec 11) 
and accordingly your execution of the Consent within that timeframe would be 
much appreciated.? Given that you continue to deal in all ways with RBC, I 
have not forwarded you a copy of the Participation agreement....

Thanks and have a good weekend!

I am attaching the following (see the Security Agreement Amendment) as an

		 Subject: Alberta Gas Prepay and Assignment to BTM




As you are aware, we are finalizing the participation of Bank of 
Tokyo-Mitsubishi (BTM) into the Alberta Gas Prepay financing.? 

Recall there are three swaps:

(a) Commodity Swap between Enron Canada and RBC(b) Commodity Swap between 
Chase and RBC(c) Interest Rate Swap between Enron Canada and RBC

We will be participating BTM into the agreements to which Enron is party [(a) 
and (c) above].? As a result of this, Enron will not be re-signing any new 
ISDA's etc.?? However, Section 7 to the ISDA Master agreement governing 
Transfers requires the prior written consent for any transfer of ""any 
interest or obligation"" under the Agreement.? Our view is that the 
participation to BTM does qualify as a tranfer of an any ""interest or 
obligation"", ergo we need Enron's consent.? Attached please find a proposed 
Consent from Enron prepared by my lawyer.? This is the only document that we 
require signed by Enron.? Please take note of the key language contained 
therein:

??????? ""Enron hereby consents to RBC assigning a 50% participation interest 
in the Swap Documents to Bank of Tokyo-???? ?????? Mitsubishi, Ltd., New York 
Branch; provided that (a) RBC's rights and obligations under the Swap 
Documents shall remain ??????? unchanged, (b) RBC shall remain solely 
responsible to Enron for the performance of such obligations and (c) Enron 
shall ??????? continue to deal solely and directly with RBC in connection 
with RBC's rights and obligations under the Swap Documents.""

The commodity swap between Chase and RBC will be ""split"" and each of RBC and 
BTM will have a Swap with Chase for one-half the amount.

Sara(s), please advise whether you are comfortable with our approach and 
whether you require any changes to the Consent.? BTM has reviewed the 
Participation agreement and is moving forward to getting the doc's approved 
internally...we're targeting for a close mid next week (the week of Dec 11) 
and accordingly your execution of the Consent within that timeframe would be 
much appreciated.? Given that you continue to deal in all ways with RBC, I 
have not forwarded you a copy of the Participation agreement....

Thanks and have a good weekend!

Many of you have been involved in recent efforts to either amend documents to 
provide for rehypothecation of securities or additional collateral 
arrangements, both resulting from cash constraints in the market. In that 
regard, it appears that our credit group will be very interested in accepting 
different forms of government obligations, including Treasury Bills, Treasury 
Notes and Treasury Bonds.  Our current version of Paragraph 13 does not have 
the ""choice"" for Eligible Collateral consisting of longer dated obligations 
such as Treasury Notes and Bonds; our earlier version did provide this 
option.  

LEGAL:  When preparing new master agreements, please be specific about credit 
requests to include securities and verify with credit the specific types of 
Eligible Collateral to be included in Paragraph 13. 

CREDIT:  When drafting credit worksheets, please be  specific when requesting 
types of Eligible Collateral other than cash.

We may consider amending Paragraph 13 again or adding additional forms of 
Eligible Collateral to Library Doc. "

		 Subject: Account set-up with Morgan Stanley

Jason,
 Below are the documents that need to be prepared by Enron Networks and 
forwarded to us so we can send them to the prime broker for set up of your 
account.

1. Prime Broker Agreement ( Request from Prime Broker)
2. Limited Partnership Agreement/ Corporate Resolution
3. Form W-9
4. Trading Authorization
5. Authorization to Transfer Funds

I have attached the Form W-9.  The rest of the documents need to be 
coordinated with Sara Shackleton, ENA legal because Enron already has a 
template for the rest.  Enron typically does not fill out the documents sent 
by the primebroker but prepare ones that they have created themselves which 
capture that same requirement.  Also before any trade is executed procedures 
outlined on the document I sent earlier must be followed.  You must be 
cleared by Donna Lowry in Compliance with regards to insider information and 
a signed DASH must be provided to the Equity Trading group before they can 
execute on your behalf.

Thanks,
Theresa"

Brant:

Please call me or schedule time to discuss Bridgeline (""CP"").  In particular, 
you should note the following:

(1)  CP requests cross default with US 100 million for ENA and US 20 million 
for itself.
(2)  Change in ownership as default trigger is different from your proposal.
(3)  CP requests US 15 million Enron Corp. guaranty and increases its 
guaranty cap to US 15 million
(4)  Docs to be delivered:  ONLY CP's guarantor to deliver annual 
unaudited/quarterly unaudited consolidated financials 
(5)  Review setoff (elimination of affiliates)
(6)  Review transfer because CP has a proposal for ENA
(7)  Change to collateral thresholds - bilateral US 15 million

Also, I think Susan verified with you that you did not intend to use a 
non-specific MAC (even though the credit worksheet is marked as such).  

I'll wait to hear from you.

With respect to the attached (internal) FX product for EOL, I just wanted to 
verify with you that internal counterparties should transact on EOL with:

(1)  RMT  (as principal for Houston FX desk)

(2)  EEFT as agent for RMT (as principal for London FX desk).  In this 
regard, was the services agreement between ENA and EEFT ever extended to 
include RMT for internal trades? 

(3)  Enron Japan Corp. (as principal for Tokyo FX desk)

There appears to be some confusion since our meeting of November 3.  Thanks.

Your summary is correct based on information to date (in this regard the 
agreement between ENA and EEFT still requires amendment in respect of RMT and 
I undertake to get this done). 

However, please note that there have been some last minute changes in the 
Japanese tax advice, received I understand only as of last night. Susan Musch 
will be following up on these changes at a meeting today with Sheila Glover 
and Darren Delage, and has undertaken to keep you appraised of the position. 
The effect of the change would be to permit RMT to be the principal for the 
Japanese FX desk, with a Japanese entity acting as agent to arrange the 
transactions. 

Best regards
Janine

Sara-

We had started an ISDA with this counterparty that was put on hold, but is 
now back on again.

The main issue was the change in ownership, which should be if AES Corp. 
fails to own 56.33% of Empresa Distribuidora de Energia Norte.

Let me know if there were any other issues with preparing this document.

Thank you,

Pat

As we discussed earlier today, Chris Foster is in the process of analyzing 
the economics of the proposed derivative structure to determine indicative 
price,term, etc., and Catalytica is considering whether the structure meets 
its requirements. The attached draft ECT/GE agreement should give you some 
useful background and other details about the transaction. Thanks for your 
assistance.

Subject: Pastoria - Revised Enron/GE Agreement

Attached is the latest revision of the agreement for your review and comment.

With regards to the Catalytica/Enron agreement, we are still working with 
Catalytica to come to agreement on an acceptable structure for both parties.  
However, the basic agreement as it stands is that we are working on a spark 
spread derivative structure which 'mimics' the macroeconomics of Pastoria as 
much as possible (e.g., 750 MW, local spot PX prices and gas price, etc.) but 
would not have any contractual link to the project.  Under this agreement, we 
would always have the right at any time to buy back the spread for 10 MMUSD, 
or exchange it for the XONON credit if we could not use it at Pastoria or at 
another Enron project.

We are working with the West desk to come up with a indicative price for such 
a spread so we can begin to craft an agreement which we can then pass on for 
your further review and comment.

Keep you posted...

Regards,

SUBJECT TO LEGAL AND CREDIT APPROVAL (as to a particular transaction), I have 
asked Dale Neuner on the ECT confirmation desk, to please forward to you a 
""suggested format"" for a pulp and paper confirmation.  Dale is an invaluable 
resource for these deals.  Not knowing anything further, I am uncertain as to 
whether this transaction will be documented on ECT's ""omnibus format"" or an 
""ISDA format"", so Dale will probably send the omnibus format.  Tanya Rohauer 
is the credit guru.  I will update our review of Brazilian counterparties to

Subject: MSA with TGS

Sara:

I just spoke with Rolo and he advised the ownership structure of 
Transportadora de Gas del Sur S.A. (TGS):

70% of TGS is owned by Compania de Inversiones de Energia S.A. (CIESA)
CIESA is owned 50% by Enron and 50% by Perez Companc.
In the corporate workbook the ownership structure of CIESA is outlined.  

The ownership structure of CIESA is somewhat complex and it appears that 
Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A. is the legal entity that owns the 
shares in CIESA.  

I am assuming the best way to structure the event of default is to say if 
Enron Corp. through its wholly-owned subsidiaries no longer owns 50% of CIESA 
and/or if CIESA no longer owns 70% of TGS then, a Change in Ownership Event 
of Default will have occurred.

Please let me know what you think of this.

Pat

Subject: Brazilian Regulations for Swaps & Prepays

Antonio Felix,

As Enron is finding several opportunities involving financial derivatives in 
Brazil, we would like to get from Tozzini Freire Law Firm a summarized but 
concise read on the ""cans and cannots"" of these type of transactions in 
Brazil. Here is my understanding of the regulations from the memo you have 
already sent to us regarding swaps and prepays as well as a list of the most 
common examples of deals that Enron would be encountering in the marketplace. 
I would appreciate if you could comment on what is written here and also add 
further information so Enron can have some sort of menu of deals of this 
nature that can be pursued. I would like to ask you to add your comment in 
this same message to make the review process a little easier. Thank you 
inadvance for your attention.

Swaps (Pulp & Paper, Petrochem, Power)

OTC Swaps

The Central Bank regulates swap transactions involving local financial 
institutions acting either as dealers for their own account or as 
intermediaries to the contracting parties. When the financial institutions 
act as intermediaries, the agreements are in fact private agreements 
negotiated by two non-financial companies, but become subject to the 
requirements and regulations normally applicable to swaps involving financial 
institutions. According to regulations currently in force, such swaps can 
relate to exchange rates, interest rates, gold and price indices.

All of the swap agreements involving financial institutions must be 
registered with CETIP or with another custody and clearing system authorized 
by the Central Bank or the CVM (Brazilian SEC). As a matter of practice, the 
agreements used by the banks that participate in the swap market do not 
follow a standard form, since normally each bank has a particular sample form 
with which it feels more comfortable.

Derivatives
In addition to exchange-traded derivatives and OTC swaps involving financial 
institutions, there is no legal impediment, in principle, to derivatives 
transactions being privately negotiated and entered into between two 
interested parties. As a general rule in Brazil, as long as no specific 
prohibition is found in the law, parties are free to negotiate agreements 
that best suit their interests.

International Hedge 
Central Bank regulations authorize that Brazilian companies enter into 
transactions abroad, either in exchanges or having a financial institution as 
their counterpart, to hedge against the fluctuation of interest rates, 
exchange rates or commodity prices in the international markets. 

Such hedge transactions must refer to payments in foreign currency scheduled 
to be made by or to the Brazilian company in respect of commercial or 
financial rights or obligations, or to payments in local currency arising out 
of certain financial obligations subject to the variation of exchange rates 
and payments relating to imports, exports or local transactions involving 
commodities priced according to their valuation in foreign exchanges. The 
commercial market exchange rates are applicable to foreign exchange 
agreements referring to remittances of currency in connection with hedge 
transactions.

When the underlying obligation/right is registered with the Central Bank, the 
corresponding hedge transaction must be informed to the Central Bank within 
10 days of its execution. When there is no registration with the Central 
Bank, the banks executing the foreign exchange agreements relating to the 
hedge transaction must verify the existence of the obligation/right being 
hedged.

Examples

Commodity swap between two Brazilian companies:
As per what has been said above, there is nothing that precludes Enron Brazil 
of entering into a swap with another Brazilian company regarding any 
commodity traded by Enron (Pulp, Paper, Petrochem products, Power, Gas). 
Enron does not need to be a financial institutions to provide swaps 
transactions. On the other hand, I am not sure yet on the following points: 
(1) Does such swap agreement should be registered with CETIP or any other 
clearing system to be valid under Brazilian regulations? (2) What are the 
taxes involved in a swap?

Commodity swap between a Brazilian company and an offshore company:
This kind of deal seems to be also available in the Brazilian market and the 
only difference from example 1 would be the fact that it must be registered 
with the Central Bank and it would involved transfer of foreign currency.

Commodity swap between two offshore companies but involving Brazilian exports:
I am not sure if Brazilian regulations would have anything to do with a 
transaction like this one. I would assume that a Brazilian exporter would 
sell to their offshore subsidiary and such subsidiary would sell to their end 
customer. Enron would step in and offer a swap agreement for the offshore 
subsidiary of the Brazilian company therefore Enron would not have any 
involvement with Brazilian regulations because it would not be dealing with 
Brazil. 


Prepays (Pulp & Paper, Petrochem, Power)

The regulations currently in force governing export prepayments, especially 
Central Bank of Brazil's Carta-Circular 2624, of February 14, 1996, establish 
that all repayments of principal under such transactions must necessarily be 
made by means of shipments of the relevant exported goods.  Carta-Circular 
2624 allows cash remittances abroad only in regard to payments of interest 
under the facility.  Therefore, it is not possible to structure a transaction 
where the repayment of principal will be made only in cash or where the 
borrower has the ability to choose between paying cash or exporting the goods.

A transaction that involves structuring a direct loan to the Brazilian 
company where the value of the principal of which would be tied to the price 
of the relevant commodity is very difficult to be approved.  Under a direct 
loan registered with the Central Bank the borrower may remit all due amounts 
of principal and interest in accordance with the schedule of payments 
attached to the certificate of registration. The problem with such 
alternative is that, although there are no express regulations preventing it 
to do so, the Central Bank will most probably not issue a prior authorization 
for such type of loan, as it only normally issues authorizations for normal 
loans where the principal is a fixed amount and the interest rate is either a 
fixed rate or a floating rate (normally based on LIBOR or US Treasury).  It 
should also be noted that generally speaking all interest payments under such 
an agreement are subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% p.a.

CC 5 Account

A possible alternative way to structure a prepay would be by using a 
non-registered loan with the Central Bank.  Under such alternative, the funds 
disbursed by Enron under the loan would be remitted to Brazil through an 
international transfer of Brazilian currency, as allowed by Circular 2677 of 
the Central Bank of Brazil. The international transfer of Brazilian currency 
(""International Transfer"") is a system which uses a non-resident current 
account in Brazil and the Brazilian interbank foreign exchange market to 
effect remittances of funds to and from Brazil.  Under such system, a lender 
that wishes to disburse funds to a Brazilian borrower makes a foreign 
currency deposit with a bank located outside of Brazil (""offshore bank"")  and 
instructs the offshore bank to deliver such dollars to a Brazilian bank in 
exchange for Brazilian currency.  Such Brazilian currency is then deposited 
in a non-resident account held by the offshore bank in Brazil and thereafter 
transferred to the borrower. The repayments follow the inverse procedure, 
i.e. the borrower deposits the amount in a non-resident account of an 
offshore bank and instructs it to exchange the funds into foreign currency 
and deliver them to the lender abroad.

The main differences between the registered loans and the non-registered 
loans are that the non-registered loans are not subject to prior approval by 
the Central Bank of Brazil (and therefore not subject to scrutiny as to their 
minimum tenors and applicable interest rates) and the applicable foreign 
exchange rate to non-registered loans is the floating rate (as opposed to the 
commercial rate of exchange). All transfers of funds to Brazil as 
International Transfers are subject to a Financial Transactions Tax (""IOF"") 
at the rate of 2% on the amount transferred, plus a bank fee that normally 
ranges from 0.4% to 0.6% of such amount.  Any interest payments under a 
non-registered loan are subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% (or 25% 
if the lender is located in a tax-haven jurisdiction).

I don't think this type of transaction is the best way to circumvent some of 
the Brazilian regulations regarding prepayment given the bad press that deals 
via the CC 5 Account mechanism would bring to Enron but I have it addressed 
just in case someone does not share the same opinion. 

Examples

Financial prepay between two Brazilian companies
Not allowed unless the company providing the prepay qualifies as a financial 
institution as per Brazilian law. Since it will not be the case in Enron's 
cases, we should not focus in these kind of transactions.

Financial prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company
As it has been mentioned before it is allowed as long as Enron can structure 
the prepay in way where there is a pre-established amortization schedule for 
principal and interest. It is very hard to structure a prepay with specific 
split between principal and interest because the objective of the prepay is 
to lock on a certain volume of a product and not on a specific price. 
Therefore, if Enron prepays for a specific product on a floating basis the 
attached value of that commodity can go up or down as the market fluctuates 
as well as the total value associate to the deal. Such value can be either 
principal or interest and it is impossible to determine what it will be.

Financial prepay between two offshore companies but one being a subsidiary of 
a Brazilian entity
I think there is no restrictions in this case given the whole deal will be 
closed offshore and the Brazilian authorities are not going to be involved. 
It will most likely be a deal involving three parties: a company in Brazil, 
its offshore subsidiary and Enron.

Physical prepay between two Brazilian companies
No restrictions.

Physical prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company
No restrictions as long as there is physical deliveries.

Physical prepay between two offshore companies but  involving Brazilian 
exports
No restrictions. It would also involve three parties: a company in Brazil, 
its offshore subsidiary and Enron.

Thanks,

Gustavo

Subject: MSA with TGS

Sara:

I just spoke with Rolo and he advised the ownership structure of 
Transportadora de Gas del Sur S.A. (TGS):

70% of TGS is owned by Compania de Inversiones de Energia S.A. (CIESA)
CIESA is owned 50% by Enron and 50% by Perez Companc.
In the corporate workbook the ownership structure of CIESA is outlined.  

The ownership structure of CIESA is somewhat complex and it appears that 
Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A. is the legal entity that owns the 
shares in CIESA.  

I am assuming the best way to structure the event of default is to say if 
Enron Corp. through its wholly-owned subsidiaries no longer owns 50% of CIESA 
and/or if CIESA no longer owns 70% of TGS then, a Change in Ownership Event 
of Default will have occurred.

Please let me know what you think of this.

Regards,

Pat

Pat,

Yetserday we had a meeting with TGS. We agreed to put an MSA in place to 
start hedging LPG. They are very interested in doing business with us, so I 
suggest we go ahead preparing the MSA.
Do you need TGS financial's or you already have them? Do you need anything 
else?

swaps and derivatives.  I e-mailed Michael about this attachment and I think 
his response was that Antonio Felix ADDED comments to the attachment.  I am 
not clear.  I am aware of only TWO Tozzini memos :  dated 12/26/97 (physical

Subject: Brazilian Regulations for Swaps & Prepays

Antonio Felix,

As Enron is finding several opportunities involving financial derivatives in 
Brazil, we would like to get from Tozzini Freire Law Firm a summarized but 
concise read on the ""cans and cannots"" of these type of transactions in 
Brazil. Here is my understanding of the regulations from the memo you have 
already sent to us regarding swaps and prepays as well as a list of the most 
common examples of deals that Enron would be encountering in the marketplace. 
I would appreciate if you could comment on what is written here and also add 
further information so Enron can have some sort of menu of deals of this 
nature that can be pursued. I would like to ask you to add your comment in 
this same message to make the review process a little easier. Thank you 
inadvance for your attention.

Swaps (Pulp & Paper, Petrochem, Power)

OTC Swaps

The Central Bank regulates swap transactions involving local financial 
institutions acting either as dealers for their own account or as 
intermediaries to the contracting parties. When the financial institutions 
act as intermediaries, the agreements are in fact private agreements 
negotiated by two non-financial companies, but become subject to the 
requirements and regulations normally applicable to swaps involving financial 
institutions. According to regulations currently in force, such swaps can 
relate to exchange rates, interest rates, gold and price indices.

All of the swap agreements involving financial institutions must be 
registered with CETIP or with another custody and clearing system authorized 
by the Central Bank or the CVM (Brazilian SEC). As a matter of practice, the 
agreements used by the banks that participate in the swap market do not 
follow a standard form, since normally each bank has a particular sample form 
with which it feels more comfortable.

Derivatives
In addition to exchange-traded derivatives and OTC swaps involving financial 
institutions, there is no legal impediment, in principle, to derivatives 
transactions being privately negotiated and entered into between two 
interested parties. As a general rule in Brazil, as long as no specific 
prohibition is found in the law, parties are free to negotiate agreements 
that best suit their interests.

International Hedge 
Central Bank regulations authorize that Brazilian companies enter into 
transactions abroad, either in exchanges or having a financial institution as 
their counterpart, to hedge against the fluctuation of interest rates, 
exchange rates or commodity prices in the international markets. 

Such hedge transactions must refer to payments in foreign currency scheduled 
to be made by or to the Brazilian company in respect of commercial or 
financial rights or obligations, or to payments in local currency arising out 
of certain financial obligations subject to the variation of exchange rates 
and payments relating to imports, exports or local transactions involving 
commodities priced according to their valuation in foreign exchanges. The 
commercial market exchange rates are applicable to foreign exchange 
agreements referring to remittances of currency in connection with hedge 
transactions.

When the underlying obligation/right is registered with the Central Bank, the 
corresponding hedge transaction must be informed to the Central Bank within 
10 days of its execution. When there is no registration with the Central 
Bank, the banks executing the foreign exchange agreements relating to the 
hedge transaction must verify the existence of the obligation/right being 
hedged.

Examples

Commodity swap between two Brazilian companies:
As per what has been said above, there is nothing that precludes Enron Brazil 
of entering into a swap with another Brazilian company regarding any 
commodity traded by Enron (Pulp, Paper, Petrochem products, Power, Gas). 
Enron does not need to be a financial institutions to provide swaps 
transactions. On the other hand, I am not sure yet on the following points: 
(1) Does such swap agreement should be registered with CETIP or any other 
clearing system to be valid under Brazilian regulations? (2) What are the 
taxes involved in a swap?

Commodity swap between a Brazilian company and an offshore company:
This kind of deal seems to be also available in the Brazilian market and the 
only difference from example 1 would be the fact that it must be registered 
with the Central Bank and it would involved transfer of foreign currency.

Commodity swap between two offshore companies but involving Brazilian exports:
I am not sure if Brazilian regulations would have anything to do with a 
transaction like this one. I would assume that a Brazilian exporter would 
sell to their offshore subsidiary and such subsidiary would sell to their end 
customer. Enron would step in and offer a swap agreement for the offshore 
subsidiary of the Brazilian company therefore Enron would not have any 
involvement with Brazilian regulations because it would not be dealing with 
Brazil. 


Prepays (Pulp & Paper, Petrochem, Power)

The regulations currently in force governing export prepayments, especially 
Central Bank of Brazil's Carta-Circular 2624, of February 14, 1996, establish 
that all repayments of principal under such transactions must necessarily be 
made by means of shipments of the relevant exported goods.  Carta-Circular 
2624 allows cash remittances abroad only in regard to payments of interest 
under the facility.  Therefore, it is not possible to structure a transaction 
where the repayment of principal will be made only in cash or where the 
borrower has the ability to choose between paying cash or exporting the goods.

A transaction that involves structuring a direct loan to the Brazilian 
company where the value of the principal of which would be tied to the price 
of the relevant commodity is very difficult to be approved.  Under a direct 
loan registered with the Central Bank the borrower may remit all due amounts 
of principal and interest in accordance with the schedule of payments 
attached to the certificate of registration. The problem with such 
alternative is that, although there are no express regulations preventing it 
to do so, the Central Bank will most probably not issue a prior authorization 
for such type of loan, as it only normally issues authorizations for normal 
loans where the principal is a fixed amount and the interest rate is either a 
fixed rate or a floating rate (normally based on LIBOR or US Treasury).  It 
should also be noted that generally speaking all interest payments under such 
an agreement are subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% p.a.

CC 5 Account

A possible alternative way to structure a prepay would be by using a 
non-registered loan with the Central Bank.  Under such alternative, the funds 
disbursed by Enron under the loan would be remitted to Brazil through an 
international transfer of Brazilian currency, as allowed by Circular 2677 of 
the Central Bank of Brazil. The international transfer of Brazilian currency 
(""International Transfer"") is a system which uses a non-resident current 
account in Brazil and the Brazilian interbank foreign exchange market to 
effect remittances of funds to and from Brazil.  Under such system, a lender 
that wishes to disburse funds to a Brazilian borrower makes a foreign 
currency deposit with a bank located outside of Brazil (""offshore bank"")  and 
instructs the offshore bank to deliver such dollars to a Brazilian bank in 
exchange for Brazilian currency.  Such Brazilian currency is then deposited 
in a non-resident account held by the offshore bank in Brazil and thereafter 
transferred to the borrower. The repayments follow the inverse procedure, 
i.e. the borrower deposits the amount in a non-resident account of an 
offshore bank and instructs it to exchange the funds into foreign currency 
and deliver them to the lender abroad.

The main differences between the registered loans and the non-registered 
loans are that the non-registered loans are not subject to prior approval by 
the Central Bank of Brazil (and therefore not subject to scrutiny as to their 
minimum tenors and applicable interest rates) and the applicable foreign 
exchange rate to non-registered loans is the floating rate (as opposed to the 
commercial rate of exchange). All transfers of funds to Brazil as 
International Transfers are subject to a Financial Transactions Tax (""IOF"") 
at the rate of 2% on the amount transferred, plus a bank fee that normally 
ranges from 0.4% to 0.6% of such amount.  Any interest payments under a 
non-registered loan are subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% (or 25% 
if the lender is located in a tax-haven jurisdiction).

I don't think this type of transaction is the best way to circumvent some of 
the Brazilian regulations regarding prepayment given the bad press that deals 
via the CC 5 Account mechanism would bring to Enron but I have it addressed 
just in case someone does not share the same opinion. 

Examples

Financial prepay between two Brazilian companies
Not allowed unless the company providing the prepay qualifies as a financial 
institution as per Brazilian law. Since it will not be the case in Enron's 
cases, we should not focus in these kind of transactions.

Financial prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company
As it has been mentioned before it is allowed as long as Enron can structure 
the prepay in way where there is a pre-established amortization schedule for 
principal and interest. It is very hard to structure a prepay with specific 
split between principal and interest because the objective of the prepay is 
to lock on a certain volume of a product and not on a specific price. 
Therefore, if Enron prepays for a specific product on a floating basis the 
attached value of that commodity can go up or down as the market fluctuates 
as well as the total value associate to the deal. Such value can be either 
principal or interest and it is impossible to determine what it will be.

Financial prepay between two offshore companies but one being a subsidiary of 
a Brazilian entity
I think there is no restrictions in this case given the whole deal will be 
closed offshore and the Brazilian authorities are not going to be involved. 
It will most likely be a deal involving three parties: a company in Brazil, 
its offshore subsidiary and Enron.

Physical prepay between two Brazilian companies
No restrictions.

Physical prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company
No restrictions as long as there is physical deliveries.

Physical prepay between two offshore companies but  involving Brazilian 
exports
No restrictions. It would also involve three parties: a company in Brazil, 
its offshore subsidiary and Enron.

Thanks,

Gustavo

 During   the  construction of the clerical area the clerks will do their 
best to continue to function in a normal manner.  The fax machines will be 
located in EB3837A  (cubicle area in front of Suzanne Adams).    There should 
be no interruptions in the fax lines per the Telephony Services.  Office 
supplies will also be boxed and stored in various areas throughout the 
floor.  There will be 2  phones  and computers available to the clerks.  
Reginald will be located at EB3808B x39288 and Tim and Kenneth will be 
located at EB3808B x31459.

 This may  cause time delays on various functions of the clerks:

Faxes being sent, received, copied and delivered in a timely manner;
ASAP deliveries/pickups/courier outgoing/incoming/scheduled and unscheduled 
daily runs to Allen Center;
Telephone accessibility will be limited;
Space preparation for large ASAP copy jobs;
Availability of clerks when needed;
Accessibility/ordering of office supplies; 
Mail being sorted and distributed in a timely manner.


 This will begin today Wednesday,  August 24th, and probably will not be 
finished until Wednesday,  September 1st.   We apologize for  any  
inconvenience this may cause.

Under separate cover, I am faxing to you a copy of a ""Table of Contents"" for 
a collection of memoranda on various Brazilian issues (physical trading, 
derivatives, tax, etc. which I have copies of.  I have also received from you 
this morning the response of Antonio Felix et al to the inquiry of Gustavo 
Junqueira.  It will become increasingly difficult to monitor our progress 
with the Tozzini firm if the business people have direct contact with Tozzini 
and bypass the Enron lawyers.  We will not be able to compile a comprehensive 
review and the requests will become disorganized.  Requests for legal 
research by Tozzini should originate with the Enron lawyers and be addressed 
to the Enron lawyers.  We can then discuss conclusions with our business 
people (and even meet together with Tozzini).  I hope that you concur with 
this procedure.  If you do, I think that it would be more appropriate for you 
to contact the Tozzini firm to convey the message (and also to our business 
people).

Please call me when you are back in the Sao Paulo office if you have any 
questions.

P.S.  I will prepare for you the ""mini-book"" containing the memoranda 
referenced above.

Just got off the phone with the lawyer.  We have only minor comments and he 
needs to check with his credit people regarding the collateral threshold.  I 
will wait to hear back before sending out a revision.  Sara

Sara,

I hope you have now received instructions from your commercial swaps team to 
put together an ISDA  currency swap and confirm which ECT Corp will be 
providing to either Enron Europe Power 3 Limited or a subsidiary of that 
company. The subsidiary will be receiving dollars under a bond issue and 
paying pounds out (a spot transaction I believe) but will then receive pounds 
income which it will need to convert to dollars to pay interest on the bonds.

The precedent document is the Sutton Bridge currency swap.

Can you please confirm you have been instructed and let us know your timing 
for issuing a document.  The sooner we can see this next week the better.

The bond trustee will as usual require the swap to be backed with legal 
opinions from Enron in-house counsel (Mark Haedicke) re due execution and 
from V&E (Terry Yates) re enforceability. My understanding is that the swap 
will not be guaranteed by Corp (correct Julian?).

Linklaters are representing Enron - Julian Davies and Fran Xavier (tel: 171 
456 2000). Could you please send them your fax, telephone and email details. 
Linklaters have kindly agreed to prepare a first draft of the Mark Haedicke 
opinion and to send it out to you Sara.

Thank  you. I look forward to hearing from you.


     Mark

I've finally finished my two-year project of replacing most of my landscaping

everything looks great on the weekends.

I'm dying under a load of work here but I know better than to complain too

individuals in confirms.  I need to speak with you about the ISDA, omnibus 
and industrial master templates under revision and whether the drafted 
language conforms to your proposal.  In that regard, you may recall that swap 
templates were given to you several months ago.  The legal group is

Thanks.  When you have Annex A ready, we'll have to tweak Annex B.  For 
example, I think we eliminated the term ""Derivative Transactions"" in Annex A 
(but it shows up in the Catalytica Annex B).  Bart Clark is the lawyer who is

A copy of the 8/31/99 letter from Erik Ludtke was received at 18:10 on fax 
no. ""713 646 4818"" addressed to the attention of ""Assistant General 
Counsel"".  This would conform to notices in the master agreement (for 
Sections 5 and 6), an executed copy of which we have never received or seen.  

On a different matter, do you think that we can discuss the omnibus templates 
tomorrow?  I am pressed for a response.  SS"

Irene:  Due to the lateness of  discussions at Enron Capital & Trade 
Resources Corp., I did not send any documents to you this evening.  However, 
I do have two different sets of drafts to send to you in the morning.  I have 
an ISDA without an annex (collateral built into the Schedule) and an ISDA 
with an annex.  We have had discussions regarding the use of Letters of 
Credit and Surety Bonds as acceptable forms of collateral and I may need some 
additional time to resolve the issues.  

I will contact you early tomorrow to deliver docs and establish a timeline

time period before which a Market Disruption Event will kick in.:

Postponement:  For the purposes of the definition of ""Price Source 
Disruption,"" as set forth in Section 7.4(c)(i) of the Commodity Definitions,
   the Maximum Days of Disruption shall be [thirty-two/sixty-four] days after 
the last date of publication of World Pulp Monthly,
   or any successor publication, published by Resource Information Systems,

The meeting is on our calendars for 9:30 am 9/3/99.  Let's talk about the 
NYMEX hedge exemption/position limits process and the reasons why you need 
attorney backup when Mark is unavailable.  Also, highlighting specific NYMEX 
rules and regulations/Enron trading policy issues for me would be helpful.  I 
am only looking for broad oversight.  We can meet with Mark when he returns 
(and have Taffy put us on Mark's calendar). Thanks.  Sara

I am still trying to resolve the question of who will advise you on the 
consulting and other agreements.  In the meantime, I have attached a form 
which you can use to create a report for your group.  This would be quite 
helpful to the lawyers in staffing the group more efficiently.  SS

Sorry for the delay.

Here are the next four descriptions.



Only the three liquids one waiting now.

I have sent these to David Forster in our Project group to review first 
before I send them to yourself.  If I don't get them back today I will send 
them over the weekend so they are there for you on Monday.

Could you please send me comments back on all the other descriptions today.  
Is your fax machine at your end OK?  It's just that the other fax you sent 
came through a dark background making the comments a little hard to read.

My fax is 44 171 316 5420.

I have forwarded the descriptions you have sent us thus far to the respective

the descriptions.  I understand your deadline is the end of the week.

When can I expect the remaining descriptions?

Please review the attached ""paper & pulp"" doc for accuracy.  I've already 
marked the doc for accuracy (as far as I can tell) but I don't know if the 
general statements are accurate.  Please coordinate through Tana Jones.  I do 
not know who wrote the document, but I presume it was someone in London.  Sara

Mark Taylor has asked me to forward the attached email to each of you.  Per 
Mark's direction and the email, we need to sign off, from a Legal (not 
business) perspective only, on the attached descriptions of the 12 product 
areas to be traded online.  So far we have only received 5 of the referenced 
12 descriptions.  I will forward the additional descriptions to the relevant 
Legal group when I receive them.  Per the attached email, Awais needs our 
Legal sign off by Friday.

I understand Alan may be out for the rest of the week so the attached 
descriptions on Coal, SO2 and NOX will need to be approved by someone else in 
his group.  I'm not sure who that would be.  Could you let me know?  Mark 
asked if Shari and Sara could sign off on the weather and pulp & paper 
description for our group.

Thanks for your help!

Tana,

I am afraid there is more than one description.  Some are quite lengthy,  US 
West Power (11 Pages) and US Natural Gas (5 pages).  There is a quite urgent 
deadline to get these uploaded into the web pages and then integrated into 
the site by the end of this week.  So any comments you can provide ASAP would 
be much appreciated.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to phone, or email me.  Tel 
no: 44 171 970 7377.

Thanks

Steven & Carol,

I am working for Louise Kitchen on the EnronOnline project.  As part of the 
site we are incorporating market descriptions of all the main market that we 
will be trading on the system to give users some general information.

I have collected and rewritten these into a standard format and am currently 
in the process of obtaining Legal and regulatory approval of these 
descriptions that will be visible to anyone on the web.

In Total there are 12 descriptions covering North Amercia.  These are listed 
below.

Canada Gas
LPG
NOx Emissions
Oil & Oil products
Plastics and Petrochemicals
Pulp & Paper
SO2 Emissions
US Coal
US Natural Gas
US East Power
US West Power
Weather Derivatives

I have below the completed descriptions to date.  Please could you pass to 
the respective people in your groups for their review and comments.  I would 
appreciate it if you could provide your comments as soonas possible as these 
have to be approved and loaded into the web site this week.  

Below are 5 of the descriptions.  I shall send the remainder to yourselves 
tomorrow.



If you have any questions my telephone number in London is  44 171 970 7377.

Thanks

Awais

You will have our comments on the ISDA before Sept 10.  In fact not much has
changed  at the documentation level.

I would be most pleased to meet with you.  Should you have time let's also
squeeze a lunch or a diner in your busy agenda.

 In regards to this trade, I talked with the trader, Randy Degner, about 
their confirmation.  He is in agreement on using our omnibus confirm since 
their confirmation was incorrect as far as referencing a Master Agreement .  
He would like to see if someone can speak with JoAnn Goza (316) 828-7169 in 
their Wichita office to establish a Master Agreement between KCI and ECT.

Thanks

Our internal phone and voice mail system is all screwed up.  Is 3pm Houston 
(5pm BA) today too late for you to discuss omnibus?
I haven't heard a word from Richard.  Scott Neal left a message about the 
Friday letter.
Also, Bruce Harris called this morning about the issue of Elektro trading 
(Hickerson desk).  I am hoping that Antonio Felix can talk to me sometime on 
Wednesday.  He's then out for the rest of the week.  Coordination is getting 
complicated.  I'm supposed to get my visa today (so I can leave anytime).  
Talk to you soon.  SS

London traders are transacting from London in the names of both ECT(Houston) 
and ECTRIC(London) with DAPSA and Sempra.  The deal tickets are still being 
sent to Houston for confirmation preparation (rather than from London where 
the trade is actually consummated).  With respect to Sempra, we were 
previously advised that Sempra would not transact directly with ECTRIC absent 
a Master but this cannot be accurate because some Sempra deal tickets recite 
ECTRIC's name.    

This message is FYI if there are no regulatory issues involved.

Houston will certainly document back-to-back internal transactions.

Subject: Tiger ISDA Docs faxed to you last night

Joseph Manogue at Tiger called me last night to say he had finally reviewed 
the draft ISDA doc with all agreed changes put in and lined from original. He 
faxed it to you and will have the original Fedexed overnight. Hope you'll 
have time to review it today.

S&S has again asked about the gtee and l/c wording. They do not have anything 
from us in writing confirming the agreed changes. Joe asked that you fax the 
revised gtee wording that has been agreed (I believe it was our agreeing to 
reduce the claim period from 15 days down to 5) and the new l/c wording 
(drops the 2 day period to replace an l/c with a different bank if the first 
refuses to pay). I know we talked about these issues earlier, but Tiger's 
lawyers want to get everything agreed in writing now so final docs can be 
issued for signing, even if we are the one's issuing the gtee and l/c.

Thanks! Call if you have questions or if I can be of any help. There is an 
outside chance we could have everything set to go this week.

With best regards,
Per

I would like the credit group to respond to the following:

1.  What person in credit is the initial contact for the preparation of 
credit worksheets for structured transactions?  How can we insure that the 
process will run smoothly?

2.  Can we (credit and legal) schedule a meeting with a trader to walk 
through the actual termination amout calculation process?

3.  With respect to L/C's, does credit review incoming L/C's for content?  If 
not, we need to establish a procedure?

The Alley is NOT holding any tickets for me.  All I want to know is whether 
""McKeogh"" at ""713-664-3207"" has a ticket for a performance on Friday, March 3 
since I do not have the tickets in front of me.  They should be able to tell 
you or just email the Box Office phone number to me. Also, I can't do 
anything about flights until I return to Houston on Monday.  Thanks.  SS

I've called the Alley Theatre.  They wanted to know when the tickets were 
purchased, if they were purchased with a credit card, was a confirmation 
number given at the end of the transaction and were they for Hay Fever?  
Since I didn't know the answer to any of his questions, I said ""Can you just 
check to see if there are any tickets waiting to be picked up for McKeogh"".  
He said there were not any tickets to be picked up for McKeogh for Hay Fever 
on March 3.  He acted like there is more than one production being done.

Greetings!  I hope that we can make certain plans to meet when I am in Sao 
Paulo and to have a telephone conversation this week.

I will arrive in Sao Paulo on Sunday, Sept. 19.  Andrea Bertone and I will be 
meeting with Jose Emilio on Monday, Sept. 20. regarding physical trading 
matters.  Would you be able to meet with me at Enron's office on either 
Tuesday or Wednesday, Sept. 21 (preferably) or Sept. 22 to discuss certain 
aspects of financial trading?  I will be able to clarify the specific issues 
this week.  I would also like to schedule a telephone call this week, say 
Wednesday or Thursday to discuss.  Please e-mail me as to whether we can meet 
in Sao Paulo.  I will try to call you today.  Let me know if you have a 
convenient time.  

Sara

Thank you for the message!  Let's schedule the following:
(1)  Phone call on Thursday, Sept. 16 to discuss parameters for financial 
trading discussion.  I can call you at 1 pm (Houston time) which is 3 pm (Sao 
Paulo time).

(2)  Meeting in Enron's Sao Paulo office on Tuesday, Sept. 21 in the 
morning.  Anytime is convenient for me.  Do you have a preference?  How about 
9 am?

I will not need to call you today if we can schedule our conference call and 
meeting in Sao Paulo via e-mail.  Thank you for responding promptly.  
Regards.  Sara

Dear Sara:

We can meet either on the 21 or 22.  As to our prior telephone call, please 
be advised that I will be out of the office on Tuesday and Wednesday.  
Probably the best alternative is for you to call me on Thursday afternoon.

Best regards,

Antonio Felix

Stewart needs help with yet another ISDA situation.  It's gotten to the point 
where he's such an ISDA advocate that we are going to have to consider 
nominating him for Legal's prestigious  ""Best With Legal Paper""  annual 
award.  Let me know if I can help in any way with this.--cgy

Sorry this has taken so long, however we have a copy of a draft ISDA that
our legal folks have developed. I would appreciate Enron's comments
regarding this, so if you could, please pass this on to the appropriate

MEeting on the 23rd at your convenience is fine.  24th would be OK also in
the afternoon.


You should have received a fax with the comments on the ISDA. I will fax the
article.  Surprisingly enough it was on word, so you should have been able
to open it.
Best regards.

Hello!  I'll be visiting the Sao Paulo office next week to discuss physical 
and financial trading issues with Tozzini lawyers.  This time, I'll arrive 
on  the weekend and hopefully beat any new hurricanes!  Andrea and I have 
confirmed our meeting throughout the day Monday to discuss documentation for 
physical power transactions.  I'll be reviewing financial trading issues 
during the remaining period.  Thus far, reviews are preliminary in nature.  
I'll be flying to Buenos Aires Wednesday evening.  I hope you'll be in the 
office so that we can meet.  I look forward to seeing you again.  Sara"

Sheila -

Attached are my comments to the Enron Corp. Guaranty.  The form you prepared
did not include the revisions proposed in the last round of ISDA Guaranty
negotiations which were agreed to by Sara Shackleton, and I have added them
in the attached marked draft.

Also, you will note that in our earlier discussions last week North Shore
Gas contracts were not addressed, and I have attempted to do so here.

We are still looking at the issue of whether specific designation of the New
York ""Commercial Division"" for state courts is acceptable, and expect to
have an answer tomorrow morning.  Also, I have added some additional
language more typical of an exclusive jurisdiction clause generally.

No one else at Peoples has seen these comments, so they remain subject to
further change.

Pleae call me if you wish to discuss (312-240-4413).

Market News

Equity markets were lower across the board amid fears of higher
inflation today.  The U.S.  Department of Labor reported that April's
Consumer Price Index (CPI) was up .7%, its largest gain since October
of 1990.  That news led to a market sell-off, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average closing down 193.87 (-1.75%) to 10913.32, the S&P
500 falling 29.76 (-2.18%) to 1337.8, and the Nasdaq dropping 54.14
(-2.10%) to 2527.86.  The 30 year bond was up .17 to 5.911.

Financial stocks were hit hard today.  JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) slid 5
13/16 to 140 15/16, American Express (NYSE:AXP) dropped 4 to 120 3/4,
and Citigroup (NYSE:C) fell 2 7/16 to 71.  Tech bellwethers were also
lower, with America Online (NYSE:AOL) down 6 3/4 to 125 7/8 and Intel
Corp.  (Nasdaq:INTC) down 2 1/16 to 58.

AtHome (Nasdaq:ATHM) withstood the market slide and closed up 13/16 to
150 1/8 and was as high as 156 1/2 Friday.  The Wall Street Journal
reported that Microsoft (Nasdaq:MSFT) will contribute about $5 million
to AtHome Solutions, a private venture that helps smaller cable
companies bring internet access to their users.  Microsoft lost 2 1/4
and closed at 76 7/8.

Go2Net (Nasdaq:GNET) was up 2 1/8 to 127 3/16 after announcing that it
will purchase IQC.com, an equity tracking service, for $20 million in
stock.  Go2Net said that it plans to integrate IQC's content into its
Silicon Investor web site.

Oracle (Nasdaq:ORCL) was up 3.8% (up 7/8) to 23 7/8 after the company
reassured analysts at a meeting yesterday; Prudential Securities
upgraded the database company from accumulate to strong buy.

Dell Computer (Nasdaq:DELL) slid 4.77% (down 2 1/16) to 41 3/16 after
Paine Webber downgraded the direct computer maker to neutral from
attractive.  Dell reports earnings next Tuesday after the closing
bell; the First Call consensus estimate is 16 cents per share.

Motorola (NYSE:MOT) fell 3.07% (down 2 5/8) to 82 7/8 even after an
upgrade from BT Alex.  Brown from buy to strong buy, along with a
12-month price target of $100.

ING Baring initiated coverage on Micron Technology (NYSE:MU) with a
hold rating, saying that manufacturing costs may not decline quickly
enough to keep pace with declining DRAM prices.  Micron was off 5/8 to
36 15/16.

On the data networking front, shares of 3Com (Nasdaq:COMS) were up
7.29% (up 1 15/16) to 28 1/2 on speculation that the company may be
purchased by either Lucent Technologies (NYSE:LU) or Ericsson
(Nasdaq:ERICY).  Lucent was off 2 9/16 to 58 7/16; Ericsson was off 1
3/16 to 26 7/8.  3Com's competitor Cisco Systems (Nasdaq:CSCO) fell 2
1/4 to 115 7/16.

Global Crossing (Nasdaq:GBLX) was up 2.29% (up 1 3/8) to 61 3/8 after
CNBC's David Faber broke a story that the company may combine, in a
merger of equals, with regional bell US West (NYSE:USW), which closed
up 2 1/4 to 62 1/4.  Faber also reported that Frontier Corp.
(NYSE:FRO), a company that Global Crossing is in the process of
purchasing, is supportive of the merger.  Frontier closed down 4.67%
(down 2 3/4) to 56 1/8.

IPO News

Despite the heavy new issue supply and weak market conditions,
internet IPOs continue to outperform.  Investors continue to bid up
shares of well-known brand names, first movers, and any high-speed
internet related issues.  Both Nextcard (Nasdaq:NXCD), which offers
online credit cards, and Copper Mountain (Nasdaq:CMTN), which provides
high-speed internet connections, performed well on their first trading
days.  In contrast, Intelligent Life, which provides financial content
through its website Bankrate.com, failed to impress investors, closing
its first trading day unchanged from its offering price.  Apparently,
investors were not aware of Intelligent Life's internet business due
to the lack of media coverage or a "".com"" in its name.

conducting business and procedure for implementation.  I hope to narrow the 
focus of the legal review, identify other issues and will ask that legal fees 
be broken out by product.  On Tuesday, Sept 21, I will meet with Antonio 
Felix at Enron's offices in Sao Paulo at 9 am.  Everyone is welcome to join 
me for both the conference call and meeting in Sao Paulo.  Please let me know 
if you would like to participate.  Thanks.  Sara  "

Have you decided who will be assisting tax-wise for these two countries?

I have a conference call this afternoon at 3 pm (Houston time) with Antonio 
Felix de Araujo Cintra from the Tozzini firm regarding further research on 
derivative products for trading in Brazil.  Attached is a summary of products 
and the various Enron groups seeking answers.  If you would like to

I will be in Sao Paulo from Sept 20-22 and Buenos Aires from Sept 23-24.  In 
Brazil, I will be meeting again with Tozzini lawyers.  In BA, I'll be meeting 
with Marval lawyers.  Let me know if you would like to participate in any way.

I am forwarding to you guidelines prepared for global products trading.  It's 
a good starting point.  I am currently working on guidelines for Argentina 
which will address both physical and financial trading.  Other ""guidelines"" 
exist in limited form for the remote offices in Singapore and Australia.  I 
am checking on London.
I'm not exactly certain as to what you are looking for.  Obviously the 
foreign offices have issues that may not apply in the US (although LA. is 
about as close as you can get to a third world country).  One thing that 
doesn't show up in the attachment is the swap eligibility issue.   Let me 
know how I can help further.  Sara

Subject: Tiger ISDA Docs faxed to you last night

Joseph Manogue at Tiger called me last night to say he had finally reviewed 
the draft ISDA doc with all agreed changes put in and lined from original. He 
faxed it to you and will have the original Fedexed overnight. Hope you'll 
have time to review it today.

S&S has again asked about the gtee and l/c wording. They do not have anything 
from us in writing confirming the agreed changes. Joe asked that you fax the 
revised gtee wording that has been agreed (I believe it was our agreeing to 
reduce the claim period from 15 days down to 5) and the new l/c wording 
(drops the 2 day period to replace an l/c with a different bank if the first 
refuses to pay). I know we talked about these issues earlier, but Tiger's 
lawyers want to get everything agreed in writing now so final docs can be 
issued for signing, even if we are the one's issuing the gtee and l/c.

Thanks! Call if you have questions or if I can be of any help. There is an 
outside chance we could have everything set to go this week.

With best regards,
Per

Hi back!  and Happy New Year too!  To what do I owe this small pleasure?  I'm 
fine in Texas, still hanging out with Phoebe and Chloe, working hard, etc.  
Where are you living these days?  N.O.?  Atlanta?  Memphis?  Eleuthra?  St. 
Petersburg?  Amelia Island Plantation?  I've simply lost track!  As for me, 
well, I lead the simple life, own a little house in West University, own a 
little car (I had to buy a new one recently - the 14-year old 380 SE started 
scaring me a bit), you know, the usual.  Are you selling burgers up and down 
the east coast?  Have you gone international?  In a new franchise business?  
How's your family?  
 
Got to get back to work!  This weekend I'm off to Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires 
on business.  SARA

Sara, here are the trader guidelines I developed for UK gas, UK power and 
Nordic power.  I assume you need both gas and power. These are to some extent 
country or market specific. As these guidelines need to be approved by 
Houston, I am copying this to Mark, Alan and Jeff. tks

Mark Elliott tells me that you drafted some trader guidelines (physical and 
financial) for the London traders.  I am trying to develop similar guidelines 
for the Southern Cone regions (first Argentina) and thought your expertise 
would be very helpful.  Could you send me a set?  I'm leaving for Sao Paulo 
on Saturday but I will be in the office tomorrow.  Thank you for your help.

Corky's in New Orleans and 13 Wendy's in Florida with John Casey as my

Richard is doing his residency and getting married in Cleveland next month,
and Karen is a dietician ( those are Beverly's kids, in case you've
forgotten). Bev is dating a guy for several years and Helen is divorced and
living alone ( I hope) in Pensacola. How is your entire family? Why didn't
you invite me to S.America with you? Forget the lame excuse and just invite
me on the next trip-like the usual family trip at year-end!! Call if you can
be nice to me and come visit me or invite me to visit you!   Sam

Subject: Re: Products for Trading in Brazil.  

Gary and Joe,

We should probably have a conference call sometime next week to discuss how 
we want to proceed on the financial derivatives/trading side.  I have  a 
number of concerns which I share here.

First, we do not have a tax-efficient entity in which to trade.  If we set up 
a Brazilian limitada solely for the purpose of trading, and we lose money, we 
will generate Brazil tax credits.  Enron already has at least $25M of these 
credits and I think we want to try to limit the possibility of generating 
additional credits going forward.  In addition, there is a possibility that 
Enron Corp. may begin limiting the utilization of these credits, so one might 
end up with minimal tax benefit if there was a loss (creating an asymetrical 
trading payoff).  I was hoping we could trade out of Elektro, but Lynn 
informs me that any gains in Elektro will be subject to both US and Brazil 
taxation.

Second, to the extent that we do take tax risk in a limitada, we still need 
to fund (and possibly) guarantee the limitada.  Currently, the only way to 
fund the limitada without being exposed to a whole host of tax/FX issues is 
through equity.  However, equity is difficult to repatriate (it would be 
repatriated probably only as far as Cayman for tax reasons) and we are 
subject to convertibility risk.  In addition, earnings in the company could 
most likely only be repatriated via shareholder loans (dividends would be 
subject to US tax), meaning that the cash would have to come back into Brazil 
when the loan expired (and then it would be sent back out if there was no 
convertibility event).

Third, trading stocks on the Bovespa may create Chinese Wall issues with 
regards to our ongoing M&A and Financing activities.  In all likelihood, one 
would be trading energy/telecom stocks.  Those companies are also the ones 
with which the ESA origination teams are trying to do business.  We might be 
able to create a Chinese Wall, but given the size of the ESA office (not big) 
and the limited scope of our intended trading operation, we have to consider 
whether it is worth potnetially limiting those core activities to spec. trade 
(or consider what cost would be incurred to ceate a Chinese Wall).  

The other two products--money markets and futures--can be traded (albeit in a 
more limited fashion) offshore.   Because money market instruments can't be 
shorted locally, they are really just passive investment vehicles (like a 
bank CD) off of which one trades the interest rate via swaps.  That is, you 
are shortening or lengthening your investment horizon based on one's 
expectation of rates and continually earning either a higher or lower carry 
than market.  Most of this type of trading can be done offshore through 
credit-linked notes (including R$ CDI, R$ prefixed and USD fixed) and 
short-term Brazil Bradys.  Currency futures of course can be traded via NDFs.

In sum, I think we need to better define the type of trades we will do and 
where we are going to do those trades.  My hope is that we can define a 
couple of products/ideas we want to implement now and then figure out in 
which entity to house that activity.  

I will try to set up a conference call for next week on this topic.   

Regards,  Bruce

I'll be glad to help you out from Enron's remote offices and while in Houston 
during the week of Sept. 27 - Oct.1.  Please note the following:

2.  I'll be on vacation from Oct. 2 - Oct. 9

You may need to contact me through my assistant Kaye Ellis (Ext. 35968) or

Subject: Proposed Enron/Petron ISDA documentation

Hi Sara,

How are things with you, m'dear?  Have you any exotic destinations planned 
for this year's vacation?

Anyway - I'm planning to go on vacation with my family (yah - it's weird to 
say ""family"" now!)  to Perth from Thursday 23 September through to Saturday 3 
October and was wondering whether you could help 'babysit' the Petron 
matter.  Janice had mentioned that you'd done some due diligence on ISDA in 
the Philippines a year or so ago so I thought that you would probably be the 
most appropriate person to look after this matter in my absence.  Matt, who 
is a new attorney who joined us in the Singapore office last week, will also 
be keeping track of this file but he hasn't been fully 'Enronized' by Tana as 
yet (tho' he will be so before Thanksgiving as he'll be headed to Houston 
next month for a month's stint there) so I thought it best if you could be 
the main contact person for Petron as well as for our business folks during 
that week that I'm not around.  I really hope that you don't mind.

Assuming that you're OK with this, I would like to give your name and contact 
details to the Enron AP/A/CHI biz folks who are handling this - Manuel 
Gallego in the Philippines, Victor Santos who is presently relocating to 
Singapore and David Terlip to whom they report.  The traders in the Singapore 
office, John Chismar and Eng Wang Moi , will be providing the pricing.  Matt 
and my assistant, Angeline, will get hold of you should they hear from Petron 
during that week.  The plan is that Petron is interested in entering into 
some crack spread swaps with us.  So far, Citibank and Chase have signed up 
ISDAs with Petron.

In the meantime, I'll have Angeline fax to you copies of all the 
correspondence which I've had had with our Filipino counsel QTE to-date so 
that you'll get a good idea of what the regulatory and legal environment's 
like now in the Philippines. [Angeline - can you please do that today.  
Sara's fax no. is Houston Legal's fax no.]

So far, QTE has reviewed our draft ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex and 
I sent it across to Petron's inhouse counsel on 8 September (please see 
attached) and I'm now waiting for their written comments on those drafts.  

Please let me know whether you'll be able to look after this matter for me.  
Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks a mill,
Anita

No, in general there is a netting issue with French counterparties.  The 
""quick fix"" is to only permit ONE Transaction using a deemed ISDA.  The 
broader issue to be resolved is that one of the parties must be a ""financial 
institution"" under French law.  We tried to push ECT into that defintion, but 
without success.  The next step is to require  an opinion from outside 
counsel identifying our counterparty as that financial institution.  
SS            
ps - Tanya is well aware of the situation

Subject: VCP Asset Monetization Strategy

We have committed to move forward with one Asset Monetization transaction to 
fully address and resolve the issues and complexities involved and establish 
a base template by which we can expand the strategy as we move forward in 
Brazil. Votorantim Cellulose e Papel (VCP) is the targeted transaction due to 
its size, diversity of opportunities, and management commitment.


The structure of the assets is as follows:




The currently identified opportunities are as follows:



The tasks to be accomplished are as follows:  





The Team that we see on the project is listed below:





I would first like to ask each of you to provide feedback on what I have laid 
out to date. With regard to process and go forwards I am seeking all input.
Below are some additional files for your use.  We will co-ordinate initially 
with each functional group and get everyone together as we move forward.
We have a commitment to complete Stage I with a proposal to the customer by 
October 1st. It will take all of us to make that happen.

Thanks

Your switchboard does not answer and I'd like to speak with you.  Please call 
me at 713/853-5620.

We'll e-mail two identical Schedules to you in word.  Enron Capital & Trade 
Resources entered into an ISDA with Barclays in 1995 and that Schedule was 
virtually identical to the one we're sending.  We therefore do not expect 
there to be many issues.  The banks should serve as Calculation Agents and 
confirming agents so we will look to them for the confirmations.  Look 
forward to finalizing these documents with you.  Thanks.  Sara"

I have sent the ISDA schedule to Barclays for their review as there are a few
issues that Barclays needs to respond to before I can forward the document to
Enron (the email is being sent separately by my word processing staff).  I am
confirming whether Credit Lyonnais is handling the schedule themselves since
that was my impression when talking to Daryl Stanley, although that was before
getting this email (however, if MBP is handling the schedule for both banks, 
the
schedules will be identical except as to the Tax representations, so the
negotiation of one schedule will make the other schedule easy to complete).

Daryl or Ricardo, can one of you confirm?

Sara,

I got an inquiry from a South African country today.  Off the top of your 
head do you know anything about our ability to do derivatives in that 
country.  I'm just wondering if you have any ready info...i.e. at this point 
it would not merit any incremental research.

Thanks,

We are presently contacting Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to facilitate opening 
of an account for EPHXII to trade ADRs.  You will need to provide a 
resolution authorizing opening of the account as well as an authorized trader 
list and other contacts.  We will provide you with drafts.  I am certain that 
the broker will accept fax signatures and then follow up with originals.  

For future reference, will this be an isolated instance (i.e., deal specific) 
or will these accounts become more routine?  Just wondering if S. Cone has a 
formal trading policy or if trading is still deal specific.  SS"

Subject: Millenium execution procedures

**Please do not forward**

So everyone knows, here is how we plan to execute the purchase/sale of 
Millenium ADRs.  Please let me know ASAP if anyone sees any problems with 
this.

*We will have a formal ESA transaction approval and DASH signed by Diomedes 
and/or Jim and others.  These approvals will be shown to Corp. Treasury, Risk 
Management, and RAC.

1. Jeff Kinneman's team will execute all trades with the market.  They 
function in this respect as an internal broker for ESA: ie, ESA will direct 
and manage all trading decisions and they will execute.  Jeff reports to Gary 
Hickerson and Greg Whaley in Risk Management.  Gary has been advised and Greg 
will be advised that we will be taking a small trading position in these 
securities.  Jeff's team has been restricted from trading any other Millenium 
securities except at our request. 

2. We will use the CayCo that owns PEP (Enron Brazil Power Holding XII) for 
our trades.  Lynn chose this company for tax purposes, and Robert has 
indicated that there are no legal restrictions on using this company.  James, 
Diomedes and Joe are Directors of this company.  Joe can authorize Jeff, 
Pedro, myself (or whoever) to execute trades of the CayCo.  Appropriate 
corporate resolutions will be executed as needed.

3. Morgan Stanley will be the clearing broker for our ADRs.  The clearing 
broker is also custody agent for the securities.  Sara is in process of 
completing this application (as a domestic account).  MS is the primary 
clearing broker and custody agent for most of Corp's stock purchases.

4. Jeff's team already has a trading agreement with JPM.  We do not have an 
agreement in place with DKB.  We will execute that agreement once we have 
clarified several matters with DKB. 

5. Trades will be conducted in the following manner:

a) Pedro and I will discuss price targets/amounts throughout a given day
b) I will place an order with Jeff's team.  If I am out, Pedro will speak 
with Jeff directly.  Jeff's number is 713-853-5398.
c) We will get execution feedback on the order from the team as well as any 
market talk
d) If the order is filled, Corp. (Atlantic Commercial Finance) will be 
instructed to send funds on behalf of CayCo to MS.  Cathy Moehlman in 
Treasury will handle cash movements and has been briefed on this potential 
activity.

Regards,  Bruce

Sorry, I've been tied up all day.  Rod and I just spoke and he is thinking 
about the NAV issue.  
Regarding setoff, we can agree to Tiger's language BUT credit will not permit 
ENA affiliates to trade with Tiger.  That's your issue.  Will you agree.
We will not agree that all collateral be held in NY.
There is still an issue about Relevant Price and the possibility of fewer 
than three dealers.
We cannot finalize L/C and MAC issues until we see Tiger's redraft which we 
have not received.

Let's talk.  ss"

Tom Kabat, Senior Resource Planner, Resource Management Division for the City 
of Palo Alto, Utilities Department, gave me his card yesterday and said he 
wanted to get an ISDA started for future trading.  He asked if we had ISDA's 
with any other cities, that is, it might make his job easier.  Are you guys 
sending follow-up letters to the attendees?  SS

Sara,

Bruce Harris gave me you name as a contact for getting a copy of Enron's 
approved ISDA documentation.  I am looking a helping our 50% owned 
subsidiary, CIESA do an interest rate swap to fix rates on its $220MM 
floating rate note agreement.  The existing swap which was done in 1997 runs 
off on 10/22/99.  The tax department here at Enron (South America) have asked 
me to let them review any swap documentation we plan on entering into 
beforehand so they can look at any tax issues (i.e., tax law changes that may 
have occured since the last swap was done).  

I am not sure what documentation was used the last time around - I have asked 
the financial folks at TGS which manages the CIESA FRN on behalf of Enron and 
Perez Companc to send me a copy of whatever documentation was used before as 
a starting place but haven't heard back from them.  Do you happen to have any 
information on the previous swap?

I am on my way to Dallas for the day.  I will give you a call tomorrow to 
check in.  Thanks.

BRS

I love you so much.  And you send great messages.  My life has always been a

fascinated with the island.  I sat next to this lawyer from NY on the flight

have a ""house sitter"" while I'm on vacation (thought I'd try it out since you 
probably would!).  Mike asked the concierge at ""The Argyle"" to make 
reservations from a list I prepared.  All of your suggestions except Parkway 
Grill appear.  How do people in LA dress for dinner? HELP!  I have to pack 
tonight.  I need new shoes.  I'll be in the office tomorrow until 4:15pm.

Hey Sass,

My life is a mess!! I barely have time to pee.
These are the restaurants I remember as great--Patina (but you can't
wear jeans I don't think), La Campanile (maybe it's El Campanile) and
Parkway Grill.
Have fun.

I think people dress in clothes.  I saw everybody in everything, it's
just that Patina seemed a little bit snootier than the others (the food
is fabulous though).  Maybe the Parkway Grill isn't on the list because
that's the wrong name of the restaurant.  Maybe it's really Perkway
Grillades.
Love you lots.

Attached is a general confirm outlining the proposed transaction with 
Deseret.  I am not sure where the original of this documet came from.   
However, I am providing it to you so that you can have the language for the 
general terms of the transaction.  

Let me know if I may provide any other information.  

In talking with Deseret, they felt that they had a much better chance of 
pushing a short form ISDA agreement for this trasaction through the general 
counsel than they would the long form ISDA.  That said, I think our best 
approach is to set up a short form ISDA agreement for Deseret.   As usual, 
the sooner the better on putting together the short form ISDA document.  
Today if possible.  Please let me know.

Subject: PULP & PAPER MEETING TOMORROW: draft London / Houston trade flow 
schematic

In advance of the video conference tomorrow amongst the Houston and London 
personnel involved in the Pulp & Paper deals, I now attach a final draft 
version of a ""schematic"" which sets down the trade flow structure on the 
deals sourced by EEFT for ECTRIC.  If you have any comments on this, please 
let me know.

Sara / Carol / Dale:  Please see fit to let any other appropriate personnel 
in Houston have a copy of this document at your discretion.

Kind regards

Mark

I think you might be the best person to look at this.  It is a financial 
power swap with a cooperative.  Let's discuss.

Attached is a general confirm outlining the proposed transaction with 
Deseret.  I am not sure where the original of this documet came from.   
However, I am providing it to you so that you can have the language for the 
general terms of the transaction.  

Let me know if I may provide any other information.  

In talking with Deseret, they felt that they had a much better chance of 
pushing a short form ISDA agreement for this trasaction through the general 
counsel than they would the long form ISDA.  That said, I think our best 
approach is to set up a short form ISDA agreement for Deseret.   As usual, 
the sooner the better on putting together the short form ISDA document.  
Today if possible.  Please let me know.

The only policy that I've seen is the ""Interim Southern Cone Electricity 
Trading Policy"" dated July 29th, 1999 and which does authorize financial 
electricity trading in Brazil.  I'm not aware of  policy (maybe there is 
none) or resolution (maybe each will be deal specific) which addresses the 
opening of brokerage accounts and equity trading (even for hedging 
purposes).   I think we should monitor the activity and see if it's going to 
be sporadic.  I'll be in the office today until 4 pm.  Sara

We are presently contacting Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to facilitate opening 
of an account for EPHXII to trade ADRs.  You will need to provide a 
resolution authorizing opening of the account as well as an authorized trader 
list and other contacts.  We will provide you with drafts.  I am certain that 
the broker will accept fax signatures and then follow up with originals.  

For future reference, will this be an isolated instance (i.e., deal specific) 
or will these accounts become more routine?  Just wondering if S. Cone has a 
formal trading policy or if trading is still deal specific.  SS

Mark, you may recall my memo to you in April, 1999 which indicated that for 
netting purposes, the conditions included:

1.  The transaction must be governed by a market standard master agreement or 
occur on a French regulated market

2.  One of the parties must be (a) an ""investment firm"" within the meaning of 
the law of 2nd of July, 1996, (b) an instituion or firm benefitting from the 
provisions of article 25 of the Law or (c) a non-resident entity having a 
""comparable status""

The term ""investment firm"" embodies financial type institutions which recieve 
and transmit order for financial instruments for third parties.

There are 12 categories of article 25 firms (including Bank of France, 
insurance companies, broker types, etc.)  .For example, one murky designation 
includes ""persons who supply an investment service which is ancillary to 
their professional activity, provided the rules governing such activity do 
not prohibt the carrying on of investment services"".  Slaughter and May has 
advised that they could assist us in determining whether our French 
counterparty fit this category and it definitely needs to be discussed with 
the counterparty (and extract a rep from them as well).  There are other 
categories as well.   I have a copy of the law if you would like to review.

The non-resident entity having ""comparable status"" is the category WE were 
trying for fit into without much success.

Tana tells me that I have given you misinformation.  Perhaps the law has 
changed and Justin has a recent update.  

ENA has a Soc Gen master, and we have recently sent a Deemed ISDA to a French 
corporate (one shot deal only). "

I hope that there is no more confusion!

The opening of each brokerage account should require two signatures for 
control purposes.  ONE of those signature MUST BE either of Ted Murphy or 
Rick Buy (their titles frequently change but check the Enron Corp. corporate 
workbook).  The SECOND signature MUST BE an officer of the entity opening the 
account.  We suggest the level of authority used by ENA but certainly 
whatever appears in the entity's unanimous consent or resolution authorizing 
the opening of brokerage accounts.  I think that Marie previously sent you a 
form.  Let us know if you have any questions.  

What is the timing on the Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII Ltd. account?

Nancy,

I am confused by your e-mail.  I thought the brokerage account was going to 
be opened for Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII Ltd., not Enron South America.  
We typically require any one of the President, any Managing Director or the 
Vice President, Finance and Treasurer, together with any one of the Managing 
Director, Legal, Rick Buy or Ted Murphy.  Of course, the level of officers 
may vary from entity to entity.

I spoke with Ted Murphy regarding setting up the brokerage account for the 
Copel shares.  He indicated that the easiest thing to do is coordiante with 
Sara Shackelton (ECT finance lawyer).  Typically, she sets up the paperwork 
and Ted (or Rick) signs off on setting up the account (she has done this many 
times).  Robert may have already done this or it may not be necessary in this 
case - I will leave that up to him.  Regardless, Ted (or Rick) does need to 
be one of the people who sign the documents.  Sorry for the delay.

Dale/Bart/Sara,

We need to clean up the confirmation and any other legal information that 
accompanies it (Bart/Sara, is the attached Omnibus T&Cs we proposed to use 
standard documentation or are any revisions necessary prior to sending out to 
CCSI?) so that we can send this out to CCSI for their review.

Looking at the confirmation, I see the following items that need to be 
revised:

Trade date/Signing date - Not yet confirmed; will insert date the deal is 
closed when it is known.
Need to specify which curve to look at in the Gas Daily Index (there is a low 
high and a mid or average); we did not specify which one we would refer to 
previously
Do we need to replace ECT with ENA throughout??
Catalytica should be Catalytica Combustion Systems (the subsidiary not the 
parent)
Need to add in details about CCSI (name/title/payment account info etc.)


Sean - I will get the info for 5 from CCSI

Dale - Could you correct number 2, advise on number 3 and review the document 
again to see if any other information is lacking that should be included?

Bart/Sara  - Could you advise about the details on the Omnibus (I have 
misplaced any copy of this)  I thought there were some credit issues that 
needed to be filled in at the bottom of this?

If anyone else could advise on other items that need to be addressed with 
either the Confirmation and/or the Omnibus agreement, now is the time!

Sara,  great to hear from you.  The entity requiring the brokerage account is 
Enron Energy Services, Limited, which is a UK entity.  This company is buying 
100% of the shares of a UK engineering firm (called Torpy) in order to use in 
its facilities management business here.  The purchase price for Torpy is $4 
million, $1 million of which is payable in Enron Corp. stock.  For tax 
reasons this Enron stock needs to be purchased in the market rather than 
using treasury shares.  Thanks for the tip on account signatories.  Please 
let me know what else I need to do  Thanks again.

Would you please provide us with information identifying the specific entity 
requiring the brokerage account and a brief description of the transaction 
for which the account is required.  Also, for purposes of your unanimous

Regards from Houston!  I hope you are well and busy.

I just wanted to follow up on our very productive meeting of September 21, 
1999.  Enron North America  and Enron South America  are still quite anxious 
to continue our analysis of the various components of financial trading.  I 
believe that you were going to prepare some type of matrix to help identify 
the various legal issues and practical aspects associated with financially 
transacting in Brazil.  We would then add tax and regulatory analyses to the 
possibilities.  If my memory serves me correctly, we had identified 
transactions by the Enron entity (""ENE"") as follows:

1.  cross-border swaps
 (a)  ENE offshore FINANCIAL INSTITUTION and Brazilian entity
 (b)  ENE offshore (not financial institution) through CC-5 Account with 
authorized Brazilian bank and Brazilian entity

 NOTE:  enforceability issues with 1(b)

2.  local swaps
 (a)  ENE onshore entity and Brazilian FINANCIAL INSTITUTION (or ENE onshore 
FINANCIAL INSTITUTION and Brazilian resident)
 (b)  ENE onshore entity and Brazilian entity (not financial institution) 
registered with the BM&F or CETIP through intermediary

 NOTE:  compliance with existing regulations as to specific reference 
products is required as to 2(a) and 2(b)

3.  ""pure"" OTC swaps
 (a)  ENE onshore entity and Brazilian onshore entity
 (b)  ENE offshore entity and Brazilian offshore entity

 NOTE:  3(a) presents enforceability issues under Brazilian law and 3(b) 
presents no issues whatsoever

We look forward to your response as soon as possible and would also like to 
know when we may hear from you.  In connection with your response, please 
note that we are interested in the recent changes to the laws for acquiring 
banks (bankrupt or otherwise).

Regards to Marcelo and Jose Emilio.  Sara

Subject: Assignment of Irving Pulp Master ISDA Agreement

Sara,

If appears from discussions with Mark Bettle today that interest levels at 
the top management of J.D. Irving is minimal to consolidate business under 
one master ISDA agreement.  As a result it seems prudent to move forward to 
assign the current Enron Canada master ISDA agreement over to Enron North 
America.

From my earlier conversations with Bryan Burnett he would support this 
decision.  I have not spoken personally with the originator of the  Enron 
Canada master ISDA, Chris Calger, but it is my understanding he would also 
support this move.  

Would you please take steps to get this done as soon as possible.  

If there are any questions, please call.

JH.

Hi there!  A quick refresher course for me with respect to French derivatives 
trading (not a bank).  In transacting with a French corporate, should we 
request articles and bylaws for capacity and ALSO a due authorization 
opinion?  I think that this is correct.  However, if we are transacting with 
an ""S.A."", we should NOT request articles and bylaws but only the due 
authorization opinion.  My notes on these items are confusing.  Could you 
please respond in the morning?  Thanks.  Sara

p.s.  We are currently operating under the ""one Transaction rule"" with French 
non-bank entities in order to avoid the netting problem."

Subject: Re: Spark Spread Confirmation  

RE your inquiry about the General Terms and Conditions of Confirmation ( 
Annex A to the Confirmation ) and Credit and Other Special Provisions (Annex 
B to the Confirmation) that were attached to the 9/1/99 ""Summary of Proposed 
Agreement Between Enron and Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. (""CCSI"")"" ( 
which I understand was sent to Catalytica) , I went through all the E-Mails I 
had sent or received that attached the Confirmation or the Summary of 
Proposed Agreement as an exhibit, but I can't seem to find one that included 
these Annexes A and B. I've asked a clerk in the department to deliver to 
both you and Sara the copy of Annexes A and B that were attached to the paper 
version of the 9/1 Summary of Proposed Agreement in my files. Perhaps one of 
you will recollect from whom the Annexes were obtained, so we can retrieve 
them in electronic format and append them to the most current draft 
Confirmation.

Regarding your question about credit terms, they are embodied in Annex B. 
Regarding our exposure to Catalytica credit between execution and payment, 
remember that we will not execute the Option Repurchase Agreement until we 
receive CCSI's cash via wire transfer ( this was the deal Brad agreed to when 
he suggested we delete the receipt of CCSI's payment as an express condition 
to effectiveness of the Xonon Implementation Agreement with GE, the 
effectiveness of which agreement is in turn an express condition to 
effectiveness of the Option Repurchase Agreement). In short, my understanding 
is that we would not deliver the Option Repurchase or execute and deliver the 
Xonon Implementation Agreement until we had a good wire transfer from CCSI of 
the full payment amount. Perhaps we should add that stipulation expressly to 
the Option Repurchase Agreement and consider whether it would then be 
appropriate to delete Annex B. Note in this regard, however, that if CCSI 
were to default under other provisions of the derivative, I believe we would 
be seeking payment from CCSI for termination expenses and the like, but I 
don't know if this justifies the credit provision.

Brad Nebergall advises he has not sought formal approval of the Catalytica 
transaction because it is too early to know for sure that we have a deal ( 
ie, we still do not have GE's reaction to the latest draft Xonon 
Implementation Agreement and, as we discussed, we will still need to get the 
Option Repurchase Agreement blessed by Catalytica's auditors). Brad said, 
however, that he has met twice with underwriting on the transaction, and that 
Dave Delaney is in ""general agreement"" with the deal ""in concept"". I hope 
that addresses your inquiry, and I'll update you when (and if) we move to the 
next stage.

credit included an additional event of default (cross-default) with 
thresholds of $10 million for Catalytica and $50 million for Enron North 
America.  Sean has requested that ""Catalytica, Inc."" be REPLACED with the sub 
""Catalytica Combustion Systems"".  Should the credit remain the same?

We are withholding release of this confirm pending a response from

Just note that the sub's full name is Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. 
Regarding the sub's credit, we should have pretty good info since we are an 
equity owner ( I think 30%) in CCSI. I understand CCSI has no revenues, that 
its principal asset is the Xonon system patent, and that the proceeds of 
Enron's investment in CCSI will be the source of the funds for the purchase 
of the spark spread derivative.

Sara,  

Given the deal pressure we expect in the last quarter of 99,especially in 
origination, I am trying to eliminate as many duplicative meetings as 
possible.  Instead of having Andrea Bertone attend this weekly meeting, could 
you and Lynn Aven attend my legal staff meeting (along with Brent Hendry and 
Rick Hopkinson, who are already scheduled to attend) each week? They are held 
on Tuesdays at 10:00 am SP time. That way, we can get a direct report from 
you with a synthesized summary of the issues.  If you need to consult with 
Andrea, Robert or me on an offline basis, you can let us know in the meeting, 
and we will arrange a separate call. I believe this would be more efficient.

Thanks, and please let me know,

Regards,
Randy

Sorry, I did not realize you were awaiting a response from me on this.

Our deal is with the subsidiary, not the parent.  So the name of the 
counterparty should be Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc., (CCSI) not 
Catalytica.

Regarding the credit issue (Annex B; Credit and other special provisions), I 
can't see how we are exposed to credit risk; we will not sign the XONON 
Implementation Agreement with GE until we have received the $9.9 million 
payment from CCSI.  If CCSI does not agree to return the spark spread 
confirmation upon our request, as defined per the agreement, then CCSI is in 
default of the agreement and the spark spread confirmation becomes worthless.

My main concern is with the general terms and conditions of the spark spread 
confirmation because I know there are some errors in there that need to be 
corrected:

There are three prices for the Gas Daily index referenced - low, high and 
mid.  We need to define which curve we want to reference.
We need to change the name from Catalytica to Catalytica Combustion Systems, 
Inc.
I think ECT should now be changed to Enron North America in the agreement, 
but please advise on this
I need to provide the details for CCSI (e.g., name, title, payment account 
information)

Also, if Lucy can review the document for any other errors that would be a 
good idea.

I was looking to get these items corrected in anticipation of sending to CCSI 
sometime around the end of next week.

Please feel to contact me with any other questions.

We are trying to revise the draft transaction confirmation per Sean's e-mail 
of date.  The original confirm was prepared for ""Catalytica, Inc."" and the 
credit included an additional event of default (cross-default) with 
thresholds of $10 million for Catalytica and $50 million for Enron North 
America.  Sean has requested that ""Catalytica, Inc."" be REPLACED with the sub 
""Catalytica Combustion Systems"".  Should the credit remain the same?

We are withholding release of this confirm pending a response from 
underwriting.  Thanks.  Sara

Brent, could we close a Swap with TGS without having the ISDA signed but 
then, a few weeks later after we sending the confirmation we sign the ISDA?

TGS wants to close a swap with us starting November 1st. The problem is that 
their lawyer, Enrique Prini (do you know him??) is going for vacation next 
monday for two weeks. I told the guy from TGS that he should have Chris 
Dougall taking over while he is outside, but he did not sound convinced. 
Maybe you could talk to Chris?? But still, let's wait until they send us 
their comments.

Hope you are well!  I had a wonderful vacation in L.A.  I never made it to 
either the Norton Simon or the Getty; I'll just have to plan another trip to 
the west coast.

In connection with your recent review of our standard ISDA Schedule, Credit 
Support Annex and legal opinion (the ""Documents""), could you please advise as 
the whether additional provisions are required or advisable in any of the 
Documents when our counterparty is an Argentine public utility, municipality 
or other type of regulated entity.  In the U.S., we use the ISDA 
Multicurrency - Cross Border boilerplate and incorporate most of the ISDA 
municipal language and some of our own into the Schedule for municipals and 
governmental entities.  However, for public utilities which are general 
corporates (and not governmentally owned), we take a different approach and 
incorporate language which might trigger an ""Additional Termination Event"" 
for ""regulatory type developments"" (e.g., orders issued by a public utility 
commission) which would cause or might cause our master agreement to become 
void or unenforceable or similar swap agreements to become void or 
unenforceable.  For example:

""The filing of a motion, pleading, application or other similar action in any 
proceeding or action by Party B, a commission, regulatory agency or other 
entity having jurisdiction over Party B, in respect of Party B, or in respect 
of any other similarly situated entity organized under the laws of the 
state(s) in which Party B is located or regulated, to the effect that 
performance under this Agreement or one or more Transactions hereunder or 
similar agreements is unlawful or that this Agreement or one or more 
Transactions hereunder or similar agreements are void or voidable."" 

By fax, I will send you our Municipal Schedule.

Please advise as to changes in both the (i) Schedule and (ii) legal opinion 
for both (a) public utilities (corporates, non-governmental) and governmental 
entities (municipals, public agencies, governmental utilities, etc.).  Please 
call if you have any questions.  Regards.  Sara"

Randy,
I can certainly participate in your Tuesday morning meetings (and I can 
appreciate the time constraints under which Andrea is working!).  I believe 
that Lynn will defer to Rick's participation.  Please let me know if there is 
a call in number.  I think that I will be able to keep you updated through 
your meetings.  My need for meeting with Lynn and Brent stems from the fact 
that we are ""offshore"" Brazil and need to communicate regularly to keep the 
fires burning.
Have a great weekend!  I just got back from my vacation - I went to L.A. - 
and the weather was extraordinary.  So was the food.  I'm looking forward to 
Sao Paulo.  Will see you soon.  Sara

Crude Oil Futures Contract on October __, 1999 and (ii) the average of the 
daily settlement prices for the December NYMEX Light Sweet Crude Oil Futures

I spoke to Todd Busby.  He said he is trying to set this up as a transaction 
where we could directly link the two swaps.  It is my understanding that this 
would simplify the transaction in that the credit/contracting process would 
be fairly straightforward.  He said that he needs to get his internal ducks 
in a row before he is prepared to take a step forward with us.  He will call 
me if and when this occurs.   So, this might not come to anything.  I will 
let you know if and when he surfaces so we can decisde what we should do next.

Thanks!!

Many thanks, Sara.  I appreciate your including Andrea in these calls, and I

meantime, the download once a week will certainly be helpful to me.  

Sounds like a great vacation.  I am jealous.

Randy,
I can certainly participate in your Tuesday morning meetings (and I can 
appreciate the time constraints under which Andrea is working!).  I believe 
that Lynn will defer to Rick's participation.  Please let me know if there is 
a call in number.  I think that I will be able to keep you updated through 
your meetings.  My need for meeting with Lynn and Brent stems from the fact 
that we are ""offshore"" Brazil and need to communicate regularly to keep the 
fires burning.
Have a great weekend!  I just got back from my vacation - I went to L.A. - 
and the weather was extraordinary.  So was the food.  I'm looking forward to 
Sao Paulo.  Will see you soon.  Sara

Sara,  

Given the deal pressure we expect in the last quarter of 99,especially in 
origination, I am trying to eliminate as many duplicative meetings as 
possible.  Instead of having Andrea Bertone attend this weekly meeting, could 
you and Lynn Aven attend my legal staff meeting (along with Brent Hendry and 
Rick Hopkinson, who are already scheduled to attend) each week? They are held 
on Tuesdays at 10:00 am SP time. That way, we can get a direct report from 
you with a synthesized summary of the issues.  If you need to consult with 
Andrea, Robert or me on an offline basis, you can let us know in the meeting, 
and we will arrange a separate call. I believe this would be more efficient.

Thanks, and please let me know,

Regards,
Randy

Subject: S. Cone Trading Issues

In an effort to establish regular communication on the progress of trading 
issues (primarily related legal and tax perspectives)  in the S. Cone, Lynn 
and I have agreed to conference on Friday, October 15 at 9 am (Houston time) 
and weekly at that time.  Would anyone else like to participate this Friday?  
If you are interested in participating on a weekly basis, are Fridays at 9 am 
(Houston time) convenient for you?  My immediate concerns are financial 
trading issues.  However, we can focus on all relevant issues as we so 
determine.  I will create a ""short list"" to initiate discussion.  Thanks.  
Sara

Sheer volume! (has kept me from being up to date).  It's at the top of the 
list and I promise it by next week.

I do need to speak with you about this Duke issue which has apparently 
created some confusion over here.  Seems to me there are three issues here:  
(1) ECT's consent toDuke Energy Trading and Marketing LLC releasing the 
master to its affiliate, (2)  credit's assessment of trading with two Duke 
entities and (3) issues particular to trading power in Argentina (if any).  
Who is in charge of addressing Duke?  SS

""...PROVIDED, HOWEVER,THAT NOTHING IN THIS PROVISION SHALL AFFECT THE 
ENFORCEABILITY OF SECTION 6(e) OF THIS AGREEMENT with respect to incidental

PG&E claims that it will never be responsible for consequential damages and 
that certain elements of ""Loss"" comprise consequential damages (PG&E always

Have you ever prepared a list of the ""Loss"" components?
Can you assess before I go to Haedicke (or is this a non-starter)?

FYI:  Jeff  I  know  that  you  are  busy,  however  I  have  received  
several  outside  calls  today  (10/13/99)  from  
            a  party  claiming  to  be  with  BP Amoco,  he  requested  deal 
#N16124.1  to  be  faxed  to  (281)366-4934.  The
            party  refuses  to  give  his  name  or  phone  number.  His  
reply  has  been  ""If  I  have  to  give  my  name
            and  number  maybe  I  don't  need  your  confirm"",  then  he  
hangs  up.  He  has  called  several  times  since
            I  stopped  you  and  Bob  Bowen  earlier.  I  also  suspect  
that  this  same  party  has  been  calling  and  
            hanging  up  without  answering;  and  calling  from  a  
different  outside  line  pretending  to  be  someone  else,
            but  making  the  same  deal  request ,  followed  by  hanging  
up  when  I  ask  for  his  name  and  phone
            number.  I  have  contacted  Susan  Flynn  in  legal  to  
inquire  about  these  calls  or  BP Amoco.  I  was  advised
            not  to  send  any  confirms  out  blindly  and  that  I  was  
handling  it  just  right .  Susan  is  currently  inquiring
            with  the  other  legal  staff  and  attorneys  about  the  
matter.  I  also  was  advised  to  inform  you  to  make  
            other  members  of  our  team  aware  ""not  to  send  out  blind  
information  requests"" .  The  party  was  calling 
            from  (281)493-0214.  I  will  keep  you  informed.

            Thanks,

I am sitting in on this conference call as I write this message.  Brent just 
mentioned that you were preparing an analysis addressing ""trading locations"" 
to present to Don.  Randy is interested in seeing your written response.  Do 
you need anything from me?

Also, I heard from AFAC by e-mail yesterday and he said that Marcelo was 
working on a memo (which I was to receive yesterday!).  We may need Randy to 
intercede and keep the lawyers working on ALL projects.  Apparently AFAC 
handles all Central Bank issues for Tozzini and Cuiaba has these issues now.

Sara and I are going to go through the comments and then get back to you very 
soon on the issues.  

I understand that they don't want to sign the CSA, but I am not in the 
position to eliminate this because Goldman Sachs did not make them sign one.  
They are partially owned by Enron and Perez Companc and both of these 
companies sign ISDAs that include CSAs.  

Will follow up soon.

Pat / Sara,

I just talked to the commercial guy @ TGS. We just talked about the Credit 
Support Annex (CSA)and he basically said that they have signed many ISDA's 
(i.e.: with Goldman Sachs) and in none of those were they required to include 
the CSA. I do not know if the CSA is a thing we do require for every 
trasnsaction or not, but I see these guys unwilling to comply with the CSA. 

Why don't we schedule a conference call ASAP to determine our next steps.

this and schedule a conference call with them as soon as possible.  Please

Subject: Call from TGS for LPG Hedge


Eduardo Pawlusek (TGS) just called me and we talked about the LPG Hedge. I 
did not tell him anything about the ""imbedded loan structure"" we are thinking 
of. 

ISDA Document: He told me that his lawyer (Enrique Prini) is reviewing the 
ISDA and will send us the comments on Monday. The problem is that the lawyer 
is leaving on Monday for two weeks. I told him that he should have Chris 
Dougall (who already knows our lawyers) take over while Enrique is out of 
town. 
Timing: TGS is looking for a swap starting November 1, 1999 until December 
31, 2000 (14 months). The problem is that we have to get the ISDA signed 
before we do any transaction, and given that their lawyer will be out, I am 
not sure we will be able to sign it before end of this month.
Volume: TGS sells 200,000 tons/yr of LPG. Approximately 30% of that 
(60,000tons/yr) is what TGS commercialises. They are analysing two scenarios: 
2,500 tons/month (35,000 tons/14months),
1,800 tons/month (25,200 tons/14months). 
Price: He wants us to send him the terms and conditions of a swap ASAP. He 
wants price, settlements and index to be defined. He also said they will be 
asking the banks to send them a quote. 

With regards to the loan we need to evaluate the amount cash involved in the 
swap. Then we can determine an appropriate loan amount. Jeff talked with 
Brian Swinford about this structure.

response from him on Monday (yesterday).  I have not spoken with either AFAC

Subject: Cash Collateral in Canada

I have spoken with Daivd Mitchell about the issue that I raised in my e-mail 
yesterday regarding which law would govern the ""perfection"" of our interest 
in cash collateral pledged to Enron North America Corp. by a Canadian 
counterparty and held by us in an account in the US.  David confirmed that 
while a New York/Texas court should apply US law for perfection purposes, 
there is a possibility that a court would say that the law where the pledgor 
is located would govern perfection.  Because of this uncertainty and because 
of the perfection issues under Canadian law regarding cash collateral, do you 
all agree that in our masters involving ENA and a Canadian counterparty that 
Cash is not an acceptable form of collateral?


Peter, 
As I mentioned to you yesterday, with respect to LC's that are issued for our 
benefit, there could be a circumstance where we would draw and hold the cash 
as collateral.  In that circumstance, I think we need some guidnace from you 
and Stikeman as to what we should be doing to perfect our interest in such 
cash.  I would be interested in knowing whether in a bankruptcy context 
involving a Canadian counterparty, whether the court would hold that such 
cash proceeds are property of the estate.

Let me know what you think.  My assistant is trying to set up a call with 
you, me and Shari to go through the other Canadian law issues that I raised 
in my e-mail to you yesterday.

Sara,

When can we get a revised draft (credit issue outstanding) for the spark 
spread confirmation; should not take very long to revise the terms and 
conditions.

Brad and Chris will be in San Francisco meeting with the developers and GE 
tomorrow.  I ran into Randy and he suggested we should meet with him early 
next week to discuss the current deal structure.  I think we should be able 
to resolve the credit issue and any other remaining issues with this document 
at that time (if any remain) and we will want to send this document out 
immeadiately thereafter.  Therefore, I suggest that we should clean up the 
general terms and conditions in preparation of this so that we are in a 
position to send this document out ASAP once any remaining issues are 
resolved.

Many thanks for your cooperation in this matter.

Sorry, I did not realize you were awaiting a response from me on this.

Our deal is with the subsidiary, not the parent.  So the name of the 
counterparty should be Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc., (CCSI) not 
Catalytica.

Regarding the credit issue (Annex B; Credit and other special provisions), I 
can't see how we are exposed to credit risk; we will not sign the XONON 
Implementation Agreement with GE until we have received the $9.9 million 
payment from CCSI.  If CCSI does not agree to return the spark spread 
confirmation upon our request, as defined per the agreement, then CCSI is in 
default of the agreement and the spark spread confirmation becomes worthless.

My main concern is with the general terms and conditions of the spark spread 
confirmation because I know there are some errors in there that need to be 
corrected:

There are three prices for the Gas Daily index referenced - low, high and 
mid.  We need to define which curve we want to reference.
We need to change the name from Catalytica to Catalytica Combustion Systems, 
Inc.
I think ECT should now be changed to Enron North America in the agreement, 
but please advise on this
I need to provide the details for CCSI (e.g., name, title, payment account 
information)

Also, if Lucy can review the document for any other errors that would be a 
good idea.

I was looking to get these items corrected in anticipation of sending to CCSI 
sometime around the end of next week.

Please feel to contact me with any other questions.

We are trying to revise the draft transaction confirmation per Sean's e-mail

Christopher,

I believe Tracy Ngo has begun to look at it from a credit perspective.  I 
don' have any of the details.  Aquila Energy Corp. is the guarantor for 
Aquila trading subs and is not anywhere near the equivalent credit quality of 
Enron Corp.  We need to be careful of how much incremental risk we take with 
Aquila without collateral because of our significant trading positions with 
them.  Please advise when you find out more details about the structure.

I spoke to Todd Busby.  He said he is trying to set this up as a transaction 
where we could directly link the two swaps.  It is my understanding that this 
would simplify the transaction in that the credit/contracting process would 
be fairly straightforward.  He said that he needs to get his internal ducks 
in a row before he is prepared to take a step forward with us.  He will call 
me if and when this occurs.   So, this might not come to anything.  I will 
let you know if and when he surfaces so we can decisde what we should do next.

In case any of you have tried to contact Sara, she is not in the office today 
(her voice mail message states this).  She has laryngitis.  Her doctor has 
asked her not to talk at all.  She is planning to be in the office tomorrow.  
If possible, could you try to commuicate through email as much as possible.  
She can hardly whisper and I promise you will feel really, really guilty if

Julian,

let's leave it for Barclays to request the guarantee which they no doubt will.

Treasa and David will need to discuss with the currency swaps desk in Houston 
the issue of euro conversion.

Barclays call on the guarantee. If they think about it then they probably
will want the Corp. guarantee. And of course the precedent swap was
guaranteed....we could send out the first draft though and see if they raise
the issue of the guarantee. Do you want to raise the question of
re-denomination into euro with them?

Sara,

I hope you have now received instructions from your commercial swaps team to
put
together an ISDA  currency swap and confirm which ECT Corp will be providing
to
either Enron Europe Power 3 Limited or a subsidiary of that company. The
subsidiary will be receiving dollars under a bond issue and paying pounds
out (a
spot transaction I believe) but will then receive pounds income which it
will
need to convert to dollars to pay interest on the bonds.

The precedent document is the Sutton Bridge currency swap.

Can you please confirm you have been instructed and let us know your timing
for
issuing a document.  The sooner we can see this next week the better.

The bond trustee will as usual require the swap to be backed with legal
opinions
from Enron in-house counsel (Mark Haedicke) re due execution and from V&E
(Terry
Yates) re enforceability. My understanding is that the swap will not be
guaranteed by Corp (correct Julian?).

Linklaters are representing Enron - Julian Davies and Fran Xavier (tel: 171
456
2000). Could you please send them your fax, telephone and email details.
Linklaters have kindly agreed to prepare a first draft of the Mark Haedicke
opinion and to send it out to you Sara.

Thank  you. I look forward to hearing from you.


                         Mark

In regards to the revised confirmations received from Merrill, do you need

The changes on the revisions are for the Payment Date and Fallback Reference 
Price that Marie had asked you about.

Please advise.

Sorry to have to respond via e-mail but I've got laryngitis (although I 
should be in most of the day today).

The actual opening of the agreement is simple because we have a good broker 
relationship and the agreement is acceptable to us.  BUT, the broker WILL NOT 
open the agreement until we can submit the underlying authority which 
includes:

authorizing resolutions (or unanimous consent) from the account party
trading authorization
number of signatures for transacting

Marie previously sent ""samples"" of the the underlying documentation to Robert 
George.

We have not received anything to date.

When we receive the information, we can fax EVERYTHING to the broker and the 
account can be opened immediately and then followed up by original hard 
copies.

Let me know if you have any further questions.  Sara"

next week before our legal conference on Thursday and Friday.  If so, then 
maybe you, Lynn and I can meet to assess the situation.  If not, then let's 
please reschedule our Friday call for Monday or Tuesday of next week.  I can

have to begin taking at home due to the early hour so if we decide on 
Tuesday, it should be after 10:30 am..  Please let me hear from you.

In case any of you have tried to contact Sara, she is not in the office today 
(her voice mail message states this).  She has laryngitis.  Her doctor has 
asked her not to talk at all.  She is planning to be in the office tomorrow.  
If possible, could you try to commuicate through email as much as possible.  
She can hardly whisper and I promise you will feel really, really guilty if 
you ask her to talk.

I'll be happy to deliver any messages to her.  My extension is 3-5968.

Your summary is correct based on information to date (in this regard the 
agreement between ENA and EEFT still requires amendment in respect of RMT and 
I undertake to get this done). 

However, please note that there have been some last minute changes in the 
Japanese tax advice, received I understand only as of last night. Susan Musch 
will be following up on these changes at a meeting today with Sheila Glover 
and Darren Delage, and has undertaken to keep you appraised of the position. 
The effect of the change would be to permit RMT to be the principal for the 
Japanese FX desk, with a Japanese entity acting as agent to arrange the 
transactions. 

Best regards
Janine

With respect to the attached (internal) FX product for EOL, I just wanted to 
verify with you that internal counterparties should transact on EOL with:

(1)  RMT  (as principal for Houston FX desk)

(2)  EEFT as agent for RMT (as principal for London FX desk).  In this 
regard, was the services agreement between ENA and EEFT ever extended to 
include RMT for internal trades? 

(3)  Enron Japan Corp. (as principal for Tokyo FX desk)

There appears to be some confusion since our meeting of November 3.  Thanks.

As you are aware, we are finalizing the participation of Bank of 
Tokyo-Mitsubishi (BTM) into the Alberta Gas Prepay financing.? 

Recall there are three swaps:

(a) Commodity Swap between Enron Canada and RBC(b) Commodity Swap between 
Chase and RBC(c) Interest Rate Swap between Enron Canada and RBC

We will be participating BTM into the agreements to which Enron is party [(a) 
and (c) above].? As a result of this, Enron will not be re-signing any new 
ISDA's etc.?? However, Section 7 to the ISDA Master agreement governing 
Transfers requires the prior written consent for any transfer of ""any 
interest or obligation"" under the Agreement.? Our view is that the 
participation to BTM does qualify as a tranfer of an any ""interest or 
obligation"", ergo we need Enron's consent.? Attached please find a proposed 
Consent from Enron prepared by my lawyer.? This is the only document that we 
require signed by Enron.? Please take note of the key language contained 
therein:

??????? ""Enron hereby consents to RBC assigning a 50% participation interest 
in the Swap Documents to Bank of Tokyo-???? ?????? Mitsubishi, Ltd., New York 
Branch; provided that (a) RBC's rights and obligations under the Swap 
Documents shall remain ??????? unchanged, (b) RBC shall remain solely 
responsible to Enron for the performance of such obligations and (c) Enron 
shall ??????? continue to deal solely and directly with RBC in connection 
with RBC's rights and obligations under the Swap Documents.""

The commodity swap between Chase and RBC will be ""split"" and each of RBC and 
BTM will have a Swap with Chase for one-half the amount.

Sara(s), please advise whether you are comfortable with our approach and 
whether you require any changes to the Consent.? BTM has reviewed the 
Participation agreement and is moving forward to getting the doc's approved 
internally...we're targeting for a close mid next week (the week of Dec 11) 
and accordingly your execution of the Consent within that timeframe would be 
much appreciated.? Given that you continue to deal in all ways with RBC, I 
have not forwarded you a copy of the Participation agreement....

Thanks and have a good weekend!

I am about to finalize comments to the SITA Master ISDA Agreement on behalf 
of ECTRIC.  I need your able assistance with respect to the following:

(1)  SITA has not passed a board resolution authorizing execution of the 
Agreement.  Instead, SITA proposes a certificate stating that its President 
Directeur General or Directeur General have, pursuant to the Articles of 
Association, full power and authority to execute the Agreement or to grant a 
power of attorney to do so.

(2)  SITA has requested evidence of EEFT's authority to sign on behalf of 
ECTRIC.  I have sent a copy of the power of attorney to the lawyer and will 
ask that she direct any questions to you if I am not reachable.

SITA's attorney is Susan Hopkinson at Lovells in Paris.  Her phone is 33153

I will be out of the office Dec. 7 & 8.  Stephanie Panus if assisting with

Mark:

Per our conversation, I understand that the Canadian company has a number of 
outstanding OTC FX transactions with one or more counterparties.  Each of 
those transactions should be documented by a confirmation which confirms the 
economic terms of each deal.  Each confirmation must be subject to (1) an 
existing type of master agreement (such as the ISDA, IFEMA, FEOMA), (2) a 
""deemed"" version of such an agreement or (3) ""terms and conditions"" appearing 
in the confirmation itself.  It is quite likely that in any of these three 
types of confirmations, there are provisions for assignment of trades, credit 
event upon merger, material adverse change, additonal events of default or 
termination, etc.  which may be triggered by the pending acquisiton of the 
Canadian company.  Further, there may be credit issues associated with the 
transactions and/or master agreements (in the form of specific credit 
provisions in a confirmation or a credit annex to the master agreement).  As 
a result, a party attempting to ""step into the shoes of the Canadian company"" 
must review the existing documents, subject to any confidentiality 
restrictions, in order to evaluate the positions and risks associated with 
assuming those positions.

Thus, we need to conduct a thorough due diligence of the financial trading 
positions of the Canadian company.  Please let me know if you have any 
questions.

Sara

Subject: FX Trader in Tokyo =20

Heidi,

In response to your attached e-mail, I am attaching the e-mail message that=
 I=20
sent out yesterday regarding the structure for the FX trader in Tokyo and t=
he=20
EM-Japan traders.  (You were already copied on this but I want to make sure=
=20
that you got it.) =20

In this e-mail, I explain that PWC-Tokyo has recommended following a=20
dependent agent approach for these traders (which is what you reference in=
=20
your attached e-mail).  I recommend this approach saying that it is a=20
pragmatic approach and should be easily implemented.  I talked with Sheila=
=20
Glover and Darren Delage about this approach yesterday evening and they lik=
e=20
it as well.  (In fact, they were also copied on the e-mail regarding the FX=
=20
trader and the EM-Japan traders.)

The following points should be kept in mind in following the dependent agen=
t=20
approach, which I have already discussed with Sheila and Darren:

(1) Agency approach:  Enron Japan would be considered to be an agent of ENA=
. =20
In this role, it would facilitate trades that would be entered into between=
=20
ENA and the third party counterparties.  The trades would be entered into i=
n=20
the name of ENA.  Under this approach, Darren is limited in what he is=20
authorized to do, and his trading parameters will need to be reduced to=20
writing.  These parameters must restrict his activities so that they=20
constitute activities that have a preparatory or auxiliary character.  The=
=20
advice that we received for the FX trader's activities in Australia should=
=20
equally apply to our facts here.  The following is an excerpt from a memo=
=20
that I wrote last year summarizing this advice:

Guidelines and boundaries must be established on what the financial trader=
=20
can do (e.g. price parameters, product parameters, etc.). Activities cannot=
=20
include the negotiation of terms of master contracts, forwards and other=20
derivatives with counterparties. If a master contract must be executed in=
=20
Australia, then it should be executed by an independent agent (such as a=20
lawyer) having a power of attorney from the hedging party. Confirmations=20
should be issued by the hedging party, rather than by EA Finance in Sydney.=
=20
The Australian tax advisor recommended that the financial trader say:  =01&=
My=20
principal will deal with you within these parameters =01(.=018

(2) Darren's employment:  Darren must be considered an employee of Enron=20
Japan so as to avoid ENA being treated as having a permanent establishment =
in=20
Japan.
(3) Darren's agency role:  Darren should not identify himself as an employe=
e=20
of ENA Houston.  He should make it clear that the third parties are enterin=
g=20
into the transactions with ENA as principal.
(4) Service agreement:  A service agreement must be put in place between=20
Enron Japan and ENA (similar to what we did for the FX trader in Sydney).=
=20
Enron Japan should at least initially  be compensated at a cost plus 5%=20
mark-up.  Yesterday evening I also forwarded to Sheila and Darren by e-mail=
=20
the old service agreement that we put in place for the FX trader in Sydney =
so=20
that they could review what terms have been previously used.  (Incidentally=
,=20
the service agreement we put in place between Enron Australia and ENA was=
=20
very similar (almost identical) to the one that was put in place between=20
Enron Europe and ENA for the FX trader in London.)
(5) Potential issues upon Japanese tax audit:  Notwithstanding that this=20
approach is easier to implement, more workable and more pragmatic in=20
approach, we need to be aware that there could be questions upon a Japanese=
=20
tax audit.  In that event, transfer pricing issues could be raised.  That i=
s,=20
the auditors could question whether a cost plus 5% mark-up is commensurate=
=20
with what an unrelated third party would charge for similar services.  We=
=20
would then need to justify that service fee, or if unsuccessful, try to wor=
k=20
out a commission fee that would be acceptable to the Japanese tax auditors.=
 =20
Management needs to be aware of this potential.

I guess I wasn't clear in my attached e-mail.  I am sorry for any=20
inconvenience this may have caused you.  I hope this e-mail better explains=
=20
the recommended structure.  Please let me know if you would like to set up =
a=20
conference call to discuss this further (and let me know who you would like=
=20
on the call).

Best regards,
Susan

Jan-Erland,

I have not yet received the 2001 projections/budget for the Enron Metals=20
trading in Japan.  If you have already sent it, could you please re-send it=

Also, I talked with PWC-Tokyo late last night about structuring for the FX=
=20
trader and Japanese Metals traders to confirm Baker & McKenzie's advice on=
=20
not using a dependent agent structure in Japan.  PWC has advised that=20
although Baker & McKenzie's approach is more technically correct, foreign=
=20
traders usually set up their Japanese trading operations through the use of=
 a=20
dependent agent in Japan.  The Japanese dependent agent is usually reimburs=
ed=20
using cost plus 5%, at least initially.  Then, if the Japanese tax=20
authorities raise questions upon audit, a commission arrangement is general=
ly=20
used, with the question being what should the profit split be between the=
=20
agent and the foreign company.  Whether the Japanese tax authorities raise=
=20
questions upon audit is dependent upon the volume of trades and the magnitu=
de=20
of the trades.  The PWC Japanese tax partner suggested that we use this=20
arrangement for both the FX trader and the EM Japan trades.  I have asked P=
WC=20
to send this advice in writing by tomorrow.

This seems to be a much more pragmatic approach than the one suggested by=
=20
Baker & McKenzie.  And it should be easy to implement by year-end.  However=

management must be aware of the fact that PWC's approach could raise=20

Subject: FX Trader in Tokyo =20

Heidi,

In response to your attached e-mail, I am attaching the e-mail message that=
 I=20
sent out yesterday regarding the structure for the FX trader in Tokyo and t=
he=20
EM-Japan traders.  (You were already copied on this but I want to make sure=
=20
that you got it.) =20

In this e-mail, I explain that PWC-Tokyo has recommended following a=20
dependent agent approach for these traders (which is what you reference in=
=20
your attached e-mail).  I recommend this approach saying that it is a=20
pragmatic approach and should be easily implemented.  I talked with Sheila=
=20
Glover and Darren Delage about this approach yesterday evening and they lik=
e=20
it as well.  (In fact, they were also copied on the e-mail regarding the FX=
=20
trader and the EM-Japan traders.)

The following points should be kept in mind in following the dependent agen=
t=20
approach, which I have already discussed with Sheila and Darren:

(1) Agency approach:  Enron Japan would be considered to be an agent of ENA=
. =20
In this role, it would facilitate trades that would be entered into between=
=20
ENA and the third party counterparties.  The trades would be entered into i=
n=20
the name of ENA.  Under this approach, Darren is limited in what he is=20
authorized to do, and his trading parameters will need to be reduced to=20
writing.  These parameters must restrict his activities so that they=20
constitute activities that have a preparatory or auxiliary character.  The=
=20
advice that we received for the FX trader's activities in Australia should=
=20
equally apply to our facts here.  The following is an excerpt from a memo=
=20
that I wrote last year summarizing this advice:

Guidelines and boundaries must be established on what the financial trader=
=20
can do (e.g. price parameters, product parameters, etc.). Activities cannot=
=20
include the negotiation of terms of master contracts, forwards and other=20
derivatives with counterparties. If a master contract must be executed in=
=20
Australia, then it should be executed by an independent agent (such as a=20
lawyer) having a power of attorney from the hedging party. Confirmations=20
should be issued by the hedging party, rather than by EA Finance in Sydney.=
=20
The Australian tax advisor recommended that the financial trader say:  =01&=
My=20
principal will deal with you within these parameters =01(.=018

(2) Darren's employment:  Darren must be considered an employee of Enron=20
Japan so as to avoid ENA being treated as having a permanent establishment =
in=20
Japan.
(3) Darren's agency role:  Darren should not identify himself as an employe=
e=20
of ENA Houston.  He should make it clear that the third parties are enterin=
g=20
into the transactions with ENA as principal.
(4) Service agreement:  A service agreement must be put in place between=20
Enron Japan and ENA (similar to what we did for the FX trader in Sydney).=
=20
Enron Japan should at least initially  be compensated at a cost plus 5%=20
mark-up.  Yesterday evening I also forwarded to Sheila and Darren by e-mail=
=20
the old service agreement that we put in place for the FX trader in Sydney =
so=20
that they could review what terms have been previously used.  (Incidentally=
,=20
the service agreement we put in place between Enron Australia and ENA was=
=20
very similar (almost identical) to the one that was put in place between=20
Enron Europe and ENA for the FX trader in London.)
(5) Potential issues upon Japanese tax audit:  Notwithstanding that this=20
approach is easier to implement, more workable and more pragmatic in=20
approach, we need to be aware that there could be questions upon a Japanese=
=20
tax audit.  In that event, transfer pricing issues could be raised.  That i=
s,=20
the auditors could question whether a cost plus 5% mark-up is commensurate=
=20
with what an unrelated third party would charge for similar services.  We=
=20
would then need to justify that service fee, or if unsuccessful, try to wor=
k=20
out a commission fee that would be acceptable to the Japanese tax auditors.=
 =20
Management needs to be aware of this potential.

I guess I wasn't clear in my attached e-mail.  I am sorry for any=20
inconvenience this may have caused you.  I hope this e-mail better explains=
=20
the recommended structure.  Please let me know if you would like to set up =
a=20
conference call to discuss this further (and let me know who you would like=
=20
on the call).

Best regards,
Susan

Subject: Enron Metals & FX Traders in Japan =20

Jan-Erland,

I have not yet received the 2001 projections/budget for the Enron Metals=20
trading in Japan.  If you have already sent it, could you please re-send it=
? =20

Also, I talked with PWC-Tokyo late last night about structuring for the FX=
=20
trader and Japanese Metals traders to confirm Baker & McKenzie's advice on=
=20
not using a dependent agent structure in Japan.  PWC has advised that=20
although Baker & McKenzie's approach is more technically correct, foreign=
=20
traders usually set up their Japanese trading operations through the use of=
 a=20
dependent agent in Japan.  The Japanese dependent agent is usually reimburs=
ed=20
using cost plus 5%, at least initially.  Then, if the Japanese tax=20
authorities raise questions upon audit, a commission arrangement is general=
ly=20
used, with the question being what should the profit split be between the=
=20
agent and the foreign company.  Whether the Japanese tax authorities raise=
=20
questions upon audit is dependent upon the volume of trades and the magnitu=
de=20
of the trades.  The PWC Japanese tax partner suggested that we use this=20
arrangement for both the FX trader and the EM Japan trades.  I have asked P=
WC=20
to send this advice in writing by tomorrow.

This seems to be a much more pragmatic approach than the one suggested by=
=20
Baker & McKenzie.  And it should be easy to implement by year-end.  However=
,=20
management must be aware of the fact that PWC's approach could raise=20
questions upon a Japanese tax audit.  Note that if we follow this approach,=
=20
we would need to set up a services agreement between Enron Japan (whichever=
=20
the appropriate entity is) and ENA.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional=20
information.

Best regards,
Susan

I thought we had devised a format for any response.  I'm glad to meet with 
you anytime.  Currently, I have severe laryngitis and I am unable to speak.  
I will probably be limited on Friday as well.  We can manage if you come to

Sara,

I don't think that we ever got around to talking about how we should notify 
Chase of this change.  Could we do that before I leave?  Hopefully sometime 
this week.
Does the ISDA cover publication changes?  Somehow I thought it did.  It does 
doesn't it?  I just can't remember in which section.
Many thanks,

Lucy

Subject: APEA / Chase: Change in Reporting of NGI's 1st of Month Indices

Lucy,

Effective September 1st, Natural Gas Intelligence changed the reporting of 
the California Border and City-Gate 1st of month indices.  These indices were 
formerly reported in a separate table.  That table has been eliminated and 
these indices have been included within the general table.   These changes 
are minor; however, we need to ensure that Chase knows of the change.  Can 
you please handle this?  It affects Glendale, Pasadena and SMUD.

The following are the new definitions:

1.  Malin:  the ""Bidweek Avg."" price for California, Malin, published in 
Natural Gas Intelligence, or successor publication, in the first issue 
published on or about the first Monday of the delivery Month in the table 
identified as ""Spot Gas Prices"".

2. Kern River Station: the ""Bidweek Avg"" price for California, Kern River 
Station, PG&E, published in Natural Gas Intelligence, or successor 
publication, in the first issue published on or about the first Monday of the 
delivery Month in the table identified as ""Spot Gas Prices"".

3.  Topock: the ""Bidweek Avg"" price for California, Southern Cal. Border 
Avg., published in Natural Gas Intelligence, or successor publication, in the 
first issue published on or about the first Monday of the delivery Month in 
the table identified as ""Spot Gas Prices"".

4.  PG&E Citygate: the ""Bidweek Avg"" price for California, PG&E Citygate, 
published in Natural Gas Intelligence, or successor publication, in the first 
issue published on or about the first Monday of the delivery Month in the 
table identified as ""Spot Gas Prices"". 

Glendale and Pasadena are affected at Topock.  SMUD is affected at all four 
points.

Let me know if you need additional clarification or information.

Thanks for your help.

Laird

 A broker account was set up under Friedman, Billings and Ramsey who clear 
their transactions through Bear Stears.  This was a special purpose account 
set up to facilitate the sale of DevXenergy for Jedi I.  We plan on closing 
this account as soon as the trade settles.  If you have any questions, please 
give me a call at extension 31439.

		 Subject: Enron's Authorized Trader Lists

Per review of the Risk Management Policy and discussion with Rick Buy, the 
Chief Risk Officer is responsible for maintaining the list of authorized 
traders for Enron.  I am charged by Rick with the policy administration 
responsibility, and consequently, Veronica and I have been in the process of 
obtaining updated authorized trader lists.  I understand from talking with 
Legal today that in the past Mike Moscoso from Shona's group maintained this 
list and provided it to Legal, so I think there are several versions of 
authorized trader lists floating around.  I noticed this since the brokerage 
agreements and officer's compliance certificate that I have to sign had 
attached a list that was inconsistent with our records in RAC.

Anyway, we're getting the ""official"" list together - hopefully by Monday, at 
least for the Enron North America traders - and we will provide to both of 
your groups.  Then going forward we'll get the lists posted on the RAC Market 
Risk Management web site and keep it updated for trader turnover/reassignment 
so you can both access any time you need to.

Best regards,

Cassandra."

I have still not received the above-mentioned comments.  I have also not 
received EWEB's proposed form of legal opinion.  I will go ahead and 
blackline the Schedule once again.

When the lawyers last spoke, we agreed to execute all docs prior to the end 
of the year.

Would you please call EWEB and inquire about these items?

Thanks.  Sara"

A second EWEB question:

EWEB wants the definition of ""Applicable Rate""  to remain without changing to 
the Non-default Rate if the payee is the defaulting party.  They say they 
must have a ""balanced rate"".  Please let me hear from you.  Sara"

Can you provide me with a blackline of one of the confirms below marked 
against the draft which Enron marked up and faxed to Steve on September 1, 
2000?  The current format contains a number of changes and it would be easier 
to review.  The directory on that document reads ""Ext. ID[.]"".  We want to

I attach a final draft of the equity forward confirmation for the two
outstanding equity forward transactions. We need to fill in the: (1) par
value of your stock in the definition of Shares in each of the attached that
appears on page 3 for the May 8, 2000 trade and on page 2 for the August 4
trade; and (2) date when the share repurchase program was publicly announced
that is page 16 of the May 8, 2000 transaction and on page 15 of the August
4, 2000 transaction.

If the attached is acceptable to you, please advise me of the above so that
we may prepare execution copies and finalize these confirmations.

     Jeff,

     Attached is a draft of the equity forward contract which we believe is
     compliant with EITF Issue 00-19.  Please have your auditors review it
     to determine if this contract should get equity treatment under 00-19.

     The document is blacklined against your outstanding equity forward
     contract so that you can easily identify the changes.

     I'll touch base with you on Monday.

     Regards,
     Christine

I have been speaking with Soma regarding the markup of the collateral

Enron/Chase ISDA limiting the collateral to direct obligations of the US.
We needed to determine whether we could accept your proposal.  I have been

the amendments can be executed.  Please contact me regarding how you would
like to accomplish this.

Just got your voice mail.  I have severe laryngitis and I cannot use my voice 
today or tomorrow.  Sorry.  We can e-mail or speak through Marie.  
Yes, we have a blackline.  Marie has finished going through it and I need to 
review (the lawyers blacklined the latest version over the second blackline 
so we had to revert to a comparision to the first blackline!).  Re: the 
credit support annex, I believe all is resolved.  However, I believe there is 
still an L/C issue.  If there is an L/C default (say the issuer is 
downgraded), Tiger is insisting that we post cash immediately without the 
right to post a  substitute L/C within two days.  I am not absolutely certain 
of this, but Carol has a 2 pm call with the lawyers and I will listen.  I 
don't know if Tiger responded to our guaranty.  I was out sick yesterday.  
Hope this brings you up to date.  SS  "

Chris:

The master you are referring to was drafted in March, 1999 in the name of 
""Air Liquide America Corp."" and needs to be updated from both a credit and 
legal perspective.  Last time, Kelly Minear had to visit the counterparty's 
office to review financials since the company was private.  We will need an 
updated credit worksheet to prepare a new draft.

Tracy and Ed:  Will  one of you update the prior credit to begin the process?

Thanks.  Sara

Sara:

A customer of John Malowney, Air Liquide, wants to revisit the possibility of 
executing a Master ISDA.  He said he thought we had already done one and sent 
it to them but he has lost it.  Can you check to see if you can find it and 
e-mail it to me?

Sam:

Don't you have a new address by now?  I remember you said that you were 
moving into a plush high-rise overlooking the great southern city of Atlanta, 
home of the Peach Bowl!   Please email me and let me know.

A belated thanks for the birthday card.  I had a fabulous birthday in Napa 
Valley at Auberge d'Soleil with my little sister and friends.  We drank 
wonderful wines and dined in great restaurants - and had great weather.

Hope you're doing well.

Have you started any new business ventures?  Maybe taken Wendy's to Amelia 
Island Plantation?  Or better yet, purchased the water rights to Palm Springs?

I'm just hangin' in Houston, same old job, etc.  I joined my two friends 
Monty and Keith for our annual birthday celebration at Galatoire's about two 
weeks ago.  It's always great fun.   I think I get to plan a reunion of 
Gordon, Arata et al ex-pats.  There are about thirty of us scattered around 
the country.

My regards to Beverly and Helen.

In connection with our disussion regarding Market Quotation and ""Reference 
Market - makers"" in the Schedule (specifically Enron's request to delete 
clause (b) to the Section 12 definition), I am advised that it would be 
difficult to locate four leading dealers with offices in the same city.  With 
respect to the outstanding trades, for example, we would like to know which 
city has  four leading dealers  for quoting Mid-Columbia prices?  Please let

Thanks for the email update. Sorry to hear you're sick and hope the voice

I thought we discussed the l/c issue and agreed that if the l/c defaulted on 
payment that we would go to cash. The question was timing, i.e. was it 2 days 
or 5 days before the cash was do in. I have an appointment out of the office 
at 3pm my time and won't be bale to join the call, but if it helps I can call 
to follow up when I am free at aroung 5PM my time.

Let me know how the call goes.

Just got your voice mail.  I have severe laryngitis and I cannot use my voice

Yes, we have a blackline.  Marie has finished going through it and I need to 
review (the lawyers blacklined the latest version over the second blackline 
so we had to revert to a comparision to the first blackline!).  Re: the 
credit support annex, I believe all is resolved.  However, I believe there is 
still an L/C issue.  If there is an L/C default (say the issuer is 
downgraded), Tiger is insisting that we post cash immediately without the 
right to post a  substitute L/C within two days.  I am not absolutely certain 
of this, but Carol has a 2 pm call with the lawyers and I will listen.  I 
don't know if Tiger responded to our guaranty.  I was out sick yesterday.  
Hope this brings you up to date.  SS

		 Subject: CSFB and UBS Confirmations


Sara,

I am still working on the share repurchase program question but wanted to
get to you what answers I had.

1. On UBS, the language we discussed could be drafted as follows:

""In the event the Trigger Price is increased to equal the Other Trigger
Price, the Determined Amount shall be reduced so that the Effective Share
Price is increased in direct proportion to the increase in the Trigger
Price.  The ""Effective Share Price"" shall be the result obtained by dividing
X by Y where ""X"" equals the product of the Price Per Share multiplied by the
Number of Shares, and ""Y"" equals the Number of Shares plus the Determined
Amount.""

2. I was able to find a summary of the November 15-16, 2000 Emerging
Issues Task Force meeting discussing the ""best efforts"" language in
increasing the authorized shares.  I would propose revising the stricken
language in 3(a) to read as follows:

""In the event that, but for this Section 3, titled ""Other Provisions,"" Party
B would be obligated to deliver a number of Shares equal to the Determined
Amount plus the Excess Shares, Party B shall have an ongoing obligation to
satisfy delivery of the Excess Shares; provided however that the number of
Excess Shares to be delivered hereby shall not exceed [________] shares.
Party B may, at its sole option, satisfy delivery of the Excess Shares by
using its best efforts to increase its Authorized Shares or by delivery of a
cash payment equal to the [product obtained by multiplying the Excess Shares
by the Final Price].""

Please confirm that the formula for the cash payment is appropriate.  Their
language puts a cap on the number of shares to be delivered but that cap is
tied to a value making the number of shares to be delivered indeterminate
and therefor outside your control.  The cap drafted above solves this
problem.  It is important to note that no interest can accrue while Party B
is waiting to get approval to increase its authorized shares, if so the
obligation would be accounted for as debt.

1.  Please note the revised Threshold which we previously discussed.
2.  We accepted Portland as a forum for arbitration.
3.  We need to discuss your invoicing procedure.

Subject: Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc.

Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc. (""EMMT"") has agreed to provide to 
ENA two (2) separate guaranty agreements:  (i) the first guaranty from Edison 
Mission Energy for four (4) specific swaps that were previously entered into 
with ENA, and (ii) the second guaranty from Edison Mission Midwest Holdings 
Co. for other financial transactions (previously entered into and for new 
swaps).

EMMT had previously provided to me their guaranty format (which actually 
looks like a combination of a previously accepted physical power gty and the 
financial guaranty format that ENA sends with ISDA drafts).  I have taken 
EMMT's format and took a stab at reviewing/commenting on their format by 
following our accepted format.  There are two guaranty format attachments 
below that have my red-lined comments for ENA financial legal's review.  The 
third attachment is my suggestion to add the 4 executed confirms for the 
Edison Mission Energy gty as a Schedule A to the gty (for your review and 
comments as well).

In summary and for clarification, the terms for both guaranties are as 
follows:
(i)  Guarantor:  Edison Mission Midwest Holdings Co.
Covered CP:  Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc.
Beneficiary:  Enron North America Corp.
Effective Date of Gty:  August 28, 2000
Execution Date of Gty:  December 21, 2000 (or as soon as possible)
Expiry Date:  open
Amount:  $15,000,000
Products Covered:  swaps, options, or other financially-settled derivative 
transactions (NO executed ISDA)

(ii)  Guarantor:  Edison Mission Energy
Covered CP:  Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc.
Beneficiary:  Enron North America Corp.
Execution and Effective Date of Gty:  December 21, 2000 (or as soon as 
possible)
Expiry Date:  January 31, 2002
Amount:  $35,000,000
Specific Financial Transactions Covered:  four (4) specific confirms.  
Transaction ID's are:  NA8930.1, NA9105.1, NA9106.1, NC8086.1 (NO executed 
ISDA)

I made efforts on wearing my ""legal hat"" by the red-lined comments to the 
guaranty format.  Feel free to modify/accept/add comments, etc.  I would 
appreciate your immediate attention to the requested reviews.  I am available 
in Portland at 503-464-8755 or (cell 503-807-5633) should you have any 
questions regarding the aforementioned.  In the essence of time, Credit is 
requesting that legal provide comments given that there is NO EXECUTED MASTER 
ISDA.  It is critical that we accept the guaranties first once negotiated, 
and pursue an ISDA early next year.

Thanks for all of your prompt attention regarding this matter.

Regards,
Tracy

Stephanie,

I am following up on the above-referenced Agreement on behalf of Richard
Weiss of this office. Before we can send the execution copies to our Zurich
office for signature, we have to obtain an Apostille for the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws which you provided. Presently we are waiting on
that. The Guarantee has been prepared and the legal opinion is in the
process of being signed. I hope to have everything to you by next week
sometime.

Please feel free to reply with any questions you might have.

Thank you,
Kimberly

     Attached is the newly marked up version of the contract.  The
     highlights are as follows (not all changes are addressed below):

     1)  Dividend language has been inserted on page 6.  We may have to do
     something with the structure since there are two ""Method of
     Adjustments.""

     2)  On page 11 and 12, we reinserted our language in sections (iii)
     and (v) but conformed them to your Registration Provisions.  We needed
     to reinsert the language in (iii) for section (v) to work.

     3) On page 13, I reinserted our ""best efforts ongoing obligation""
     language.  The reason I did this is because I realized that they way
     you had it drafted in the email does not work from an accounting
     perspective.

     4)  On page 14, 1st paragraph, the words ""but prior to the Settlement
     Date"" was added for accounting purposes.

     5)  The new ratcheting Trigger Price language was added on page 14.

     Please call me after you have reviewed the markup to verify that we
     are in agreement on the terms.

     Regards,
     Christine

Trigger/Determined Amount inverse relationship:

""In the event the Trigger Price is increased to equal the Other Trigger
Price, the Determined Amount shall be reduced so that the Effective Share
Price is increased in direct proportion to the increase in the Trigger
Price.  The ""Effective Share Price"" shall be the result obtained by
dividing
X by Y where ""X"" equals the product of the Price Per Share multiplied by
the
Number of Shares, and ""Y"" equals the Number of Shares plus the Determined
Amount.""


Paragraph 3(a) first paragraph, 3rd sentence replacement:


""In the event that, but for this Section 3, titled ""Other Provisions,""
Party
B would be obligated to deliver a number of Shares equal to the Determined
Amount plus the Excess Shares, Party B shall have an ongoing obligation to
satisfy delivery of the Excess Shares; provided however that the number of
Excess Shares to be delivered hereby shall not exceed [________] shares.
Party B may, at its sole option, satisfy delivery of the Excess Shares by
using its best efforts to increase its Authorized Shares or by delivery of
a
cash payment equal to the [product obtained by multiplying the Excess
Shares
by the Final Price].""

Sara:

As we discussed this evening, I attach a revised draft based on our
discussions and, aside from the jurisdiction issue, have highlighted what I
think are the open issues in brackets.  I apologize in advance if I left
anything out and look forward to discussing this further with you tomorrow
morning.

Beth Ann:

I received your message and tried to speak with CSFB and Jim Armogida.  In 
each instance, unfortunately, I had to leave voice mails.  It was just about 
2 hours ago that I told CSFB that we were done (having left the negotiation 
of Paragraph 10.1 to Jim)!  

I am forwarding the latest UBS comments to you just in case I have the urge 
to call you for advice.

Have a Merry Christmas.  I'm off to New Orleans this evening for the holiday 
weekend.  In fact, there's a new Susan Spicer restaurant called ""Herbsaint"" 
and I should be dining there in about 6 hours.

Thanks for your help.  Sara

     Dear Sara, Clint and Jeff:

     David Kelly reviewed the contract I sent you last night and asked me
     to make the following additional changes:

     1)  In Registration Provisions, change in two places ""this equity
     derivatives transaction"" to read ""this Transaction.""

     2)  Move dividend adjustment language to the ""Amendment of the Equity
     Definitions"" section.

     3)  On page 14, I inserted the necessary ratcheting trigger language
     that I inadvertently deleted yesterday.

     The revised document is attached.

     As Jeff and I agreed today, we are going to restructure the floating
     rate forward so that it will be a fixed rate forward.  We will
     therefore use the same confirmation for both transactions.

     We will restructure the forward as of 12/26/00 using $73.6797 as the
     base price.  This price represents the forward price as of 12/12
     ($73.5941) plus interest up to 12/26 ($0.2107) less the dividend paid
     on 12/20 ($0.1251).

     The rate we will use to calculate the interest on the forward will be
     interpolated between 3 and 4 month LIBOR set on 12/26 plus 65 basis
     points.  The forward price will be reduced by the expected dividend of
     $0.125 per share paid around 3/20/01.

     The maturity of the forward will remain April 12, 2001.

     I will be on vacation next week but Mike Collins will be able to help
     you.  He can be reached at 203-719-8385.

     Happy Holidays to you all!

     Regards,
     Christine

Will I have your CSA before 3 pm Houston Time today?

Sara:  Thanks for the revised schedule and comments.  I will be reviewing
and discussing them with EWEB tomorrow (Friday, 12/22).  In the meantime,
attached for your review is our draft form of legal opinion resulting from
our discussion last week.

Perhaps we can arrange time for a conference call on Tuesday, 12/26/00, to
finalize our negotiations?

Jim:

Attached is a revised Schedule.  We have accepted most of your changes.  I
believe that the outstanding issues include:

1.  Please note the revised Threshold which we previously discussed.
2.  We accepted Portland as a forum for arbitration.
3.  We need to discuss your invoicing procedure.
4.  We are waiting to comment back on the revised reps pending receipt of
the CSA and legal opinion.
5.  We have added some language to the recording provision to acknowledge
internal recording destruction policies.
6.  We have not revised the Reference Market-maker provision.  Have you had
a chance to consider my email of 12/19/00?

Please let us know when we will receive the remaining documentation so that
we can finalize our negotiations.

Regards.  Sara

I am not sure which of you handles the commodity swaps so I am sending this 
to all of you.? The final Pricing Date for the Commodity Swap (your reference 
Q19197) is today and we noticed a discrepancy in the swap we have with you 
and the one with Chase.? In our Chase swap we specified that the Pricing 
Dates for Floating Price are each Friday in the Calculation Period subject to 
adjustment in accordance with the Preceding Business Day Convention.? No 
Business Day Convention was specified in the swap we have with you and it 
will be an issue as US Thanksgiving in November was on a Friday.? Since the 
Floating Payments we make to Chase (which flow back to you) need to match the 
payments you give to us, we need to amend our swap with you to specify 
Preceding Business Day Convention.? Can you let me know if this is acceptable 
and I will prepare an amendment or please call me to discuss.

As discussed, the RBC/Enron swap confirmation needs to be amended so that the 
Pricing Dates are subject to the Preceding Business Day Convention.? As the 
original commodity swap confirmation was prepared by Enron therefore, can you 
please send out an amended confirmation which deletes Floating Price and 
Pricing Date(s) in its entirety and replaces it with the attached.? The 
amended confirmation should be sent to Ruth-Ann Marchis for signature.? Her

     Dear Sara, Clint and Jeff:

     David Kelly reviewed the contract I sent you last night and asked me
     to make the following additional changes:

     1)  In Registration Provisions, change in two places ""this equity
     derivatives transaction"" to read ""this Transaction.""

     2)  Move dividend adjustment language to the ""Amendment of the Equity
     Definitions"" section.

     3)  On page 14, I inserted the necessary ratcheting trigger language
     that I inadvertently deleted yesterday.

     The revised document is attached.

     As Jeff and I agreed today, we are going to restructure the floating
     rate forward so that it will be a fixed rate forward.  We will
     therefore use the same confirmation for both transactions.

     We will restructure the forward as of 12/26/00 using $73.6797 as the
     base price.  This price represents the forward price as of 12/12
     ($73.5941) plus interest up to 12/26 ($0.2107) less the dividend paid
     on 12/20 ($0.1251).

     The rate we will use to calculate the interest on the forward will be
     interpolated between 3 and 4 month LIBOR set on 12/26 plus 65 basis
     points.  The forward price will be reduced by the expected dividend of
     $0.125 per share paid around 3/20/01.

     The maturity of the forward will remain April 12, 2001.

     I will be on vacation next week but Mike Collins will be able to help
     you.  He can be reached at 203-719-8385.

     Happy Holidays to you all!

     Regards,
     Christine

Jim and Sara:

Jim, I received your voice mail and apologize for taking so long to get back
to you.  I attach a copy of the last draft we discussed that contains the
new jurisdiction language.  I used some of your suggested language, ISDA's
section 13 wording and then just lifted the rest from the language in the
indemnity to the engagement letter that I faxed to you earlier today.
Please let me know if this is acceptable.

Thanks,

Sharen:

In connection with the two (2) swap confirmations which you are revising 
(from a ""Deemed ISDA"" format to a regular ISDA format), I ask that you please 
contact  Stephanie to review the final forms.  Please note the following:

(1)  Melissa's prior ""Deemed ISDA"" drafts (dated Nov. 22, 2000) show ENA swap 
nos. as 447459.4 and 447459.02.  One of your confims doesn't match:  it says 
447459.04.  Please verify the correct number.

(2)  You can eliminate the ""Payment Date(s)"" section from the General Terms 
because individual Payment Dates appear in both the Fixed and Floating 
Details.

After either Tana or Stephanie have approved, please email to EWEB as follows 
(with a copy to Holli Krebs):

jdeason@chbh.com
Dick.Varner@eweb.eugene.or.us

NOTE TO STEPHANIE:  copies of my markups  and the Deemed ISDA's are located 
in a file entitled ""EWEB confirmations"".  Also, the ISDA has not been signed 
but will be dated October 30, 2000."

ED:

EWEB has requested a blackline of the ISDA and is ready to sign next week.  
Your MAC references the ""Electric System"" which is defined in the Bond 
Indenture which I sent to you earlier today.  It looks to me like the 
Electric System includes physical and intangible assets acquired by the Board 
as a separate utility system, including generating and transmission 
facilities and the Trojan Project (not sure what this is).  I've asked 
Stephanie to revise our docs to incorporate these definitions.  Please review 
the CSA when Stephanie sends it to you (and comment) and I can send first 
thing on Tuesday.  Thanks.  Sara

Stephanie:  Please send Ed a copy of the blacklined CSA when you are done."

Sorry that I didn't have a chance to call you again today.  After reviewing 
the appendix (Board resolution summary), I would like to request an opinion 
from EWEB's bond counsel that swap/other transaction payments are payable 
from the Operating Fund (together and in parity with other operating costs) 
and precede EWEB's debt service payments.

Also, can you please describe EWEB's Master Resolution (relevant to long term 
bonded indebtedness) as this is to be referenced in Larry Cable's legal 
opinion.

I will be back in the office on Tuesday, Jan. 2.  Have a happy new year.

Happy New Year!

I have assigned you to this former Marie Heard file.  We need to overnight 
copies of the master agreement (boilerplate and all) to Neel Lemon in 
Dallas.  He does not need ENA's or the CP's background documentation.  You 
can send the ENE guaranty.  This company has undergone a franchise tax 
restructuring and has survived as a limited partnership which we are in the 
process of evaluating.  I'll bring the file to you.   Details to follow 
soon.  SS

All:

Following is a list of outsanding items:

(1)  ISDA Master Agreement (Schedule and Credit Support Annex)
        I need to better understand EWEB's proposed settlement language.  ENA 
generally sends an invoice when the counterparty owes a payment (but not  
when ENA owes a payment).  The invoice reflects the outstanding transactions 
for a given Calculation Period and the net amount owed.  ENA can   generate 
this invoice in all cases.  Does EWEB intend that BOTH parties always send 
reciprocal invoices?  Is is necessary that the Calc Agent ALSO  make a phone 
call?  What does EWEB's language ""separate invoices and documentation 
covering each Transaction sufficient to permit the other   party to comply 
with its interanl accounting and record keeping procedures concerning 
individual Transactions"" mean?

 Please call me to resolve.

 When can we execute?

(2)  Cable Huston legal opinion:  please add

 (1)  opening paragraph:  ""(iii)  the Confirmations for Transactions ENA 
Contracts Nos. 447459.02 and 447459.4 each dated October 30, 2000 ...""

 (2)  Paragraph 12 prior to the period in the first sentence:  ""as  those 
terms are defined in the Master Resolution adopted by the EWEB Board on June  
16, 1986, as supplemented""

(3)  the two (2) confirmations
 These require execution by EWEB.  When will this be done?

(4)  Bond Counsel opinion
 Dick, I sent you  an email on Friday.  ENA is pleased to discuss with your 
counsel.  Please refer to Larry's legal opinion:  the deleted Paragraph 10  
of the December 21, 2000 draft and the Paragraph 12 of the  December 30, 2000 
draft for the type of information requested.

Please let me know if I have left out any items.  I would like to finalize 
documentation today.

I have reviewed the attachment and it is correct.  We should attach and 
return one to Phil.  We need one copy for the file, credit and Soma.  I'm not

I checked with Samantha.  The counterparty is holding two orignal ISDA 
documents (complete with boilerplate and Schedule/CSA) and ENA resolutions 
(in the form of unanimous consents) and incumbency.  Sam will check on the 
ENE guaranty.  

There is nothing more that we can do unless you want us to call the 
counterparty/lawyer.

Please advise.  Sara"

Dear Danny 

We have had extensive discussions with Rabo concerning deal mechanics, and 
the relevant documentary issues.? Here is a summary of the salient points, 
none of which should hopefully be problematic:

1.????? Notwithstanding the structural logic, Rabo are not keen to purchase 
Psyche (the feeling is that it would cause all kinds of internal problems, 
and might disturb the credit process which to date is running smoothly).? As 
such, we should revert to the original idea of payments to Psyche by Heracles 
being irrevocably assigned to RBC, who will then assign them to? Rabo as a 
part of our deal with them.? We note that as currently drafted, the payments 
by Heracles to Psyche would still take place.? It would obviously be 
preferable if Heracles could be directed to make payments directly to RBC.? 
Alternatively, EAH would need to sign a direction on day one (as Member of 
Psyche) that all payments received from Heracles should be paid to RBC.? We 
understand that EAH would give a charge over the Member Interest of Psyche in 
favour of RBC.

2.????? The Sales Agency Agreement should lapse, as it currently allows. 

3.????? In its place, either a version of the old clause 6.07 should be 
reinserted into the Aeneas LLC agreement, or a new Sales Agency Agreement 
would be struck with Rabo, in either event stipulating a mandatory sale of 
the EOG shares (under Rule 144) in the event of either a failed auction, or a 
valid auction with Rabo as winning bidder.? There would be no other trigger 
events (ie no necessity for Enron to be downgraded). 

4.????? Rabo will negotiate directly with ENA/Enron on the EOG market swap, 
and ISDA. 

5.????? Rabo and RBC will negotiate as between themselves on the TRS and 
ISDA. 

At present, we are all shooting for execution on Jan 15th.? 

Kind regards 

David Bermingham

Subject: Re: Cerberus 

Attached are first drafts of the following documents to be used in 
connection with the insertion of an insurance company into the 
transaction: (1) Assignment and Waiver Agreement, (2) Swap Confirmation 
between the Agent and the Insurance Company (blacklined against the 
current Cerberus Swap Confirmation) and (3) Instrument of Assignment 
whereby Aeneas will assign the balance of its note to RBC (blacklined 
against the Assignment executed on November 30, 2000). 
? 
With regard to the Swap schedule to be entered into between the Agent 
and the Insurance Company, it would be helpful to know whether RBC and 
the Insurance Company have entered into any recent Swap transactions so 
we can follow the general provisions. 
? 
I believe that RBC was going to produce a draft Swap confirmation for 
the Swap to be entered into between ENA and the Insurance Company, but 
please could RBC confirm.? It also would be helpful to see an example of 
a Swap schedule which may have been entered into between Enron and the 
Insurance Company in a different transaction (if one exists). 
? 
With regard to the Sales Agency Agreement, it would be our preference 
still to have RBC as the party to the Sales Agency Agreement, but 
agreeing to act at the direction of the Insurance Company in certain 
circumstances. 
? 
I will be in our Houston office for most of Thursday in Conference Room 
42 Main at 713-220-4242, returning to Dallas Thursday evening when I 
will be contactable at 214-659-4645.

Clint Freeland asked that we resend our forward confirmation template to 
you.  It is attached below.
Also, we will send a draft of our ISDA Master Agreement (Schedule only,  no 
boilerplate) to you shortly.  Can you provide me with the name of your 
attorney so that we can email directly?  It seems that Enron North America 
Corp. is currently negotiating an ISDA with First Union National Bank and 
sent a new ISDA draft to the attention of Delene Travella on 11/08/00.  There 
may be an efficient way to handle both master agreements simultaneously.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for resending it.  After going through our files, I did see where
you had sent it last month, and we are currently working on it.
I am aware that we are about to finalize an ISDA with Enron North America,
but I wasn't sure if the provisions in the schedules would be the same given
that the ENE share transactions would be documented under the Enron Corp
ISDA.  I'm sure the provisions are similar and we will be able to fast track
the ENE Corp. document.  Our internal negotiator's e-mail is
vijay.suchdev@funb.com (who I believe has dealt with you in his former life
at Lehman Brothers)

Dear Sara,

Attached please find our response to the draft Amendment to the CSA
for the above-referenced Agreement.  You will note that I have added
some additional language which our Legal Dept. prefers to include in
Amendments, which I trust will be acceptable to you as well.  As
mentioned briefly over the telephone the other day, I have also
incorporated some changes with respect to Letter of Credit provisions.

The changes to the LC terms are those which our Credit Department is
requiring as a result of a review of Cargill's LC language.  The main
issue is that an LC issued as collateral can no longer be transferable.
I note from the file on our ISDA negotiations that Enron may have
preferred transferability in order to be able to transfer an LC to
its Affiliates.  If this is still the case, we can certainly discuss
options which may specify and limit transferability accordingly.

I look forward to your response at your earliest opportunity.

Regards,
Mara Alexander

What is the formal format we have for notifying Chase?  Do I need to send 
them the edition that announced the change or ???  
What is your suggestion?
I bring this up only because we were so adamant about creating the 
confirmation and then e-mailing it over to Chase so that they could be the 
confirming party.

~I mean, do we need to draft the changes that we want on the confirm and send 
it over to them and ask them to change the confirm???

~Or is all of this covered under the ISDA and we only need to make them aware 
that  the publication made some changes?

Sara,

I don't think that we ever got around to talking about how we should notify 
Chase of this change.  Could we do that before I leave?  Hopefully sometime 
this week.
Does the ISDA cover publication changes?  Somehow I thought it did.  It does 
doesn't it?  I just can't remember in which section.
Many thanks,

Lucy

Subject: APEA / Chase: Change in Reporting of NGI's 1st of Month Indices

Lucy,

Effective September 1st, Natural Gas Intelligence changed the reporting of 
the California Border and City-Gate 1st of month indices.  These indices were 
formerly reported in a separate table.  That table has been eliminated and 
these indices have been included within the general table.   These changes 
are minor; however, we need to ensure that Chase knows of the change.  Can 
you please handle this?  It affects Glendale, Pasadena and SMUD.

The following are the new definitions:

1.  Malin:  the ""Bidweek Avg."" price for California, Malin, published in 
Natural Gas Intelligence, or successor publication, in the first issue 
published on or about the first Monday of the delivery Month in the table 
identified as ""Spot Gas Prices"".

2. Kern River Station: the ""Bidweek Avg"" price for California, Kern River 
Station, PG&E, published in Natural Gas Intelligence, or successor 
publication, in the first issue published on or about the first Monday of the 
delivery Month in the table identified as ""Spot Gas Prices"".

3.  Topock: the ""Bidweek Avg"" price for California, Southern Cal. Border 
Avg., published in Natural Gas Intelligence, or successor publication, in the 
first issue published on or about the first Monday of the delivery Month in 
the table identified as ""Spot Gas Prices"".

4.  PG&E Citygate: the ""Bidweek Avg"" price for California, PG&E Citygate, 
published in Natural Gas Intelligence, or successor publication, in the first 
issue published on or about the first Monday of the delivery Month in the 
table identified as ""Spot Gas Prices"". 

Glendale and Pasadena are affected at Topock.  SMUD is affected at all four 
points.

Let me know if you need additional clarification or information.

Thanks for your help.

Laird

Dick:  

After our conversation, I spoke with our settlements people again who 
requested an EWEB invoice when Enron owes money to EWEB.  I propose that we 
add a section to the Schedule entitled ""Accounts"" (Part 3(h)) as follows:

""Prior to each payment date for any Transaction, Party A (ENA) shall provide 
Party B with an invoice reflecting the net payment owed by a party.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Party B shall provide Party A with an invoice 
prior to any payment date on which Party A owes a net payment to Party B.  
With respect to all payments hereunder, and except as otherwise directed in 
writing, the parties shall comply with the following payment instructions:

[bank, account no., ABA no.]""

Please provide me with EWEB's account data and let me know if you have any 
comments.  I'll send the blackline immediately after I hear from you.

Also, I have not received EXECUTED CONFIRMATIONS.  Have these been sent to 
anyone at Enron?  Sara

Subject: CMPC Fiancial Deal

Gustavo,

CMPC would like to sell us fixed financial newsprint for 3 years (2000-3000 
tons per month).  I quoted a bid of $596/mt based on the RISI East index and 
$598/mt based on the PPW index.  Going forward all price questions should be 
referred to Jay, and the final price would need to be confirmed at the time 
of deal closure.

Alejandro and Francisco would like to review a draft of a contract, and a 
draft is currently being completed in Legal. You should call to confirm where 
they would like the legal documents sent.  I presume that they would like one 
set to go to their attorneys in NY and one set to themselves in Chile.

Their Contact information:

Alejandro Espinosa  56-24-41-2271  aespinosa@gerencia.cmpc.cl
Francisco Ruiz-Tagle  56-24-41-2271  fruiztagle@gerencia.cmpc.cl

Your language is fine.  I will get the bank info to you tomorrow.

We faxed back the confirm yesterday.  Our mgmt assistant did it.  If you need 
the name of the recipient, I can get that for you.

Dick:

After our conversation, I spoke with our settlements people again who
requested an EWEB invoice when Enron owes money to EWEB.  I propose that we
add a section to the Schedule entitled ""Accounts"" (Part 3(h)) as follows:

""Prior to each payment date for any Transaction, Party A (ENA) shall
provide Party B with an invoice reflecting the net payment owed by a party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Party B shall provide Party A with an
invoice prior to any payment date on which Party A owes a net payment to
Party B.  With respect to all payments hereunder, and except as otherwise
directed in writing, the parties shall comply with the following payment
instructions:

[bank, account no., ABA no.]""

Please provide me with EWEB's account data and let me know if you have any
comments.  I'll send the blackline immediately after I hear from you.

Also, I have not received EXECUTED CONFIRMATIONS.  Have these been sent to
anyone at Enron?  Sara

I think it is my turn to take a vacation.  I would like to take the week of 
December 13 off.  I hope this is OK with everyone.  I need to get my request 
for a temp in ASAP so we can try and get who we want.  Let me know your temp 
""wish list"".  We only have one floor floater and I'm sure several admins will 
be off if it is like last year.  It is hard for me to believe I have been on 
the floor a year.  Enough of my sentiment.

Thanks,

Earlier this year, I negotiated this agreement with GS&C.  I cannot locate 
the agreement so GS&C is sending a copy.  The Enron party is ENA.  We now 
need to amend the authorized trader list which I will email to you.  ENA's 
use of GS&C's platform is for trading US treasuries, agencies, money market, 
corporates, JGB's.  We need to:

(1)  remove Harry Arora (who was the sole authorized trader)

(2)  add the following:       Darren Delage
   Shane Dallmann
   Ellen Su
   Pushkar Shahi
   Gary Hickerson

THIS IS A VERY HIGH PRIORITY FOR GARY AND WE SHOULD TRY TO COMPLETE TODAY.

Tom:

I'm trying to finalize the ISDA Master Agreement with these guys.  We have 
one issue:

If there is a long-term market disruption event (i.e. over 3 days), and we 
have no fallback price, then we negotiate a price and ENA would normally 
obtain 2 quotes and average them.  Our position is that we prefer to obtain 
the quotes because if a disruption were to occur, we would obtain quotes for 
hundreds of deals in the same manner (because our agreements will all have 
the same provisions) and it is possible that 4 quotes may not be available.

NYSEG would like for each of ENA and NYSEG to obtain 2 quotes and then 
average the 4 quotes.

Are you agreeable to this?

Sara

Below is a document containing ""General Terms and Conditions"" which is ALWAYS 
attached to a financial confirmation when the parties have no executed master 
agreement.  If Ed, Tracy or someone in credit needs to add credit to the 
transaction, then we ALSO attach an Annex B (counterparty specific credit 
provisions),  Annex B-1(collateral and exposure provisions) and a letter of 
credit format. 

I am only attaching the General Terms and Conditions.



Let me know if you still want to see the ISDA Master Agreement (preprinted 
boilerplate consisting of an agreement and Credit Support Annex which I 
cannot email) together with a sample Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the Credit 
Support Annex (which are the two ""customized"" pieces negotiated by legal) .

Thanks.  Sara

To my knowledge, we will trade these instruments via internal broker 
platforms (i.e., ENA traders will trade online rather than over the phone), 
such as Goldman Sachs, or directly over the phone.  All trades will be 
confirmed either online or verbally and ENA will receive a daily statement 
reflecting trades done the previous day.  ENA does not prepare a confirmation 
but will need to check out the broker statements.

I believe that these debt securities are issued in either book-entry form (in 
variable denominations) or as registered certificates (e.g., undivided 
interests in a mortgage pool).

We will trade US agencies and Japanese bonds with Goldman.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Sara,  I'm at home sick this morning, but plan to go into work this 
afternoon.  Could you take a look at the email below and give me your 
thoughts?  I'm not at all familiar with these instruments.  Thanks.

Gary has gotten approval to use Governement Agencies as hedging vehicles.  
Per Ellen, they will use Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Federal Home Loan Bank 
instruments.  What do we need to do to trade, confirm and settle these 
instruments?
We will get together at 4:30 today to discuss the changes required.
Thanks. Sheila

Contracts:


Notice No. 01-10
January 8, 2001

TO:        ALL NYMEX MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
ALL NYMEX CLEARING FIRMS
ALL NYMEX OPERATIONS MANAGERS

FROM:     Neal Wolkoff
          Executive Vice President

SUBJECT:     MARGIN RATE CHANGE FOR BACK MONTH CONTRACTS

Effective Date:    Monday, January 8, 2001 (close of business).

Futures Contract:  Henry Hub Natural Gas.

Contract Months: April 2001 and all Subsequent Contract Months.

Rate Change:

NYMEX Division Margins for the April 2001 Contract and all Subsequent
Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contracts

Effective Date:    Monday, January 8, 2001 (close of business)

Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):            Old:  $7,000  New:  $5,000

Member Customer (Initial Margin):                Old:  $7,700  New:  $5,500

Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):            Old:  $9,450  New:  $6,750

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by 
first determining the ""Scan Risk"" and then multiplying the number of spreads 
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the 
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.

Because there is a difference between the outright margin required for the 
February 2001 and March 2001 delivery months and other months, each spread 
which includes one leg in either the February 2001or March 2001 delivery 
months will have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at 
$11,500 starting on Monday, January 8, 2001.  This figure is determined as 
follows:

Example at Clearing Member Rates

One Long February 2001 or March 2001 NG    (1 x $14,000)   =        $14,000
One Short April 2001 - January 2004 NG       (1 x $5,000)    =   -     $  
5,000
Net Scan Risk                         ($14,000-$5,000) =        $  9,000
Spread Rate                          (1x $2,500)     =   +     $  2,500
Total Requirement                                 =        $11,500

NYMEX Division Margins on Natural Gas Futures Spreads:
Requirements for Spreads with One Leg in February 2001 or March 2001 
Contract,  and One in the April 2001 Contract or Subsequent Contracts

Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):               $11,500

Member Customer (Initial Margin):                   $12,650

Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):               $15,525

Should you have any questions regarding these changes, please contact Arthur 
McCoy at (212) 299-2928 or Joe Sanguedolce at (212) 299-2855.  This notice 
supersedes all previous notices regarding outright margins for the NYMEX 
Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contract.

Everything About Enron's Insurance Programs

That You Were Afraid To Ask

(or Didn't  Know to Ask)

Presented by
David Marshall
Enron Corporate Risk Management

Thursday, January 11, 2001
11:30 - 1:00

The Houston Room
601 Jefferson
(We've reserved the Enron Shuttle to transport the ""non-walkers"")

Lunch will be served.  Please RSVP to Pat Radford at 39282.

One of the goals of Jeff Hodge and Barbara Gray is to increase the level of 
departmental information sharing activities.  Since we are faced on a daily 
basis with insurance matters in contract drafting and client advising, the 
East/Upstream Origination and Trading Group felt it would be productive to 
have Enron's Corporate Risk Management Group give a presentation on current 
Enron Insurance Programs, policies and contractual risk allocation 
preferences.  It then occured to us that this subject might be of interest to 
all of the lawyers on the 38th floor.   Please join us next Thursday.   

Sorry for the inconvenient location.  We'll make it worth your while with the 
quality of the food and the presentation.

Sara,

I mentioned this ISDA to Tanya and before we begin negotiations, she wants to 
understand their reasoning for this ISDA because of their other trading 
entities.  I will call Serge and then respond back to you.

Thanks

Tanya:

Enron Corp, (global finance) has a FASB 125 structured deal executed in Dec., 
2000 which requires amendment for tax purposes.  A new  total return equity 
swap on EOG stock will need to be executed between ENA and Rabo.  ENA must be 
the swap counterparty (""normal course of business"") for the legal opinion 
which must be issued for the structure.  I would like to send Rabo our ISDA 
format so as to avoid any surprises; time is short.  I assume we do not want 
a CSA but will require an Enron Corp. guaranty.  Do we want cross default and 
Credit Event Upon Merger to apply to the parties?   Do we want to 
add/eliminate additional events of default?  The ultimate Schedule will 
probably look very different from our standard but we need to urge our format 
as much as possible.  

Please call me to update.  This update is currently scheduled to close next 
Friday.  Thanks.  Sara

I still can't talk.  I think that our response should be final except that 
there may be some agreed to changes on the L/C side.  Carol St. Clair is 
addressing that with Jennifer and Miriam.  In any event, I believe that Tiger 
needs to ""OK"" our response of yesterday since there were some errors on their 
redraft.  Marie is not in the office today.  If you want to speak to a 
person, call Susan Bailey and she can come into my office and we can manage.  
Have a good weekend.  Sara"

Quantex  Trading application.   The intent would be to use the enhanced 
platform replacing the POSIT application. 

We are forwarding the trading application agreement onto you for the 
appropriate person's legal review and approval.
Please do not hesitate to call Selena, 3-5168,  if you need additional

Many thanks. Sheila

There is a March 26, 1993 Master Commodity Price Swap Agreement between ERMS

Folks,

We are confirmed for our meeting next Wednesday the 17th in room 3125b at 3 
pm.  To reiterate, the purpose of the meeting will be to clarify the 
procedures for implementing ISDA agreements with counterparties interested in 
financial derivative transactions.  The goal is for everyone to understand 
the process as it relates to different types of counterparties and to 
streamline the internal process wherever possible.

See you next week.

I've left a message for Dave Adams (legal) to call back AND described to him 
the following situation:

ENA and NRG have executed OVER 130 financial deals both online (EOL) and 
offline WITHOUT EVER CHANGING ANY OF THE GTC's.  
In the absence of an executed master agreement, we never want the GTC's to 
change!  The reason is that bankruptcy protection for swap agreements 
requires a single agreement for all swap transactions.  If you don't have an 
ISDA master agreement in place, you want your single set of GTC's to be 
viewed by a court as a single agreement.  Having different versions of the 
GTC's does not look like a single agreement.

I will try to convince Dave Adams that we should retain our GTC's but move 
forward on an ISDA which would then govern all online and offline trades.

The business people are really bugging me about this because it is holding up 
proceeding with our other ISDAs.  Would you mind dealing with this ASAP and 
letting me know when you think you will be able to get the drafting done.

Thanks very much and sorry to be bugging you.

Hi Sara,

How are you going - did you have a good Thanksgiving?  Coincidentally 
Thursday was also a holiday here - we were celebrating Respect for the Aged 
Day though.

Actually, Sara, I was wondering how we are going in getting some drafting 
together for the credit provisions discussed recently with John Suttle and 
Jonathan Whitehead.

Thanks and sorry for the trouble.

Jane:

If you have time in the morning (Nov. 9 Tokyo), I would like to discuss ENA's 
view of the CSA/Schedule relationship.  In a nutshell, we provide that a 
ratings downgrade is an Additional Event of Default in the Schedule (normally 
a MAC in the CSA).  John's preferance, of course, would be a unilateral event 
triggering an IBJ default (which I am sure would be difficult to negotiate).

I am not certain of the time difference but perhaps you could call me at the 
office after 4 pm (Nov.8 in Houston) and I could then conference in John.  
Alternatively, please feel free to contact me at home (after 7 pm Houston 
time on Nov. 8) at 713-664-3207.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara

Dear John,

Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to 
the end.  They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly 
their back / mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in 
place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course.  They 
acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards 
CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank.  They did 
say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do 
so. Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are 
set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask 
them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now.

We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime, if you 
are still willing to do so.  The bank has a credit rating of A, so I guess 
this means US$15 million credit limit.  

On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract 
without a full CSA, I wonder who is best to do this drafting.  I should be 
able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the 
drafting .... Alan, do you have any suggestions?     

Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the 
""Threshold Amount"" definition to US$10 million.  Is there any flexibility on 
this?

Thanks.

Jane McBride

		 Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT

Jonathan,

One thing we might be able to propose is a ""Credit Matrix"" which prescribes a 
Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact - with collateral 
rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each 
counterparty.  We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and 
they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change (MAC) 
clauses.  This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot 
automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs.  We 
are comfortable because as the counterparty's credit quality deteriorates, 
the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases.  I would propose to 
IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA.  Jane and John - is 
it possible to draft these collateral/credit terms into the contract without 
using a full CSA?  (I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a 
CSA).

Rating (S&P)     Credit Line
AA or above    $20MM
BBB+ to AA-    $15MM
BBB     $10MM
BBB-     $7MM
BB- to BB+    $5MM
Below BB-    $1MM

These terms are subject to negotiation.  Once again, the matrix removes MAC 
clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such, but effectively 
reduces the potential exposure we have (or THEY have) to a counterparty with 
diminishing credit quality.

What do you all think?

John

Sorry, Pressed send too early:

John, Have had a conversation with IBJ re the CSA, and they have asked us to 
consider proposing a solution that does not involve a CSA. I propose to meet 
with them again to try and explore why, but I would like to be prepared to 
offer them a solution whereby we don't enter into a CSA, and we would limit 
the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ. My feeling is that we 
would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions (over 2 years) at 
this stage anyway, and would prefer to get the relationship going, as I am 
not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet. They appear to be quite 
willing to discuss all the other points. We can always press for a 
renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals. 
I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate.

What are your thoughts on this, and what limitations would you want to put on 
trades if we do not have a CSA?

Thanks,
Jonathan

John-

During our last meeting with IBJ, we pushed hard for the implementation of 
the CSA.  I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the 
requisite activities relating to the CSA, as we understand that they utilize 
same with certain financial institution counterparties.  We expressed our 
view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in 
our recent conference call.  

IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a non-financial 
institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the 
first.  We requested that they raise this issue with their respective 
superiors.  As you know, their response to our discussions relating to this 
issue was ""In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral 
operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA.""  The legitimacy of this 
statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be 
something entirely different, including the possibility that they merely do 
not want to enter into a CSA with a non-financial institution.  

We will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the CSA with Enron, 
however it is uncertain if this is achievable.

Tanya:

I know you're swamped so I'll try to make this easy and you can answer ""yes"" 
or ""no"", etc.

1.  Is First Union National Bank the correct name?  (as opposed to First 
Union National Bank, Charlotte)

2.  Threshold for cross default:  We used $100,000,000 for ENE and 
$50,000,000 for FUNB.  FUNB wants $100,000,000.

3.  Documents to be delivered:  FUNB will produce audited/consolidated 
financials for First Union Corporation.  We requested FUNB financials.

4.  With respect to the ENA master only (the CSA):

 (i)  FUNB wants to post 10-year government bonds in addition to cash and 
L'C's

 (ii)  I sent you the FUNB matrix  Is it acceptable?

 (iii) FUNB wants to revise the MAC trigger to include ""Baa3 by Moody's"" and 
""failure to have a Credit Rating from either S&P or Moody's"".

 (iv) FUNB wants to revise the definition of ""Qualified Institution"" to 
include not only the rating we assign, but also ""having assets in excess of 
$10 billion"" and also not subject to approval by the non-downgraded party

 (v)  FUNB wants all demands for delivery or return of collateral to be made 
on a Valuation Date.  I think we should retain language that demands can be 
made on or after a Valuation Date.  But I think we could agree that demands 
be made prior to 5 pm New York time.

5.  With respect to the ENA master only (the Enron Corp. guaranty in favor of 
First Union National Bank):

 (i)  FUNB wants a $30,000,000 cap (as opposed to the $15,000,000 cap we 
proposed)

Two different FUNB people keep calling me, one on the ENA front and the other 
with respect to ENE.  Now you know why your assistance is always greatly 
appreciated.

Hey, Clem:

Hope you had a great New Year!

I'll try to make this easy so that you can respond ""yes"" or ""no"":

(1)  FUNB wants ENE remain liable for payments covering ""any other damages, 
costs and attorney's fees"".  Do you agree?

(2)  FUNB only wants to make a demand for payment with no strings attached.  
I'll try to whittle the demand period down from five days to three.  Do you 
agree:

(3)  Guaranty to be governed by NY law.  Agreed?

I'm sure you enjoyed this little exercise if I hear back from you.

Thanks.  Sara

Tanya:

Enron Corp, (global finance) has a FASB 125 structured deal executed in Dec., 
2000 which requires amendment for tax purposes.  A new  total return equity 
swap on EOG stock will need to be executed between ENA and Rabo.  ENA must be 
the swap counterparty (""normal course of business"") for the legal opinion 
which must be issued for the structure.  I would like to send Rabo our ISDA 
format so as to avoid any surprises; time is short.  I assume we do not want 
a CSA but will require an Enron Corp. guaranty.  Do we want cross default and 
Credit Event Upon Merger to apply to the parties?   Do we want to 
add/eliminate additional events of default?  The ultimate Schedule will 
probably look very different from our standard but we need to urge our format 
as much as possible.  

Please call me to update.  This update is currently scheduled to close next 
Friday.  Thanks.  Sara

Susan:  Per Tanya's message below, please prepare a draft Schedule for the 
bank listed below.  There is no CSA.  Angela can help you with the choices.  
THIS IS A DEAL SPECIFIC ISDA SCHEDULE and not for general use.

Angela:  I know that this Schedule will never be accepted in total but it 
highlights the ENA priorities.  You can forward to the Rabobank person who 
sent the email request the other day and David Barbour et al.  I would 
appreciate if you could handle and I'll let you know when I'm back in the 
office for good.

Thank you both.  Sara

I would use the following:

Rabobank Nederland   (per your voice mail that outside counsel is not sure):
No CSA
Enron Corp Gty - have they asked about a limit?  I would propose $25MM
Bilateral Cross Defualts of $100MM fopr Enron Corp and Rabobank Nederland
I'd leave out the Additional Termination Event since these guys are AAA rated
Is Credit Event upon Merger normally in our schedule or the CSA?  If we 
usually omit when we do not have a CSA, then I am ok with that.

I'll try to get to First Union this weekend.  Sorry for the delays - the 
insanity is at  the worst levels yet!!

Dear sir,

Your name and email address were forwarded to me by Jane Anne Thomas in our
Legal department. We are working on a structured trade with the Royal Bank
of Canada (project Cerberus) that involves Rabobank entering into a
derivative contract with Enron North America.
I am looking for the following information on Enron North America that we
need to start the processes of opening counterparty accounts and preparing
an ISDA master agreement:

- Full legal name;
- Registered Address;
- Telephone Number/Fax Number;
- Legal/Documentation contact name.

I would be very grateful if you could supply me with this information.

Yes, as long as the Tiger lawyers do their bit.  Please call Susan Bailey 
about the guaranty and she can have it prepared for execution.  Question:  
Are we only preparing the Tiger guaranty or other animal guaranties as well?

I still can't talk.  I think that our response should be final except that 
there may be some agreed to changes on the L/C side.  Carol St. Clair is 
addressing that with Jennifer and Miriam.  In any event, I believe that Tiger 
needs to ""OK"" our response of yesterday since there were some errors on their

All -
Just wanted to let you know that Rabobank got their final approval today to 
become the swap counterparty in the Cerberus financing.  We are moving 
forward on the documentation with a target close of early next week (probably 
Tuesday).  

Issues that I am aware of that remain are:
1) For the tax folks, we need to assign EAH's interest in both Aeneas and 
Psyche to either EES or EBS (an Enron operating subsidiary), then have that 
entity contribute the Aeneas 0.01% economic interest to Psyche.  As I 
understand it, this will provide the sale for tax purposes that Tammy needs 
in order to spring the desired gain.  I am working with Mark Lindsay to 
arrange for one of the Enron operating entities to take the A shares.  Danny 
and David, please start putting the necessary assignment documents together 
to facilitate this.  I'll give you the name of the Enron entity when I get it.

2) Due to certain things going on in the default swap market (which Rabo is 
using as one of the factors in its pricing formula), we have agreed to pay 
RBC an additional 10bp upfront and raise the spread on the deal to L + 85bp 
from L + 75bp.  David and Danny, please make the necessary adjustments.

3) Rabo has requested that a couple of business points be changed.  Those are 
that they would like to have an assignment over the A share of Aeneas, and 
they would like the Sales Agency Agreement to be triggered upon and Enron 
bankruptcy (if it occurs before maturity).  David, I agree with you that we 
should not agree to these requests.  We must maintain control of the A share 
in Aeneas since that is where the EOG stock is housed, and an Enron 
bankruptcy should not trigger the SAA because Aeneas is a bankruptcy-remote 
entity which should survive a bankruptcy of Enron.  Besides, requiring them 
to wait until maturity of the deal to trigger the SAA was the business deal 
we agreed to a long time ago.   

If there are other issues that I have left out, please let me know.  I am in 
Austin all week, but will be checking in periodically so send me either an 
e:mail or a voicemail if you need me.  Talk to you soon.

EXCEPTION THAT the two Word Perfect documents are ALSO in WORD.

Attached are the blackline drafts of the Assignment and Waiver Agreement
and the RBC Swap Confirmation and a draft of the Pledge Agreement
between EAH and RBC.

The next round of drafts will reflect points raised on the conference
call today and points to be confirmed with Enron next week.

agreed with your assessment of damages as they relate to the swap agreement, 
but they have asked us to provide a larger guaranty to cover the possibility 
of damages related to non-transfer of funds at settlement (we can discuss 
this issue, but I'm comfortable with their request on this).

So, the long and the short of this is that Merrill Lynch is asking for a $150 
million guaranty from Enron Corp. to cover this trading.  Can you please 
prepare the guaranty document to reflect this?  As we have discussed the 
guaranty should be from Enron Corp. to cover FX trading of Enron North 
America.  The beneficiary of the guaranty should be Merrill Lynch 
International Bank Ltd.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.


Thanks for all your help,


Jay"

Brenda, for future transactions wherein swaps are involved, please see that 
extra copies of executed swaps are made at closing so that copies may be 
immediately distributed to the applicable confirmation desks.  Since this 
aspect of the structured finance transactions include ""trading"" transactions, 
the confirmation desks need the paperwork immediately for their reference and

this memo to the other paralegals and attorneys in your group.  For your 
reference, at this time the distribution of executed copies should be 
provided as follows depending upon the nature of the swaps:

As to the initial closing into the Brazos partnership of Preston 1 and

Brenda, may Laurel and I get executed copies of the interest rate swaps, and 
I need the rest of the swap docs too, as well as copies to Larry Joe Hunter, 
all as previously requested.  Mary

Laurel, I do not have executed versions.  I did draft the swaps and they were 
signed at closing, but Global Finance Legal is in charge of distribution of 
executed docs.  To the extent it is helpful here are the final versions that 
I sent to closing.  If I can be of further help, please call.

It was my understanding (from Tim Proffitt) that the legal department drafted 
all of the documents related to Brazos.  Does this include the interest rate 
swaps?  Originally you had sent me to Brenda Funk to get copies of the 
confirms for my records, but I have not heard anything from her at all.  
Could you please forward to me a copy of the documents, even if it has only 
been signed off on by one party?  I would like to review them and send them 
on to our file room.  

IF LEGAL HAS NOT DRAFTED THE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONFIRMS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW 
RIGHT AWAY, SO THAT I CAN PREPARE THESE DOCUMENTS!!

Thank you.

Thank you very much for your message.  I am happy for you to prepare the
equity swap confirmation for Rabo's review.  I will review the document but
could you also copy in Mark Lauber and Christine Hogg.  I have copied them
on this mail, so you'll have their email addresses.  

Will you also be negotiating the ISDA?  If it is not you, could you let me
know who it will be.

Sara

I am not sure I understand the question.  What do you mean by RMT?  

Here is an explanation of what happened here in London:

Due to cash flows originated by tax in London before year end,  some Enron 
Europe companies had FX positions that needed to be hedged.  However, due to 
tax reasons we could not hedge the FX positions in the entities in which they 
arose because the hedge gains or losses would be subject to the 'sub-part F' 
income rules (and liable to double tax).  

Tax therefore suggested that we transact the hedges in the name of 'ECT 
Europe Accounting Entity' (company 912), where they would be consolidated 
into Enron Europe for management accounting but would be within a US legal 
entity and therefore not subject to double tax.  My understanding is that 912 
is a branch of ENA and therefore there is a hedge transacted between ENA 912 
and ENA.

We have been trying to identify the hedges within company 912 but cannot see 
them there.  Can you help with this?

Regards

Peter

Jim:

Pursuant to our recent conversation, I have attached below a DRAFT of ENA's 
standard (1) municipal ISDA Schedule and (2) Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit 
Support Annex.  These two documents are intended to supplement the 
boilerplate for the ISDA Master Agreement and the ISDA Credit Support Annex.  
The forms are generic, that is, they have not been tailored for use by a 
specific municipal counterparty; they would necessarily be the subject of 
specific negotiations.  

Energy New England's agency relationship with the various municipalities 
appears to cover physical trading.  Notwithstanding the agency agreement, the 
financial trading world requires much more specificity, including but not 
limited to, evidence of authority to execute a master financial agreement and 
transactions thereunder.  Additional information, including a legal opinion, 
is also required.  

I assume from our prior conversation that you already have in your possession 
copies of the ISDA boilerplate.  Please advise otherwise.

You should feel free to contact Ed Sacks with questions regarding collateral 
support documentation.  As I mentioned, the attached Paragraph 13 has not 
been customized.

Please feel free to call if you have any questions.

Sara

   Enron Global Markets LLC - Office of the Chairman

After having conducted our first of several business reviews, Enron Global 
Markets - Office of the Chairman would like to outline the following 
organizational changes effective immediately.

The Global Risk Markets group under Jere Overdyke illustrates enormous 
opportunities given the size of those businesses.  To better focus on the 
different commercial functions and to capture market share and value, the 
group is being realigned.  Jere will continue to manage Global Risk Markets 
and build on our insurance capabilities.  Mark Tawney is responsible for our 
weather business and will now report to the EGM Office of the Chairman.  

Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President of 
Operations and Chief Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of 
the Chairman, and to Sally Beck, Vice President of Global Risk Management 
Operations.  In his role as Chief Accounting Officer, Brent will also report 
to Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for 
Enron Corp.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila Glover, 
business controller for Financial Products; Todd Hall, business controller 
for weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for global products and 
coal.  In addition, Tom Myers will join Brent's management team as Director 
of Accounting.  Brent and his team are responsible for all accounting, risk 
reporting and trading operations for all the businesses within EGM. 

Cindy Skinner will join the Enron Global Markets team with responsibility for 
Human Resources.  She will also report to David Oxley and the HR organization.
 
Please join us in congratulating everyone in their assignments.

My intent on the Credit Worksheet was to only require guaranties and to set 
default perimeters (3rd party debt and S&P/Moody ratings).  I believe that 
this can be taken care of outside of the CSA.  Let me know if this helps.

I still can't talk.  I think that our response should be final except that 
there may be some agreed to changes on the L/C side.  Carol St. Clair is 
addressing that with Jennifer and Miriam.  In any event, I believe that Tiger 
needs to ""OK"" our response of yesterday since there were some errors on their 
redraft.  Marie is not in the office today.  If you want to speak to a 
person, call Susan Bailey and she can come into my office and we can manage.  
Have a good weekend.  Sara

Tanya:

I know you're swamped so I'll try to make this easy and you can answer ""yes"" 
or ""no"", etc.

1.  Is First Union National Bank the correct name?  (as opposed to First 
Union National Bank, Charlotte)

2.  Threshold for cross default:  We used $100,000,000 for ENE and 
$50,000,000 for FUNB.  FUNB wants $100,000,000.

3.  Documents to be delivered:  FUNB will produce audited/consolidated 
financials for First Union Corporation.  We requested FUNB financials.

4.  With respect to the ENA master only (the CSA):

 (i)  FUNB wants to post 10-year government bonds in addition to cash and 
L'C's

 (ii)  I sent you the FUNB matrix  Is it acceptable?

 (iii) FUNB wants to revise the MAC trigger to include ""Baa3 by Moody's"" and 
""failure to have a Credit Rating from either S&P or Moody's"".

 (iv) FUNB wants to revise the definition of ""Qualified Institution"" to 
include not only the rating we assign, but also ""having assets in excess of 
$10 billion"" and also not subject to approval by the non-downgraded party

 (v)  FUNB wants all demands for delivery or return of collateral to be made 
on a Valuation Date.  I think we should retain language that demands can be 
made on or after a Valuation Date.  But I think we could agree that demands 
be made prior to 5 pm New York time.

5.  With respect to the ENA master only (the Enron Corp. guaranty in favor of 
First Union National Bank):

 (i)  FUNB wants a $30,000,000 cap (as opposed to the $15,000,000 cap we 
proposed)

Two different FUNB people keep calling me, one on the ENA front and the other 
with respect to ENE.  Now you know why your assistance is always greatly 
appreciated.

I was interested in the 1991 and 1998 definitions because they referenced by 
name in the Rabo-RBC TRS Confirmation (Cerberus restructuring).  I didn't 
realize there was a newer version of the definitions.  Unless that 
Confirmation is scheduled to be modified to refer solely to the 2000 
definitions, I'd like to get a copy of all 3 if possible.

Hi, Dee:

A few pieces of information from credit.

1.  With respect to ENA's swap counterparty, we note that the rated entity 
per S&P is ""First Union National Bank, Charlotte"".  You need to let us know 
which entity is in fact the swap party.

2.  Regarding Threshold for cross default, $100,000,000 is fine.

3.  Regarding financials, if you want to provide us with First Union Corp. 
financials, we will need a guaranty and credit will switch to the guarantor.

4.  10 year bonds are OK with a haircut (probably 90 or 95%).

5.  Credit is still reviewing the matrix 

6.  Your changes to the MAC trigger are fine.

7.  Your comments to our definition of ""Qualified Institution"" have been 
rejected.

8.  The $30,000,000 cap on the Enron Corp. guaranty is fine.

I'll try to follow up with you tomorrow.  

Sara

Ellen Su, bond trader in  Gary Hickerson's world, would like to know with 
whom we have repo agreements.  I'm pretty sure we have them with Goldman 
Sachs & Co. and with BMO/Nesbitt Burns.  Sara Shackleton has been working on 
getting an agreement signed with Warburg Dillon Read, but it appears that at 
present this document is not signed.  

Could you please advise if we have signed repo docs with any other 
counterparties?  Could you also update me on the status of the WDR agreement? 

Thank you very much for your help.

Jason:

Here's my suggestion for item (ix) [Additional Event of Default] event on 
page 2 of the Schedule:

""In the case of Party B, Enron North America Corp. .... owns less than a 
majority interest in Party B unless within five (5) Local Business Days of 
such occurrence, Party B posts collateral with Party A (i) in an amount equal 
to Party A's Exposure under this Agreement plus $250,000, but in no event 
greater than 125% of Party A's Exposure, and (ii) in a form satisfactory to 
Party A in Party A's reasonable discretion.

""Exposure"" shall mean for any relevant date for which Exposure is calculated, 
the amount, if any, that would be payable to Party A by Party B pursuant to 
Section 6(e)(ii)(2)(A) of this Agreement as if all Transactions were being 
terminated as of the relevant date; provided that Market Quotation will be 
determined by Party A using its estimates at mid-market of the amounts that 
would be paid for Replacement Transactions (as that term is defined in the 
definition of ""Market quotation"") in order to ensure that Party A does not 
suffer an economic penalty.""

I think that we agreed on everything else.

Please send new blackline.  Thanks.

NEXT TIME YOU THINK YOU=0F2RE HAVING A BAD DAY:

Fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burned out section of
forest while assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The deceased
male was dressed in a full wet suit, complete with scuba tanks on his
back, flippers, and facemask. A post-mortem revealed that the person
died not from burns, but from massive internal injuries. Dental records
provided a positive identification.

Investigators then set about to determine how a fully clad diver ended
up in the middle of a forest fire. It was revealed that on the day of
the fire, the person went for a diving trip off the coast some 20 miles
from the forest. The fire fighters, seeking to control the fire as
quickly as possible, called in a fleet of helicopters with very large
dip buckets. Water was dipped from the ocean and then flown to the
forest fire and emptied.

You guessed it.

One minute the man was making like Flipper in the Pacific, the next he
was doing the breaststroke in a fire dip bucket 300 feet in the air.
Apparently he extinguished exactly 5'10"" of the fire. Some days it just
doesn't pay to get out of bed.

This article was taken from the California Examiner, March 20, 1998.


STILL THINK YOU=0F2RE HAVING A BAD DAY?

A man was working on his motorcycle on his patio and his wife was in the
kitchen. The man was racing the engine on the motorcycle when it
accidentally slipped into gear. The man, still holding onto the
handlebars, was dragged through the glass patio doors and along with the
motorcycle dumped onto the floor inside the house. The wife, hearing the
crash, ran into the dining room and found her husband lying on the
floor, cut and bleeding, the motorcycle lying next to him, and the
shattered patio door!

She ran to the phone and summoned the ambulance. Because they lived on a
fairly large hill, the wife went down the several flights of stairs to
the street to escort the paramedics to her husband.

After the ambulance arrived and transported the man to the hospital, the
wife uprighted the motorcycle and pushed it outside. Since gas was
spilled on the floor, the wife got bunch of napkins, blotted up most of
the gasoline, and threw the napkins in the toilet. The man was treated
and released to come home.

Upon arriving home, he looked at the shattered patio door and the damage
done to his motorcycle. He became despondent, went to the bathroom, sat
down on the toilet and smoked a cigarette. After finishing the
cigarette, he flipped it between his legs into the toilet bowl while
seated. The wife, who was in the kitchen, heard the loud explosion and
her husband screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her husband
lying on the floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was
suffering burns on the buttocks, the back of his legs, and his groin.

The wife again ran to the phone to call the ambulance. The very same
paramedic crew was dispatched and the wife met them at the street. The
paramedics loaded the husband on to the stretcher and began carrying him
to the street. While they were going down the stairs to the street
accompanied by the wife, one of the paramedics asked the wife how the
husband had burned himself.

She told them and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one of them
slipped and tipped the stretcher, dumping the husband out. He fell down
the remaining stairs and broke his arm.

Taken from a Florida Newspaper.


STILL HAVING A BAD DAY? Just remember, it could be worse.....

1. The average cost of rehabilitating a seal after the Exxon Valdez oil
spill in Alaska was $80,000! At a special ceremony, two of the most
expensively saved animals were released back into the wild amid cheers
and applause from onlookers. A minute later, in full view, a killer
whale ate them both.

2. A psychology student in New York rented out her spare room to a
carpenter in order to nag him constantly and study his reactions. After
weeks of needling, he snapped and beat her with an axe leaving her brain
damaged.

3. A woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen, shaking
frantically with what looked like a wire running from his waist towards
the electric kettle. Intending to jolt him away from the deadly current
she whacked him with a handy plank of wood by the back door, breaking
his arm in two places. Until that moment he had been happily listening
to his new Walkman.

4. Two animal rights protesters were protesting at the cruelty of
sending pigs to a slaughterhouse in Bonn Germany. Suddenly the pigs, all
two thousand of them, escaped through a broken fence and stampeded,
trampling the two hapless protesters to death.

AND FINALLY.......

5. Iraqi terrorist, Khay Rahnajet, didn't pay enough postage on a letter
bomb. It came back with ""return to sender"" stamped on it. Having
forgotten it was the bomb, he opened it and was blown to bits.

YOUR DAY'S NOT SO BAD, IS IT?

Since your plan is to assume the existing hedges, you need to determine from 
Sara Shakleton, our legal advisor, the issues related to assignability. Also, 
you should reduce the amount of CAD that you need to hedge by assigning the 
existing hedges. 

Sara: What should we do if there is a position with a bank in which we do not 
deal with or have agreements with?

Stuart:

Would it be possible for you to send us a tradeable forward curve (we need to 
use it for our base case and run sensitivities from there)?

Also here are some answers to  the questions you asked earlier this morning. 



1) Will the asset be in a mark-to-market book? If so, will you need 
mark-to-market accounting for this hedge? 
Answer:  We will plan to review with Kent Castleman
 
2) Under what entity name will the hedge be executed?
Answer:  Not yet determined

3) What will be done with the existing hedges that the entity currently has 
in place? Will they be assigned to Enron? Liquidated?
Answer:  Yes, we plan to assume the existing hedges on the date of purchase



Thanks a lot.

Please review the attached confirmation letter.  In order to apply the

the letter, but all the other changes should be there.  I do not have any of 
the information called for in the ""Payments to Counterpary"" section.  Please

Enron Corp. has a 1/17/92 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange master wtih 
Paribas.  I will fax to you the letter which I received regarding the above 
merger.  Basically, Enron Corp.'s signature to this letter will indicate 
agreement to put all [existing, if any, and future] Transactions under this

is BNP and which changed its name to ""BNP Paribas.""

Do you have any credit issues?

I would suggest the following:

 ""This is a Confirmation of an Option offered by ____________ to ENA and 
accepted by ENA pursuant to a telephone conversation on ___________ between 
the parties.""

I don't know whether this is an omnibus or master but use language 
accordingly.  Call if you have questions.   ss

Pulp & Paper  has been approched by a broker to buy a Cap. Jeff Harbert's run 
it by Mark Taylor and Credit and everyone is okay doing the trade - as it is 
a short term trade where we have no exposure. Mark, however, wants to be sure 
we get the language relating to 'whereby you offered this transaction to us' 
in the Confirmation, in order to meet the trade optoins requirements.

Can you send this to me.

A couple of questions:  1)  for tax reps, are they a US or foreign entity? 
and 2) are they a financial institution (there are certain clauses in the 
Schedule to include/exclude for financial institutions)?

Bob:  

Thanks for the memo and we should discuss in a future meeting dedicated to 
form changes.

If we adopt the 2000 Definitions in our Schedule, we will also need to change 
the existing reference in Part 6(f)(iii) to ""Negotiated Fallback"" (to Section 
7.5(c)(iv))

Also, the term ""Relevant Price"" is used in the ""Negotiated Fallback"" 
definition. We should clarify whether we need to retain Part 6(f)(iv) of the 
Schedule when using ""Negotiated Fallback"" or whether we intend that ""Fallback 
Reference Dealers"" be an entirely separate and distinct fallback (i.e. the 
4th fallback in our Schedule).

Kim:

I hope Portland was successful.

I'd like to go ahead and schedule two lunch sessions with the 
confirm/settlements group:  the first regarding basic financial 
agreements/confirmations and format, lingo, etc (very general) and the second 
more specific session addressing types of financial transactions and their 
basic structures.  One day next week would be great and perhaps one or two 
weeks after the first session for the followup.  Please send your dates and 
list of attendees.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks.  Sara

Sara,
I am actually in Portland but I got your voicemail regarding setting up a 
training class.  I will be back in the office on Wed. afternoon and will 
compile a list of people that need to attend.  I will have my assistant try 
and locate a large conference room.  I would like to do this next week if 
possible.  I was thinking maybe Tues. or Wed.  I will talk to you when I 
return on Wed.  Thanks!

Sometimes I have brilliant ideas and this may not be one of them.  Also, it 
would be nice if Jennifer had a singing role but I know how kids can be so 
don't you worry.  I'm not implying that Zachary shouldn't sing (or take on an 
acting role as well)  because that would be even better.  Or we could do a 
quartet.  Whatever.
But you ,dahling, are the centerpiece here because Mother and Daddy like you 
best.  So here are my preliminary thoughts for an Irving Houston off-Broadway 
play.  Naturally this is based on an Ada & Mike premise.

(1)  This old suitcase  (Daddy packed the Louis Vuitton without wheels a WEEK 
early but Mother wouldn't let him close it and then it wouldn't close)
(2)  Lovely Linda  (you remember Linda, don't you?)
(3)  Hi Debba, Hi Sara  (what's the story, morning glory, etc. and of course 
this is the information hot-line and Mother's source of e-mail)

 I'm sure I'll have many more brilliant ideas over the weekend but I wanted 
you to be the first to share these ideas with me.  Sas

For purposes of this ""omnibus"" Transaction, Con Ed requests cross-default to 
ENA's guarantor and elimination of setoff for the non-defaulting party's 
affiliates.  Samantha needs a worksheet for the Transaction before she can 
prepare Annex B and B-1.
 We're sending tonight together with the ISDA Schedule and CSA.

Sara,
I spoke with Brent and we are going to try and have the first session next 
Tues. if possible.  I will let you and Brent know for sure.  My assistant is 
trying to locate a large conference room.

Kim:

I hope Portland was successful.

I'd like to go ahead and schedule two lunch sessions with the 
confirm/settlements group:  the first regarding basic financial 
agreements/confirmations and format, lingo, etc (very general) and the second 
more specific session addressing types of financial transactions and their 
basic structures.  One day next week would be great and perhaps one or two 
weeks after the first session for the followup.  Please send your dates and 
list of attendees.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks.  Sara

Sara,
I am actually in Portland but I got your voicemail regarding setting up a 
training class.  I will be back in the office on Wed. afternoon and will 
compile a list of people that need to attend.  I will have my assistant try 
and locate a large conference room.  I would like to do this next week if 
possible.  I was thinking maybe Tues. or Wed.  I will talk to you when I 
return on Wed.  Thanks!

Janelle and Tom:  Ed Sacks and I need to speak with you in the a.m. about a 
few issues.

I have questions about market disruption because Con Ed has asked:

(1)  that Market Quotation apply rather than Loss (in the event of Early 
Termination)
 Is this a very liquid market?  ENA agrees to market quotation only for FX 
and short term deals in liquid markets (e.g., gas)

(2)  to jointly determine when a Market Disruption has occurred (after 
consultation)
 Usually ENA as the Calculation Agent makes this determination in good faith.

(3)  to identify two brokers/pricing platforms for purposes of determining 
the daily MTM
 Each party typically assesses its own MTM for valuation purposes (whether 
for collateral calls or termination, etc.).  Sounds like Ed and I need to 
know what was said to Con Ed about marking

(4)  I think Con Ed was headed in the direction of asking that we each 
provide dealer quotes (rather than ENA coming up with two quotes in good 
faith) as a Disruption Fallback.  Tom, I think we discussed this in a 
different situation.

Ed and I agreed to conference at 10 am Houston time to discuss these and the 
draft docs (which were e-mailed to you).

Sara:

Julie Beck (VP Finance - Inland Paperboard and Packaging) has given me the 
name of another attorney who will review the new ISDA and confirms:

 Jack Falconi,  (214) 360-4865,  jfalconi@gfbank.com

Temple Inland (the parent  -  will provide a $15 million guaranty) has worked 
with Jack in the past and wants him involved.  

It might be a good idea to call Jack.  I am not clear on the role that Grant 
Adamson will play (Grant gave us comments on the earlier ISDA).  From what 
Julie said, I think that Jack will be our main legal contact at this point.


Thanks,  Jim

Per:

I am told that Mark Taylor sent an email in December to Bob Shultz at EOL 
addressing the hedge fund issues (and CTA issues) associated with online 
trading and that you and Caroline received that email.  Apparently the hedge 
fund crises of last year have heightened regulatory scrutiny of the funds' 
derivatives activity.  EOL does not want to be subjected to any regulatory 
oversight.  I have not seen the email yet.  I will broach the subject with 
Mark when he returns to the office.

these are mark's comments for your info- CTA's are not a segment Per and I

they have trading OTC.  Metals is a different story as we do not take any 
credit exposure,  but the issue of linkage between the CTA customers and the

Subject: Re: Hedge Fund and CTA list  

Bob:

Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated.  The threshold issue is 
that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus 
will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents 
before trading.  That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic 
corporates and takes a lot  of legal resources that so far have been spent 
elsewhere.

The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates 
to regulatory uncertainty.  About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term 
Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in, 
orchestrating a bail-out.  There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of 
teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of 
messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge 
funds - none of them good.  Our view is that the regulators will be paying 
much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past 
and we don't want that spotlight shining on us.  [In case you're interested: 
notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators.  Much of the federal 
regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging -- as opposed to 
speculation -- was safer and therefore more palatable.  The failure of a 
large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the 
financial markets.  Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.]

For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the 
internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds (or 
individuals - for similar reasons).  

Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their 
customers just as Brokers cannot.

Mark

Harry,

Further to our conversation last week, I have listed below, in two segments, 
the top CTAs who presently manage more than $100mill each, and the top Hedge 
Funds, based upon their likelihood to manage assets in diversified markets, 
that may include tangible commodities. My understanding of EOL is that it 
presently caters primarily to this latter group and offers only tangible 
commodity trading instruments.

As I explained, the principle difference between a Hedge Fund and a CTA 
(Commodity Trading Advisor), is the manner in which they control the assets 
that they are contracted to manage. In the case of a CTA, the money can not 
be held by the CTA itself. The underlying investor will open a clearing 
account with a respective Clearing House, the assets will remain in this 
account and the CTA will trade based on the full monetary value of that 
account - in many cases an investor may well fund this account with Notional 
Funding. NF are 'abstract funds' not actually deposited at the Clearing 
House, but acknowledged as being available should variation or original 
margin be required. The CTA has no control over these funds. All monetary 
transactions must be executed by the Clearing House, and must be authorized 
by the investor. The CTA does have the ability to execute trades at an other 
trading house - such as Enron, through a contractual document called an 
International Uniform Give-Up Agreement. We have quite a few hundred of these 
agreements in NY. Essentially, all parties involved in the execution of a 
trade - the CTA, the Investor, the Executing Broker and the Clearing House, 
agree to allow the CTA to trade wherever he/she wishes and Give-Up that trade 
to the Investor's Clearing House. Since every regulated trade must ultimately 
clear the respective exchange, for a CTA to trade OTC and Swap agreements, 
would require prior notification to an investor that his/her money may be 
required as collateral against such a trade, and would be required to be 
deposited at Enron. A Hedge Fund has greater flexibility to trade such 
instruments since in the majority of instances a Hedge Fund does exert 
control over the funds it manages. A Hedge Fund typically structures its 
investment vehicles as Off-Shore limited partnership funds. As such the Hedge 
fund has direct control over the underlying assets and can move those assets 
to wherever they may be required - if investing via Enron On-Line, it would 
move the assets to Enron, for example.

This first list, below, is comprised of the top flight CTAs :



The following list is of Hedge Funds that I believe are trading Commodities 
and other non-security investments. It is by no means complete ! :



I would be happy to make any introductions that I can to any of the above 
names. Some we know well, others we may have to network ourselves into. 
Caroline and I met a few weeks ago and I passed some names on to her - I am 
not sure where that has got to yet, but if you need any further information 
please call me.

Mark and Mark:

Per is continuing to pursue hedge funds offline and called me yesterday about 
EOL hedge fund trading.  Credit referred me to Mark's earlier message 
addressing the issues.  As you can see, Per will want to meet next week to 
discuss.

Thanks Sara. I don't remember seeing some of this so the full background was 
helpful. As we discussed, it appears that the reluctants to trade online was 
not in the context of full ISDA docs, due dil, etc that we have done to trade 
with the hedge funds we currently talk to.  I'll give some thought to this 
and talk to Caroline. More than likely we'll need to have a meeting in 
Houston with credit and legal to discuss not if but how to set up hedge funds 
on EOL. Trading with them is a business decision we made already, executing 
online seems to be a a logical extension and doesn't add any further legal 
risk, just monitoring issues.

I'm in Houston next week. If you're avaiable and Mark has time on his 
schedule, lets get together.

Sara, Janelle - The terms that we have agreed to are transaction specific.  
Given the unfavorable credit terms for Enron, we will have to give serious 
consideration if we should elect to trade with this counterparty in the 
future, unless we can force them to deviate from thier credit policies.  Good 
luck on the other issues.

Sara:

Julie Beck (VP Finance - Inland Paperboard and Packaging) has given me the 
name of another attorney who will review the new ISDA and confirms:

 Jack Falconi,  (214) 360-4865,  jfalconi@gfbank.com

Temple Inland (the parent  -  will provide a $15 million guaranty) has worked 
with Jack in the past and wants him involved.  

It might be a good idea to call Jack.  I am not clear on the role that Grant 
Adamson will play (Grant gave us comments on the earlier ISDA).  From what 
Julie said, I think that Jack will be our main legal contact at this point.


Thanks,  Jim

Subject: Payment Date for financial power trades on EnronOnline

Hello, Kim Theriot and Leslie Reeves have spoken with Debbie Brackett in 
credit to discuss the payment date for financial power transactions done on 
EnronOnline.  The confirmation letters (for all financial power trades) that 
I send out have the following payment date language on them:

The fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price 
is determinable (for trades one month or longer)

The fifth (5th) Business Day following the last day of the month that 
includes the Determination Period (for trades less than one month)

The language on EnronOnline is different.  EnronOnline has 10 calendar days 
instead of 5 Business Days (see the EnronOnline definition below).

Debbie Brackett wants the payment date to remain as 5 days for netting 
purposes across ENA.

Please let me know if there is anything else I need to do in order to get 
this language changed on EOL for all financial power products.

Thank you,
Melissa

I believe we did the initial survey in 1996-97 in Mexico (Sara and I worked 
on it together), cobering financial and physical trading. I don't know if 
there have been any updates since that time. You should check with Steve Van 
Hooser, Sara Shackleton and Peggy Banczak. I do not have any issues to add to 
the original survey.

We need to update the advice we received from Mexican counsel to address the

advice.  Are there are other issue you would like to add to our request for

at BBB- or Baa3.

(2)  Financials -  no Cargill entities provide quarterly financials as a

Regarding the above party, ENA submitted arbitration and the response was to 
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of NY courts and waive jury trial.  You 
have this highlighted in yellow and flagged the jury trial waiver.

Can you recall if you spoke with Richard about this issue?

Hey, Stewart:

It looks like Tana has been corresponding with these guys about EOL trading.  
Modesto was planning to address the ISDA after working with Tana on the 
electronic trading agreement.  By copy of this message, Tana should let you 
know if anything recent has happened on the ISDA front. 

Let me know if you need anything further. 

Regards.  SS

Clem:

Per my voice mail,  please respond to the remaining issues raised by ConEd's 
lawyer:

(1)  ""Guarantor agrees that its obligations are unconditional and will not be 
discharged except by complete payment of the amounts payable under the 
Contract, [without setoff of the amount payable under the Contract] 
irrespective of any claims as to the Contract's validity, regularity or 
enforceability or the lack of authority of Enron to execute or deliver the 
Contract, or any change or amendment to the Contract (whether or not approved 
by or known to Guarantor).'

Response:  the bracketed language is unacceptable.  What about the bolded 
language?

(2)  ""This Guaranty shall continue to be effective if the Guarantor merges or 
consolidates with or into another entity, loses its separate legal identity 
or ceases to exist.""

Response:  not sure if this will remain effective if a merger occurs and 
therefore not binding (e.g., merger without assumption)

(3)  What are you looking for when requiring an ""explanation of why such 
payment is due"" in the demand section (paragraph 2)?  Is it to identify the 
type of default suffered by ENA?

Thanks for your response and I'll let you know if this particular guaranty is 
still a rush.  SS

Janelle:

I reviewed the email of 1/19/01 from Ben Chu.  There are only 2 items listed:

(1)  I will beef up the language to make it absolutely clear that ENA can 
select the price only if it hears from ConEd first.

(2)  I am not sure that I agree about the NY ISO changing pricing after 30 
days.  We will need to discuss.  I have heard that this is not as frequent an 
occurrence as in the past and we are using the same mechanism as the ISDA 
procedure for change in prices.

(3)  Other than the foregoing, he had no other comments exept to say that he 
would review again.

A few items to consider for the paralegals:

(1)  We need to organize the various country opinions (ISDA closeout netting, 
ENA jurisdictional survey, others) so that they are accessible to the group.  
We should also have a checkout process for the opinions.  We should have 
access to the ECTRIC opinion database (which I believe is organized online).  
I know that I can look in a particular file cabinet located near Susan for 
the various volumes of opinions, but where can I find an updated listing of 
all of the above?

(2)  Impress upon everyone the importance of entering information into Lotus 
Notes (for ALL types of agreements).

(3) I believe that Sam is in charge of the unanimous consents (for all Enron 
affiliates).  I for one would like an UPDATED book of the consents (kept 
updated).  These consents must be maintained and kept current.  If Sam is out 
of the office, we need access to the book.

(4)  We should create a ""paralegal manual"" as we go.  Each person could be 
responsible for drafting sections (and you could review their drafting 
skills!).  Given some time, I could probably help to identify relevant 
sections.

(5)  Agreement checkout.  We need to create a ""checkout card"" for each file 
so that when files are returned to the file cabinet, the checkout card is 
retired and placed inside the file for the next checkout.  I will volunteer 
my assistant to help out but I don't want to step out of turn here so I'll 
wait to hear from you.

(6)  I have the sense from some of the legal-credit meetings that everyone 
needs to be reminded to follow up on outstanding ISDA's (mainly the Top Ten 
and high priority items). 

I'll send additional items as they occur to me.  Thanks.  Sara

Dear Sara,

Further to our conversation of this morning, I have spoken to our
Credit Manager, Andrzej Kabarowski.  We are able to significantly
move negotiations forward by agreeing to your proposed $100MM
Cross-Default Thresholds for Cargill-Alliant and Enron North America
Corp.  I can also agree to your language and a trigger of BELOW BBB-
for the Additional Event of Default.

Regarding the Set-Off issue, I attach language for your consideration
which demonstrates our agreement to include a Non-Defaulting Party's
Affiliates.  This language does not, however, make Set-Off available
in all instances, but rather restricts it to the market standard of
set-off in cases of any Event of Default and the Credit Event Upon
Merger Termination Event.  In light of our agreement to the 3 major
items above, we ask that you consider using the attached language in
this ISDA Master Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and
Cargill-Alliant LLC.

Unfortunately, I still have no further information on the Guarantee
from Cargill, Incorporated.  We have again pressed our Corporate
Treasury Dept. for a prompt response.

I look forward to hearing from you again at your earliest convenience.

Mara Alexander
Sr. Documentation Analyst

I've had 2 swaptions sitting on my desk for a month!!!  AIGGG.  They are 
American style swaptions, and I wasn't sure how to document that.  I'll be

Annex B comments fine except we need your website address for purposes of 
Paragraph 4.  Please note that:

Par. 3 Credit Support Agreements - Guaranty  
this assumes that we have the signed guaranty on the date of the Confirmation

The Enron Corp. guaranty in favor of ConEd was submitted to our Treasury 
group this morning for signature.  As of 5:30 p.m., it had not been returned 
to me.  I have left a message with Treasury and hope that I will receive in 
the morning.  Please advise (1) fax number of person to whom I should fax 
guaranty upon my receipt and (2) person/address for FedExp delivery of 
executed guaranty.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

The resolution is being circulated for signature.  Nancy will fax you a copy 
as soon as it is executed.  I have attached the schedule of authorized 
traders which probably needs more information on it for the traders.  Please

Sorry, but I still can't talk.  Although Marie is not in today, I can have 
Susan Bailey (Ext. 34737) contact Morgan to alert them that the faxed docs 
are coming.  We also will need a signature on the agreement itself and I 
can't recall if Marie sent that already.  Please call Susan so that we can be

Tanya,

With regard to Credit's ""initialling-off"" on the Confirmation signature 
pages, that would be my call.  I know we have done so with some other 
structured deals.

So my apologies if this was not to be the case.  If you prefer, Brenda can 
run off new signature pages (where legal wil ""initial-off"" only).  The others 
can be destroyed.


Brenda,

Please run-off new pages, and I will get legal to initial-off only.

I am comfortable with the concept of the confirm you sent me; however, why 
are we not circulating the actual final confirmation with the signature 
pages?  The file you sent me still has a few blanks, etc.  I am not sure why 
credit is signing off on the confirm as this is not standard procedure. 
Please advise.

Paul:

John Fortunato has advised me that CP has only three (3) issues with the 
draft which we delivered in November, 2000.  The credit issues are:

(1)  CP financials available online - we'll need their website address

(2)  CP Threshold for cross default is too low and wish a ""higher number"" but 
have not given John any indication of what they want

Please let John and Stephanie know the outcome so that we can prepare 
executable docs.  Thanks.

P.S.  The legal issue was governing law, Texas or NY.  CP doesn't care but 
needs confirmation and possibly explanation.

Dear Sara & Cheryl,

I have been asked by our affiliate in Geneva, Cargill
International, S.A. (""CISA""), to begin negotiations for
them on an ISDA Master Agreement with Enron.

There had been some question as to which Enron entity
was to enter into an ISDA with CISA, but the latest
information they had (possibly from someone in an Enron
office in London?) was that it should be Enron Capital
& Trade Resources International Corp.  FYI, Cargill
International, S.A. is located and incorporated in Geneva.

Could you kindly advise whom I should be contacting to
confirm this is indeed the proper Enron entity and with
whom I should be speaking to begin negotiations?  Please
also let me know if there is anything that needs to be
done from a Credit or Trading perspective in order to
get this ISDA started on Enron's part.

Thanks and Regards,

We are ok with reciprocal website financials.  Please have the counterparty 
call me to discuss the cross default threshold.  We use a widely accepted 
standard in the industry, which is 2% of total debt, rounded.  In fact, by 
this standard, Enron has set it's own threshold too low.

Paul:

John Fortunato has advised me that CP has only three (3) issues with the 
draft which we delivered in November, 2000.  The credit issues are:

(1)  CP financials available online - we'll need their website address

(2)  CP Threshold for cross default is too low and wish a ""higher number"" but 
have not given John any indication of what they want

Please let John and Stephanie know the outcome so that we can prepare 
executable docs.  Thanks.

P.S.  The legal issue was governing law, Texas or NY.  CP doesn't care but 
needs confirmation and possibly explanation.

I don't believe so Sara.  Initially, the cp wanted to do a financial trade

physical.  Therefore, I recently sent a request to the physical power legal 
team to process a draft EEI.

I will advise if financial becomes a priority but it doesn't look like it at 
this time.

Thanks for following up.

the ISDA format; the counterparty is the ""Power Authority for the State of 
New York"".  Ignore the ""junk"" in the counterparty's form.  I have no other 
info about the particular deal.  Call if you have any questions and please 
send me a copy.  SS

Rather than a ""redline"" of their confirmation, maybe its better if we just 
send our confirmation, and see if that would be acceptable.  Can you either 
email me the appropriate draft to distribute to them or have it distributed 
directly? Thanks.

The only change from our previous conversation is the addition of a bilateral 
additional event of default tied to a debt rating (below BBB-) of the 
counterparty or the guarantor if applicable.

Guarantors:
1. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
2. not required; entity rated AA
3. not requried; entity rated AA
4. Bear Stearns Cos. Inc.
5. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co.
6. not required; entity rated AA

Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Tanya:  Based upon our earlier conversation, I will begin preparing masters 
for the following parties with (1) no CSA, (2) bilateral cross-default at 
US$100 million and (3) uncapped (or min US$100 million cap) guaranties for 
counterparties required to post guaranties.  The parties on Clint's list are:

(1)  Lehman Brothers Finance S.A. [have form of master and a form of guaranty 
from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.] - Stephanie Panus

(2)  Credit Suisse First Boston International [no form of master]

(3)  Deutsche Bank AG [have a form of master from ENA negotiations]

(4)  Bear Stearns International Limited [no form of master] - Samantha Boyd

(5)  Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc. [may develop form from ENA 
negotiations]

(6)  Credit Agricole Indosuez S.A.

Tanya:  Please let me know if any of the foregoing require parent guaranties.

Clint:  Please identify the lawyer to whom I should address comments.  Also, 
are there any others?  ENE has an agreement with Toronto Dominion, NY Branch.

Samantha:  Please assign Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank and let me know who 
is handling.

Annex B comments fine except we need your website address for purposes of 
Paragraph 4.  Please note that:

Par. 3 Credit Support Agreements - Guaranty  
this assumes that we have the signed guaranty on the date of the Confirmation

The Enron Corp. guaranty in favor of ConEd was submitted to our Treasury

to me.  I have left a message with Treasury and hope that I will receive in

Melissa Murphy (financial power) will be in Calgary next week (Tues - Fri)

We are ok with reciprocal website financials.  Please have the counterparty 
call me to discuss the cross default threshold.  We use a widely accepted 
standard in the industry, which is 2% of total debt, rounded.  In fact, by 
this standard, Enron has set it's own threshold too low.

John Fortunato has advised me that CP has only three (3) issues with the

(1)  CP financials available online - we'll need their website address

(2)  CP Threshold for cross default is too low and wish a ""higher number"" but

Please let John and Stephanie know the outcome so that we can prepare 
executable docs.  Thanks.

P.S.  The legal issue was governing law, Texas or NY.  CP doesn't care but

whom we have repo agreements.  I'm pretty sure we have them with Goldman 
Sachs & Co. and with BMO/Nesbitt Burns.  Sara Shackleton has been working on

Could you please advise if we have signed repo docs with any other

		 Subject: Re: P&G

I am copying Sara on this b/c I would be interested in her input if she has a 
different take than I do.

I understand your message to mean that P&G is offering a representation from 
them that they will strictly adhere to their corporate derivatives policy 
(with a copy of the policy attached to the contract), and, in exchange for 
this, they would like the ""No Reliance"" representation deleted entirely.

I don't really see how such a representation helps us with the ""No Reliance"" 
problem.   The CFTC has ruled that in a dealer/customer context, if the 
customer relies on the dealer's expertise in entering into a trade, then the 
trade may be unenforceable against the customer.  The legal principle is one 
of fiduciary duty and doesn't really have anything to do with corporate 
authorization.  In other words, the fact that the trade is authorized does 
not change the fact that the customer is relying on the dealer's superior 
knowledge.

In its 1996 lawsuit with Bankers Trust, Procter & Gamble unwound an interest 
rate swap position when they ended up about $200 million out of the money.  
P&G argued that they were relying on BT due to BT's superior expertise in 
interest rate markets, and therefore P&G shouldn't have to pay.  The issue of 
whether or not P&G was authorized to enter into the swaps was not an issue at 
all in that case, nor would it be an issue, in my opinion, if P&G sought to 
unwind a pulp and paper swap with us based on our alleged superior expertise 
in pulp and paper markets.

The danger of having positions unwound has made the ""No Reliance"" clause one 
of the most important clauses in the ISDA for us.  I will look at and 
consider any particular language they may wish to propose, but conceptually, 
we can not trade with counterparties who wish to rely on our market expertise 
in deciding whether to enter into a trade. -- Bob

Bob,

P&G business contact mentioned that they have inserted the following into 
their ISDA schedules:

1) a clause that states that P&G will strictly adhere to their corporate 
derivatives policy (that covers deal terms, hedged risks, etc.) and append 
the ISDA with the corporate policy....

Is this something we can consider???  Policy spells out types of deals they 
can and can't enter...therefore, they can't sue us (hopefully) if they have 
followed their policy guidelines...

Thanks.

John:  Please have Caraustar call Paul Radous about the cross default issue.  
Legal will wait to hear back from Paul after his discussion with your

We are ok with reciprocal website financials.  Please have the counterparty 
call me to discuss the cross default threshold.  We use a widely accepted 
standard in the industry, which is 2% of total debt, rounded.  In fact, by 
this standard, Enron has set it's own threshold too low.

Paul:

John Fortunato has advised me that CP has only three (3) issues with the 
draft which we delivered in November, 2000.  The credit issues are:

(1)  CP financials available online - we'll need their website address

(2)  CP Threshold for cross default is too low and wish a ""higher number"" but 
have not given John any indication of what they want

Please let John and Stephanie know the outcome so that we can prepare 
executable docs.  Thanks.

P.S.  The legal issue was governing law, Texas or NY.  CP doesn't care but 
needs confirmation and possibly explanation.

Agreement and the ISDA Credit Support Annex) to attach to the draft

not have the ""boilerplate"" in a word document.

Also, is there anything that Houston legal can do to facilitate your

Carol:

Here's another paper & pulp master with a relatively new deal person (Steve 
Klein).  The file has sat for ages and it looks like outside counsel has some 
time (he's a good guy).  Please let me know.

Also, I spoke with Mark and I'd like to sit down with you to do some 
brainstorming/planning, e.g., a group offsite, in-house training, form 
changes.  Today is not a good day but tomorrow is fine.  How about 2 pm?

Sara:

Any chance you are available at 1:30pm on Wednesday for a call regarding the
Enron/Corrugated Services ISDA?  If that time will not work for you, please
suggest another time tomorrow afternoon that would.

Also, you will be receiving on Thursday morning a copy of some of the more
relevant documentation relating to the June 2000 drop down of the Corrugated
Services, Inc. operating assets and liabilities (including the original
Enron/Corrugated Services, Inc. ISDA) into a newly formed limited
partnership known as Corrugated Services, L.P.  In connection with that
transaction, Corrugated Services, Inc. changed its name to CSI Holdings,
Inc.  CSI Holdings, Inc. also formed at that time and now owns 100% of CSI
GP, Inc., which entity serves as the general partner of Corrugated Services,
L.P.  All of this was done to create a more franchise tax efficient
operating and ownership structure.

Based on the foregoing, we believe that it will be necessary to redocument
the original agreement either through an amendment thereto or the
cancellation thereof and the creation of a new LP/Enron agreement.

We plan on discussing the foregoing during our call tomorrow afternoon.

Thanks.

I'm on my way out of the office for an appointment but will be back around 4 
or 4:30 Houston time.  I'd like a quick chat this evening or tomorrow morning 
(before 11 am Houston, if possible).  I understand that the dynamics of this 
deal were discussed by Russ and Jeff Kinneman/Sheila Glover.  The Enron party 
is Enron North America Corp. (""ENA"", formerly named ""ECT"") and the $25million 
Enron Corp. guaranty is for the purpose of securing payment of the 20%plus 
margin requirement for  illiquid securities held by ENA in its Bear account 
(""stock loan account"").  I'm not sure if other agreements are necessary and I 
was hoping that we could discuss.

Feel free to email or call.  Thanks for your help.

Sara:

I have made some inquiry and verified that the Bear Stearns Stock Loan
enhanced leveraged product is indeed what is under consideration.

As promised, I have a brief step-by-step  explanation of such a stock loan
transaction, which is appended to this message.  There are actually two
possible scenarios: one where cash collateral is used for the stock loan,
the other where actual securities are used as collateral.  We understand
that, at least initially, you will be using bonds as collateral.

The Stock Loan Agreement is used in connection with our current form of
Institutional Account Agreement which ECT may not have signed.  I therefore
also append that agreement to this message.

I expect you waill wnat to review these attachments before we speak again.
Again, as a reminder, I will be on vacation from Friday the 16th through the
following week.  If you would like to speak before hand, or if you have any
questions regarding any of the documents, please let me know.

Regards,

Sharon

I have received the following request from a Hess lawyer:

ECT and Hess have an executed ISDA effective 1/29/98.

Guess what they want?  The following ISDA agreements to trade financial (and 
PHYSICAL):

(1)  Amerada Hess Corp.   and  ENA
(2)  Hess Energy Services Company, LLC and  ENA
(3)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and  ELFI
(4)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and ECT Singapore Pte. Ltd.
(5)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and ECTRIC

I explained our financial trading entities.
She did not know what products each of the Hess affiliates would be trading.
Hess CREDIT:  Grim Trivino at 212-536-8979
Hess LEGAL:  Dana Dellacona at 212-536-8133

Please let me know who will handle in credit (and I'll intercede with the 
lawyer).  TO MY KNOWLEDGE, NOBODY AT ENRON IS PUSHING HESS.
As usual, thanks for your help.

Enron Corp. for execution.  No other master agreements/guaranties for the 
other hedge fund entities have been drafted but each will look similar to the

David:

In the midst of leaving my voice mail, I think I realized my error.  
I believe that a guarantor can be a ""corporation,....entity"" having total 
asssts exceeding $10million.  However, that subpart (I) guarantor cannot be 
one that falls into the subpart (III) category (which is different from the 
prior law).

we don't currently have a central legal database of opinions from various

Hi Justin.  It has been quite some time.  I hope all is well with you.  I am 
back after teaching for a year--it was fun and I received my certification 
(hopefully for later use.)

Sara Shackleton mentioned that at one time your office created (and perhaps 
still updates and utilizes) a legal opinion database with respect to physical 
and financial trading matters in various jurisdictions.  Could you advise if 
this is the case?  If so, I would like to visit with you about it.  If this 
is not within your purview, could you forward this to the correct person and 
advise me of whom that would be.  We are working to organize our opinions and 
thought it would be helpful to know what the London office has.

Thanks much.

Ellen Su, bond trader in  Gary Hickerson's world, would like to know with 
whom we have repo agreements.  I'm pretty sure we have them with Goldman 
Sachs & Co. and with BMO/Nesbitt Burns.  Sara Shackleton has been working on 
getting an agreement signed with Warburg Dillon Read, but it appears that at 
present this document is not signed.  

Could you please advise if we have signed repo docs with any other 
counterparties?  Could you also update me on the status of the WDR agreement? 

Thank you very much for your help.

Clem:

Attached to the end of this string of emails is the Bear, Stearns & Co. 
(""Bear"") form of guaranty.  My only issue is with Section 1.  Consents, 
Waivers and Renewals of the Bear guaranty which Bear insists upon .  Although 
Bear will agree to the Enron form of guaranty,  our Par. 4 Setoffs and 
Counterclaims problematic in light of Bear's waiver provision.  I'd like to 
discuss with you.  

ENA has agreed to a Securities Lending arrangement with Bear and the ENE 
guaranty (capped at $25million and restricted to ENA's arrangements with 
Bear) is part of that ""package"".

FYI, several Enron companies have accounts with Bear. 

When do you think we could discuss?

You are correct in that I do not need the emails.  However, when I receive 
calls from Sheila or Gary or a counterparty, I rely upon  Lotus Notes and the 
information is not there.  I know that everyone is working diligently to 
satisfy the traders' requests.  The emails you are sending can be entered 
directly into the database so that everyone can access the information.  I 
will be glad to show you how to utilize this feature.

What do you think is a reasonable date to ask Sam and Stephanie to complete 
their review of the brokerage agreements in Lotus Notes?

Sara, earlier this week, I asked Stephanie and Samantha to update lotus notes 
on the brokerage agreements that we prioritized last week.  In addition to 
lotus notes, I often send emails to the traders to keep them updated -- as 
the attached is an example.  If you would like to be copied so that you know 
what's going on -- i.e., that I am working diligently on the brokerage 
agreemetns on a daily basis, let me know.  I fgured that you did not want to 
be flooded with the emails and that, instead, we would meet every other week 
for an update.  Let me know -- whatever makes you feel more comfortable is 
what I would like to do.

Hey Aneela, here is the other email sent to Paul this week.  As you can see 
from the attached, we are still in the process of discussing key issues with 
RJ, the agreeemtn is not yet in execution posture.  In a phone call 
subsequent to the attached email, we resolved all of the issues identified 
below (in Enron's favor), except for the limitation of liability issue (see 
my previous email to you) that Paul and I are looking into.  I just want to

Paul, I tried to call you at our scheduled time but you were not available.  
To expedite the process, let me tell you here what the outstanding issues are:


1. Para. 15 - Can we clarify this last sentence that you put in the most 
recent draft.  What are we meaning to say there?


2. We feel strongly about including the limitation on liability issue.  We 
especially want to limit any liability to punitive damages.  We think its 
mutually beneficial.  Did you leave this out intentionally?  


3.  Did you intentionally reject our draft confidentiality provisions?


If you do not have time to call me today, please send back an emailed 
response.

Sara - Please find attached the latest version of the ISDA document between
Enron & Moore Global Investments, Ltd. as well as our comments which can be
found below as well as written on the document itself. Please note that also
included in the fax are some revisions to the legal opinion.  I will send to
you any comments regarding the guaranty once our lawyer has completed his
review.

Schedule:
Part 1 (c) ""Threshold Amount"" - We are willing to accept your proposal for
the flat number of $100 million for Enron, but we cannot accept $2 million
for the Moore Global.  The majority of our documents are bilateral in
nature, but we have accepted a 2:1 ratio, thus we have proposed $50 million
for Moore Global.  Please reconsider.

Part 3(b) Documents to be delivered - I have added the legal opinion
language, but I just wanted to confirm that Enron will pay for these
requested legal opinions.  I found out that FIF Master Fund, Ltd  also uses
Graham Thompson as outside counsel.


Credit Support Annex:
Paragraph 13 (b)(iv) - Thresholds - We are willing to accept a $0 Threshold
even though with most of our counterparties, we have at least a $5 million
threshold.   On the other hand, we find it to be a operational nuisance to
have to transfer collateral back and forth with a ""minimum transfer amount""
of zero, thus we would like to stick with $500,000 since we do not think
$500,000 is an unreasonable amount of exposure for either party and it would
eliminate the nuisance factor.

Thank you very much for your help in this matter and we look forward to
hearing from you.

Regards-

Rose

Sara -

Jeff Fuller is interested in pursuing ISDA's with a number of his other 
customers after a successful experience with Merced Irrigation District.  He 
would like a generic ISDA to start with and hopes to negotiate four ISDA's in 
the near future.  The purpose of the ISDA will be to hedge their price risk 
once they get a piece of slice (this is a BPA plan to allocate slices of 
their system to customers).  Feel free to call me if you have any questions 
at 503-464-3810.

Stewart,

PRM has 4 utility clients (Benton PUD, Franklin PUD, Grays Harbor PUD and
City of Richland) that will be purchasing BPA's Slice product beginning
October 1, 2001.  I want to get the process started to get ISDA's in place
between Enron and these utilities.  We are currently in the beginning stages
of discussing financial trades with their legal counsel.  Fortunately for
Enron, I think we can have one attorney represent all 4 of PRM's clients.
(FYI, that attorney will be Doug Rosenberg at Preston Gates & Ellis in
Seattle.)

To get started, I'd like Enron to forward to me copies of the ISDA agreement
that you would propose as the starting point for discussions.  I also ask
that you send me a list/examples of any other documentation Enron will
require (e.g., legal opinion, board resolution, etc.).  Please send just one
set of documentation at this point.  I want to get the basic legal review
process underway before you prepare four different sets of documents.  I'd
also like to request that when we get to the point of having Enron's
attorney walk through the ISDA with our attorney, that Enron use Sara
Shackleton.  Sara was great to work with when we went through this for
Merced, and I think she'd be extremely helpful once again as we venture into
new territory with these 4 utilities.

Thanks for your help.

Jeff

I haven't heard of anyone pushing this internally but there are serious 
issues here because of the ""agency"" relationship that Energy New England has 
with various municipals.  You want the municipals on the dotted line and not 
the agent.

How do you want to handle?

Jorge:

The Bank of Montreal (""BMO"") master agreement provides for Market Quotation 
in the event of early termination for non-commodity based products. BMO 
prepared the letter to document our agreement to a different valuation 
methodology for the terminated transaction.  Please execute the letter.

P.S.  Do know the difference between Market Quotation and Loss?

Good Afternoon Sara,

I wanted to document our discussion this afternoon regarding the Early 
Termination Letter for our Deal No. M368796 that settled on 2/2/01, with the 
Bank of Montreal. You stated that the Master ISDA Agreement states that the 
valuation method for early termination should be the process of obtaining 
Market Quotations from Reference Market Makers. This Early Termination Letter 
reflects that BMO determined the value through its ordinary valuation methods 
instead. This was agreed upon by, the trader, Ellen Su. Therefore, you 
provided your approval for us to execute this letter. Please respond with 
your agreement for our files.

Many Thanks,

Jorge A. Garcia

Ed & Brant:

I'm being hounded by ENE but no Enron traders seem interested.  Brant 
prepared a new worksheet based upon which we sent a new ISDA.  ENE 
""represents"" four municipal utilities and is trying to negotiate ISDA's on 
behalf of those utilities.  I think the agent is off-base and I'm not sure 
that any of the utilities really want to trade financial.

Ed, Shari suggested that you may have some insight into ENE.  Should I drop 
this one altogether?  Or are we interested in pursuing?

Either Ed or Brant please let me know.  Thanks.

product to Canadian hydro utilities.  Doug says that the product is

frequent trading partners.  We have never put a swap master agreement in 
place.  In this day and age, we would be negligent to not execute the swap 
master agreement

Cargill's legal department received a draft of our ISDA Master Agreement TWO 
MONTHS AGO.  I need your help to prompt the Cargill trader(s) to put some 
pressure on their legal department to negotiate the agreement with ENA.  The 
Cargill traders may call PHIL FANTLE.

Would you please make some calls and let me know who you speak with and when?

You can then give me a call or drop me an voice mail (Ext. 35620)."

Melissa:

Before I can respond, I need to know the following answers:

(1)  What is the Exercise Period (Commencement/Expiration Dates) for the 
swaption and during what hours can we exercise?  Is it from Jan. 2 - Feb 28, 
2001 from 9 am to 11 am New York time?

(2)  Is the Commencement Date also the Premium Payment Date?

(3)  For early termination purposes, is there just a single Optional Early 
Termination Date or is it a period of time and during what hours?

(4)  Did we want to specify any Cash Settlement Reference Banks?

I can mark this confirm quickly when I hear from you.  Thanks.

Sara, 

Would it be possible for you to forward the Early Term. Language that you 
requested be changed by Chase?  They have not responded at all and I would 
like to continue insisting by faxing it over to them as many times as it 
takes to get this issue reolved.  Let me know if this is possible.

Cassandra, Bill and Cheryl,
We have sent to legal a request to open a new Futures Clearing Agreement with 
JP Morgan Chase.  Gary is requesting that we establish this account to 
provide additional coverage for Rate & Currency  and Equity Products.  Carr 
and Pru have lost some key persons and service levels are not deemed to be as 
good as previously.
Thanks.

Rhett:

I am negotiating with First Union National Bank (Party B below).  Is the 
following rep OK?

""Party B is a national banking association organized under the laws of the 
United States of America and is treated as a corporation for United States 
tax purposes.""

Why does the bank see the need for the latter clause?

Tanya:  There are a few issues left:

(1) [re:  legal name of our counterparty]
 According to FUNB, there is no legal entity named ""First Union National 
Bank, Charlotte"".  If S&P is including the city where FUNB is headquartered 
as part of their legal name, then S&P is wrong.  FUNB has asked that we 
forward the S&P document that you are looking at.

(2)  [re:  FUNB request to provide us with First Union Corp. financials and 
your response that it's OK if First Union Corp. signs on as a guarantor]
FUNB says that First Union National Bank doesn't prepare annual statements.  
FUNB can provide quarterly call reports (with YTD info) which is also 
available on the FDIC page (www.fdic.gov).  FUNB annual financials also 
available on EDGAR.  I don't know what a call report is and FUNB did not 
offer up First Union Corp. as a guarantor.

(3)  [re:  10 year bonds which you agreed to accept as Eligible Credit 
Support]
I don't know what the ""usual haircut"" is on these issues.  You said 90% or 
95%.  Legal no longer offers up bonds in our documents which is why we 
haven't discussed haircuts lately.

(4)  [re:  the Specified Conditions of Tax Event, Tax Event Upon Merger and 
Credit Event Upon Merger]
FUNB would rather terminate than collateralize Transactions (and eliminate 
obligations to transfer in avoidance of termination).  If a Specified 
Condition exists, then there is no obligation to deliver collateral to that 
party (experiencing the Specified Condition) and a Secured Party could 
exercise all remedies available to it against the Pledgor.  (I think that we 
have a different philosophy in that we would prefer to preserve 
Transactions).  I'm more willing to give in on the tax events (but global 
mergers could force that issue and the agreement basically requires the 
Affected Party to try to transfer the Transaction to avoid termination).

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara

your transaction can proceed prior to that time.  However, I will need some

Dee:  I am trying to hear from credit on about four issues, namely, the legal 
entity, need for First Union Corp. guaranty (due to the availability of 
financials), haircut on bonds and Specified Conditions.  I would then propose 
preparation of a blackline to squeeze out the remaining issues.  If I hear 
from credit tomorrow (and I'm pushing), I could have the blackline by 
Wednesday and we could talk.  Hopefully, we'd be done by this week.  Hope 
this works.  Regards.

Tanya:

Our legal group would like to schedule instructional seminars covering the 
ISDA Schedule, Credit Support Annex, omnibus and other forms and, 
specifically, the credit issues which arise in the preparation and 
negotiation of these documents.  Our thought is to eventually offer regular 
instruction every other month but we believe that initially we should offer 
monthly seminars.  

In order to avoid ""legal/credit Tuesday"" boredom, we propose Wednesday or 
Thursday as a regular luncheon meeting date.  How does the week of February 
19 or 26 sound?  I believe that we can circulate a ""curriculum"" of sorts to 
you or at the least a listing of topics.

Please let me know what you think.  As always, we welcome your suggestions.

Dear Carol:

Glocap Legal Search is one of the fastest growing in-house legal recruiting
firms in the nation.    We have worked very hard to create a unique and 
powerful legal recruiting company and we were gratified recently when Forbes 
ranked Glocap its Favorite Headhunter.   To read the review, which appeared 
in the spring issue of Forbes.com magazine click on 
http://www.forbesbest.com/asp/category.asp?category=Headhunters.

Glocap recruits for Fortune 500 companies, major financial institutions, 
consulting companies, investment banks and many other public and private 
companies of all sizes.

I am writing to  ask for your help. Do you know anyone or any department at 
your company that may need Attorneys and could use our services? If so, I 
would be grateful for the referral.


To give you an idea of the kinds of candidates that we place, I have briefly 
summarized a very small sample of the outstanding, pre-screened attorneys 
available through Glocap.

Attorneys we are working with now include:

1. Harvard Law (Magna cum laude), Harvard College (magna cum laude). General 
Counsel at both a VC incubator and a major broker-dealer. Former VP of a 
major bank, with expertise in all GC functions including managed risk, 
compliance, acquisition finance, securities, corporate HR issues, real 
estate, litigation. A well-spoken, thoughtful attorney with about 20 total 
years of legal experience is seeking new challenges. Will relocate.

2. Yale Law School, Princeton University (magna cum laude).  Senior VP of one 
of top financial institutions in the world, this attorney has played a 
leading legal, business, integration and managerial role in acquisitions, 
joint ventures, equity investments and divestitures. Also has broad 
experience in securities law at a top law firm. Very well spoke and 
personable, this candidate is interested in  a  senior business/GC type
position. NY metro area.

3. UChicago Law School, over five years extraordinary experience at both a
top law firm and a premier incubator. Practice areas include corporate,
securities, intellectual property, mergers & acquisitions, venture capital
financings and technology. Dynamic, very highly regarded attorney also
speaks mandarin Chinese. Wants in-house or legal/business position in

In our previous dealings, the counterparty never responded to the proposed 
EEI Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreements.  Concepts like margining were 
not understood and there was even a case whereby we tried to margin them and 
they failed to post.  Jim Delany at ENE has tried to reignite the EEI

Ed & Brant:

I'm being hounded by ENE but no Enron traders seem interested.  Brant 
prepared a new worksheet based upon which we sent a new ISDA.  ENE 
""represents"" four municipal utilities and is trying to negotiate ISDA's on 
behalf of those utilities.  I think the agent is off-base and I'm not sure 
that any of the utilities really want to trade financial.

Ed, Shari suggested that you may have some insight into ENE.  Should I drop 
this one altogether?  Or are we interested in pursuing?

Either Ed or Brant please let me know.  Thanks.

Dueling wine-shipping measures ferment Legislature and lobbyists


By Laylan Copelin
American-Statesman Staff
Monday, February 12, 2001


In this parched state, Texas lawmakers are fond of saying that whiskey is
for drinking and water is for fighting. But legislators are busy turning
wine into water, squabbling over the selling of wine directly to customers
-- whether over the Internet or via tourists shipping wine home to Texas.

For the second legislative session, the state's small wineries and the Wine
Institute of California are squaring off against the powerful Texas
distributors. Two years ago, the Licensed Beverage Distributors of Texas
tried to make it a felony to ship wine across state lines, while the
California wineries tried to circumvent the four Texas companies that
dominate distribution of liquor and wine.

""We fought to a standstill,"" said Austin lobbyist Sharon Hull, who
represents the Wine Institute of California.

Now for Round Two. Both sides have their flag-waving issues. On one side are
e-commerce and questions about the right to free trade among states. On the
other side are warnings that taxes will go uncollected, wine will be sold
over the Internet to minors and out-of-state wineries will be bootlegging if
they ship to the state's many ""dry"" precincts that never approved the sale
of alcohol.

The real issue is money. And the fight is between two business models of how
to deliver wine to the customer. One eliminates the middleman; the other
honors a delivery system that Texas has used since the end of Prohibition.

With rare exceptions, Texas' so-called three-tier system kept brewers,
wholesalers and retailers from joint ownership or ventures. It prevented a
few companies from dominating the alcoholic-beverage industry from
fermentation to final sale.

The law did not keep a handful of companies from dominating the wholesaling
segment of the industry. Glazer's Distributing Co. of Dallas competes
statewide with Republic Beverage Co. of Houston and Block Distributing of
San Antonio. (Block owns 51 percent of Republic.) A fourth, Longhorn Liquors
of Arlington, competes in the Dallas area. Among them, they control all the
distribution of distilled spirits and an estimated 85 percent of the wine
wholesale market in Texas.

That's why some lawmakers want to make changes.

""If the two big (wholesale) guys don't anoint your wine,"" said state Rep.
David Swinford, R-Dumas, ""you're toast.""

In addition to major out-of-state brands, Texas distributors sold
three-fourths of the 1.6 million gallons of wine produced in Texas in 1999.
Yet almost all of that was from the state's four biggest wineries: Llano
Estacado, St. Genevieve, Cap Rock and Fall Creek.

So-called boutique wines from California or from small Texas wineries almost
never make it to the grocery shelves.

Current law says Texans cannot bring into the state more than 3 gallons
(about two cases) of wine per month. And buyers must accompany the wine,
instead of shipping it. There are similar limits on beer and liquor.

Also, Texas wineries can sell only 25,000 gallons a year to customers at a
winery if it is in a ""wet"" precinct that allows the sale of alcohol. And
they can ship only limited amounts of wine to a customer who lives in a wet
precinct.

Last year, a federal judge in Houston said the 3-gallon limit is an
unconstitutional restriction on free trade among states. The judge has
withheld a final ruling, probably waiting to see what the Legislature will
do. Meanwhile, a federal appeals ruling in Indiana upholding a state's right
to regulate alcohol sales has given wholesalers hope that Texas can win on
appeal.

Yet two lawmakers, Swinford and Rep. Anna Mowery, R-Fort Worth, have taken
two different tacks to promote wine sales.

Mowery's House Bill 1046 would keep the 3-gallon limit but create a direct
wine-shipper's permit, allowing wineries to ship to Texans. A person 21
years or older -- with proper identification -- would be required to sign
for the delivery. And the holder of the shipper's permit would be required
to pay all taxes. Wine could not be shipped into a dry precinct.

Only 28 Texas counties allow the sale of alcohol countywide. Eighty-nine
percent of the state is either dry or a patchwork of small precincts where
alcohol can be sold.

Alan Gray, director of the Licensed Beverage Distributors, opposes the bill.
He said he believes that minors would be able to buy wine off the Internet,
that local sales taxes would not be collected and that the shippers have no
easy way to determine where alcohol sales are legal.

""We think it creates nothing more than an honor system,"" Gray said.

Mowery insists that allowing direct shipping of a small amount of wine to
customers won't affect wholesalers' profits. Gray argued that if wine wins
an exception, liquor could be next.

The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, which enforces the state's laws, is
not allowed to support or oppose legislation. Randy Yarbrough, the agency's
assistant director, said Mowery's bill could provide equal treatment to
Texas wholesalers and out-of-state wineries. Yet the agency would have to
work out collection and payment of sales taxes to cities.

Also, there is no easy way, such as a database, for shippers to determine
areas of the state where alcohol can be sold.

""No one (at the state level) knows where the wet and dry areas are,""
Yarbrough said.

As for sale to minors, Yarbrough said states that allow Internet sales have
used minors in sting operations. But he believes that sales to minors remain
a bigger problem for local retailers.

""Kids generally do not want to buy alcohol over the Internet,"" Yarbrough
said. ""They want it for tonight.""

Swinford, the Panhandle Republican, takes a Texas-only approach. House Bill
892 would allow Texas wineries to ship up to two cases of wine per month
within the state, even into dry areas. Wineries in dry counties also could
sell wine on the premises just as private clubs do with memberships.

""I call this bill `Direct-Ship Lite,' "" joked Swinford.

Swinford said his bill will develop the Texas wine industry. Gray argues
that it may be illegal because it would favor Texas wineries over
out-of-state ones.

Swinford said Texas wineries need the help. California produces 400 times
the wine that Texas does but consumes only three times as much.

""This is not a booze bill,"" he said. ""I don't even like wine. I like
agriculture.""

This is a first for me.  I received the following objection to our standard

""The arbitration does not provide for expedited procedures with limited 
discovery and limited live testimony.   This could take as long as in court 
and cost more.""

Is this a valid objection?  If so, how should we amend our language?  Or 
should we be silent as to jurisdicition without waiving any objections 
(venue, forum) and waive jury trial?

I look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks.

Sara,

Per our discussion on February 6th, I was wondering if you had any feedback
from your credit people regarding the five Enron-Hess entity ISDAs we
discussed.  Also, as I mentioned in the February 6th e mail to you, Amerada
Hess Corporation would like to be able to trade on Enron On-Line
immediately.  Can you give me a call to discuss how soon we can make
arrangements for this?

last week with Mr. Chuck Cerria regarding executing an ISDA between
numerous

I have received the following request from a Hess lawyer:

ECT and Hess have an executed ISDA effective 1/29/98.

Guess what they want?  The following ISDA agreements to trade financial (and 
PHYSICAL):

(1)  Amerada Hess Corp.   and  ENA
(2)  Hess Energy Services Company, LLC and  ENA
(3)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and  ELFI
(4)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and ECT Singapore Pte. Ltd.
(5)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and ECTRIC

I explained our financial trading entities.
She did not know what products each of the Hess affiliates would be trading.
Hess CREDIT:  Grim Trivino at 212-536-8979
Hess LEGAL:  Dana Dellacona at 212-536-8133

Please let me know who will handle in credit (and I'll intercede with the 
lawyer).  TO MY KNOWLEDGE, NOBODY AT ENRON IS PUSHING HESS.
As usual, thanks for your help.

Hi Sara,
Thanks for the update.  With respect to First Union Corp., the holding
company of First Union National Bank (""FUNB"")  providing a guaranty, I don't
believe that's an option. FUNB is a rated entity and as mentioned in my Jan.
23rd email, we can provide quarterly call reports (with year-to-date
information), which is also available on the FDIC page (www.fdic.gov). First
Union Corporation's consolidated annual financial statements are available
on EDGAR as well as First Union's home page (www.firstunion.com).  I look
forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.  It seems that our
marketers are asking for credit approval to enter into the Shenandoah trade
today without the Master in place. If approval is given, we will need mutual
downgrade provisions in our confirm.  I think all other pending trades are
on hold until we can get our docs wrapped up.

Tanya:

I know you're swamped so I'll try to make this easy and you can answer ""yes"" 
or ""no"", etc.

1.  Is First Union National Bank the correct name?  (as opposed to First 
Union National Bank, Charlotte)

2.  Threshold for cross default:  We used $100,000,000 for ENE and 
$50,000,000 for FUNB.  FUNB wants $100,000,000.

3.  Documents to be delivered:  FUNB will produce audited/consolidated 
financials for First Union Corporation.  We requested FUNB financials.

4.  With respect to the ENA master only (the CSA):

 (i)  FUNB wants to post 10-year government bonds in addition to cash and 
L'C's

 (ii)  I sent you the FUNB matrix  Is it acceptable?

 (iii) FUNB wants to revise the MAC trigger to include ""Baa3 by Moody's"" and 
""failure to have a Credit Rating from either S&P or Moody's"".

 (iv) FUNB wants to revise the definition of ""Qualified Institution"" to 
include not only the rating we assign, but also ""having assets in excess of 
$10 billion"" and also not subject to approval by the non-downgraded party

 (v)  FUNB wants all demands for delivery or return of collateral to be made 
on a Valuation Date.  I think we should retain language that demands can be 
made on or after a Valuation Date.  But I think we could agree that demands 
be made prior to 5 pm New York time.

5.  With respect to the ENA master only (the Enron Corp. guaranty in favor of 
First Union National Bank):

 (i)  FUNB wants a $30,000,000 cap (as opposed to the $15,000,000 cap we 
proposed)

Two different FUNB people keep calling me, one on the ENA front and the other 
with respect to ENE.  Now you know why your assistance is always greatly 
appreciated.

Tanya:  There are a few issues left:

(1) [re:  legal name of our counterparty]
 According to FUNB, there is no legal entity named ""First Union National 
Bank, Charlotte"".  If S&P is including the city where FUNB is headquartered 
as part of their legal name, then S&P is wrong.  FUNB has asked that we 
forward the S&P document that you are looking at.

(2)  [re:  FUNB request to provide us with First Union Corp. financials and 
your response that it's OK if First Union Corp. signs on as a guarantor]
FUNB says that First Union National Bank doesn't prepare annual statements.  
FUNB can provide quarterly call reports (with YTD info) which is also 
available on the FDIC page (www.fdic.gov).  FUNB annual financials also 
available on EDGAR.  I don't know what a call report is and FUNB did not 
offer up First Union Corp. as a guarantor.

(3)  [re:  10 year bonds which you agreed to accept as Eligible Credit 
Support]
I don't know what the ""usual haircut"" is on these issues.  You said 90% or 
95%.  Legal no longer offers up bonds in our documents which is why we 
haven't discussed haircuts lately.

(4)  [re:  the Specified Conditions of Tax Event, Tax Event Upon Merger and 
Credit Event Upon Merger]
FUNB would rather terminate than collateralize Transactions (and eliminate 
obligations to transfer in avoidance of termination).  If a Specified 
Condition exists, then there is no obligation to deliver collateral to that 
party (experiencing the Specified Condition) and a Secured Party could 
exercise all remedies available to it against the Pledgor.  (I think that we 
have a different philosophy in that we would prefer to preserve 
Transactions).  I'm more willing to give in on the tax events (but global 
mergers could force that issue and the agreement basically requires the 
Affected Party to try to transfer the Transaction to avoid termination).

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara

I think you were going to identify the Lagrasta deals after our meeting of 
last Tuesday (Oct. 19).  I've done a quick review (although I'm not as 
familiar with the deals as you may be) and think there are 9 deals:
 
Aries Resources, LLC
[Classic Resources Inc.] - dropped
Formosa Hydrocarbons, Inc. - Breslau also concerned
Hallwood Energy Corporation
HS Resources Inc.
Neumin Production Co. - Breslau also concerned
Titan Resources L.P.
TXU Energy Trading Company (?)
Vastar Resources, Inc.

 [Travella, Dee]  The swap party is First Union National Bank.
""First Union National Bank, Charlotte"" is not a legal entity.  If S&P is
including the city where we are headquartered as part of our legal name,
they are incorrect.  Is it possible for you to forward the S&P document that
you are referring to and I will have our corporate relations people look
into it.

 [Travella, Dee]  First Union National Bank doesn't prepare annual

Hi Sara,
Thanks for the update.  With respect to First Union Corp., the holding
company of First Union National Bank (""FUNB"")  providing a guaranty, I don't
believe that's an option. FUNB is a rated entity and as mentioned in my Jan.
23rd email, we can provide quarterly call reports (with year-to-date
information), which is also available on the FDIC page (www.fdic.gov). First
Union Corporation's consolidated annual financial statements are available
on EDGAR as well as First Union's home page (www.firstunion.com).  I look
forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.  It seems that our
marketers are asking for credit approval to enter into the Shenandoah trade
today without the Master in place. If approval is given, we will need mutual
downgrade provisions in our confirm.  I think all other pending trades are
on hold until we can get our docs wrapped up.

Greg Malcolm, the Contract Administrator for OPG just called to give me the 
status of the following documents that were sent to them by Enron last fall: 

1. EEI (physical power): Said I could expect to receive their comments to our 
initial draft no later than the end of Feb.

2. ISDA (financial): I should receive a response from them on our initial 
draft sometime in March (he was not as firm on this timeframe as he was about 
the EEI). 

3. Physical Power Confirms:  For interim trading, he is going to send me the 
form of confirmation template they want to use for sales to us. 


Commercial People: If these timeframes are unacceptable given whatever 
business you are trying to do with OPG - please ask your equivalent at OPG to 
put pressure on OPG's Legal Dept. There is nothing I can do to make this go 
any faster.

Thanks,

First Union has asked for the following:

Choice 1:  Minimum Transfer Amount of $500,000/Rounding of $10,000

Choice 2:  Minimum Transfer Amount of $250,000/Rounding of $10,000

We're almost done.  Please email response tonight, if possible.  Many

On the thresholds, I will agree to their matrix with one change for BBB-.  
Revised looks like this:

25MM AAA
20MM A or above
15MM BBB+ or above
10MM BBB
5MM BBB-
0 below BBB-

Rounding at 10K is fine.  I would prefer to leave our Min Trf amount the way 
it is (only changes the threshold, in effect).  Or, I am amenable to one 
amount for everyone (say 100K instead of our 0).

Do I need to look at Inser B and C?

Tanya:

I know you're swamped so I'll try to make this easy and you can answer ""yes"" 
or ""no"", etc.

1.  Is First Union National Bank the correct name?  (as opposed to First 
Union National Bank, Charlotte)

2.  Threshold for cross default:  We used $100,000,000 for ENE and 
$50,000,000 for FUNB.  FUNB wants $100,000,000.

3.  Documents to be delivered:  FUNB will produce audited/consolidated 
financials for First Union Corporation.  We requested FUNB financials.

4.  With respect to the ENA master only (the CSA):

 (i)  FUNB wants to post 10-year government bonds in addition to cash and 
L'C's

 (ii)  I sent you the FUNB matrix  Is it acceptable?

 (iii) FUNB wants to revise the MAC trigger to include ""Baa3 by Moody's"" and 
""failure to have a Credit Rating from either S&P or Moody's"".

 (iv) FUNB wants to revise the definition of ""Qualified Institution"" to 
include not only the rating we assign, but also ""having assets in excess of 
$10 billion"" and also not subject to approval by the non-downgraded party

 (v)  FUNB wants all demands for delivery or return of collateral to be made 
on a Valuation Date.  I think we should retain language that demands can be 
made on or after a Valuation Date.  But I think we could agree that demands 
be made prior to 5 pm New York time.

5.  With respect to the ENA master only (the Enron Corp. guaranty in favor of 
First Union National Bank):

 (i)  FUNB wants a $30,000,000 cap (as opposed to the $15,000,000 cap we 
proposed)

Two different FUNB people keep calling me, one on the ENA front and the other 
with respect to ENE.  Now you know why your assistance is always greatly 
appreciated.

Mark:  

Attached is my ""short version"" of Eligible Contract Participant (I would 
generally send to credit, new lawyer, etc.)  I am still uncertain about the 
status of the Trade Option Exemption (Issue 4); I understood from the 
conversation that you, Brent and I had that the old rules were out.  I have 
heard a different interpretation.  What is the status of this exemption under 
the new law?

Darren:

(1)  Goldman Sachs
ENA  executed the Client Access Agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co.  on June 
15, 2000.  Since you are trading in the name of ENA, you should not need to 
execute an additional agreement.  I confirmed this with Ted Leh this 
morning.  At Ted's suggestion, please forward to me the fax number and email 
address of the Goldman person requesting that you execute further 
documentation.  I can fax to him a copy of the agreement and correspond by 
email.  I will also copy Ted Leh and Vivian Siao (keeps track of agreements 
and authorized traders) so that everyone is up to date.

(2)  UBS Warburg
I spoke with Sheryl Gallant.  ENA and other Enron affiliates are already 
trading on the UBS electronic websites for OTC transactions.  Interestingly 
enough, UBS does not require an electronic trading agreement to be signed by 
a customer for online trading.  In other words, ENA has an executed ISDA with 
UBS dated May 31, 1993, you are an authorized trader for ENA and UBS is happy 
to let you access their platform. Sheryl does not know why Jun Ishi requested 
execution of a ""Client User List"" (i.e., an authorized trader list) and said 
to forget it.  If you would like for me to speak to Jun Ishi or correspond 
with him (please send his email address), just let me know.

Please let me hear from you if you would like for me to pursue further.  As a 
representative of ENA, you will probably have most agreements already in 
place.

Clem:

Attached to this email you should find a marked version of the Enron Corp. 
guaranty.  A few points:

(1)  Bear claims that the ""cap"" language which we typically include is 
inadequate because the wording implies (under NY law) that if a lesser amount 
is owed at any time, then the cap is reduced to that amount. I've not heard 
of this before.  I believe that they can send the treatise background info if 
you'd like.

(2)  The guaranty covers obligations of ENA in its Bear account and with 
respect to the margin lending agreement.  Bear has added ""performance"" to the 
guaranty as a guarantor obligation.  ENA's account obligations pertain to the 
payment of money (margin); under the margin lending agreement, ENA could have 
to deliver securities sold short in the market pursuant to a loan from Bear.  
Failure to deliver these securities would trigger a default (which is 
essentially reduced to a payment of money).  

(3)  Although Bear removed our Setoff/Counterclaim paragraph, you should 
refer to Par. 5 to see their own version!

Please call me to discuss as ENA is anxious to reduce our margin rates with 
Bear.  The Bear lawyer is leaving town tomorrow afternoon.

Thanks.

Dee:

We are working on the blackline.  Since the ""deal"" that you mentioned 
yesterday has no bearing on the master between ENA and FUNB, there is no 
emergency at hand.  A few things to note:  

(1)  regarding ""Procedures for entering into Transactions,""  my suggestion is 
that you consider a reasonable time period in which to respond upon receipt 
of a confirmation.  It is in both parties best interest to have an executed 
(and therefore enforceable) writing  This can be accomplished by under the NY 
General Obligations law by our agreement as to a ""deemed response"" if a party 
will not sign a trade confirmation.

(2)  regarding the concept of ""Specified Transaction"", ENA has reconsidered 
the earlier concession to exclude most Termination Events as Specified 
Conditions.  It is not ENA's position to unwind Transactions upon the 
occurrence of these events, and, therefore, each party ought to be able to 
rely upon the protections afforded it under the related provisions.  
Regarding the Credit Event Upon Merger, FUNB is protected with the amendment 
which we make to Section 5(b)(iv).

I hope that the blackline will resolve our outstanding issues.

Cheryl:

Enron Credit Inc. , a  Delaware corporation, has been created for U.S. debt 
trading currently handled by ENA.   As a result, ENA will need to transfer 
its brokerage debt positions to Enron Credit Inc. accounts with those 
brokers.  The brokers include our favorites:

Bear Stearns Companies
Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.
Goldman Sachs & Co. 

ENA will need to assign its positions by the end of February, 2001.
Richard Sage (London office) will need to see the ""sample package"" (unanimous 
consent, authorized trader list).  Will you please see that an email is sent 
to Richard with this information?

We should begin the documentation now.  Let me know if you have any questions.

You may want to chat with Shifali Sharma (I don't know her but will be glad

that's why the deals originate in Houston).  I'm also forwarding to you Joe's

deals that are Financial will be booked as ENA (RMT if internal).  I'm not

We'll forward the other info along as soon as we get it.

Joe:  A few questions:

1. Who trades this?
2. What book does it sit in?
3. What legal entity is that book?

Please let me know as we are comparing this to another product.  Thanks.

Wilson, Phil Clifford.

Thanks,

new Enron Credit Inc. account.  The portfolio includes high-risk, high yield 
instruments.  We should contact the brokers today or tomorrow for the form of 
agreements.  Why don't you ask Stephanie or Sam to prepare three sets of

Cheryl:

Enron Credit Inc. , a  Delaware corporation, has been created for U.S. debt 
trading currently handled by ENA.   As a result, ENA will need to transfer 
its brokerage debt positions to Enron Credit Inc. accounts with those 
brokers.  The brokers include our favorites:

Bear Stearns Companies
Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.
Goldman Sachs & Co. 

ENA will need to assign its positions by the end of February, 2001.
Richard Sage (London office) will need to see the ""sample package"" (unanimous 
consent, authorized trader list).  Will you please see that an email is sent 
to Richard with this information?

We should begin the documentation now.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Randy:  Please forgive me for missing the call this morning.  I mistakenly 
thought that my 7:30 am doctor's appointment was tomorrow and not this 
morning.

Just a brief update to my resport of yesterday, Lynn, Brent and I are meeting 
this afternoon to discuss the Tozzini response and set plans for another trip 
to Sao Paulo to meet with the lawyers and refine the review.  I'll keep you 
briefed because I know that we're fast approaching year-end and Tozzini will 
be in a crunch.  We can discuss as the need arises.

Also, Lynn is preparing his synopsis regarding Don's recent inquiries about 
trading office locations.  Don's questions tie into the legal review of 
financial trading options in general but it's a good idea to address these up 
front.

Please call if you have any questions.  I promise to be back on board next 
week.  Regards.  Sara"

Sara -

Jeff Fuller is interested in pursuing ISDA's with a number of his other 
customers after a successful experience with Merced Irrigation District.  He 
would like a generic ISDA to start with and hopes to negotiate four ISDA's in 
the near future.  The purpose of the ISDA will be to hedge their price risk 
once they get a piece of slice (this is a BPA plan to allocate slices of 
their system to customers).  Feel free to call me if you have any questions 
at 503-464-3810.

Stewart,

PRM has 4 utility clients (Benton PUD, Franklin PUD, Grays Harbor PUD and
City of Richland) that will be purchasing BPA's Slice product beginning
October 1, 2001.  I want to get the process started to get ISDA's in place
between Enron and these utilities.  We are currently in the beginning stages
of discussing financial trades with their legal counsel.  Fortunately for
Enron, I think we can have one attorney represent all 4 of PRM's clients.
(FYI, that attorney will be Doug Rosenberg at Preston Gates & Ellis in
Seattle.)

To get started, I'd like Enron to forward to me copies of the ISDA agreement
that you would propose as the starting point for discussions.  I also ask
that you send me a list/examples of any other documentation Enron will
require (e.g., legal opinion, board resolution, etc.).  Please send just one
set of documentation at this point.  I want to get the basic legal review
process underway before you prepare four different sets of documents.  I'd
also like to request that when we get to the point of having Enron's
attorney walk through the ISDA with our attorney, that Enron use Sara
Shackleton.  Sara was great to work with when we went through this for
Merced, and I think she'd be extremely helpful once again as we venture into
new territory with these 4 utilities.

Thanks for your help.

Jeff

Richard:

The corporate workbook reflects that the officers of Enron Credit, Inc. all 
reside in the U.K.  I don't see anyone identified with a power of attorney 
for executing documents in Houston.  

As there may be tax issues associated with U.K. officers signing (in the U.K) 
on behalf of a U.S. company, I am asking  for verification from Janine.

My suggestion is that Enron Credit Ltd. negotiate and execute the agreement 
and include the usual ""affiliates, representatives, etc."" who may need to 
know any confidential information.  Your V.P.'s are all in London.  

If Janelle confirms that it's alright for Brown, Sherriff or Seyfried to sign 
for Enron Credit, Inc. from London, then we can prepare the document and have 
a V.P. sign and fax the agreement to the U.S. party.  At a minimum, though, 
we should try to work from our form of NDA.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Tana,
I guess we need to change the Enron legal entity from Enron Corp?
In our current model the transacting entity will be Enron North America 
(which is a Delaware corporation?)
Can you then arrange a suitable signature (Haedicke?)
Can we get this done by the end of Friday?

Thanks,

I believe that there is a general consensus that Clem needs assistance to 
respond timely to  the mounting number of guaranties requested from Enron 
Corp.  In speaking with Clem, it seems that any evidence of increased and 
increasing business and demand for guaranties will be helpful for him to 
obtain help.  Would your group be able to put together some facts and 
projections which might address the continuing demand for new guaranties?  
Since you are the first (and most important) point of contact for evaluating 
potential business, I think that your input would be extremely valuable for 
Clem to ""plead his case.""

Per our earlier conversation, could you please prepare a revised guaranty for 
Merrill Lynch?  There are two significant changes to the guaranty currently 
in place:

1)  Beneficiary of the new guaranty should be Merrill Lynch International 
Bank, Ltd.   The current guaranty is to Merrill Lynch International Bank.

2)  The guaranty amount should be increased from $30 million to $150 million.


Please send revised guaranty to:

thing about the conversation to me was that it reminded me that I had
not heard from you in a while. I am sure that you are very busy, but I
wanted you to know that I hoped things are going well with you and that
you get a chance to kick back some soon. Probably because that is what I
want to do.

Take Care,

Carson

Thanks for the response.  I'll wait to hear from Richard Sage as to who owns 
the information.
Only officers at the VP level or higher may execute binding contracts for all 
Enron U.S. companies (bylaws).  I do not know the ""rule"" for non-U.S. 
companies (although I suspect the articles of association would contain that 
information).

Sara

You are right about the tax issue - in fact, we are in the process of 
replacing the UK directors and officers of Enron Credit Inc with US directors 
and officers.

The entity that signs up to the confidentiality agreement ought to be the one 
that owns the information to be supplied.  Based on conversations I have had 
with Richard Sage, I had formed the impression that the owner of the 
information was Enron Credit Ltd.  If this is right, we should pursue your 
first suggestion.  Otherwise, given that the tax issue is being rectified and 
this should therefore be an isolated incident, I think we can wear the tax 
risk inherent in your second suggestion.  Though I do wonder whether an 
officer of Enron Credit Inc, such as Richard Sage (currently), could sign, 
rather than a director?

Kind regards

Guenther Klar

Julie/Laurel,

I am back in London to continue our effort to get equity trading going over 
here.  Being back in the States the past two months, however, I have not been 
pushing the install of these apps.  I think we are OK on Autex and Instinet 
(although there may be issues with their Win2K compliancy) but do not know 
the status on ITG/Posit.  Although there may well have been further 
correspondence subsequent to the e-mails below, this is the most recent I can 
find.  Do either of you either know of any further developments and/or have 
the install/contractual package I mentioned?  

Thanks and regards,

After the flurry of e-mails below, I received a package from ITG/Posit Europe 
which I subsequently sent to one of you in Houston.  I am not sure who I sent 
it to but I am quite sure it got there and was ""put through the channels""

I am now trying to find out if any software was included in that package

not either of you are aware of this installation software.

Cyrus/Julie,

Can you please coordinate with Jamie White at ITG on this install.  I don't 
really care how I get it.  I would presume that someone in our IT group 
worked with ITG to determine the best delivery method on the original 
install.  If so, please use the same architecture.  If not, please consider 
the options and if we think there exists a better method than the one being 
in Houston, let's upgrade the one in Houston concurrently with the London 
install so the two sites are in synch.

This install will initially be for European equity trading only but we may 
want to incorporate US equities at a later date as well.  Any activity on 
this setup will be governed by the same agreements currently in place as it 
will be done on behalf of both ECT Investments and Enron North America until 
further notice.

Thanks and regards,
John

In response to your email, yes, our confidentiality language was so limited 
that it did not allow us to provide the agreement to affiliates of either 
party without consent.  We revised the form about 9 months ago to broaden the 
langage to include affiliates, but Duke is an old master so they need our 
consent so they can provide it to their affiliate.  Unless Federico has any 
reason not to waive the language, I think we can go ahead & draft a waiver up 
here and send it to Duke.  Can you talk to Federico asap and run that by him 
and let me know so I can get this over to Duke.  Thanks!

Pat - 

We sent them indicative pricing last Friday. Still waiting to see if they 
like our pricing. I still do not know what volume scenario they want to go 
for, but as we see it, they will want to transact starting next Monday. We 
will keep you posted on any update.

Regarding the ISDA, I told them we can agree to sign it without the CSA, 
though we would need to maintain the other provisions. I am still waiting for 
TGS's reply.

Susan-

Attached is the revised credit worksheet for TGS removing the CSA.  Given 
that we will probably not have the ISDA executed by the time Argentina 
transacts with TGS (by the end of the month), we will need to confirm the 
deal including a Deemed ISDA per Sara's suggestions.

I advised Argentina that we were making no other changes to our format other 
than removing the CSA since this seems to be the major issue for TGS.  
However, we may want to hold off on sending the 2nd draft until commercial 
has a chance to advise TGS of our position.  I want to make sure that the CSA 
is really the only hurdle for them before we send the revised draft down.  I 
will advise when I have heard back from Argentina on their further 
discussions with the counterparty regarding the ISDA.

Let's discuss if any questions.

We finally agreed on the guaranty form (the cap is $25 million) and are about 
ready to execute the actual agreement.  I have one question:  in the ISDA 
world, we use ""cost of funds plus 1%"" as the default interest rate.  The Bear 
document provides:

""...interest thereon at a rate equal to (A) in the case of purchases of 
Foreign Securities, LIBOR, (B) in the case of purchases of any other 
securities (or other amounts, if any, due to Lender hereunder), the Federal 
Funds Rate or (C) such other rate as may be specified in Schedule B, in each 
case as such rate fluctuates from day to day, from the date of such purchase 
until the date of payment of such excess.""

What is your preference:  Bear's standard language or do you want to specify 
another rate?

I think this is Kinneman's decision.  To the extent that an agreement uses a 
rate that may result in P&L when it is pulled out of the book, that is his 
risk.  Not too big of an issue from my perspective.

Subject: Bear Stearns ""Securities Loan Agreement""

Tanya:

We finally agreed on the guaranty form (the cap is $25 million) and are about 
ready to execute the actual agreement.  I have one question:  in the ISDA 
world, we use ""cost of funds plus 1%"" as the default interest rate.  The Bear 
document provides:

""...interest thereon at a rate equal to (A) in the case of purchases of 
Foreign Securities, LIBOR, (B) in the case of purchases of any other 
securities (or other amounts, if any, due to Lender hereunder), the Federal 
Funds Rate or (C) such other rate as may be specified in Schedule B, in each 
case as such rate fluctuates from day to day, from the date of such purchase 
until the date of payment of such excess.""

What is your preference:  Bear's standard language or do you want to specify 
another rate?

Sara,
Sorry, I was too assiduous in deleting what I thought would be duplicated on 
this thread, so I'm working from memory on comments before Guenther's last 
contribution.

Data for pricing is owned by Enron Credit Ltd (generated by employees of 
Enron Power Operations Ltd whose costs are charged to ECL)
Information deals are done with ECL (Derivative transactions are currently 
with Enron North America Corp, probably with Enron Credit Inc in the future)
The Enron staff who would be looking at this are employed by Enron North 
America Corp which is why I suggested ENAC as the named party.
They clearly act for ECL on information deals.
If it's OK to use ECL then that would be easier for us.

I have no objections to suggestions that I should be promoted! In the 
meantime, I am a board director of ECL and have both legal and group 
management authority to sign contracts (with a lawyer's initials being a 
prerequisite).

Regards,
Richard

Guenther:

Thanks for the response.  I'll wait to hear from Richard Sage as to who owns 
the information.
Only officers at the VP level or higher may execute binding contracts for all 
Enron U.S. companies (bylaws).  I do not know the ""rule"" for non-U.S. 
companies (although I suspect the articles of association would contain that 
information).

Sara

You are right about the tax issue - in fact, we are in the process of 
replacing the UK directors and officers of Enron Credit Inc with US directors 
and officers.

The entity that signs up to the confidentiality agreement ought to be the one 
that owns the information to be supplied.  Based on conversations I have had 
with Richard Sage, I had formed the impression that the owner of the 
information was Enron Credit Ltd.  If this is right, we should pursue your 
first suggestion.  Otherwise, given that the tax issue is being rectified and 
this should therefore be an isolated incident, I think we can wear the tax 
risk inherent in your second suggestion.  Though I do wonder whether an 
officer of Enron Credit Inc, such as Richard Sage (currently), could sign, 
rather than a director?

Kind regards

Guenther Klar

Darren Delage is the interest rate/fx trader in your office - I presume he 
has been in contact with Australia and New Zealand Bank.  He will have 
details on the transaction, but it sounds like we will have several 
transactions on a go-forward basis.  I presume this is why the counterparty 
is requesting a guaranty and an ISDA.

Whichever Enron entity is the transacting entity needs an ISDA over the

Hi John,

I have followed up on this with Darren Delage and it seems that this is the 
situation: The trades with ANZ will be done by Enron Japan but only by virtue 
of ""dependant agency"" arrangements with ENA. (These arrangements are still 
being documented.)

I think this means that ENA and not Enron Japan will need to enter into 
agreements with ANZ.

I think Darren will follow up from his side but could you go back to Micheal 
on this.

trading obligations pursuant to an ISDA Master Agreement and transactions 
thereunder which would be entered into between Enron North America Corp. and 
ANZ Bank.  Jason Williams (in Enron's risk control group) asked that you 
receive a copy of Enron's form of guaranty if you had not already received 
one.  We are in the process of preparing a draft ISDA Master Agreement  and 
will forward it to you next week.  Please let us know if you have any 
questions.

Please copy Jay Williams and me.  Thanks and sorry for such short notice.

Anna:  

I have not seen the executed Enron Corp. guaranty this afternoon and I'll 
check with Enron Corp. when we reopen for business.  We should talk first 
thing on Tuesday.  A couple of items:

(1)  The Securities Loan Agreement is between Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. and 
Enron North America Corp.  You requested The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. as 
the guaranty beneficiary (although that party is incorrectly stated as being 
party to the Securities Loan Agreement).  I just wanted to verify your 
preference and we may want to modify the first page to be accurate.

(2)  As you requested that I prepare the Schedules A and B, I ask the 
following:

 (i)  as to Schedule A, please submit your notice information

 (ii) as to Schedule B, we propose the default interest rate to be the 
Federal Funds Rate as defined in your agreement.

Please respond and we can finalize the agreement.  Please let me know if 
there is anything further you require.  Regards.

Jane:

Susan is trying to revise the Services Agreement once again and the 
""governing law"" issue was raised.  I do not have any memoranda addressing 
which choice of law would be binding on Enron Japan Corp.  However, I note 
that the draft ISDA marked by our Japanese counsel for use by Enron Japan 
Corp. and IBJ elects New York law (AA email to me dated 9/21/00).  Are either 
Texas or New York law preferable for the Services Agreement? 

Thanks for your assistance.  Regards.

		 Subject: Commodity Exchange Act, as revised by CFMA

Enclosed is a version of the Commodity Exchange Act, redlined to show how it 
has been revised by the CFMA.  This document was e-mailed to me earlier today 
by Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.



Chris, the language in the ""Definitions"" sections (Section 1a) is what 
concerns us most.

A new definition has been added -- ""EXEMPT COMMODITY"" which is (14) of Sec. 
1a (not to be confused w/ ""EXCLUDED COMMODITY,"" which is (13) of Sec 1a.).  
The new ""scheme"" is as follows -- an ""excluded"" commodity (essentially, 
financials and weather) is the most deregulated, an ""exempt"" commodity is 
almost but not quite as deregulated, and agricultural commodities are still 
subject to full jurisdiction of the CFTC and the Commodity Exchange Act.

As you can see, the definition of ""Exempt Commodity"" is simply stated as 
everything other than an excluded commodity or agricultural commodity.  The 
ambiguity is that ""agricultural commodity"" is not defined, so the question is 
-- is the reference to ""agricultural commodity"" here meant to encompass 
coffee, sugar and cocoa as well as grains and meats? 

FYI, the list of ""enumerated"" agricultural commodities is in (4) of Sec 1a, 
in the old definition of ""COMMODITY,"" which remains in the Act.  Usually, 
when regulators wish to reference the restricted list of grains and meats, it 
is this section they refer to.  In fact, Congress referred expressly to this 
list in other places in the CFMA.  For example, see the new Section 4p(c)(1) 
(which is on page 59 of the attached document).

Please feel free to call me w/ any comments or questions.  Thanks -- Bob

		 Subject: Memorandum on Issues Relating to Exchange Membership


Trena, attached please find a brief memorandum on the referenced subject.  As 
we discussed, this memo outlines the issues in very general terms.  Some of 
the legal concepts touched upon -- e.g., the exact nature of the fiduciary 
relationship between a licensed broker and its customers -- are rather 
complex, and would bear out very involved legal research and analysis in a 
more detailed memorandum.

Mark Taylor has advised me that the legal department's approval of the 
purchase of any exchange membership (clearing or non-clearing)  will require 
the personal approval of Mark Haedicke, the chief legal officer of Enron 
Wholesale Services.

As always, please feel free to call me with any comments or questions.  
Thanks -- Bob

Your deadlines for the securities loan agreement for and related guaranties 
are impossible to meet  (2/16/01 was last Friday).  The same agreement with 
ENA has yet to be completed due to protracted negotiations.

I propose the following for Schedule B:

""The fourth sentence of Paragraph 10 of the Securities Loan Agreement is 
amended to read as follows:

In the event that (i) the purchase price of Replacement Securities (plus all 
other amounts, if any, due to Lender hereunder) exceeds (ii) the amount of 
the Collateral, Borrower shall be liable to Lender for the amount of such 
excess together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the rate per annum 
equal to the cost (without proof or evidence of any actual cost) to the 
Lender (as certified by it) if it were to fund or of funding the relevant 
amount plus 1% per annum, as such rate fluctuates from day to day, from the 
date of such purchase until the date of payment of such excess.""

Sara

You are right about the tax issue - in fact, we are in the process of 
replacing the UK directors and officers of Enron Credit Inc with US directors 
and officers.

The entity that signs up to the confidentiality agreement ought to be the one 
that owns the information to be supplied.  Based on conversations I have had 
with Richard Sage, I had formed the impression that the owner of the 
information was Enron Credit Ltd.  If this is right, we should pursue your 
first suggestion.  Otherwise, given that the tax issue is being rectified and 
this should therefore be an isolated incident, I think we can wear the tax 
risk inherent in your second suggestion.  Though I do wonder whether an 
officer of Enron Credit Inc, such as Richard Sage (currently), could sign, 
rather than a director?

Kind regards

Richard:

Further to my message below, after speaking with Sheila, it appears that the 
Securities Loan Agreement that ENA will sign (hopefully tomorrow) is actually 
the same agreement to be used by Enron Credit Inc. (""ECI"").   I think we can 
have this assigned from ENA to ECI.  We will have to get a new guaranty from 
Enron Corp.  I still do not know anything about the Bear guaranty that you 
mentioned in your email.  Please advise.

Also, please verify for me which office will prepare confirmations for ECI.  
If it is London, is there a services agreement in place between ENA and EI?

Your deadlines for the securities loan agreement for and related guaranties 
are impossible to meet  (2/16/01 was last Friday).  The same agreement with 
ENA has yet to be completed due to protracted negotiations.  

Please advise as to who in credit approved the USD25million Enron Corp. 
guaranty on behalf of ECI.  Also, FYI, Bear will not provide a reciprocal 
guaranty for ENA.

All,
So that everyone can see what everone else is doing, below is the list of 
steps of which I am aware.
I think quite a few of these were completed in Houston on Friday.
Please shout if:
- I have missed anything
- Any deadlines are unrealistic
- Anybody else should be copied in
etc

Thanks,

Bob:  Now there's the real reason!  If there are two new softs entities, then 
ENA and ECTRIC lose the netting benefits.  The tax issues are transparent 
(it's like the two credit derivative entities).  Who is involved from 
credit?  We need to discuss the structures with them because credit may be 
concerned about the loss of netting privileges.

Also, we need to verify that US entity softs trades will be USD based and the 
European softs entity will settle in Euro or GBP.  It seems obvious but a US 
entity could routinely settle in a currency other than USD.  SS

Just so you have the answers.


Products will be settled in the currency they are traded in....that is USD, 
Euro or GBP
We would intend the new Enron softs entity to be a US entity and that the UK 
trading would be done through the arranger....EEFT.


I am presently looking at another structure, that if it can be done 
technically then I will go for that.

Lets discuss when you are out of your meeting.

Susan:

The internal EOL FX products will be opened up to third parties shortly.  I'm 
reviewing the GTC's.  With respect to the tax reps which are incorporated 
into the GTC's, I think we need a ""universal"" rep since the products could be 
traded by parties residing anywhere in the world.  I believe that the first 
week in March is the target EOL date.  

Can you prepare the tax rep section for the GTC's?  I am not aware of any 
other EOL product having this type of rep but I am not familiar with the 
totality of EOL products.

Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Per Brant's request, please advise if it is more appropriate to have the 
requested master for Northern Border Partners, L.P. with RMT or ENA. 
According to the corporate database, two (2) of the three general partners

directly or indirectly owned by Enron Corp.

Tanya:  I don't know if Dow is trading financial, but if so, it looks as 
though we're having a problem.  Who (in credit) will handle Dow?  I'm 
expecting a call from the plastics guys once they read Mark's message below.  
By the way, I worked with Rod on this one  Thanks.  Sara

		 Subject: RE: ISDA TDCC(Dow)/Enron

Gentlemen:

Several points regarding the below:

We worked for the first half of 1999 to try and negotiate a master agreement 
with TDCC but failed due to an inability to agree on credit terms (i.e. TDCC 
wouldn't sign a master with ANY credit terms in it at all).  Rod Nelson was 
the Credit Dept. person responsible for this counterparty at that time.
If we want to start down this road again, the first step is to contact 
someone in Credit and have them generate the necessary credit terms for  a 
master agreement.  Unless the commercial folks have already, I'll ask someone 
in my group to get that process started.
The e-mail from Dow indicates:
 ""TDCC has never accepted and cannot accept the Terms and Conditions included 
in the
confirmations sent by Enron.""
All credit concerns aside, if Dow is not signing and returning our 
confirmations, then based on this statement our derivatives trading with them 
should stop immediately on legal grounds.
The e-mail as forwarded to me did not contain the attachment.  Does someone 
here have it?

Let's hope it works out better this time.

Mark

The Bear/ENA Securities Loan Agreement will be signed tonight and Bear should 
receive tomorrow morning.  The Enron Corp. guaranty has been executed as well 
and will be included in the package.  

I will also ask Bear for an immediate assignment of the agreement to Enron

Sorry for the confusion over this agreement; I didn't realize that ENA was 
doing this for ECI.

Sara,
Sorry, I wasn't trying to be unreasonable - where I put down dates in the 
past it was because I thought they had been done.
We have found a way of paying intermediate margin, so the only deadline now 
is the end of the month. Can you advise what is reasonably doable by when.

Yes, London will prepare confirmations for ECI.
We will therefore need a services agreement between ECI and Enron Credit Ltd.
This is at the bottom of the list.

Sheila, 
Did the idea of getting a guarantee from Bear ever lead to anything?

Thanks,
Richard

Further to my message below, after speaking with Sheila, it appears that the 
Securities Loan Agreement that ENA will sign (hopefully tomorrow) is actually 
the same agreement to be used by Enron Credit Inc. (""ECI"").   I think we can 
have this assigned from ENA to ECI.  We will have to get a new guaranty from 
Enron Corp.  I still do not know anything about the Bear guaranty that you 
mentioned in your email.  Please advise.

Also, please verify for me which office will prepare confirmations for ECI.  
If it is London, is there a services agreement in place between ENA and EI?

Your deadlines for the securities loan agreement for and related guaranties 
are impossible to meet  (2/16/01 was last Friday).  The same agreement with 
ENA has yet to be completed due to protracted negotiations.  

Please advise as to who in credit approved the USD25million Enron Corp. 
guaranty on behalf of ECI.  Also, FYI, Bear will not provide a reciprocal 
guaranty for ENA.

So that everyone can see what everone else is doing, below is the list of

I think quite a few of these were completed in Houston on Friday.
Please shout if:
- I have missed anything
- Any deadlines are unrealistic
- Anybody else should be copied in

Janine:

Congratulations on your promotion!

I need an update on the back-office relationship between Enron Credit Inc. 
(ECI) and Enron Credit Ltd. (ECL) Does London confirm the ECI trades?  If so, 
I assume there is a power of attorney from ECI to someone in London.  Or will 
ECI trades be confirmed in the U.S.?

I received a call from someone in London inquiring as to whether Greg Whalley 
could sign for ENA because he was in London.  I believe this was in relation 
to the credit business.  Are U.K. traders booking credit deals in the name of 
ENA or is this some type of back-office function performed on behalf of ENA?  
Any reason not to use ECI or ECL  here?

 Also, can you send a copy of the services agreement (if any) between any 
companies performing services on behalf of either ECI or ECL?

Thanks.

JP's affiliates?
(2)  Is it OK (after we deposit property into our account) for JP to return 
""property of like or equivalent kind or amount""?
(3)  Do you want to agree to an interest rate (on customer funds) upfront or 
only ""as agreed from time to time""?

Susan:  You've just hit the nail on the head!  Remember, for FX trading ENA 
is always the principal, either in Houston, through EEFT as agent (under 
services agreement which I presume covers FX deals) or Enron Japan Corp. 
(under services agreement).  Most problematic are the counterparties since 
they could originate from anywhere in the world.

I have heard that Enron Japan had some GTC's that contained ""universal tax 
reps"" but I haven't checked it out.  Why don't you give me a call.

Subject: EOL tax reps

Susan:

The internal EOL FX products will be opened up to third parties shortly.  I'm 
reviewing the GTC's.  With respect to the tax reps which are incorporated 
into the GTC's, I think we need a ""universal"" rep since the products could be 
traded by parties residing anywhere in the world.  I believe that the first 
week in March is the target EOL date.  

Can you prepare the tax rep section for the GTC's?  I am not aware of any 
other EOL product having this type of rep but I am not familiar with the 
totality of EOL products.

Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Sara, in the interest of time this morning, I thought  I would send a quick 
e-mail. I have read the appendix to the repo agreement and think it is OK.  
No accounting issues, I think they just want to address the substitution 
mechanics.  Technically, repo transactions are FAS 125 transactions (sales of 
financial assets), so I presume that is why the ""FAS 125"" is noted at the top 
of the page (I don't believe it is necessary - what value does it add?).  I 
think the issue is one for Treasury  - are we OK with the counterparties 
ability to terminate the contract if we do not agree to the replacement 
(substituted) securities? Hope this helps.

FYI - yes, Wes Colwell and his crew are ENA accounting; however, they know 
nothing of FAS 125/133, as I was directed to Chris Sherman.

I think the ""Wes"" we were looking for the other day may be Wes Colwell who I 
think may be in charge of accounting for ENA.  If not, maybe somebody on this 
list will know something about FAS133.

Sheila:

Just a few questions about this futures agreement:

(1)  Is it OK for JP to combine our orders with orders of other clients and 
JP's affiliates? YES
(2)  Is it OK (after we deposit property into our account) for JP to return 
""property of like or equivalent kind or amount""? NO
(3)  Do you want to agree to an interest rate (on customer funds) upfront or 
only ""as agreed from time to time""? I WOULD LIKE TO AGREE TO AN INTEREST RATE 
UPFRONT. (EG. FED FUNDS). CAN WE TAKE A LOOK AT PRU, CARR AND CSFB futures 
agreements TO SEE WHAT IS MARKET?

Sara -
SMUD gave us their version of the ISDA agreement about 6 weeks ago and I am 
still waiting for comments.  I believe Susan Flynn is working on it and I 
thought we would get comments by this past Monday.  They want to start doing 
financial gas and power swaps and I would really like to wrap up the legal 
contract side of things.  Can someone please call or email me and tell me the 
status.

Thank you (503-464-3810)

		 Subject: Las Vegas Cogen - Nevada Power Response to RFP

In a mad dash to meet the RFP response deadline, a draft of the Response to 
RFP to be submitted by Las Vegas Cogeneration Limited Partnership and ENA to 
Nevada Power is attached.

The Response to RFP is due tomorrow by overnight delivery.

This is my first foray into the EEI Master, and particularly in connection 
with unit-firm power / tolling contracts.  I would greatly appreciate a 
review and comment by Shari and/or Elizabeth, given the size and duration of 
the proposed transaction.  One of the attachments is a partial cover sheet 
reflecting certain of the changes to the documents requested by Nevada 
Power.  The full list of requests, as incorporated into the RFP form, is 
attached for reference.  

I am not satisfied with the provisions of the ""unit firm"" contract regarding 
availability/power delivery.  We need to adequately document that the plant 
is allowed to be off-line, and not to make power deliveries, during 
maintenance periods.  The ""unit firm"" definition should cover other 
unscheduled outages.  Suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Please note that the form of ISDA contract is not attached.  I understand 
Tracy has done the credit worksheet, and I hope to have a copy of the 
contract for attachment by noon tomorrow.  

Apologies to all for the rushed nature of this project.  It has been one of 
those things.  Your help is greatly appreciated.

Marcelo:

Attached are my comments to your initial draft of Appendix C to the Canadian 
form of repo agreement.  Please note the following:

(1)  You attached ""Annex II"" to the end of Appendix C.  That annex came from 
the US repo with Merrill.  The information should actually be incorporated 
into ""Appendix A"" of your repo agreement.

(2)  I am waiting to hear internally regarding substitution and a default 
issue.

(3)  Please let me know if we have any issues on the Appendix C (and add a 
reference to Appendix C at the end of your printed form).  

We should be ready to execute shortly.

Thanks.

Sara,

I work with Enron Investment Partners and would like to set up an account so 
that EIP can sell dribble out of its position in Cynet (CYNE.OB).  We 
currently hold preferred stock, and intend to convert to common for sale into 
the public market. We intend to begin selling dribble in the middle of March, 
so I would like to set up the administrative end now.

It is my understanding that I need:

? Your existing templates for setting up a new account. 

These documents include:
? Prime Broker Agreement
? Corporate Resolution
? Form W-9
? Trading Authorization
? Authorization to Transfer Funds

Please send this information to me as soon as possible.

Best,

Claude Tellis
Enron Investment Partners
(713) 345 - 5382

Sara/Cheryl,
 ECT Investments Inc has received a faxed document from Goldman Sachs 
International  regarding terms of business for executing equity transactions 
through the London office.  This document is not intended for the purposes of 
opening up a new executing broker accouunt with Goldman Sachs International.  
ECT Investments Inc currently has an existing executing broker agreement with 
Goldman Sachs & Co which should cover trades done in Houston and London since 
we are trading under the same legal entity.  The Terms of Business Letter 
sets forths terms and conditions that would apply to transactions executed by 
ECT Investments in London which is governed under the SFA rules and 
regulations.
 I will forward a copy of the document to Cheryl.  Goldman Sachs 
International is waiting for us to review and sign.  If you have additional 
questions and concerns, I can be reached at extension 31439.


Thanks,

Darren:

(1)  Goldman Sachs
ENA  executed the Client Access Agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co.  on June 
15, 2000.  Since you are trading in the name of ENA, you should not need to 
execute an additional agreement.  I confirmed this with Ted Leh this 
morning.  At Ted's suggestion, please forward to me the fax number and email 
address of the Goldman person requesting that you execute further 
documentation.  I can fax to him a copy of the agreement and correspond by 
email.  I will also copy Ted Leh and Vivian Siao (keeps track of agreements 
and authorized traders) so that everyone is up to date.

(2)  UBS Warburg
I spoke with Sheryl Gallant.  ENA and other Enron affiliates are already 
trading on the UBS electronic websites for OTC transactions.  Interestingly 
enough, UBS does not require an electronic trading agreement to be signed by 
a customer for online trading.  In other words, ENA has an executed ISDA with 
UBS dated May 31, 1993, you are an authorized trader for ENA and UBS is happy 
to let you access their platform. Sheryl does not know why Jun Ishi requested 
execution of a ""Client User List"" (i.e., an authorized trader list) and said 
to forget it.  If you would like for me to speak to Jun Ishi or correspond 
with him (please send his email address), just let me know.

Please let me hear from you if you would like for me to pursue further.  As a 
representative of ENA, you will probably have most agreements already in 
place.

Marcelo:

Attached are my comments to your initial draft of Appendix C to the Canadian 
form of repo agreement.  Please note the following:

(1)  You attached ""Annex II"" to the end of Appendix C.  That annex came from 
the US repo with Merrill.  The information should actually be incorporated 
into ""Appendix A"" of your repo agreement.

(2)  I am waiting to hear internally regarding substitution and a default 
issue.

(3)  Please let me know if we have any issues on the Appendix C (and add a 
reference to Appendix C at the end of your printed form).  

We should be ready to execute shortly.

Thanks.

There are multiple Goldman files.  I do have the""ENA/GS&Co."" online agreement 
only.  I have it only for reference as it has been executed.   The problem 
I'm referring to is the identification of the Lotus Notes Goldman files.  We

Sara,
As per my voice mail the attached document contains JPM's comments.

(See attached file: JPMorganFuturesEnronBlklned2232001.doc)

With regard to Section 2, 6(c), 14, 17 and 24:

   Section 2: Our debit rate benchmark for $ is the 30 day Libor rate with a
   spread.  We typically do not reference the rate in the agreement to allow 
for
   changes.  We do have an interest schedule that I can have e-mailed to you 
on
   Monday when the salesperson returns.
   Section 6 (c): Our credit rate benchmark for $ is the 13 wk T-bill with a
   spread.  As above, we typically do not reference the rate in the agreement 
to
   allow for changes as agreed between JPMFI and Client.  I will have our
   salesperson include this schedule in the e-mail.
   Section 14: If we are to include arbitration language, the CFTC mandates 
the
   exact form (180.3 of the CEA).  I can fax you the language and the reg.
   Please send me an e-mail with your fax number.
   Section 17: Unfortunately we cannot accept the additional language.  
Clients
   are sent daily statements in which they are required to notify us any
   objections within 24 hours since the nature of the futures market is such
   that large market movements can occur over short periods of time.  The
   monthly statement is a recap of the daily statements and the same reasoning
   applies.
   Section 24:  We can accept the deletion of the witness line as long as 
Enron
   does not intend to trade SGXDT.



Please feel free to call me at your earliest convenience (212) 648-4292.

Thank you and Regards,
Corinne

Sara- can you please let me know the status of the Paloma and Moore documents?

On Paloma, I was under the impression all the points were agreed- are we just 
waiting for them to send back the signed doc?

Moore- any sticking points that I can talk to their business line about.?

Catequil- have they sent back another draft yet?

Thanks very much,
Caroline...

I'm forwarding ECT Canada's top 15 counterparties. We will use this list with 
the exception of J. Aaron, BP Amoco, PG&E, Morgan Stanley and Bank of 
Montreal as our target list for the USD/CAD products. Please ensure that a 
GTC is drawn up to allow EOL trading of these currency products. I would like 
to have the legal work done by March 6 in order to meet Gary's deadline.

David: I talked to Goldman today. They have developed a mechanism to feed 
live rates from their website into Excel. They will be here in 2 weeks to do 
a demo.

We need to eliminate Appendix B altogether.  We have previously agreed to 
eliminate substitution and FAS 125 does not require substitution.  I have 
only one more issue to resolve. 

Will you revise again?

Marcelo:

Attached are my comments to your initial draft of Appendix C to the Canadian 
form of repo agreement.  Please note the following:

(1)  You attached ""Annex II"" to the end of Appendix C.  That annex came from 
the US repo with Merrill.  The information should actually be incorporated 
into ""Appendix A"" of your repo agreement.

(2)  I am waiting to hear internally regarding substitution and a default 
issue.

(3)  Please let me know if we have any issues on the Appendix C (and add a 
reference to Appendix C at the end of your printed form).  

We should be ready to execute shortly.

Thanks.

Folks - this film was made by the nephew of a friend of mine and it's  
especially cute if you're jewish (and each of you is!), so watch it if you  
can, enjoy it, and vote. Dave, this is Larry Cooper's nephew. Stan, I don't  
know what happened earlier but here it is. ??Love to all, ?sam

A few years ago we sought California legal advice for transacting with 
California cities.  We have an opinion from McCutchen, Doyle, Brown &

Should we update this opinion given the increased number of cities with whom 
we are sending draft ISDA's to?  If so, which law firm do you think we should

initially had some legal concerns with their documentation.  Lets discuss.

Sara,

My Credit Manager advises that he needs to consult with one of our
Corporate Treasury's attorneys on the Cargill, Inc. guarantee, but
that attorney will be out all this week.  Hopefully I can get a
response to you on the guarantee early next week.

Meanwhile, attached please find one small change to Set-Off language
from the latest draft.  Can you please explain the reason behind
adding the second paragraph -- is this bankruptcy related?

Sara,

I'm sorry, but I'm still awaiting word on the Cargill, Inc. guarantee
of
Cargill-Alliant, which was in the hands of our Credit Manager for a
final
once-over.  (Unless they've by-passed me?  Have you seen a revised copy
of
this guarantee?)

I also need that same Credit Mgr. to give his final nod of approval to
the
Set-Off language you'd put into the last draft.  Our Legal only had on
a
couple of minor comments on it.

Thanks for the follow-up!  I intend to press hard this week for a final
response so we can at last get this wrapped up.

Is anyone familiar with an ISDA Master Agreement executed between ENA and the 
above company?  I have received a Security Agreement executed by this party 
seeking ENA's signature and the document references the Endorsement (to a

Thank you for your fax.
Section 180.3 of the CEA prohibits us from agreeing to any settlement

forums - which will include AAA.  If Enron chooses AAA, the arbitration will 
be
subject to the provisions specified in your fax dd 2/26/2001.

Attached is JPM's proposed language for the arbitration agreement.

(See attached file: ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.doc)

If you are in agreement with the language, please forward Enron's proposed
language (detailed in your 2/26 fax) electronically (if available).

Thank you and Regards,
Corinne

Subject: Use of Enron Interntional For Brazilian Transactions

Carolyn:

During 1999, there have been several purchases of NDF's related to the 
Elektro risk.  ENA, formerly ECT,  purchased the NDF's and then did a back to 
back NDF with Enron International for the identical risk.  The gain or loss 
associated with the NDF thus was reflected on EI's books.  

Now that EI is no longer an operating entity, I understand that the same 
transactions are still being handled on a back to back basis with EI from 
ENA..  Do you foresee that this will be a long range approach to these sorts 
of transactions or will each of the regions have to execute an ISDA agreement 
with ENA in order to get the gain or loss on the appropriate regions's books? 

From a tax perspective, the income is all US source income and therefore 
leaving the income on EI's books while apportioning the gainor loss to the 
various regions for financial reporting purposes if fine.

Thanks for sharing any insight you may have as to how accounting will handle 
these transactions going forward.

has access.  Please provide me with a list and copies of the ISDA Master 
Agreements (and/or related financial agreements) which have been executed by 
London  in the name of ENA.  These agreements should also be logged onto the

Will these masters be assigned to Enron Credit Inc.?  Will all trades be 
assigned?  If so, will you prepare the assignment for execution?

Just to clarify... the transfer of the swap has not been put on hold, but the 
sale of the assets hedged by the swaps.  I have been working on the asset 
sale out of Rawhide, but I'm not familiar with the transfer of the swap.

Sara,

I will send executed copies of the swaps shortly.

I'll let you know when I get an update.

FYI
I was just notified that the sale of CEG and RioGas which are hedged in 
Raptor 2 will likely close next week.  Current estimates indicate that the 
loss on the sale will be around $30MM.  It is expected that the sale of the 
one remaining South American LDC will result in gains that will more than 
offset this loss.  Obviously, those expectations can change, but I wanted to 
keep everyone informed on this.

Ryan - This expected realized loss is exactly the situation which most 
concerned us in the meeting with Patti this week.  Is there anything we can 
do to push them towards resolving that timing of realized losses is 
irrelevent, and this is not an issue?

Wendi/Sara-

This is a Power of Attorney agreement for Global Advisors.. The mentioned 
traders will be executing on behalf of Cargill Incorporated...

Can you please go through this ASAP and let me know if anything in here is 
problematic...

They would also like this to govern EOL transactions... will this be a 
problem?

Thanks very much.

Denis:

I will initial the Security Agreement for you and have it executed.  Where do 
you want the executed documents sent?

As you know, all of our master agreements (whether or not related to 
structured deals) are logged into our Lotus Notes database to which London 
has access.  Please provide me with a list and copies of the ISDA Master 
Agreements (and/or related financial agreements) which have been executed by 
London  in the name of ENA.  These agreements should also be logged onto the 
ENA database.    

Will these masters be assigned to Enron Credit Inc.?  Will all trades be 
assigned?  If so, will you prepare the assignment for execution?

Thanks.

Is anyone familiar with an ISDA Master Agreement executed between ENA and the 
above company?  I have received a Security Agreement executed by this party 
seeking ENA's signature and the document references the Endorsement (to a 
policy  - what policy?) issued to ENA on 10/19/00 which defines the ISDA 
agreement.  This could be related to credit activity in London.  I am waiting 
to hear from Jeff Kinneman and Denis O'Connell.

		 Subject: RE: assignment of trade to Raptor vehicle

I assume that what this e-mail relates to is the discussed ""transfer"" of the 
2 LDC swaps from Raptor 2 to Raptor 4. Frankly, I do not know what it means 
to assign a swap from 1 of these vehicles to another vehicle. I think that in 
general the schedules to the ISDAs that each of the 2 sets of parties 
executed are the same, but what happens in the case of differences? My rather 
simplistic approach would be to terminate the existing swaps in Raptor 2 and 
execute new swaps at the same time and on the same terms in Raptor 4. 

Unless anyone objects, I propose that we proceed along the lines outlined 
above, using the Raptor process documentation developed by Lisa and recently 
updated by Gordon.

We recently [like yesterday] received closing books on Raptor 3 and 
distributed those. If Anyone needs documentation on the other 3 structures, 
let us know....[Realizing that they are about to change due to the planned 
merger of Raptor 1, 2 and 4 into Mega-Raptor -- sounds like a bad Rug-Rats 
movie I recently had the misfortune of viewing doesn't it?]

No.  I guess the first step is to know into which Raptor the swaps are moving 
and to get Joel to give us a closing book on that Raptor so we can get the 
correct parties etc.  Attached is an assignment/assumption document I drafted 
for the VPP transaction which might be helpful (of course, it has a lot of 
inapplicable specifics) .    We ought to also check with Joel about any 
provisions in the rest of the vehicle docs that may apply to an assignment.  
I would think that if all parties join and consent and provide no ED or TE 
under the ISDAs shall occur on the basis of the assignment that it would be 
clean from the ISDA point of view.  Mary

Just to clarify... the transfer of the swap has not been put on hold, but the 
sale of the assets hedged by the swaps.  I have been working on the asset 
sale out of Rawhide, but I'm not familiar with the transfer of the swap.

Sara,

I will send executed copies of the swaps shortly.

Thanks,
B

Just an update... I spoke with V&E this morning and the sale has been put on 
hold.  The negotiations broke down last week and, with the holiday, there has 
been no further progress.

I'll let you know when I get an update.

Thanks,

FYI
I was just notified that the sale of CEG and RioGas which are hedged in 
Raptor 2 will likely close next week.  Current estimates indicate that the 
loss on the sale will be around $30MM.  It is expected that the sale of the 
one remaining South American LDC will result in gains that will more than 
offset this loss.  Obviously, those expectations can change, but I wanted to 
keep everyone informed on this.

Ryan - This expected realized loss is exactly the situation which most 
concerned us in the meeting with Patti this week.  Is there anything we can 
do to push them towards resolving that timing of realized losses is 
irrelevent, and this is not an issue?

Jeff - you should receive in the next day or so a Security Agreement from our

ENA.  I have approved these docs - in short the agreement grants us security 
in a Reinsurance Contract which supports RVI's obligation under the Credit 
Default Swap.

I would be grateful if you could sign where necessary and forward all copies 
by courier directly to Sharon White at the following address:

Sharon White

PO Box HM 666
Hamilton 
Bermuda

Sara - I would be grateful if you could provide the requisite legal 
initials.  On a separate point - Sara - can you confirm that Greg Whalley has 
the authority to sign on behalf of ENA - if so can you have someone fax me a 
copy of the signatory authority.
 
If you have any questions give me buzz.

Many tks

Denis


PS - Drop me a mail when the docs have gone so I can chase-up with Sharon.

I will initial the Security Agreement for you and have it executed.  Where do 
you want the executed documents sent?

As you know, all of our master agreements (whether or not related to 
structured deals) are logged into our Lotus Notes database to which London 
has access.  Please provide me with a list and copies of the ISDA Master 
Agreements (and/or related financial agreements) which have been executed by 
London  in the name of ENA.  These agreements should also be logged onto the 
ENA database.    

Will these masters be assigned to Enron Credit Inc.?  Will all trades be 
assigned?  If so, will you prepare the assignment for execution?

Thanks.

Is anyone familiar with an ISDA Master Agreement executed between ENA and the 
above company?  I have received a Security Agreement executed by this party 
seeking ENA's signature and the document references the Endorsement (to a 
policy  - what policy?) issued to ENA on 10/19/00 which defines the ISDA 
agreement.  This could be related to credit activity in London.  I am waiting 
to hear from Jeff Kinneman and Denis O'Connell.

Sara,

A question for you:

Would it be possible to very quickly amend the existing ISDA to add the name
Glencore AG? Brant is unable to approve certain trades until this is done and 
I
would rather not wait for the guarantee and credit issues to be resolved as 
this
may take some time.

David

We discussed the idea of each file having its own card.  It was the consensus 
that this would be too much to track on a going forward basis due to all the 
name changes, mergers and the like.  I suggest we delay this project and 
assess how the new system works for awhile.  Then after we get caught up on 
other of the projects, we can reassess this idea.  Let me know what you 
think.  Mary

I am still waiting verification from EI (which still exists as a legal

Sara,

Any news on Enron S.A.?  Are we to confirm our new Non-Deliverable forward 
deals under the name Enron South America, or should we use Enron 
International?  Our counterparty is Bruce Harris.  Also, are we putting a 
master agreement in place--will it be dated September 1, 1999?  Please let me 
know how we should handle these, as we have a few deals we need to confirm 
for EI/ESA.  

Thanks.

Yes, my recollection is that Janelle was negotiating a deal with these guys 
in January, 2001.  I had conversations with David Adams and Grant Adamson but 
I can't recall if the swaption was ever executed.  I discussed the 
confirmation problem with David and noted that a small percentage of confirms 
were being marked  inconsistently (in Dec., 2000) after months of trading 
without any changes at all.  He was too busy to focus (and was a new lawyer, 
I think, which is why changes were appearing in the omnibus).

David,

We continue to wait for word from you on the availability of additional 
financial information to review Glencore International AG.  We are looking 
for similair information to that which was provided S&P.  Without such 
information, a limited global credit line  will be allocated per your 
direction.

Sara, I believe we should holdoff preparing executable documents until we 
hear back from David.  That way, we can include in a single amendment those 
changes I referenced in my credit worksheet.

thanks

With respect to Morgan, I believe that a paragraph could be added to reflect 
the parties' agreement to a forum other than a contract market (i.e., ""AAA""), 
and if the customer chose a particular forum for arbitration, then the 
parties could stipulate that the arbitrators not have authority to award 
punitive, exemplary or similar damages.   Because these are fairly old forms, 
I can't recall the reason for excluding this language.

I'll schedule some time on Monday for us to talk.

Hi Sara,

I have completed a preliminary legal review of the Account Agreements with 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.  

I read the draft language you sent re: limitation of liability that you 
suggested we add to these and the Bear Stearns agreements for Enron Credit, 
Inc.   Because these agreements have arbitration clauses, this provision as 
drafted might be unenforceable under the NASD rules.  I am going to 
doublecheck the law on this point today or over the weekend.  If this is in 
fact correct, the firms will probably reject the provision on this ground 
especailly if including it would subject them to NASD fines.   In any case, 
we can wait to see what there response is but in the meantime we should set 
aside time to discuss the law on this point.

I think these guys are trying to create a $35M line ($15M Collateral 
Threshold from the ISDA Credit Support Annex and a separate $20M line for the 
Global agency trading).  All trading with Cargill will be subject to the ISDA 
Master Agreement and Credit Support Annex.

Currently Cargill and Enron have a 15MM collateral threshold.  If
possible, I think the cleanest way to run this biz would be to put a
box around the prime broker biz.  We would still operate under the
master isda but could set up a mutually agreeable credit support annex
for this biz.  We would still keep the 20,000,000 line referenced in
Schedule B of the POA agreement.  The line in the POA is a seperate and
distinct measure from the daily collateral.  The 20 mill reflects gross
exposure.  Let me know if you think this is reasonable and workable.
We too, are open to suggestion as the Global and Enron relationships
are very important and a high priority to us.

I am going to find out how much line we currently have available... you

would solve the problem of other Cargill people using the line, putting

We could change the language of the POA to this... we will not go over

Interesting.  Morgan just proposed language similar to my earlier email (for 
a futures agreement but the language mirrors that used on the brokerage 
side).  Maybe its unenforceable.

Hey Sara,  

Let's talk in detail Monday but just quickly -  its precisely the decision to 
include the arbitration clause that makes the language prohibitive.  I think 
the gist of the applicable NASD rule is that members cannot draft arbitration 
clauses which limit the damages that either party would otherwise be entitled 
to in  court.  Thus, the solution if Morgan or the others object would be to 
draft a clause that is consistent with what New York provides -- since New 
York is the applicable jurisdiction.  (I'll find a sample clause I drafted in 
the past and bring when we meet).  Otherwise, these firms could be fined for 
including such language.  I am going to find the applicable rule and make 
sure that it is still good law but off hand I believe that it is.  It will be 
interesting to note if any of the firms object on this ground.  

I may have some questions about other legal issues in the agreements; if so, 
I will bring them up when we meet so that we can work through them together.

With respect to Morgan, I believe that a paragraph could be added to reflect 
the parties' agreement to a forum other than a contract market (i.e., ""AAA""), 
and if the customer chose a particular forum for arbitration, then the 
parties could stipulate that the arbitrators not have authority to award 
punitive, exemplary or similar damages.   Because these are fairly old forms, 
I can't recall the reason for excluding this language.

I'll schedule some time on Monday for us to talk.

Hi Sara,

I have completed a preliminary legal review of the Account Agreements with 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.  

I read the draft language you sent re: limitation of liability that you 
suggested we add to these and the Bear Stearns agreements for Enron Credit, 
Inc.   Because these agreements have arbitration clauses, this provision as 
drafted might be unenforceable under the NASD rules.  I am going to 
doublecheck the law on this point today or over the weekend.  If this is in 
fact correct, the firms will probably reject the provision on this ground 
especailly if including it would subject them to NASD fines.   In any case, 
we can wait to see what there response is but in the meantime we should set 
aside time to discuss the law on this point.

Guess what they want?  The following ISDA agreements to trade financial (and 
PHYSICAL):

(1)  Amerada Hess Corp.   and  ENA
(2)  Hess Energy Services Company, LLC and  ENA
(3)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and  ELFI
(4)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and ECT Singapore Pte. Ltd.
(5)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and ECTRIC

I explained our financial trading entities.
She did not know what products each of the Hess affiliates would be trading.
Hess CREDIT:  Grim Trivino at 212-536-8979
Hess LEGAL:  Dana Dellacona at 212-536-8133

Please let me know who will handle in credit (and I'll intercede with the 
lawyer).  TO MY KNOWLEDGE, NOBODY AT ENRON IS PUSHING HESS.

Mark:  I just received a copy of my ""IOU/municipal"" chart from last year with 
an undated note from you about our omnibus format/IOU's.  I would like to 
speak with you especially since I'm speaking with credit about municipals on 
Wednesday.

As a practical matter, I'm not sure whether we even transact with utilities 
on the omnibus.  Perhaps Tana can answer the question as to online trading 
and the confirmation desk as to offline trading.  Secondly, I'm not sure how 
often the Additional Event of Default is successfully negotiated into the 
ISDA Agreement.  The latter point might be worth an email to the lawyers. 

Do you have a few minutes today?

Dan,

I am forwarding by interoffice mail (i do not have an electronic copy) a

ENA will review CP's form of guaranty and comment; Brant will circulate 
guaranty to a physical lawyer and advise him that financial is also 
reviewing.  I spoke with David Porter and we have decided to amend the ISDA 
to acknowledge that all three branches can transact under the existing 
Glencore Ltd. master agreement.  The use of several different corporate 
designations (Ltd., SA, AG) is confusing CP's trading partners in the U.S.

Ladies,  

Could one of you please tell me what is Legal's position on generating 
confirms for EOL trades?  I was under the impression (evidently false) that 
we did NOT send confirms for gas  deals done on EOL.  I did hear that legal 
was currently reviewing this issue.  Do you know where it stands, or who the 
best person to contact about this would be?  Please let me know.

We are looking to do some confirm automation (at last, at last!) and one of 
the issues we are looking at is do we REALLY need to send paper confirms for 
trades done on EOL.  It seems that it would just give someone one more chance 
to dispute the trade.  

Mary, I was at the DCAF conference where you spoke on the issue of electronic 
confirmtions and on line trading, but I don't remember how far Enron was on 
these issues.  

Sara,  It seems like we talked about this as part of a larger conversation on 
web-based confirms.  

I would be grateful to hear both of your thoughts/concerns related to the 
above.  

Thanks very much for your help!"

Sara,

Okay, looks to me like Weyerhaueser wants us to act as their counsel.  I told 
Bill to propose the language he wanted, but he said his lawyer was out of 
town for two weeks.  Which makes me wonder if they can even sign this thing 
without her consent, but I did not think to ask him this at the time.

Anyway, he basically wants to add a third party guarantee as eligible credit 
support in the event of a downgrade.  He said he is willing to include 
language indicating that the nondowngraded party would have to accept this 
guarantee, subject to a commercially reasonable objection.  On its face, I 
have no objection to such a provision, but would like to quickly bounce it 
off of you.  I'm not sure that I want to be forced to disclose what that 
reason is....

And basically, I also have no objection to allowing the posting of collateral 
in a form and amount acceptable to the nondowngraded party, with such amount 
subject to change as conditions warrant.

Also, I thought we usually had assignability to affiliates so long as the 
guarantor remained the same.  I think Bill indicated we probably removed that 
because we had it this way with the Canadian subsidiary.  He wants to put it 
back in.  I want it back in as well.

Otherwise, we are increasing the guaranty amounts to $25MM, and they have 
agreed to the cross default provisions.

Let's discuss this when you get a minute.  He had some additional 
clarification he needed, but these seemed to be the legal issues on his 
list.  I don't think there is going to be any way around this other than to 
call him and explain.  Sorry.

Paul

We have a physical and financial jurisdictional survey conducted by ENA in

Ed:  I need to understand factually what is happening.  All transactions 
between ENA and Mirant Americas Energy Marketing should be subject to the 
existing ISDA between ERMS and Vastar Gas Marketing Inc., as amended.  The 
existing guaranty from Vastar Resources, Inc. applies to all trades through 
approximately  the end of this week

Who have you spoken with at Mirant as a follow up to our conversation of last 
Friday?  It appears that Mirant is trying to prevent trading until the new 
guaranty is in place.  Frank has contacted Mirant legal and are in agreement 
in principle as to the new guaranty from Mirant Corporation.  However, we 
understand that this entity  will be spun off in the near future and the 
credit could change substantially.  Have you given thought to the effect of 
the new guaranty?

Also, have we traded today with Mirant Americas Energy Marketing?  Online or 
offline?  We should talk to our traders about apparent authority and/or save 
tapes if we are having problem

Call.

We will negotiate a new ISDA in the next few months

It was my understanding that they would not be able to opt out of trading 
under the ISDA, since this contract has not been terminated.  However, if 
this is not the case and the trades that we are currently entering into are 
not being confirmed under the ISDA, I think that we should get together as 
soon as possible.  We do a significant volume of trades each day with this 
counterparty both OTC and EOL.

Lets discuss.

Ed - After we hung up, I though a bit more about trading with Mirant.  In 
light of the letter sent by Mirant on February 26 that stated "". . . no 
further transactions will be enter into under the agreement"", we need to call 
Mirant prior to completing the trade.  I will try on this end, but you should 
also try.  The contact is Nicole Russell (678) 579-7489.

All:

I have verified with CP that we do not want to stop financial trading between 
CP and ENA.  The immediate plan is as follows:

(1)  Immediate new guaranty from Mirant Corporation  (Frank to send draft in 
the a.m.)

(2)  Immediate amendment of the existing ISDA Master Agreement to replace 
Vastar with Mirant Corporation as the credit support provider (CP to send 
draft in the a.m.)

(3)  Immediate execution of a short letter agreement to reflect that all 
financial trades done until the effective date of the new guaranty will be 
honored by CP and subject to the existing ISDA Master Agreement (I will 
prepare)

(4)  Review of the existing agreement to see if CP has issues (which we may 
consider).

If anyone has any questions, please let me knowl  

Let's all stay in touch throughout the day to get this done.  Thanks.

Sara,

I have a couple quick comments on the letter you sent this morning.  In
general, we need to make clear that we are replacing the credit support
provider under the ISDA.  Otherwise, I am concerned that we could face a
possible default under the ISDA once the VRI parental guaranty is
terminated. Otherwise, the letter looks very agreeable to me.  I am
anticipating we can get this executed today so please keep in touch with me
in regards to any further changes you would like to make.

Many thanks for all your help.

Best regards,

Nicole Russell

No answer on your phone!  Monday morning works fine; I've put you down for 10 
am Houston time and I'll call you.  Contact my assistant Kaye Ellis if this 
doesn't work (713-853-5968).  I'm busy from 2 - 4 pm Houston.  

Also, Susan Bailey will be unable to answer your questions, so let's wait 
until we speak.

I spoke with Jeff and he will arrange a conference call next week with the

enter into swaps under the CFTC regulations) and jurisdictional issues for

counterparty concerns are here as well.

The tribe is located in Oregon.  I'll follow up with you next week.

Tanya:

I have been reviewing some of Gary Hickerson's older master agreements which 
may require amending (to provide for multibranch transactions).  I wanted to 
verify which master we are relying on for UBS AG.  The files are a little 
confusing but it appears that we use the May 31, 1993  Swiss Bank Corporation 
master (and not the March 15, 1994 master with Union Bank of Switzerland).

Do you have any recollection of this?

Sorry I wasn't able to reach you today and I will be out of the office 
tomorrow.  If this can wait until Monday, please contact my assistant Kaye 
Ellis (X35968) and get on my calendar early Monday.  If this cannot wait, 
please contact Mark Taylor (X37459) and he may be able to find a lawyer to 
assist you.

In general, I thought that Wendi was waiting to hear back from Cargill 
Incorporated credit.  Once we understood what Cargill was looking for, I was 
hoping to speak with their lawyer and agree to eliminate all of the 
provisions appearing in the draft POA which did not really concern ENA.  
Recall that ENA does not want to monitor Cargill's agent:  that's an internal 
job for Cargill.

I hope that we can speak on Monday.  Maybe you can coordinate tomorrow with 
Wendi.  Thanks.

Sara- I am going to suggest to Cargill that we will call them before any deal 
with Global gets booked.. they will have to approve it.. and then I'll go 
ahead with the Global deal... they will have to strip out all the references 
to the line... need to ask you a few other things though....

Subject: RE: POA/ Cargill line...


Currently Cargill and Enron have a 15MM collateral threshold.  If
possible, I think the cleanest way to run this biz would be to put a
box around the prime broker biz.  We would still operate under the
master isda but could set up a mutually agreeable credit support annex
for this biz.  We would still keep the 20,000,000 line referenced in
Schedule B of the POA agreement.  The line in the POA is a seperate and
distinct measure from the daily collateral.  The 20 mill reflects gross
exposure.  Let me know if you think this is reasonable and workable.
We too, are open to suggestion as the Global and Enron relationships
are very important and a high priority to us.

Thanks
Joe

Joe-  a few things regading the POA/ Cargill line..

I am going to find out how much line we currently have available... you
probably already have this.  We should allocate a piece to Global which
would solve the problem of other Cargill people using the line, putting
us
over the limit, without me knowing...

We could change the language of the POA to this... we will not go over
Global's piece of the Cargill line...I think this would solve our main
concern...

Please let me know... we are eager to keep trading with Global and
yourselves...

Regards,
Caroline

 <<ENRON MIRANT SOCO ISDA AMENDMENT LTR MIR LCMTS.DOC>>

Sara,

I have a couple quick comments on the letter you sent this morning.  In
general, we need to make clear that we are replacing the credit support
provider under the ISDA.  Otherwise, I am concerned that we could face a
possible default under the ISDA once the VRI parental guaranty is
terminated. Otherwise, the letter looks very agreeable to me.  I am
anticipating we can get this executed today so please keep in touch with me
in regards to any further changes you would like to make.

Many thanks for all your help.

Best regards,

Nicole Russell

Subject: Raptor restructuring

Gentlemen,

After talking with both Joel Ephross and Ron Baker this morning about the 
Raptor restructuring, my understanding of the current plan is summarized 
below.   Please let me know if I have mischaracterized the proposed 
approach.  We have a couple concerns from a tax perspective that are also 
discussed below.  

1.) V&E is currently drafting documents to allow each Raptor structure to 
look to the other structures in terms of credit capacity. 
2.) The previously proposed assignment of the LDC swaps from Raptor II to 
Raptor IV is off the table.  These swaps will now be terminated.
3.) Either Raptor II or Raptor IV will be used to hedge the Mariner 
investment ($360M) instead.  
4.) The JEDI structure is expected to be unwound thus allowing 12M Enron 
Corp. shares to come back to Enron Corp. and no longer be treated as issued 
and outstanding for purposes of Enron's EPS calculation. 
5.) The value of 12M new Enron Corp. shares would be used to capitalize 
either Raptor II or Raptor IV (12M shares x $70 = approx. $840M).  
 a.) As consideration for the contribution of the shares, the receivable owed 
by the lower tier LLC to the Enron member under the grid note would be 
increased by the same amount.
    b.) The credit capacity of the subject Raptor structure would increase by 
an amount equal to the discount on the shares caused by their restricted 
nature.   ($840M x 35% to 45% = approx. $294M to $378M)   
 c.) Ryan has apparently suggested that the shares actually be transferred to 
a trust and that the trust issue a forward contract on the shares to the 
chosen Raptor structure.  We have some concerns about this approach from a 
tax perspective.   I would like to better understand the benefits of using a 
forward contract, who would own the beneficial interest in the trust, and 
what follow-on transactions might be planned regarding the trust.
 d.) I am still confused about the characterization of the contribution of 
the additional shares as utilizing the credit capacity of the Raptor 
structure to which they are contributed.   I can understand why the shares 
would not increase the credit capacity of the structure, but I am told that 
the potential downside on the Enron stock would actually utilize the 
structure's capacity.

Sara,

Some thoughts on some of these:

Entergy Power Marketing - shouldn't be using anymore - Axia is the mktg JV 
for Koch and Entergy
LG&E - hardly ever see trades here anymore; once in a blue moon we see 
something - not worth anyone's time
PMI - highly negotiated their paper; not going to touch it
Cross Timbers, Belco, Breitburn, Cabot - all Fred customer's - I would not 
hold my breath
Dynegy Canada - should already be on our list
Dynegy - should convert to an ISDA
Reliant - should convert to an ISDA
MSCG - should convert to an ISDA

The rest can wait for another time.

Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  
Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the ""See"" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I 
will forward it to them.

We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.

ISDA Master Agreement dated as of 22 December 2000 between ENA and Credit

I will initial the Security Agreement for you and have it executed.  Where do 
you want the executed documents sent?

As you know, all of our master agreements (whether or not related to 
structured deals) are logged into our Lotus Notes database to which London 
has access.  Please provide me with a list and copies of the ISDA Master 
Agreements (and/or related financial agreements) which have been executed by 
London  in the name of ENA.  These agreements should also be logged onto the 
ENA database.    

Will these masters be assigned to Enron Credit Inc.?  Will all trades be 
assigned?  If so, will you prepare the assignment for execution?

Thanks.

Is anyone familiar with an ISDA Master Agreement executed between ENA and the 
above company?  I have received a Security Agreement executed by this party 
seeking ENA's signature and the document references the Endorsement (to a 
policy  - what policy?) issued to ENA on 10/19/00 which defines the ISDA 
agreement.  This could be related to credit activity in London.  I am waiting 
to hear from Jeff Kinneman and Denis O'Connell.

Per my voice mail of date, please feel free to contact me aboutthe 2/1/01 gas 
floor.  As I mentioned in my voice mail, the ISDA Commodity Derivatives 
Definitions provide for the Floating Amount language for caps and floors (see 
Section 6.2).  ""Exercise"" language is not necessary as this is addressed in 
the referenced definitions.

Mr. Geoffrey Pack;

Per Sarah Heineman's earlier discussion with you, Enron North America Corp. 
(""ENA"") will shortly email to you the ISDA Schedule and Paragraph 13.  We do 
not have ISDA boilerplate in word format and assume that you have such 
documents.  If not, please let us know.

We received internal credit information in mid-January.  Unfortunately, the 
derivatives legal group at ENA has been short staffed until very recently so 
we apologize for the delay in submitting draft documentation to you.  We did 
email the Enron Corp. form of guaranty to Michael Midden on 2/16/01.  We are 
currently working with Jay Williams (credit) to respond to any credit issues 
and John Suttle has transferred to our Australia office.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

You need to speak with the developer.  There is no way to control the 
inclusion of ""Other Agreements"" in the ""All Agreements"" section as the system 
is currently designed.

I am not disagreeing with you; I learned this the hard way a few months ago.  
The system is confusing.

It has been my understanding that the first section is supposed to be for 
master swap agreements only.  Having other documents listed in that section 
may be misleading to some parties who may misconstrue their use for general 
trading purposes, such as Global Contracts.  That is why we created the 
""Other Agreements"" section, to house these other agreements.  My 
understanding isthat the only reason other agreements has been listed in the 
Master Swap Agreements Section is that they have been done so erroneously.  
The drop down were not created too artfully created, allowing wrong 
agreements to be put in Master Swap Agreements, which has been 
proliferating.  If my understanding is not correct, than when did the 
intentional use of that first section change?  I think putting all agreement 
is a very bad idea.

Janice/Sara,

Attached please find the fully, negotiated credit terms for an Amended Master 
Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement between CP and EPMI as well as the new 
credit terms for an ISDA Master Swap Agreement between CP and ENA.

Janice/Sara:  Please ensure that Specified Entities for the ISDA include 
Enron Corp. and EPMI, and that the setoff provisions in both the ISDA and 
Master Power are consistent.

Sara:  In the essence of time, Merrill Lynch showed Allegheny Energy the 
existing ISDA between ENA and Merrill Lynch.  So, Allegheny's attorneys have 
reviewed the ISDA terms that we had with Merrill in order to ""get up to 
speed"" with the ISDA that Allegheny would end up having with ENA via 
assignment or ""reproduction of some sort.""  After the financial gas and power 
deals are assigned completely to Allegheny, ENA will continue to have 
interest rate swaps/and maybe even a weather swap with Merrill.  That being 
said, I don't think we can necessarily ""assign"" the ISDA with Merrill to 
Allegheny.  I think we will need to ""reproduce"" the majority of the terms to 
a new ISDA w/Allegheny.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,
Tracy

BEWARE!  This ISDA was almost finalized but for disagreement about assignment 
and arbitration (so there's not much in the Annex A to dispute).  Check Lotus

Cheryl:

Should you have any SEC issues (whether these are reps or forms to be 
completed, you should check with Travis or Lance (or anyone suggested by 
them).  As you may know, ENA has an affiliated registered broker-dealer (and 
that fact could be pertinent in some type of rep).  Thanks.

Sam, I am forwarding to you the final version of the ECT Investments - 
Raymond James Agreement today for execution.  By the end of the day, R/J 
should call me back with a separate account number for an identical agreement 
for ENA for signature as well.  Please have the accompanying docs ready so 
that we can send everything out for signature asap.

Stephanie, by the end of the day or Monday, we are going to have ready for 
execution the agreements with ""Simmons"" and Frost -- both with ENA.  Can you 
doublecheck with Aneela that this choice, based on her list, is correct.  
Then, when these come in at the end of the day or Monday I will forward for 
execution.

Do we know who other than Gary could sign any agreements today?  If not, 
maybe we will take all of these, plus Robertson Stephens and J.P. Morgan to 
him on Monday.

We may have to wait until Monday to talk about Enron Credit because I have to 
spend the rest of the afternoon preparing the SEC docs, opinion letters and 
other documents for the sale of the Cynet stock by the Houston Economic 
Opportunity Fund LP.

2:45 Houston time is fine for me.
Also, the Trading Limitation language is NOT intended to kick in for intraday 
limit moves but only at the end of the day (i.e., ""closing or settlement 
price"").  We want the language to remain the same.  Hope this works.  Sara

Sorry for the mixup.  Attached is template for confirm and then the GTC 
(minus tax reps).  I'm trying to fit in the tax reps in between phone calls 
and will distribute to Susan Musch (tax) for review.

Stuart:  Who else should be on the review list?

 Thanks.  Sara

A few points about the last draft of the Agreement:

(1)  Par. 1(a):  the transfer and assumption is effective as of March 16, 
2001 and not as of the Collateral Return

(2)  Par. 1(d):  the parties have already agreed to use one set of 
spreadsheets

(3)  Par.  3:  the ML&Co. guaranties are not being released because there are 
existing deals in place.  The guaranties will only be released as to the 
transferred Transactions

(4)  Par. 6:  conform language to side letters

(5)  Par. 8:  Please delete the last two sentences.  Enron will agree to be 
silent as to court actions, costs and attorneys fees.

those who wish to sign and hold the pages in escrow.   I have enclosed a

last
night for your convenience.  Please not that this agreement is being sent to

Sara

Thanks for the note and good wishes!

Probably wondering what I'm doing in the office on a Sundy as a 
newly-wed:catching up on email!

Justin's group deal with equity trading;  Jonathan Marsh will cover on the 
regulatory side.

Hope things are fine back at the ranch and going well for you.

Regards

Paul

Paul:

Just checking to see if you are the lawyer monitoring equity trading in the 
U.K.  I am charged with the oversight of Gary Hickerson's equity activity 
here in Houston and I want to coordinate with the London lawyer.  Please 
advise.

Also, I heard that you were recently married.  Congratulations!

The IRS changed  the rules on us again. This time they're for IRAs and other 
retirement  accounts. A uniform life-expectancy table is among the massive 
changes-all  of them effective retroactively to January 1, 2001. Find out

If you don't mind the risk and have some time until retirement, your home may 
not be the best place to start  building your nest egg. With mortgage rates 
dipping below 7%, returns from other investments might be substantially 
greater. Take a look at ""Make Your Mortgage Pay""  to find out more about

Attached are my comments to the transfer agt.  I think it makes sense to 
attach the form of each side letter to the agreement for clarity.

I have just gotten off the phone with Lauren and Ken Blasko.  There were 
minor comments to LOC Facility that have been faxed to ABN Amro.  We expect 
that ABN Amro will execute the LOC shortly as soon as they pick up the fax.

The LOC will be sent to Lauren.  If there are no further commetns to the 
various contracts, we shoudl be prepaerd to exchange signature pages upon 
conclusion of the LOC Facility.  Lauren will send the LOC together with the 
Side Letters to Enron and Kate.

Lauren is the ALlegheny point person.  Pls direct all correspondence to her.  
Locke, should signature pages be sent to you as well as to Kate?

Janice and Sara, to whose attention and which number should all 
correspondence be directed?

Thank you all for your cooperation and help in moving this toward closing.

Sara,
Thank you for your fax.
Section 180.3 of the CEA prohibits us from agreeing to any settlement
procedure/forum ahead of time.  JPMFI, in accordance with 180.3, will offer
3
forums - which will include AAA.  If Enron chooses AAA, the arbitration
will be
subject to the provisions specified in your fax dd 2/26/2001.

Attached is JPM's proposed language for the arbitration agreement.

(See attached file: ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.doc)

If you are in agreement with the language, please forward Enron's proposed
language (detailed in your 2/26 fax) electronically (if available).

Thank you and Regards,
Corinne

Sara -

I would like to discuss with you a potential opportunity at WAPA Sierra 
Nevada.  We have just sent them an EEI and would like you to send them an 
ISDA.  Basically in the near future they might find themselves quite short 
due to a PG&E contract being invalidated.  If that happens they will either:

1. Buy physical power from the market (use our EEI)
2.Do a financial swap with the market and continue to do the physical index 
with PG&E (there are some reasons for this which I am not 100% sure on).

The lawyer we have dealt with is Koji Kawamura and his email address is:

kawamura@wapa.gov

Thanks for your help - If you have any questions please let me know.

Richard Sage has asked us to change the slate of directors and officers of

retain an officer title.   Will you please provide to me a list of who the 
directors will be and who the officers will be and their respective titles.  
My understanding is that these elections should take place effective March 5, 
2001.  Please advise or if you would like to discuss please call me at

If at all possible, I would really appreciate postponing the tax discussion 
until your next swap group meeting, which I think is in 2 weeks.  I have 
other projects that I have to work on tonight and will not get the 
opportunity to prepare a presentation for the group before the meeting.  I 
really appreciate your asking me to speak to the group and also (hopefully) 
your understanding and patience in postponing the tax discussion.  

Best regards,
Susan

Mark:  This is a chronic problem which I have addressed with Cheryl on more 
than one occasion (hence the email of this morning).  Her priorities are not 
currently with the swap group.  Also, Carol will not be a reliable backup for 
structured deals since Julia's group will demand more of her time.  I don't 
know what Angela's load will be like as an ongoing substitute.  Last night we 
received notice of Yosemite IV and I'm hoping that Angela can cover.  
Alternatively, we may need to consider Frank, Francisco or Cheryl.

something.  Since this has happened before, I am going to sit down with 
Keegan this afternoon to discuss how to schedule and to troubleshoot 
scheduling issues.  


For today, I am going to try to do this - I am going to try to end the GE 
meeting early but I cannot promise.  As I explained to Keegan, since the GE 
meeting is with someone traveling to Enron to attend and is critical to Enron 
Corp., I will not be able to cancel it at the last minute.

If I do not attend, please apologize to the Group to me.  I am a bit 
frustrated because I certainly wanted to attnd to find out what everyone else 
is working on and to report on what I am doing.  I will try to email an 
update in advance and if you do not mind, maybe you could share it with the 
Group.

Hi Keegan, 

Thank you for calling this morning to provide me with my schedule for today.  

I want to share some constructive advice on how to fine tune our strategy 
with respect to scheduling because Keegan this is critical to my providing 
the best legal counsel I can to the various clients we serve.  You indicated 
that there is a conflict on the schedule in that there is a 9:30-10:30 
meeting that conflicts with the Swaps Group meeting.  We do not want to 
schedule conflicting meetings and then realize it at the last minute and then 
just notify one group that we can't attend.  

What you want to do is this:  You want to try at the time of the invitation 
to attend or as soon as practicable to notify me that there would be a 
potential conflict.  Then I will try to rescheduel.  This is especially 
important because the meetings with GSS are usually with folks from outside 
Enron, so once we agree to attend, it is nearly impossible the morning before 
to try to reschedule.  But the swaps meetings and credit meetings are very 
important and there are a lot of issues I need to discuss and anticipated 
attending.  Also and I have missed some in the past due to scheduling 
conflicts.  

Again, I also hope and need for you to take this advice constructively and 
not personally.  I appreciate all of your efforts, Keegan.  

Let's meet this afternoon to talk strategy.  Please note on my calendar that 
Ischeduled two meetings this morning, one at 2:30 and one immediately 
following at 3:30 until 5.  So we should meet before then.

Russell:

I received your voice mail about the one (1) year financial trade done 
between ENA and CP.  The three-month limitation on trades is only an internal 
ENA control which was imposed by credit some years ago.  Please refer to 
Lotus Notes for a more comprehensive explanation.

The Master Agreement has been executed.  However, CP was unable to render a 
legal opinion vouching for ""blanket"" enforceability of the trades due to 
conflicting PUC orders which are still in effect today.

What is credit's position when your internal policy is violated?  Who was the 
trader?  Have you spoken with the trader?

I think quite a few of these were completed in Houston on Friday.

Elisabeth:

I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among 
other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its 
jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) 
made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades 
through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact 
on our standard reps relating to the ""trade options exemption"" and as to the 
parties being ""eligible swap participants"" (are they still required)?  Is 
there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

Martin

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was ""too old"" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. (""ECI"").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

Stewart:

I spoke with Rawleigh White (Tribal CFO) and the Tribe's outside counsel the 
other day.  Pending receipt of Tracy's credit worksheet, I'll send the 
Tribe/lawyers a ""sample ISDA without credit"" which is not specific to the 
Tribe.  The lawyers will begin to determine if the Tribe is an ""eligible 
contract participant"" for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.

Rawleigh wants to know if Enron is interested in helping the Tribe finance 
the purchase of the two dams.  Can you please address for West Origination 
and respond to Raleigh?

Thanks.

Susan, can we send?) which is not tailored specifically for the Tribe.  We 
will be able to provide a specific Schedule and Paragraph 13 after our credit

Sheila:  Thanks for the message.  I spoke with Mike Schneider (who contacted 
me - he's at 212-648-1164) to confirm our agreement and wanted to let you 
know that he was apologetic for having not having ""better rates"" to charge 
ENA.  He said he's been after Enron's business for some time and hopes to 
reduce rates in the course of business, if possible.  I thought you might 
want to have this bit of information.  Regards.  Sara

Theresa and Greg,
The rates from JP Morgan for the Futures account appear to be competitive 
(acutally better) than the terms for our other current agreements.
With 90 day t bill at 4.41%, 90% of this is 3.969% on the credit side vs 4.16 
using JP morgan's less 25 bp.
On the debit side it is competitive.  
Therefore, I am okay with the rate schedule from JP morgan and we can go 
ahead unless anyone can see an objection.
Thanks. Sheila

 Below is the information I received from Joe Hunter's group regarding 
funding rates for some of the exchange brokers.  For comparison JP Morgan's 
Futures funding rates are:

  Credit rate     Debit rate
US Dollars 90 day US TBill auction rate less 0.25%  JP Morgan Overnight 
Borrowing Rate plus 0.25 %

Sheila:  Thanks for the message.  I spoke with Mike Schneider (who contacted 
me - he's at 212-648-1164) to confirm our agreement and wanted to let you 
know that he was apologetic for having not having ""better rates"" to charge 
ENA.  He said he's been after Enron's business for some time and hopes to 
reduce rates in the course of business, if possible.  I thought you might 
want to have this bit of information.  Regards.  Sara

Theresa and Greg,
The rates from JP Morgan for the Futures account appear to be competitive 
(acutally better) than the terms for our other current agreements.
With 90 day t bill at 4.41%, 90% of this is 3.969% on the credit side vs 4.16 
using JP morgan's less 25 bp.
On the debit side it is competitive.  
Therefore, I am okay with the rate schedule from JP morgan and we can go 
ahead unless anyone can see an objection.
Thanks. Sheila

 Below is the information I received from Joe Hunter's group regarding 
funding rates for some of the exchange brokers.  For comparison JP Morgan's 
Futures funding rates are:

  Credit rate     Debit rate
US Dollars 90 day US TBill auction rate less 0.25%  JP Morgan Overnight 
Borrowing Rate plus 0.25 %

I'm forwarding ECT Canada's top 15 counterparties. We will use this list with 
the exception of J. Aaron, BP Amoco, PG&E, Morgan Stanley and Bank of 
Montreal as our target list for the USD/CAD products. Please ensure that a 
GTC is drawn up to allow EOL trading of these currency products. I would like 
to have the legal work done by March 6 in order to meet Gary's deadline.

David: I talked to Goldman today. They have developed a mechanism to feed 
live rates from their website into Excel. They will be here in 2 weeks to do 
a demo.

How does the attached work for the BOFC/NDF?

I am not necessarily proposing that we use this for the EOL deal.

Hey, Jason:

Hope you're doing alright.  I received a call from NY and before I called 
back, I checked the infamous Lotus Notes.  It seems that you were going to 
send a letter to NY summarizing the outstanding issues (I think there was 
only one issue).  Please let me know if this was ever done.  Thanks.

On a sad note, I don't know if you heard but Samantha's 19-month old daughter 
(adoption not final) was killed in a tragic car accident last week.  The 
child managed to crawl under the car while it was in the driveway and Sam 
didn't see her.  Did you really get to know Samantha?  If so, and if you 
would like her home address, please let me know.

Serge:

Sorry to take so long to respond.  A few things:

(1)  What is the correct legal name of the entity you are inquiring about?  
Is it the unregulated marketing arm of the regulated utility?

(2)  There has not been a commercial push from the ENA perspective to set up 
a new agreement with FPL which explains why I cannot get our credit  goup to 
react.  I'll broach the topic again when  I hear from you.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Maria:

I was waiting to see if Jason Peters ever sent a ""position letter"" to you 
when we brought this negotiation back inhouse.  Absent that information, it 
appears that we had at least one issue remaining and it concerned the 
disruption fallbacks, in particular, your request for both you and ENA to 
each obtain two quotes and then average those quotes (the ultimate 
fallback).  We cannot agree to your request.  The last database entry I 
reflect was in October, 2000, when we were having difficulty obtaining your 
response.

Given the lapse of time, we could try to generate a blackline and review the 
status.  Please let me know what you would like to do.

Subject: Re: BEAR Guarantee letter  

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was ""too old"" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. (""ECI"").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

Subject: SEMPRA

It has recently emerged that we have concluded financially-settled trades 
from London with Sempra in the name of ECT (Houston).

Unfortunately, this could create a significant tax issue for ECT (Houston) 
i.e. a taxable presence in the UK.

Therefore, if we wish to continue trading with Sempra from London, we must 
trade in the name of ECTI (aka ECTRIC), but not ECT (Houston). 

This principle applies generally  - London should not bind ECT (Houston) to 
trades with counterparties.

Please call Janine Juggins or myself if you would like to discuss this.

Best regards

Paul

Thank you for the e-mail.  I tried to contact you on your mobile several 
times in the last few minutes but I cannot get through.  Is there anyone 
besides Lauren who can help us in her absence?  I understand the GDRs were 
purchased and the account must be opened.  We cannot do anything without 
background documentation.  Also, we cannot find any information about the 
purchaser on the Enron corporate workbook.  Do you have a list of 
officers/directors?  You can call me at 713/853-5620.  Regards.  Sara

Could you please contact Lauren Hagerty who will be arriving in Houston this 
afternoon (on her way back from Bombay) - please call her at home. I think 
she has already prepared the appropriate documentation. If you are unable to 
contact her please call me in Bombay on my mobile 91 9820282572.  Thanks

How are things going?

In response to your question, there is no internal memo but we do have copies 
of external lawfirm memoranda.  Yes, ENA has changed its ISDA Schedule form 
to provide for the ""eligible contract participant"" rep and line of business.  
I'll verify with Susan Bailey as to whether these changes have been subnitted 
to ECTRIC.  

Rather than bombard you with lots of paper, please let me know what you would 
lilke to see regarding the new legislation.  Please note that the act is very 
broad, extremely confusing (even to CFTC ""know-it alls"") and addresses many 
types of derivatives (ag, equity, etc.) with some specificity.

I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among 
other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its 
jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) 
made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades 
through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact 
on our standard reps relating to the ""trade options exemption"" and as to the 
parties being ""eligible swap participants"" (are they still required)?  Is 
there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

I know that you have been negotiating with Cheryl Nelson about the new ECI 
account.  I am receiving urgent calls from ECI traders and hope you give me 
some answers since Cheryl is in a meeting.

Can we execute the ECI agreement today?  
Have we agreed on the assignment?
Does the assignment also provide for the transfer of the Master Securities 
Loan Agreement?
Regarding the new ENE guaranty, Cheryl has told me that this was already 
requested.  I'll check on the expedited delivery date.

Please call me when you receive this email.  Thanks very much for your 
attention to this matter.

The accounts at Bear owned by the credit book are:

This account is empty but not yet closed

The current ENA acct is: 102-06181
This is where the positions are now held

These are the accounts that need to go to Enron Credit Inc

We're glad to hear that you are coming and we're looking forward to seeing
you again.

You can fly into any one of the three Washington area airports.  Reagan
National is the closest (about 35 minutes by car in non-rush hour traffic),
Washington Dulles is about 40 minutes away and BWI is about 50 minutes away.
That is generally our order of preference in looking for flights.  However,
flights into BWI in general may be cheaper than flights into Dulles or
National, and National tends to be the most expensive.  You need to check all
three as to price, because airfares change frequently and sometimes USAir or
another airline will quote a decent price into National.  Once you have
decided which airport you will be using, let us know and we will e-mail
directions.

Love - Anita and Steve"

The day i received this I responded to Sara and cc'd richard that I was okay

Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in

However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was ""too old"" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. (""ECI"").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

		 Subject: BEAR Guarantee letter

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

Subject: Re: Financial Trading in Brazil  

I am not aware of any products that need to be identified prior to 12/31/99.  
Going forward into next year, the following products might be of interest for 
trading.  Our current plan for managing risk is via offshore products through 
Gary's group due to tax and regulatory reasons.

1. Brazil corporate eurobonds
2. Brazil Brady bonds
3. Other country corporate and/or Brady bonds (ie, can a Brazil limitada own 
an Argentine eurobond?)
4. Bovespa index futures
5. R$ currency futures
6. Local Treasury bills (both US$ indexed and R$ rate) such as BBCs, LBCs, 
LTNs, NTNs, NBCs, etc
7. R$ currency forwards
8. Rules/regulations/tax effects on individual stock trades
9. Local company commercial paper (typically trades at 105% to 110% multiple 
to the overnight rate depending on credit).

As discussed, it would be interesting to see what the tax effects are on each 
type of investment, what margin is required, and what offshore alternatives 
are available for items #4-8 (the first 3 are bringing offshore items into 
Brazil, which we might do if there was a tax benefit that could be obtained).

Thanks,  Bruce

but would very much like to see the new ""eligible contract participant"" and 
line of business reps (or perhaps just a copy of ENA's revised ISDA

How are things going?

In response to your question, there is no internal memo but we do have copies 
of external lawfirm memoranda.  Yes, ENA has changed its ISDA Schedule form 
to provide for the ""eligible contract participant"" rep and line of business.  
I'll verify with Susan Bailey as to whether these changes have been subnitted 
to ECTRIC.  

Rather than bombard you with lots of paper, please let me know what you would 
lilke to see regarding the new legislation.  Please note that the act is very 
broad, extremely confusing (even to CFTC ""know-it alls"") and addresses many 
types of derivatives (ag, equity, etc.) with some specificity.

Will you be in San Antonio?

I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among 
other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its 
jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) 
made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades 
through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact 
on our standard reps relating to the ""trade options exemption"" and as to the 
parties being ""eligible swap participants"" (are they still required)?  Is 
there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

FirstEnergy Services Corp - please have your assistant redline changes since 
this is also one of Sam's items

City of Palo Alto and Macquarie Inc. (or ""Bank Ltd"") -  neither of these are 
on anyone's radar screen so please proceed as you wish

Proctor & Gamble - please return to me for further handling.  Ed Quinn is 
leaving Enron

Allied Waste North America -- Samantha has this marked ""sent for execution"" 
as of 2/13; can I get one of the other specialists to follow up on this?

FirstEnergy Services Corp -- Very close to finishing this (I hope); I owe 
them another redline that should reflect agreement on all issues

Select Energy -- this has recently been revived after a long dormancy.  Ed 
Sacks is revisiting credit issues.  Meanwhile, I am plodding through minutiae 
with their very detail-minded attorney

City of Palo Alto -- recently received an e-mail from their assistant city 
attorney stating that they are internally discussing what needs to be done to 
their city code to allow for derivatives trading; he also said they will not 
be ready to discuss this w/ me for a couple of weeks

Macquarie Bank Ltd. -- this is an ag ISDA (although there is no specific 
trade for it at this time).  I am waiting for our meeting to discuss 
ag-related changes to our ISDA forms.  Once that is settled, I will send them 
an updated draft

Proctor & Gamble -- I sent Libby Rutherford a letter in December, outlining 
the issues to be discussed.  I think I also put in a few phone calls to her 
at that time.  I never heard from her.  I haven't heard any pressure for 
movement from the pulp & paper desk since I met w/ Ed Quinn and some other 
people in January (although I did happen to get a call yesterday from an EES 
person working on a deal with them; he was just curious as to what we were 
doing w/ them and the status of things; I put him in touch w/ Ed)

still happy to meet w/ you on these if you wish -- Bob

(1)  The only agreement that ENA is assigning is the Securities Loan 
Agreement.

(2)  Remember, ENA is also assigning the ""credit book"" (identified in 
Sheila's earlier email and more clearly identified in Tom Doukas' email of 
yesterday which I forwarded to ;you yesterday).

Sara, I am on hold on a conference call but wanted to talk with you about 
some questions/issues re: the assignment agreement.  (My questions are not 
holding us up since Anna is proceeding to try to get a final draft as we know 
it executed).  But for my own understanding:

1. Is ENA assigning to Enron Credit Inc. any agreements other than the 
Securities Loan Agreement?  If so, let me know.  If not, then would we need 
an assignment agreement as opposed to just having Enron Credit Inc. sign a 
Securities Loan Agreement?

Hi Sara and Sheila, 

By way of update, I was able to get the guaranty to Clem and am working on 
his getting it back to me by the end of the day.  I talked to Bear Stearn's 
lawyer today about whether we could get the other agreements (account and 
assignment) executed today and she represented that (1) she is still waiting 
for her Managing Director's approval of her final draft in order to forward 
it to me (2) but that she is working with me to check in with the MD every 
hour or so for a status update.

Wednesday, March 28 is the target execution date for the ECI customer 
agreement and assignment (from ENA) of the Securities Loan Agreement/credit 
book.  I am not certain if Cheryl was able to expedite delivery of the new 
ENE guaranty.

Tom,
The day i received this I responded to Sara and cc'd richard that I was okay 
with transferring the Stock Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI.  The ENA was 
executed and the ECI piece is what is in process.  

Sara,
Any update?  How far are we away from exectution?  Do you need anything from 
anyone?

Thanks. Sheila

Subject: Re: BEAR Guarantee letter  

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was ""too old"" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. (""ECI"").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

Hey, DUDE!  Have you forgotten to read your Lotus Notes today?  Looks like 
this one filtered through lots of people (since you left, multiple people 
fill your shoes).  And where did you hear it was nice over in Houston?  It's 
raining with a high of 54 F.  But it is supposed to reach mid-70's over the 
weekend.

I'll ask Susan B. to send you a copy.  Stay tuned for the mad cow email.

Susan-

Please fax or e-mail the first revised draft of the ISDA to Rodolfo.  I 
believe that TGS is ready to execute this document except for a pending 
question that they have concerning speculation.  I am not sure what the issue 
is exactly for TGS in regards to speculation (see e-mails below), but I am 
calling Rodolfo for clarification.

Also, do you know who could forward a sample copy of a confirmation to 
Rodolfo as well??

Thank you,

Pat

Pat, 

Question: If you hedge something and then you do not produce (you do not back 
up your production with your swap), so basically you are speculating, how 
does that affect your financials??
TGS's lawyer will be back next Monday. I know you and Susan have worked on a 
new ISDA (w/o the CSA). Could you forward that to me so I send it to TGS and 
on Monday they have all the documents ready please?
TGS asked me if we could send them a model of a ""confirmation ticket"" to see 
how it looks like. Also, I would like to see it as well, cause I never seen 
one. I guess that you will put price, index, settlements and volumes.

Thanks,

Rolo

Subject: TGS SWAP - Almost there...


I talked to Eduardo Pawluszek (TGS) this morning. So that everybody knows, 
last week we quoted propane, butane and gasoline. Citibank and Goldman Sachs 
have also quoted, but Enron came up with the best price. Eduardo told me he 
is ready to go, but he is still trying to waiting for Marketing to define 
volumes.
What the auditors are saying is that if TGS hedges 2,500 tons during one 
month and they end up selling 0 tons, the hedge is now pure speculation. This 
is the main problem Eduardo is having.   We need to communicate that the risk 
on price over the next 14 months is far more that the risk of a slight 
shortfall in delivery over the same time period.  Which is the greater 
speculation??
On the ISDA, his lawyer will be arriving on Monday and we will keep on 
working on the document next week. 
Eduardo told me he is totally on board with this hedge  but he is trying to 
convince Marketing to go for it (and it is giving him a hard time).

We are plannig to pre-pay this swap which, considering current financial 
circumstances, would benefit TGS greatly.

Do we need to go higher up in the organization??  

Thanks,

Jeff and Rolo

Sara,
Thank you for your fax.

procedure/forum ahead of time.  JPMFI, in accordance with 180.3, will offer
3
forums - which will include AAA.  If Enron chooses AAA, the arbitration
will be
subject to the provisions specified in your fax dd 2/26/2001.

Attached is JPM's proposed language for the arbitration agreement.

Sara -

I would like to discuss with you a potential opportunity at WAPA Sierra 
Nevada.  We have just sent them an EEI and would like you to send them an 
ISDA.  Basically in the near future they might find themselves quite short 
due to a PG&E contract being invalidated.  If that happens they will either:

1. Buy physical power from the market (use our EEI)
2.Do a financial swap with the market and continue to do the physical index 
with PG&E (there are some reasons for this which I am not 100% sure on).

The lawyer we have dealt with is Koji Kawamura and his email address is:

kawamura@wapa.gov

Thanks for your help - If you have any questions please let me know.

Subsequent to our swap group meeting with Clement last week, I have discussed 
the issue further with Jeff Hodge, Peter Keohane, Russell Diamond and Clem.  
In addition to ENA, ECC is feeling the pressure of delays for obtaining 
corporate guaranties caused by increased guaranty requests, too few signers 
and insufficient legal staffing to handle the volume.

Although Clem will have assistance soon, we concluded that it would be 
prudent to begin negotiation of a guaranty immediately rather than wait for 
the conclusion of the master agreement (or confirmation) negotiations.  
Please try to incorporate this approach, particularly with Canadian 
counterparties. 

Credit will continue to push our internal form of Enron Corp. guaranty.

Tracy:

The Allegheny swap side letter provides that the parties will make a good 
faith effort to negotiate the ISDA master by April 6.  I am waiting with the 
firrst redraft of the agreement but can't get a response from anyone as to 
whom and where to send (via email).  I've left voice mails for Yair and Kate 
at Allegheny and Lauren at Sullivan and Cromwell.

Can you exert some pressure here?

Hi, Lauren:

I cannot find the new email address for the Allegheny lawyer for delivery of 
a revised ISDA Schedule.  I left a voice mail for Yair Yaish and for Laurie 
Peddicord
but have not heard back.  Can you provide me with the latest information?  
Are you the lawyer who should receive this Schedule?  Please let me hear from

Attached is a blacklined (against the Enron North America Corp. draft of 
3/15/01) Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex.  I have 
tried to incorporate the essence of the March 19, 2001 ""swap side letter

Subject: Brazil 10 year power deal

Christine:

Let me know if you have heard about a 10 year deal that Brazil did.  Gustavo 
advised that they are going to buy 1.7MW (24x7)at 40.00Real from a sugar mill 
beginning in May 2000.  The purchase price is suppose to be inflation 
adjusted starting 2001.  ECE will be selling this power to Elektro at a 
biomass pricing that is government controlled and adjusted annually.  The 
price to Elektro is approximately 80.00Real.   

I believe that this deal may have been already executed, but have not 
received a response from Brazil yet.  I have not had a chance to review the 
sugar mill's profile and make any type of credit assessment.

Let me know if you have heard from Brazil on this and whether we have a 10 
year power curve from them.

Regards,

Pat

Subject: Re: Contacts

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EDIDE's accounts, EDIDE will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

Sheila, finally ready to open up the account at Morgan Stanley for EDIDE so 
that EPCA can transfer the correct amount of ADRs.  I have the Corporate

Importance: High

Richard Sage has asked us to change the slate of directors and officers of 
this entity to U.S. people, with the exception that perhaps Richard Sage will 
retain an officer title.   Will you please provide to me a list of who the 
directors will be and who the officers will be and their respective titles.  
My understanding is that these elections should take place effective March 5, 
2001.  Please advise or if you would like to discuss please call me at

1. We do not have to send Bear the Officers/Traders list and other documents

things for me.

 Where are your definitions of ""Calculation Period"" and ""IPA Modified

In your definition of ""IPA Floating Rate Payment"", you use the term ""Share 
Spread"" which is not defined.  What do you mean?  There is a dangling 
definition of ""Share Spread"" at the end of the IPA Compensation section, but 
it refers to spreads appearing in either Annex I or Annex II.

In the ""IPA Compensation"" section, how is ""a negative IPA elected""?  Who is 
making an election?

Let's discuss tomorrow.

Good Morning Sara,

""Share Spread"" is not applicable and should be deleted. 

A negative IPA is subject to a specific swap traded. It would have to be a 
case where the Stock is already part of the Basket and they elect to unwind 
the swap and reduce the number of shares from the basket. For example, if 
10,000 shares of XYZ Company were part of the original basket, they can trade 
off 5,000 shares of the swap effectively creating a negative IPA. The trade 
is mutually agreed upon. 

Looking forward to meeting with you!

Jorge

1.  Check the comments for Ms. Lewis' information.

2.  No, I indicated that the assignment and account agreement were 
essential.  I did not say that accompanying docs were not required.  I

this (if it was not you) so that I know what is going on and what I can 
represent in talking with the people at Bear?


Much thanx,

Sara, I have stopped by your office but you are not around.  Please provide 
the following information/clarification in light of your conversations with 
other folks:

1. We do not have to send Bear the Officers/Traders list and other documents 
with the agreements to get things moving?

2.  If we do, then who do I contact or ask Richard Sage to contact to get 
this information re: the correct slate of officers updated?  No one has 
advised me of these steps.  And actually, if we have to do this, I would like 
Stephanie to take the lead on finishing her work on this part of the project.

3. Re: this attorney Cheryl at Bear  that you have talked to -- what is her 
full name, phone, and fax?


Thanx.

Sounds like Keegan has somethig wrong.  I have no meetings scheduled with you 
tomorrow.  I don't know anything about a 9 am meeting.  The brokerage 
meetings were originally scheduled every other week until we could bring 
ourselves up to date (and we met last week).  The swap group meeting is 
always held twice monthly.  Hope this helps.

Hi Sara, 

I need to reschedule on of the three brokerage account meetings that are on 
my calendar for tomorrow.  

My calendar indicates that I have a 9 a.m. one hour meeting with you, a 10 
a.m. one hour swaps meeting, a 1:30 brokerage account meeting a 2:30 one hour 
credit support meeting and a 4 p.m. meeting with someone from yet another 
Enron entity seeking to open a brokerage account on an urgent basis.

Keegan and I have now developed a strategy to ensure that we do not have so 
many meetings on one day.  Most of the other meetings are group meetings and 
therefore are not possible to reschedule.

I think it would be helpful for the desk and legal to retain monthly meetings 
just to stay abreast of activity and expectations.  Why don't we keep the end

Hi, Michael:

Per my voice mail, I am interested in purchasing a case of Skewis 
half-bottles (any vineyard).  Do you have 12 bottles available?  That is my 
first request.  If you don't have 12 Skewis, then I may have to search for 
alternatives. 

Shipment for this case will be directly to:

Michael C. McKeogh
601 Poydras Street, 23rd Floor
New Orleans, LA  70130

We can discuss payment when I hear from you.  Thanks for your help.

Effective March 19, 2001,  AESC and ENA entered into a ""Side Letter 
Agreement"" which is an ISDA Master Agreement from a legal perspective.  ENA 
and AESC have agreed this morning to negotiate and execute a new ISDA Master 
Agreement by April 13, 2001.  Until that date, however, we can confirm 
financial trades between ENA and AESC under the Side Letter Agreement.  
Attached below is a markup of an ISDA form of confirmation which contains 
language for these confirmations (the draft was prepared for Kim Hundl 
handling financial power).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Cheryl:

Just a bit of history:  I think that the partial listing of officers on the 
(authorized traders) list is only meant to be illustrative of corporate 
officers and directors.  The ENA unanimous consent for the relevant company 
is the authority for document execution.  If, for example, a VP is authorized 
to execute for a particular company (by virtue of a corporate resolution or 
unanimous consent) and that particular VP's name does not appear in the 
partial listing, exection is not invalidated.  The execution is valid.

Have you had a broker question ENA's authority?

generally and right away

Hey Stephanie, we need to revise this list because it does not make sense at 
least with respect to ENA.  It does not list key people (e.g. Gary) and it is 
inconsistent with the resolutions.  For example, the resolutions say that a 
managing director and treasurer can be a designated person to open an account 
but ENA does not have such an officer.  There are MD's and then there is a VP 
and Treasurer.  There are I think other inconsistencies we need to clear up 
to avoid having the accounts invalidated.  Having these points clear is 
especially important where, like now, we won't have Gary or Mark Frevert sign 
because they are out of town and we need to open the account right away.  

I know you are swamped so I will work tonight on revising the List for ENA 
tonight and give the revisions to do first thing in the morning.

Can you revise the List for ECT today (or just doublecheck it) so that we do 
not have a hold up in executing the Goldman International account for ECT 
first thing in the morning.  I promised Sheila Glover we would execute it 
right away.

Did we open any ENA accounts in the past two weeks and if so, just to be 
clear, can we send them a list that includes Gary's name and title if he 
signed.

Hi, Michael - hope all is well.

Just curious if London might be interested in a George Washington University 
MBA (International Business) looking for work in London or Europe.  She is a 
family friend.  She is bilingual (Swedish and English) and fluent in French 
and German.  She also has work experience.  I am going to send her resume to 
HR in Houston and suggest her for the analyst/associate program.  However, I 
wasn't certain as to whether the London/European offices worked through a 
different processs.  Please let me know if you think there may be some 
interest.

I am finishing the last of the edits right now, and was going to wait until I 
was finished to give them to Cheryl for review.  Would you like to see them 
before she gives the final review?  I will be glad to send them to you.  
Thanks,

thanks.  I only asked Keegan for the most recent version since I misplaced

Hello Sara, 

Keegan told me that you had asked her today to send to you an updated 
Brokerage Agreement Status Report.   We (the legal eagles) and the business 
folks agreed at the last meeting on 3/28 that I would distribute the report 
every two weeks - every other Thursday.  This works best for me and Keegan.  
Under that schedule, Keegan and I have planned that the report would be ready 
for group-wide distribution this Thursday.

Further to my voice mail of earlier today, the CI guaranty appears to be

Attached are blacklined versions based upon Cargill's comments to both the 
Enron Corp. and Cargill, Incorporated which I received from Ed Sacks.  Please 
note that I added a comma to guarantor's name in the Cargill, Incorporated 
guaranty since that is how we executed the Cargill, Incorporated ISDA Master 
Agreement.

Also, your change to the setoff language is fine.

Let's try to agree to everything this week.  Thanks.

Tanya:  Do we need to differentiate between the MAC as used in the CSA and in 
the Schedule (as an ""Additional Event of Default"") with respect to the 
disappearance of a credit rating from either S&P or Moody's (or both) based 
on your usage in power masters?  

I believe that we agreed that for purposes of the CSA (when S&P and Moody's 
are indicated on the credit worksheet), both ratings must disappear to 
trigger the MAC.

For purposes of an Additional Event of Default, should we just pose the 
question to credit?

It should say either; therefore, if one were to disappear, an Event of 
Default would occur.  This was the intent and is probably consistent with 
that in the Master Power agmt.

Susan B. should have gotten our draft of the referenced guaranty to you.  It 
still needs to be reviewed by the physical gas group since we are amending 
their guaranty.  Do you care about any allocation of payments between HPL and 
ENA?  At the moment, I do not have any allocation language in the guaranty.

Mark:

When you have a few minutes, I'm glad to discuss continuing ""training"" and 
balancing workloads.
Mary has no one to unload Canada and structured transactions (Global Finance) 
since Carol does not have time for either.  Angela has no time for equity 
deals.  I think we need a backup for each.  Perhaps Anne Koehler fits the 
bill.  Or Cheryl.  Each of Anne and Cheryl need ISDA experience.
I don't know Francisco's longer term schedule and maybe you need to speak 
with him and/or Mark Haedicke about his contined international workload.  
This could turn into a ""Yao long term project.""

Yes, ""eligible contract participant""  (""ECP"") is an issue.  Both ENA and 
ECTRI are Delaware corporations and are therefore subject to the jurisdiction 
of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the U.S. regulatory agency with 
oversight for derivatives).  As a practical matter, I understand that ECTRI 
does have many executed ISDA agreements.  I do not know the volume of 
""omnibus"" trades.  However, the ECTRI omnibus should have ECP representations 
in the annex.

A financial trade v24545 was done with Total International Limited.  This 
entity is subsidiary of a very good credit customer, TotalElf (S&P rated 
AA-).  Risk is acceptable, small volumes, short tenor, but from a legal 
standpoint, I do not think this entity is an ""Eligible Contract Party"" as we 
have no guaranty support or financial statements to support trading.  I 
noticed that quite a bit of financial trades are currently booked in London 
with this customer.  Does Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. 
(London financial) have the same ECP requirements as ENA.  If so, I would 
like to know how they have established eligibility.

Holli:

EWEB's Board Resolution of December 5, 2000 permits financial hedging in 
general and authorizes:

""The General Manager or other authorized officers as noted in the Power Risk 
Management Guidelines to execute confirmations of transactions within the 
limits specified in the Power Risk Management Guidelines.""

Each time ENA trades with EWEB, the trader must verify whether the EWEB 
trader is authorized under the then current version of the Power Risk 
Management Guidelines.  Each date you execute a trade:  (1)  you will need a  
list of authorized traders (authorized to enter into derivative transactions) 
certified by EWEB's secretary to be correct as of the Trade Date and (2) a 
statement certified by EWEB's secretary that the Transaction falls within the 
limits specified in the most current version of the Power Risk Management 
Guidelines, effective as of the Trade Date.

We have only a portion of the Power Risk Management Guidelines and it is 
dated April 19, 1999.  Our version is incomplete and probably outdated.  
Maybe EWEB will provide you with the current version.

It would be a lot easier if EWEB's resolution simply authorized it to enter 
into financial trades documented under the ISDA (which is what most 
resolutions permit).  However, EWEB did not obtain a broad resolution.

To Melissa, Sharen and Kim:  We should also verify that our confirmations 
contain these representations.  Please talk to me.

ECT and Sonoco entered into a one- year ""plastics"" swap which terminated on 
March 31, 1999.  Doug Friedman (plastics trader) has asked that ECT formally 
demand $60,000 from Sonoco for underpayment on the swap.  Sonoco has claimed 
the existence of a Market Disruption resulting from price reformation in the 
plastics publication ""Monthly Petrochemical & Pleastics Analysis"" which 
caused it to use a differenct Floating Price calculation.  ECT disagrees as 
to the existence of such an event.  Doug will contact me this week to review 
our approach.  Please give me a call.  Thanks.  Sara

If the guaranty is capped at $15million and payment demands are  made by HPL 
and ENA that exceed the cap, full payment cannot be made.  Should the 
payments be allocated proportionately or according to receipt of demand, or 
do we care?  I hope this helps.  SS

Susan B. should have gotten our draft of the referenced guaranty to you.  It 
still needs to be reviewed by the physical gas group since we are amending 
their guaranty.  Do you care about any allocation of payments between HPL and 
ENA?  At the moment, I do not have any allocation language in the guaranty.

From a credit standpoint, potential risk of this 25,000 bbls/mo, May'01, 
financial swap is very small.  But I recognize ECP issues since no support 
and no information has ever been available.  Can we include a representation 
that, upon execution, would establish eligibility.  I will manage credit 
under volume/tenor limits and implied support of a AA parent.  If acceptable, 
please send language to Confirmations for use in this (v24545) and all future 
trades.

Yes, ""eligible contract participant""  (""ECP"") is an issue.  Both ENA and 
ECTRI are Delaware corporations and are therefore subject to the jurisdiction 
of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the U.S. regulatory agency with 
oversight for derivatives).  As a practical matter, I understand that ECTRI 
does have many executed ISDA agreements.  I do not know the volume of 
""omnibus"" trades.  However, the ECTRI omnibus should have ECP representations 
in the annex.

financial requirements


A financial trade v24545 was done with Total International Limited.  This 
entity is subsidiary of a very good credit customer, TotalElf (S&P rated 
AA-).  Risk is acceptable, small volumes, short tenor, but from a legal 
standpoint, I do not think this entity is an ""Eligible Contract Party"" as we 
have no guaranty support or financial statements to support trading.  I 
noticed that quite a bit of financial trades are currently booked in London 
with this customer.  Does Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. 
(London financial) have the same ECP requirements as ENA.  If so, I would 
like to know how they have established eligibility.

Sara, I have good news, I think we are very close to executing this baby.

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside 
cousel which highlight the differences between this contract and the side 
letter/ML ISDA.  They are not much.  I have also made some changes directly 
on their draft where I either concurred with Enron or needed to make some of 
my own changes.  Pls review and let me know what you think.

I will be leaving the office soon, so if we can wrap it up tomorrow that 
would be great (I'm out Monday for Passover).

Sara: The only list that we have that is permanent is the Origination list. 
You would receive e-mails about all the deals and prospective deals 
originated by the group, including trading. Would you like to be added to 
this one? The other option would be adding you to specific trading deal lists 
that usually include only those directly involved with that specific deal 
(and is never very consistent. To be quite honest, not all the Origination 
deals are circulated through the Origination list). As far as I know, other 
than Moema - the 10-year PPA, there's nothing going on at the moment. No Term 
Sheets signed or anything. I spoke to Brent today about the Moema deal. There 
are some issues that I still have to clarify with the business people such as 
to who we are going to sell the power, contingencies, etc. I could not get a 
hold of Remi, who is coordinating the deal. As soon as I talk to him I'll 
send you guys an update.

executed.  We spoke with Allegheny this morning and they promise to execute 
next week.

Hi Sara,
Attached are the changes you requested.  Shall I begin confirming all

Thanks for your help!

Hi Sara,
Ok, I think I have properly referenced the side letter in this confirmation.  
Please let me know what changes should be made.

P.S. I am leaving at noon today, so if I haven't heard from you by then, I 
will give you a call tomorrow morning.
Thanks!

		 Subject: NUI

Since NUI Utilites, Inc. is the rated entity, we are no longer requiring the 
$50MM NUI Corp gty for this transaction.  However, the financial swap (which 
should be 40,000/day total for May-Oct) is being documented under  the NUI 
Energy Brokers, Inc. existing ISDA.  Sara has modified to cross default the 
confirmation to the Credit Agreement.  Stacy, please share the language you 
are using for the Transaciton Agreement to compensate for the Credit 
Agreement expiry in December with Sara so the financial confirmation can be 
modified as well.  We also need to modify the financial confirmation to state 
that for this transaction only, NUI must be the Guarantor not NUI Capital.  
Then we must get a deal specific gty from NUI Utilites to cover this trade - 
probably $10MM.  This all arises because the finc/phys gty we were working on 
is out the window since NUI Utilities is the rated entity with associated 
balance sheet and the NUI Corp is not needed.  Please advise asap and call 
with any questions.

Thanks,
Tanya"

		 Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Sara, I have good news, I think we are very close to executing this baby.

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside 
cousel which highlight the differences between this contract and the side 
letter/ML ISDA.  They are not much.  I have also made some changes directly 
on their draft where I either concurred with Enron or needed to make some of 
my own changes.  Pls review and let me know what you think.

I will be leaving the office soon, so if we can wrap it up tomorrow that 
would be great (I'm out Monday for Passover).

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside

I will be leaving the office soon, so if we can wrap it up tomorrow that
would be great (I'm out Monday for Passover).

Dear Sara,

Thanks for your agreement to the Set-Off language.  Do you have some
insights I can pass on to our attorney, who was wondering about the
reason behind the language in Part 5(B), the second Set-Off paragraph?

I had forwarded your comments to our Credit Manager, Andrzej
Kabarowski,
who works with our Corporate Treasury on the Cargill guarantees, but
have yet to receive a response.  I have, however, learned that our
Corporate Treasury has begun implementing a revised guarantee format
(and I am told they are absolutely inflexible about the new language).
We're trying to ascertain whether guarantees are also changing for
Cargill-Alliant, which is a joint venture rather than a subsidiary.
I will advise as soon as I know something definitive in this regard.

Unfortunately, it looks as though this Agreement will need to remain
in the ""pending"" stack for a little while longer.

Regards,
Mara Alexander

Attached are blacklined versions based upon Cargill's comments to both
the
Enron Corp. and Cargill, Incorporated which I received from Ed Sacks.
Please note that I added a comma to guarantor's name in the Cargill,
Incorporated guaranty since that is how we executed the Cargill,
Incorporated ISDA Master Agreement.

Also, your change to the setoff language is fine.

Let's try to agree to everything this week.  Thanks.

Looks like the guarantor will have to change to:  NUI Corp. (and replace NUI

Sara, Allegheny would like to be able to assign to affilaites in the same 
manner that we are allowing Enron to make an ssignment so long as the Gty 
goes along.  In our case, however, there is no gty, hence the stipualtion 
that such assignment must be to an entity with an equal or better credit 
rating.  If you wish, I can limit such assignment to an entity rated at least 
BBB+ or better.  Would that resolve your concerns?

adequate.

(2)  Procedures for Entering into Transactions.  There is no procedure for
dual confirms.  This is too confusing.

subjective.

manner that we are allowing Enron to make an ssignment so long as the Gty 
goes along.  In our case, however, there is no gty, hence the stipualtion 
that such assignment must be to an entity with an equal or better credit 
rating.  If you wish, I can limit such assignment to an entity rated at least 
BBB+ or better.  Would that resolve your concerns?

Sara, I wanted to let u knwo that under the FERC rules, we have to file the 
Enron side letter for the physical master agreement in the same manner that 
we filed the original agt between Enron and Allegheny.  Our PA office is 
handling that and, if I am not mistaken, has taken of that yesterday.  I do 
not think that EPMI is requried to file with the FERC because u are a power 
amrekter, but I am wondering whether u do such filings anyway.

Ellen:

I've reviewed WestLB's optional early termination language which is similar 
to the other's which I've reviewed (e.g., Goldman, Chase, Merrill, etc.).  
Here's how it works for your 3/26/01 - 3/26/21 swap:

(1)  March 28, 2011 is the ""Break Date"" or ""Early Termination Date"".  

(2)  Either party can give notice of early termination to the other party on 
the day that is 5 NY Business Days prior to the Break Date.  By the way, this 
is also the day on which the parties must mutually agree on 5 leading dealers 
in the relevant market in case the valuation process in (3) below is later 
disputed by the other party.

(3)  The party giving notice determines (in good faith) the Cash Settlement 
Amount as of 11 a.m. NY time on the Break Date (which should be the 
mid-market value of the deal on the Break Date.

(4)  Payment will occur on the Break Date.

(5)  I am adding a provision requiring the exercising party to notify the 
other party on the day that is 3 NY Business Days prior to the Break Date.  
There may be a dispute over the calculation and the parties will need to 
resolve.

(6)  If the parties cannot agree on the Cash Settlement Amount calculation, 
then the party who gave notice seeks mid-market quotes from the 5 leading 
dealers (previously agreed to) at 11 a.m. on the day that is 2 NY Business 
Days before the Break Date.  The confirm describes how the quotes are 
averaged.  A minimum of 3 quotes is essential.  Payment is still made on the 
Break Date.


George:

(1)  Please verify that the Break Date is 3/28/11.  My copy is a little fuzzy 
and the date could actually be 3/26/11.

(2)  I've marked the confirm and faxed it to you.  Please note that:

 (a)  the second paragraph purports to incorporate the 1991 ISDA Definitions 
but the master overrides this language because it incorporates the 1991 
Definitions ""as amended, modified, superceded or replaced from time to time"" 
(i.e., the 2000 ISDA Definitions).  There is a problem if  WestLB disagrees 
because I've left some language in Paragraph 3 ""as is"" since it is based upon 
the 2000 ISDA Definitions. 

 (b)  no need to say that the Calculation Agent is ""as otherwise stated in 
the Agreement"" because WestLB is stated to be the Calculation Agent in the 
Agreement.

Tanya:

After the last meeting, I promised to ask you about the following:

(1)  Nova Scotia Power Inc. - this shows up as ""credit review"".  Should this 
remain on the list and if so, is there anything that legal needs to do?

(2)  Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc. - this is the new ""Forest Oil"" of the 
list so I say let's forget it.  No, seriously, Carol did revisit the latest 
draft and said it was pared down about as far as it could go.  Further, she 
cannot get anyone at Occidental to return phone calls.

Please let me know what you would like to do.

All:

(1)  Joe and I have reviewed the Termination Agreement for Mercado and it 
looks fine.

(2)  I suggest that the following language be added to the bottom of a 
revised invoice (revised because the comment section which indicates the 
NF1164.Y is an annuity completed on 04/11/01 is inaccurate):

Mercado Gas Services, Inc. acknowledges that payment for Deal No. NF1164.Y is 
made in partial consideration of that certain Assignment and Assumption 
Agreement dated as of April 5, 2001 by and among Mercado Gas Services, Inc., 
Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company and Enron North America Corp.

MERCADO GAS SERVICES, INC.

By:  _________________________
Name:  ______________________
Title:  ________________________

(3)  Joe and I have the following questions:

 (a)  If the assignment to Williams was effective 4/5/01, why are we looking 
at figures from 4/9/01 and 4/11/01, respectively?

 (b)  In lieu of (a) above, have ENA and Mercado already agreed to the 
numbers appearing on the invoice?

Tracy, how is this:

Regarding the ""Transfer"" language for Allegheny (Party B), we have the 
following proposal:

""Party B may transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in 
whole but not in part, to any Affiliate provided that (1) such transfer will 
not give rise to a Termination Event or an Event of Default, and (2) (i) the 
creditworthiness of the Affiliate is not materially weaker than that of Party 
B immediately prior to such transfer, unless Party B provides a satisfactory 
guaranty or credit support to the Affiliate, or (ii) the proposed Affiliate 
satisfies the criteria that Party A applies in deciding whether to offer or 
make an extension of credit or to enter into transactions similar to the 
Transactions subject to the proposed transfer.""

Sara, Allegheny would like to be able to assign to affilaites in the same
manner that we are allowing Enron to make an ssignment so long as the Gty
goes along.  In our case, however, there is no gty, hence the stipualtion
that such assignment must be to an entity with an equal or better credit
rating.  If you wish, I can limit such assignment to an entity rated at
least BBB+ or better.  Would that resolve your concerns?

Sara, I have good news, I think we are very close to executing this baby.

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside
cousel which highlight the differences between this contract and the side
letter/ML ISDA.  They are not much.  I have also made some changes directly
on their draft where I either concurred with Enron or needed to make some
of my own changes.  Pls review and let me know what you think.

I will be leaving the office soon, so if we can wrap it up tomorrow that
would be great (I'm out Monday for Passover).

Tom:

I am not certain that the existing resolution permits repurchase and reverse 
repurchase transactions and securities lending, bonds borrow pledge, etc. as 
the brokerage consent was not written to accommodate these types of 
transactions.  However, if the repo party will accept our existing format, 
then we need not worry.  I'll call Ted Leh and try to find the proper Goldman 
person.

Sara,

Can you please provide your findings on the following items:

1. Determine with Cheryl that ECI is in fact authorized to transact Repos

2. How robust the Goldman Repo agreements are, and their sutability to ECI.

3. An estimate on how long it will take to set up the Goldman Repo Agreements 
in ECI's name.


Can you please also provide any ideas how ECI or ECL could transact a Repo 
trade today using existing documentation.


London has indicated an urgent need to carry out these transactions.

Thanks,

Tom

Sure.  I think we should ask Paul R. if anyone else from credit is necessary 
(London, perhaps?) and from legal, you, Brent and me.

Also, we need to refine the offsite now that we have a date set.  I will be 
on vacation during the week of May 7 - 11.  Were you able to put a list 
together?

 I though it might be helpful to review where we stand on the various
agreements:

 1. Enfolio Agreement between NUI Utilities and ENA - The version
(including all Exhibits) that Stacy sent on April 11 (5:23 p.m.) is the
final and is acceptable.  I have asked Terri Sue to forward NUI's Notice
Information (Exhibit A) to Stacy.  Stacy, upon receipt, can you please
generate the final agreement?
 2. Physical Transaction Agreement - I need to review Section 4 with
Bob Lurie who will be back in the office tomorrow.
 3. April Transaction Confirmation Letter - Stacy, this letter should
be addressed to Thomas E. Smith, Director, Energy Planning (who signed the
Confirmation).  Also, please confirm that the Exhibits are NUI Confirmation
Nos. 31060 and 46669.
 3. Swap Transaction Agreements - I am attaching a revised version of
the Transaction Agreement and Exhibit for Swap V09140.4 from Enron's review.
As Mark and I discussed, NUI Corporation, not NUI Utilities, will be the
Guarantor. In addition, I have modified the form of Guaranty to make it
clear that it only applies to these two Swaps; this is similar to what Enron
had agreed to when we were contemplating an NUI Corp. Guaranty for the
Enfolio Agreement.  I have made this change to the Guaranty because I am not
satisfied that the discussion within the Confirmation that purports to limit
the scope of the Guaranty is sufficient.  I think the limitations need to be
set forth within the four corners of the Guaranty itself.   If acceptable,
the same changes should be made to the Transaction Agreement and Exhibit for
Swap V09140.5.

are waiting to receive it back from our Zurich office (unfortunately the
person required to sign has been out). We should have faxed signature pages
(which we can, in turn, fax to you) at some point tomorrow. In addition, we
should be able to get you your original copy later this week.

(1)  see Tanya's note re:  Occidental

(2)  I think I negotiated either a confirm or Schedule with a Trust (I'll try 
to find).  Of course, there are lots of structured deals with Trusts.

(3)  I don't have strong feelings about the offsite - but I'd vote for the 
a.m. rather than change the legal credit seminar to accommodate the offsite.

After the last meeting, I promised to ask you about the following:

(1)  Nova Scotia Power Inc. - this shows up as ""credit review"".  Should this 
remain on the list and if so, is there anything that legal needs to do?

(2)  Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc. - this is the new ""Forest Oil"" of the 
list so I say let's forget it.  No, seriously, Carol did revisit the latest 
draft and said it was pared down about as far as it could go.  Further, she 
cannot get anyone at Occidental to return phone calls.

Please let me know what you would like to do.

Whenever you decide whether the UCD for ECI is sufficient or not please let 
me know urgently.  Management in London has some aggressive expectations for 
a deliverable on repos.  We will have to push back on them if the UCD has to 
be redrafted.

I would very much like to give management a clear status and a realistic 
time-frame for when we can expect to have the repo capacity in place.

I do recognize the time frame is highly dependent on what the current 
situation actually is.  Therefore I am hopeful we can answer the below 
questions sooner than later.

If I can provide any help in anyway please let me know.

Tom,

I am assuming that you are saying that if repos go through the Prime Broker 
accounts it is a problem.  The poblem being that the current brokerage 
agreements for ECI do not provide for repos.  Is my assumption correct?

Is our UCD adequate as is for repos?

What is our existing format that you mention below?

Are you able to pursue this with Goldman right now today?

Thanks,

Tom

I am not certain that the existing resolution permits repurchase and reverse 
repurchase transactions and securities lending, bonds borrow pledge, etc. as 
the brokerage consent was not written to accommodate these types of 
transactions.  However, if the repo party will accept our existing format, 
then we need not worry.  I'll call Ted Leh and try to find the proper Goldman 
person.

Sara,

Can you please provide your findings on the following items:

1. Determine with Cheryl that ECI is in fact authorized to transact Repos

2. How robust the Goldman Repo agreements are, and their sutability to ECI.

3. An estimate on how long it will take to set up the Goldman Repo Agreements 
in ECI's name.


Can you please also provide any ideas how ECI or ECL could transact a Repo 
trade today using existing documentation.


London has indicated an urgent need to carry out these transactions.

Thanks,

Tom

Sara,

The point person in London has been Derek Lee.

He is here in Houston right now, and will be for the remainder of the week.

I would love it if we could coordinate both entities as one negotiation.

Perhaps you and derek should compare notes?

FYI - Ted Leh has sent a message to Jeff Kinneman that he is working with you 
on the docs.  Thanks,  that should ease management's mind somewhat as to 
continuing progress.

Did we ever get any further on ECP issues related to ENA subs, i.e. ECTRIC

I have left two emails with my contact regarding ECP issues, with no reply.  
What are our choices to do with trade v34062, a trade not yet confirmed with 
this customer.  I don't see this as a credit issue, but more of a legal 
issue.  From a credit standpoint, I am ok with the trade.

Adam - consider these guys on the No Trade list until we can finalize

Dick:

I am suggesting a minor change to the ""Power Risk Management Committee"" 
certificate (to eliminate the reference to the Exhibit ""A"").  If we leave the 
reference in the certificate, you will always have to label the confirm as 
Exhibit ""A"" and resend the completed papers to us.  Please let me know if you 
are alright with this change.  If so, we ask that you please resend the 
certificate dated April 12, 2001.  If you do not wish to make the change, 
please resend the two certificates to which the confirmation labeled Exhibit 
""A"" is attached.

Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Tanya:

Bob Crane did a deal with the Canadian party identified below.  Sounds like 
he originally told our FX trader that the parties would be EGM (actually ENA) 
and Enron Industrial Markets (""EIM"").  In the end, EIM was not the correct 
party but the Canadian party was the correct party.

Is this trade between ENA and Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona authorized by 
credit?  Is the company eligible?

Please let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Sara, Allegheny would like to be able to assign to affilaites in the same
manner that we are allowing Enron to make an ssignment so long as the Gty
goes along.  In our case, however, there is no gty, hence the stipualtion
that such assignment must be to an entity with an equal or better credit
rating.  If you wish, I can limit such assignment to an entity rated at
least BBB+ or better.  Would that resolve your concerns?

Attached is my redline.  Call me so that we can discuss the remaining
issues, including:

(1)  Calculation Agent.  We believe that the existing dispute mechanism is
adequate.

(2)  Procedures for Entering into Transactions.  There is no procedure for
dual confirms.  This is too confusing.

(3)  Transfer.  We cannot agree to your assignment provision as it is too
subjective.

The other changes were not substantive.

Sara, I have good news, I think we are very close to executing this baby.

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside
cousel which highlight the differences between this contract and the side
letter/ML ISDA.  They are not much.  I have also made some changes directly
on their draft where I either concurred with Enron or needed to make some
of my own changes.  Pls review and let me know what you think.

I will be leaving the office soon, so if we can wrap it up tomorrow that
would be great (I'm out Monday for Passover).

Do not hesitate to contact me with any queries that you may have.

Sara,  

I checked with Frank and he is not handling it.  My paralegal person is 
Stephanie Panus, but I believe she is out of the office this week.  The 
latest on this master negotiation was that Stephanie was reviewing some 
comments from LDPLLC.   She was working on this comments last Wed., and she 
said she was trying to get them done that same day.  I have not heard back 
from Stephanie.  Currently LDPLLC is trying to get some deals done on EOL 
with longer tenors,  and Credit as well as LDPLLC want to get this master 
swap signed as soon as possible.  Will you please check who in legal is 
reviewing this doc.?

Thanks for your help,

I apologize, I have been out sick until this afternoon and have not gotten to 
it.  I think, if memory serves me correctly, I think I was generally ok with 
the language except for the proviso at the end because we do not know what 
your internal policies are and how you would evaluate the assignee.  It 
basically strips out the right because it still leaves us subject to Enron's 
caprice.  Could you perhaps give me a better sense as to what the criteria 
would be?

Thanks

Sara, Allegheny would like to be able to assign to affilaites in the same
manner that we are allowing Enron to make an ssignment so long as the Gty
goes along.  In our case, however, there is no gty, hence the stipualtion
that such assignment must be to an entity with an equal or better credit
rating.  If you wish, I can limit such assignment to an entity rated at
least BBB+ or better.  Would that resolve your concerns?

Attached is my redline.  Call me so that we can discuss the remaining
issues, including:

(1)  Calculation Agent.  We believe that the existing dispute mechanism is
adequate.

(2)  Procedures for Entering into Transactions.  There is no procedure for
dual confirms.  This is too confusing.

(3)  Transfer.  We cannot agree to your assignment provision as it is too
subjective.

The other changes were not substantive.

Sara, I have good news, I think we are very close to executing this baby.

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside
cousel which highlight the differences between this contract and the side
letter/ML ISDA.  They are not much.  I have also made some changes directly
on their draft where I either concurred with Enron or needed to make some
of my own changes.  Pls review and let me know what you think.

I will be leaving the office soon, so if we can wrap it up tomorrow that
would be great (I'm out Monday for Passover).

(1)  The second setoff paragraph is intended to allow the Non-defaulting

do not qualify for setoff.

Dear Sara,

Thanks for your agreement to the Set-Off language.  Do you have some
insights I can pass on to our attorney, who was wondering about the
reason behind the language in Part 5(B), the second Set-Off paragraph?

I had forwarded your comments to our Credit Manager, Andrzej
Kabarowski,
who works with our Corporate Treasury on the Cargill guarantees, but
have yet to receive a response.  I have, however, learned that our
Corporate Treasury has begun implementing a revised guarantee format
(and I am told they are absolutely inflexible about the new language).
We're trying to ascertain whether guarantees are also changing for
Cargill-Alliant, which is a joint venture rather than a subsidiary.
I will advise as soon as I know something definitive in this regard.

Unfortunately, it looks as though this Agreement will need to remain
in the ""pending"" stack for a little while longer.

Mara Alexander

Attached are blacklined versions based upon Cargill's comments to both
the
Enron Corp. and Cargill, Incorporated which I received from Ed Sacks.
Please note that I added a comma to guarantor's name in the Cargill,
Incorporated guaranty since that is how we executed the Cargill,
Incorporated ISDA Master Agreement.

Also, your change to the setoff language is fine.

Let's try to agree to everything this week.  Thanks.

Thanks.  We amended the guaranty yesterday to do just that.  We are trying to 
have the guaranty executed.

Stephanie:  We will ultimately need to attach the ""Clement approved"" form of 
guaranty to the Confirmation.  Also, we may as well note the new guaranty in

Ed,

Please review the attached revised confirm for Con Ed.  The revision is to 
the Exposure Threshold/Credit Ratings on page 1 of Annex B-1.  As ENA does 
not have a credit rating above BBB+, we have inserted $20 mil. (the BBB+ 
threshold) for those ratings above BBB+.

Please contact either Sara or myself.

Thanks,
Stephanie

Sara - I spoke to Clement about the revised guaranty and have emailed him 
clean and blacklined copies.

I'm on the phone with Donna and due to our extremely busy schedules we have 
penciled in May 16 as D-Day (you know, ""dinner date"").  After the Enron legal 
conference, I'm on vacation which is the reason for the May date.  Before the 
Enron legal conference, Donna is out of town most of the time.  So - please 
let us hear from you.

Sara and Donna:

I apologize for waiting two months to pick a date in order to consume
some of Sara's excess wine, but I think I found a good place to meet.
There is a restaurant named La Vista at 1936 Fountain View, just North
of the Rice Epicurean. It should be real close to Donna, and they let
you bring your own bottle(s) of wine. If Sara brings the wine, then I
could spring for the dinner and Donna could bring the flowers.

I am tied up next Thursday and Friday, and I know that Sara has the
Enron Law Conference in San Antonio the following Wednesday, Thursday
and Friday. Hopefully, there is a window in there when we can all get
together.

Carson

We are trying to do a deal with Valentis Investors LLC (we have an LLC 
agreement for this entity) and CD Holdings (I do not have the LLC agreement 
for them- do you need?).  Valentis is part of Wexford V- a fund owned by 
Wexford Capital.   Paul Radous has all these linkage documents- he originally 
sent them up to Carol.

Valentis and CD Holdings jointly own some oil and gas properties. They would 
like to transact a hedge of these properties- they would like to sell natural 
gas forward for 8 years.

The total notional on the deal is about 34M.. I have discussed this with Paul 
Radous.. he has suggested that we do this deal as a stand alone for the 
Valentis and CD Holding entities.. he is requesting initial margin of 
2million with a cap of 5 million.

They wanted to do this deal today (actually for the last week)... but we need 
to know if there are any legal objections... we will need a deemed ISDA like 
AIG.

Please give Paul and I a call when you have a minute.

Thanks,

Carol:

Regarding a ""hedge fund meeting"" next week, I have spoken with most of the 
likely participants and everyone is eager to meet next week.  I'll fill you 
in on details in person.  I think the following people should attend:

Fred Lagrasta
Caroline Abramo
Robyn Zivic
Russell Dyk
you 
Brent
me

I believe that we have a mushrooming ""process"" issue.  I also believe that 
the credit group is part of the problem (we should have a separate discussion 
with Paul to discuss potential hedge fund credit issues - maybe there are 
none and maybe our legal choices are unimportant to credit).  My observations 
are that all hedge funds need not be ""last minute"" deals, Caroline can be our 
ally and needs to learn our documents and credit needs to advise legal 
sooner.  I have asked Caroline to prepare a list of all funds she is 
currently working with, has already discussed with Paul or is considering.

Afternoon is best.  Shall I schedule or have you already begun?

The commercial team is pressuring for a fairly quick implementation of a
repo agreement.  If the consent which I sent yesterday is not satisfactory,
please advise as soon as possible so that I can obtain a repo specific
consent.  Also, could you please submit repo documents to me for review.

I do not know who may have contacted you from the London group (Enron
Credit Ltd.) but we can surely coordinate.  That entity should have its own
form of unanimous consent or resolution.

The attached documents are for Goldman Sachs & Co. only.  GSI has their own

Gail:

The commercial team is pressuring for a fairly quick implementation of a
repo agreement.  If the consent which I sent yesterday is not satisfactory,
please advise as soon as possible so that I can obtain a repo specific
consent.  Also, could you please submit repo documents to me for review.

I do not know who may have contacted you from the London group (Enron
Credit Ltd.) but we can surely coordinate.  That entity should have its own
form of unanimous consent or resolution.

Thanks for your help.

Attached is a form of ECI unanimous consent.  Will you accept fhis for the
purpose of signing a repo agreement and transacting thereunder?  Please let

Also, you can email repo documents to me.

Thanks.

GS&Co and GSI have different repo agreements and these are generated from 
different offices.  I have been placed in touch with the London lawyer who

ENA sent a Notice of Termination letter to Southern on November 1, 1999 and 
set that date as the Early Termination Date.  There is only one existing 
Transaction:  a second quarter 2000 collar.   We have obtained a third party 
quotation for the value of the call (at $.928) which when multiplied by the 
total notional and days, is equivalent to $25,334.40.  Please let me know if 
you have any comments to the letter.  

Lisa:  Is there a protocol for a non-lawyer to sign the calculation notice 
letter?  Should it come from settlements which would be tracking any payments 
(if ever received in whole or part)?

Thanks.  Sara

I have also asked Kristina to visit the website ""www.enroncareers.com"" and

I apologize, I have been out sick until this afternoon and have not gotten to 
it.  I think, if memory serves me correctly, I think I was generally ok with 
the language except for the proviso at the end because we do not know what 
your internal policies are and how you would evaluate the assignee.  It 
basically strips out the right because it still leaves us subject to Enron's 
caprice.  Could you perhaps give me a better sense as to what the criteria 
would be?

Thanks

Sara, Allegheny would like to be able to assign to affilaites in the same
manner that we are allowing Enron to make an ssignment so long as the Gty
goes along.  In our case, however, there is no gty, hence the stipualtion
that such assignment must be to an entity with an equal or better credit
rating.  If you wish, I can limit such assignment to an entity rated at
least BBB+ or better.  Would that resolve your concerns?

Yair:

Attached is my redline.  Call me so that we can discuss the remaining
issues, including:

(1)  Calculation Agent.  We believe that the existing dispute mechanism is
adequate.

(2)  Procedures for Entering into Transactions.  There is no procedure for
dual confirms.  This is too confusing.

(3)  Transfer.  We cannot agree to your assignment provision as it is too
subjective.

The other changes were not substantive.

Sara, I have good news, I think we are very close to executing this baby.

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside
cousel which highlight the differences between this contract and the side
letter/ML ISDA.  They are not much.  I have also made some changes directly
on their draft where I either concurred with Enron or needed to make some
of my own changes.  Pls review and let me know what you think.

I will be leaving the office soon, so if we can wrap it up tomorrow that
would be great (I'm out Monday for Passover).

Hi, Kristina:

It was great speaking with you last night!  Hope your dad is home and doing 
well.

I have contacted two different offices within Enron.  The first is Human 
Resources in Houston.  I suggested to them that you might be a good candidate 
for the associate/analyst program but they may think of other positions as 
well.  I don't know how quickly that office might respond so let me know.  
The second ""office"" is directly to London.  There is a woman in London named 
Anna Jansson who is currently leading efforts for the associate/analyst 
program in the Eastern Hemisphere.  I have spoken with Anna and she has asked 
that you visit the website ""www.enroncareers.com"" and apply through the 
site.  She already knows your name and I am trying to fax your resume 
(business resume) to her as well.  When you visit the site, you may decide to 
use a different resume; just let me know.  Just in case you would like to 
call directly, Anna's number in London (dialed from the U.S.) is 
011-44-20-7783-5912.  The company directory shows her email address as 
""anna_jansson@enron.net"" (which looks a little weird to me).

Please keep in touch and let me know if you receive responses (or don't hear 
back) so that I can follow up internally.  By the way, you have an impressive 
resume.

Please feel free to call me at anytime.  I hope we get to meet soon.

3. Catequil (Negotiating) docs with Offshore and Onshore- waiting for

in the system; we hold margin.

4. AIG (Negotiating)- Offshore, Onshore- need to get documents out to them- 
credit work sheet in legal.. still have not gotten out a confirm to them on 
the trades they have done....we have them set up in the system and hold

6. SAC Capital - possibly only one vehicle in Anguila- need to get the 
document to them- credit work sheet in legal.

We will keep the 10 am meeting on Tuesday, April 24, EB 38C2 (legal and 
credit only).
We will also schedule a meeting at 3 pm (same day after legal/credit regular 
meeting) with Fred, Caroline, Russell Dyk and Robyn Zivic.  Fred could not 
meet in the morning and he is an integral part of the process we are trying 
to develop for hedge funds.  I apologize if all of the lawyers cannot meet at 
3 pm but at least one lawyer in attendance should keep us on track.

and Thursday and would like to meet to discuss the ISDA with legal and

previously sent them our attachments (in 1999).  Mark Russell of SRP will be 
contacting you to negotiate this agreement.  I hope it is ok that I have him

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Tanya:

Bob Crane did a deal with the Canadian party identified below.  Sounds like 
he originally told our FX trader that the parties would be EGM (actually ENA) 
and Enron Industrial Markets (""EIM"").  In the end, EIM was not the correct 
party but the Canadian party was the correct party.

Is this trade between ENA and Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona authorized by 
credit?  Is the company eligible?

Please let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Caroline:

I am in the midst of preparing these annexes now.
You should take special note of the credit that Paul is insisting upon (seems 
to be similar to AIG).  This is all credit - but note his Additional 
Termination Event if the ISDA is not executed within 60 days.  You must 
discuss all of the items with your counterparty.

Also, if you do the deal(s), give me the name, phone/fax numbers, email 
addresses of all commercial and legal for your counterparties.

posting this up front amount in cash.  So, for purposes of the Deemed ISDA, 
we may as well include all of the credit provisions, but make the $2MM a 
""Special Independent Amount"" applicable to the counterparty, which may be 
increased by Enron up to $5MM. This Special Independent Amount should be 
added to the Independent Amount as that term is used in the ISDA in order to 
give us the ability to demand more collateral at will with respect to the 
long term hedge.  Given the fact that the c/p can post cash instead of LC's I 
see no reason for us to always have the Special Independent Amount in cash.  
That is, if we are $2MM out of the money on the position, I do not have a 
problem returning their cash, so long as it is in increments of the rounding 
amount. 

So I think we should just go ahead and put credit into these Deemed ISDAs, 
and require that the failure of the parties to execute an ISDA within 60 days 
will constitute a termination event.

Caroline, again, the c/p will have to verbally agree to Loss instead of 
market quotation, to the special margining provisions with respect to this 
particular long term trade, etc.  Let's discuss how this will work, since it 
is different from what I proposed on the phone.

Sara, after you have had a chance to look at these, give me a call so we can 
discuss.

Thanks.
Paul

Martin sent this message to London and Michael advised that Sullivan & 
Cromwell be retained.  With respect to interest by the CFTC in  the proposed 
transaction, would you agree that the same law firm advise on that issue as 
well?  Makes sense to me.  Also, what is Energydesk.com LImited?  Sara

Sara,

I hope you're doing well.  Please see my note to Paul below.  It feels a bit 
like an overkill to turn directly to Sullivan & Cromwell (as suggested by 
Micheal) in respect of a USD 1.25 million transaction.  The target consists 
of about a dozen employees and its business is to advise local energy 
companies on appropriate risk management structures and routines.  My 
understanding is that the target never advises on what trading positions its 
customers should take.  Could there possibly be an interest for the CFTC in 
this worth investigating further?!  I believe the Energydesk.com Limited 
people intend to let Japro survive and continue its current operations (as 
well as serving Energydes.com's customers in the future).  Please advise!

Paul, 

The above entity is a Swedish limited liability company which Energydesk.com 
Limited intends to acquire.  According to the company's Articles, it may 
prepare  analyses, give information, and engage in advisory and consulting 
activities with respect to risk management, energy and power trading; carry 
out strategic and other analyses and advise on strategic and organisation 
development; engage in IT based consulting as well as in any other activity 
ancillary with any the foregoing.  Principally, the company acts as a risk 
management consultant for small and medium seized energy companies in the 
Sweden and Finland.

Will the acquisition give rise to any SFA concerns?!  Despite the general 
extraterritorial application of US securities laws, I'd guess an acquisition 
of a minor Swedish-based operation active in the Nordic market by a U.K. 
entity would be too remote to cause attraction over there.  I may check it 
anyhow, but do you have a feel for the topic?

Martin

I apologize, I have been out sick until this afternoon and have not gotten to 
it.  I think, if memory serves me correctly, I think I was generally ok with 
the language except for the proviso at the end because we do not know what 
your internal policies are and how you would evaluate the assignee.  It 
basically strips out the right because it still leaves us subject to Enron's 
caprice.  Could you perhaps give me a better sense as to what the criteria 
would be?

Sara, Allegheny would like to be able to assign to affilaites in the same
manner that we are allowing Enron to make an ssignment so long as the Gty
goes along.  In our case, however, there is no gty, hence the stipualtion
that such assignment must be to an entity with an equal or better credit
rating.  If you wish, I can limit such assignment to an entity rated at
least BBB+ or better.  Would that resolve your concerns?

Sara, I have good news, I think we are very close to executing this baby.

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside
cousel which highlight the differences between this contract and the side
letter/ML ISDA.  They are not much.  I have also made some changes directly
on their draft where I either concurred with Enron or needed to make some
of my own changes.  Pls review and let me know what you think.

I will be leaving the office soon, so if we can wrap it up tomorrow that
would be great (I'm out Monday for Passover).

Yair:

Attached is a blacklined (against the Enron North America Corp. draft of
3/15/01) Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex.  I
have tried to incorporate the essence of the March 19, 2001 ""swap side
letter agreement.""  Please call me to discuss as it would be nice to
finalize by April 6.  Thanks.

I would like to fax the resume of Kristina Fisher to you (I do not have a 
word version to email).  She is the candidate about whom we spoke recently.  
I have also asked Kristina to visit the website ""www.enroncareers.com"" and 
apply through that process.  I assume that you are the person who receives 
inquiries on the website.

Please advise me of your fax number and I can send the resume directly to you.

Thanks so much for your interest.

We agreed to the form of confirm with ConEd last night.  Michael Forte was to 
send the redraft to Michael Brown.  I haven't seen it yet.  Sounds like there 
will be a plain vanilla swap also, which should look like (format) the one we 
did in January.

a spark spread is basis swap (gas/power spread)

I found an old ENMAX confirm but I don't have a word version; I'm know we've

We should chat.  Per the ISDA, ENA is the calc agent and we have already 
agreed to usual Market Disruption Events and fallbacks in the ISDA.  If you 
want to change the ISDA agreement, then we can consider the items which 
Merchant has included in the draft.

As calc agent, we should create a draft and send the form to you for review.  
However, I do need you to explain/verify Floating Price B.  And verify 
rounding convention which differs from our standard.

Please call to discuss.

I am looking at a transaction with MErchant Energy Group.  We have an ISDA 
with them.  It is a financial tolling deal where we will be a fixed price 
payor for power and gas and we will pay them an option premium.  They 
forwarded the attached pro forma to illustrate how the deal would be 
papered.  Can you please review the attached and let me know if it looks OK 
or what changes are required?  They indicated an interest to transact late 
this week or early next.

The consent looks ok from the GS&Co. side.  I will check with GSI to see if
they have any comments.

Gail:

Is the attached Master Repurchase Agreement used by both GS&Co as well as
GSI?  It looks like both Enron companies (U.S and U.K.) will want repos and
the U.S. company .  What is the difference in the forms used by GS&Co and
GSI?

Any word on the consent?

Gail:

The commercial team is pressuring for a fairly quick implementation of a
repo agreement.  If the consent which I sent yesterday is not satisfactory,
please advise as soon as possible so that I can obtain a repo specific
consent.  Also, could you please submit repo documents to me for review.

I do not know who may have contacted you from the London group (Enron
Credit Ltd.) but we can surely coordinate.  That entity should have its own
form of unanimous consent or resolution.

Thanks for your help.

I am looking at a transaction with MErchant Energy Group.  We have an ISDA 
with them.  It is a financial tolling deal where we will be a fixed price 
payor for power and gas and we will pay them an option premium.  They 
forwarded the attached pro forma to illustrate how the deal would be 
papered.  Can you please review the attached and let me know if it looks OK 
or what changes are required?  They indicated an interest to transact late 
this week or early next.

   Michael,

 Attached are our re-drafts of the financial products (collar,
participating swap and swap) that we are contemplating. Note that with
regard to the collar, the Notional Quantity was not put in the chart of the
call and put prices as we discussed, as it was too cumbersome to do so.  It
was set out as a separate line item.  We also provided for copies of certain
notices to be sent notices to be sent to the Con Edison General Counsel.
The draft confirms for the participating swap and the swap also use similar
provisions for Notional Quantity and provide for copies of such notices to
be sent to the Con Edison General Counsel.

Sara,

Have you had a chance to look into this?  Per Stuart, this company is owned 
by Enron.  We bought it outright, with the intent of putting into an 
off-balance sheet company.  I'm not sure if that part has happened yet, but 
we theorize that when we entered into the hedge, it was still fully Enron 
owned.  Bob Crane would really like to get this resolved, so if you could let 
me know your thoughts, I'd appreciate it.  Do I need to check with Rhett 
Jackson in tax as well?

		 Subject: Valentis

Here are the credit worksheets for Valentis (25% of the trade and Independent 
amount should be allocated here) and CD Holdings (75% allocated here).  This 
will work for the ISDA, and I am hearing from Caroline that they are ok with 
posting this up front amount in cash.  So, for purposes of the Deemed ISDA, 
we may as well include all of the credit provisions, but make the $2MM a 
""Special Independent Amount"" applicable to the counterparty, which may be 
increased by Enron up to $5MM. This Special Independent Amount should be 
added to the Independent Amount as that term is used in the ISDA in order to 
give us the ability to demand more collateral at will with respect to the 
long term hedge.  Given the fact that the c/p can post cash instead of LC's I 
see no reason for us to always have the Special Independent Amount in cash.  
That is, if we are $2MM out of the money on the position, I do not have a 
problem returning their cash, so long as it is in increments of the rounding 
amount. 

So I think we should just go ahead and put credit into these Deemed ISDAs, 
and require that the failure of the parties to execute an ISDA within 60 days 
will constitute a termination event.

Caroline, again, the c/p will have to verbally agree to Loss instead of 
market quotation, to the special margining provisions with respect to this 
particular long term trade, etc.  Let's discuss how this will work, since it 
is different from what I proposed on the phone.

Sara, after you have had a chance to look at these, give me a call so we can 
discuss.

Thanks.
Paul

Thanks for your help.  I also left a message for Jeff because I was told that 
he worked on the transaction.

The name ""Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona"" (""Stadacona"") does not appear on 
the corporate database so I cannot verify that it is an Enron-owned entity.  

The only question is:  Can we book the FX trade in the names of Stadacona and 
RMT?

Susan:

Laurel Adams has an FX deal where RMT must be a party.  The counterparty is a 
100% owned Enron sub named ""Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona"".  When I last 
checked, nothing shows up in the corporate database.  However, I have 
verified the name, ownership, etc.  with Jeff Blumenthal.  I will separately 
email you the counterparty info that I have.

We need a deemed ISDA for the parties.  We should later do the ISDA when the 
information is available on the database (which could be any day, I 
suppose).  I would just use our standard RMT format.

Please assign.  Feel free to call me or Laurel with questions.  Thanks.

Paul:  There is already a definition of ""Liabilities"" in the hedge fund 
template.  We will enhance the existing definition to add the last phrase 
""...as would ...GAAP"" and delete the ""Liabilities"" portion from your NAV

Hello, this index language is for a 16 hour daily product.  The wording 
changes a little bit for a forward product.  For a forward product the 
heading is as follows:  Trades for Standard Forward Products instead of 
Trades for Standard 16-Hour Daily Products.

From a cash perspective, we are going to start having wires, invoices etc.

Carol has seven (7) master swap agreements to be reassigned.  Cheryl and I 
will work on these together.  All appear on the legal/credit list.

(1)  Cross Timbers Oil Company
(2)  Camden Property Trust
(3)  Clorox Company (The)
(4)  Montana Power Comopany (The)
(5)  Ocean Energy, Inc.
(6)  Quebecor World USA, Inc.

Mary/Cheryl:

Carol has seven (7) master swap agreements to be reassigned.  Cheryl and I 
will work on these together.  All appear on the legal/credit list.

(1)  Cross Timbers Oil Company
(2)  Camden Property Trust
(3)  Clorox Company (The)
(4)  Montana Power Comopany (The)
(5)  Ocean Energy, Inc.
(6)  Quebecor World USA, Inc.
(7)  Russel Metals Inc.

Mary:  Would you please reassign paralegals to Cross Timbers and Quebecor?  
These were handled by Samantha.  Maybe Marie could assist; these don't appear 
to be urgent.

Thanks.

Caroline:

You should have already seen the two ISDA's (Valentis, CD Holdings) emailed 
yesterday evening per your instructions.  I am still waiting for you to send  
information regarding inhouse/outside legal counsel for both parties.

The Schedule and Paragraph 13 sent to Valentis et al is very much like the 
hedge fund template which legal is refining.  We are reviewing the first 
draft and commenting.

FYI - I will not be in the office on Friday, April 27.  Also, the Enron legal 
conference is next week and the lawyers will be in San Antonio from May 2 
(afternoon) through May 4.  And finally, I will be on vacation during the 
week of May 7 - May 11.  Please try to make plans (conference calls, 
counterparty comments, etc.) accordingly.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.

Also, who are Marty Lifgren and Charles Davidson at Wexford who received our

Subject: Update

Hi, 
I enjoyed meeting with you yesterday. We are certainly grateful for your 
review and approval of 
new language for points which the traders initiate on a frequent basis. 

Let's select a day and time to review the large folder to ensure that the 
inventory process of capturing the
language is in place. I'm confident of our procedures and updating process, 
but will initiate a full review
of our current confirmation language. How about Friday, Nov. 12 or 19th to 
review the large folder and compare it 
to our comprehensive list of pub codes?

From our discussion on Catalytica, it appears that the current arrangement 
regarding
the deal in progress, setup as a spark spread option, was arranged to be an 
off-balance sheet activity. 

During my research yesterday on the Internet regarding Catalytica, I learned 
that their Board of Directors
has two Enron leaders, Tom White and John Urquhart.

David

Can you ""publish"" a list of swap attorneys and their primary/secondary areas

random requests to the appropriate people.

For example, is Brent the only ""weather attorney""?

It's a weather question.  Looks like Carol asked Susan or Stephanie to let 
Celeste know if weather trades were possible (she thought it was).  If 
weather is a commodity, I guess it works but you'd probably need to 
inocorporate ISDA terminology and your definitions, etc.  Check the blue file 
- you'll see Carol's email.

I think that we need to execute an ISDA to do weather trades with Sempra as

Melissa:

I started with Sempra.  It's one of the more unusual masters ( a ""Master 
Master""  covering both physical and financial) and it's not the typical ""ECT 
Master"".  Further, it contains no rounding or correction to published prices 
provisions.

We'll have to review these masters on a case by case basis.

Would you believe that we do not have a repo template?  The repo requests are 
more infrequent than not.  All are negotiated.  Hope this helps.  Regards.

Hi, 
I enjoyed meeting with you yesterday. We are certainly grateful for your 
review and approval of 
new language for points which the traders initiate on a frequent basis. 

Let's select a day and time to review the large folder to ensure that the 
inventory process of capturing the
language is in place. I'm confident of our procedures and updating process, 
but will initiate a full review
of our current confirmation language. How about Friday, Nov. 12 or 19th to 
review the large folder and compare it 
to our comprehensive list of pub codes?

From our discussion on Catalytica, it appears that the current arrangement 
regarding
the deal in progress, setup as a spark spread option, was arranged to be an 
off-balance sheet activity. 

During my research yesterday on the Internet regarding Catalytica, I learned 
that their Board of Directors
has two Enron leaders, Tom White and John Urquhart.

David

I am providing you with the below checklist to facilitate your efforts in
gathering the appropriate supporting documentation to provide us when
opening a futures account.

  Supporting Documentation to be provided with fully executed
Futures Account Agreement

* IRS Form W-8 or W-9, as applicable, must be fully
completed/executed..

* Documents that authorize the use of futures and establish the
client's existence:

    For the corporation, a certified resolution,
internal investment guidelines and/or operating agreement.

    For a pension - a trust agreement.

* Audited financials.

* Signature authority (generally in the form of a resolution).

Please call me at 212 902-0861 if you have any questions.

All,

There seems to be a lot of confusion, on our ability to trade with Total 
Intl.  Our London group seems to be able to trade with this counterparty on a 
regular basis, but I understand, we have a legal issue outstanding with 
Total.  Could I please have further info on why Houston cannot trade with 
this counterparty.

Thank you,

I never heard back from you regarding my email of 4/18/01.  I had asked if 
you would mind revising the forms of certificate which we will attach to each 
trade confirmation.

We would appreciate revisions to the April 12, 2001 certificates.  This will 
be the format for all future transactions.

Please send revisions to Kimberly Hundl.  Her phone number is (713) 853-1647 
and fax if (713) 646-2443.

Thanks.

I am suggesting a minor change to the ""Power Risk Management Committee"" 
certificate (to eliminate the reference to the Exhibit ""A"").  If we leave the 
reference in the certificate, you will always have to label the confirm as 
Exhibit ""A"" and resend the completed papers to us.  Please let me know if you 
are alright with this change.  If so, we ask that you please resend the 
certificate dated April 12, 2001.  If you do not wish to make the change, 
please resend the two certificates to which the confirmation labeled Exhibit 
""A"" is attached.

Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks.

That will be fine.  However, you need to attach the trade confirmation 
(marked Exhibit ""A"") to each of your certificates since that is how each 
certificate is drafted.

Thus, for the April 12, 2001 transaction, please resend your certificates 
with the appropriate attachments as referenced in the certificates.   Please 
call if you have any questions.

certificate (to eliminate the reference to the Exhibit ""A"").  If we leave
the reference in the certificate, you will always have to label the confirm
as Exhibit ""A"" and resend the completed papers to us.  Please let me know
if you are alright with this change.  If so, we ask that you please resend
the certificate dated April 12, 2001.  If you do not wish to make the
change, please resend the two certificates to which the confirmation
labeled Exhibit ""A"" is attached.

Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks.

On April 25, you and your counterparties were provided with draft 
documentation (including the Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support 
Annex).  Did you read the documents?  Are you asking for ISDA boilerplate?  I 
will be here until noon.

Caroline:

You should have already seen the two ISDA's (Valentis, CD Holdings) emailed 
yesterday evening per your instructions.  I am still waiting for you to send  
information regarding inhouse/outside legal counsel for both parties.

The Schedule and Paragraph 13 sent to Valentis et al is very much like the 
hedge fund template which legal is refining.  We are reviewing the first 
draft and commenting.

FYI - I will not be in the office on Friday, April 27.  Also, the Enron legal 
conference is next week and the lawyers will be in San Antonio from May 2 
(afternoon) through May 4.  And finally, I will be on vacation during the 
week of May 7 - May 11.  Please try to make plans (conference calls, 
counterparty comments, etc.) accordingly.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.

Thanks for trying but appears as if they were looking for a technical

bad. I thought perhaps ebusiness or the like would have been fun.
I'll keep you posted on any future news from them.

Remember, this is the swap that you finally decided to go ahead and terminate 
yourself.  There was much confusion about how many S.A. swaps actually 
exsited (only one) and after sorting through the mess, when I asked if you 
had estabished a Raptor ""format for termination"", you decided to do the 
drafting.  Let me know if there is a problem.

swap (of which I think there was only one).  I cannot remember if it was ever 
terminated.  Can you coordinate this matter with Maricela.  I am covering the 
rest of the Raptor requests.

Mega just called and said they are going to hold off on this deal until later 
in the week. I spoke to Brent Hendry who gave me some good information re: 
the confirm and said we could just work directly with the Confirms Group to 
get the Confirm out if and when the deal is done.   Sorry for the fire 
drill.  

 
Thanks

I have a lot of time tomorrow (5/15) to discuss all related issues.
I am attaching my most recent draft of the confirmation provisions for use in 
the EOL FX product confirmations.  The first is for the Apr-Oct product and 
the second for the single day product.  We need to compare the terminology 
against the EOL description.  You will recall that this was based upon

Sara,

ECTRI is a UK registered company.  As a subsidiary of ENA, which is 
registered under US law, can my trader sleave deals through ECTRI to get 
around the eligibiilty issue.  We are working with Total to get a 
confidentiality agreement signed but it is taking awhile and we will not be 
receiving financial statements to evidence eligibility for another three 
weeks.

For SFA purposes as they are ulitmately owned by a quoted company on a 
recognised stock exchange then this is sufficient to sign them off.   I don't 
really know whether this makes them an elligible swap participant for the US 
though.

I am not quite sure I understand.  Does SFA requirements mean you have a 
guaranty, financial statements, or other material that establishes them as an 
eligible derivative customer.  One of our marketers continues to try and 
trade with them and I still don't fully understand how they are open in 
London.  Does meeting SFA requirements establish this customer as an eligible 
counterparty under US statutes?

Paul,

I have a trader that is trying to trade financially with Total International 
Ltd., but we have asked that he not until we can sort our some eligibility 
issues.  Prior to speaking with Ben Hamida at Total last week, we had never 
approached them for financial statements or a guaranty that would establish 
them as elibible contract parties.  I noticed that we have significant 
financial trading with them in London.  How have you established eligibilty?  
My trader is asking, since he cannot trade under ENA with Total, if he can 
sleave deals through London.

Any ideas or insight would be helpful.

thanks
brant

Jay:

We sent this master for execution on May 1, 2001 and the counterparty just 
responded to John with some comments.  Only one comment is credit related:  
LPC does not want to pay default interest as per the ISDA agreement.  LPC 
does not want interest compounded daily.  What is your position? 

I have made all other changes or given LPC an explanation.

Sara, some time ago we forwarded Louisiana-Pacific (L-P) an ISDA for their

Can you give me a hand in addressing them?  John

John,
 
Listed  below are several issues we need to have addressed prior to signing 
the  agreement!
 
1)  Curt Stevens name is consistently  misspelled throughout the documents. 
We should also be sure that our new  corporate address is used.  805 SW 
Broadway, Suite 1200,  Portland, Oregon 97205-3303.
 
2)  Enron doesn't like late payments or early termination of their 
agreements.  Interest on amounts owing is compounded daily.  John - this 
needs to be changed.  What other decent  arrangements can be put in here.  (I 
thought only loan sharks compounded  daily?)
 
3)  Part 3 of the Schedule to the Master Agreement should be amended to 
provide that  LP may satisfy its obligation to provide updated financial 
information by  posting it to EDGAR or on the web. Enron now has that  
ability.
 
4) We  don't have the 1991 ISDA Definitions or the 1993 ISDA Commodity 
Derivatives  Definitions cited in Parts 5 and 6 of the Schedule to the Master 
Agreement. I  wasn't able to locate them on the web. We will need these 
provide  to LP.
 
5) The  Credit Support Annex is designed to apply to ISDA Agreements subject 
to New York  law. Our Agreement is subject to Texas law. We may not have  the 
proper form.
 
Let me know at your convenience.
 
Thanks
Roger

Sharon:

I didn't have your phone or fax numbers to keep you in the loop so I am 
sending this email by way of explanation.

You may recall that Anna Meytina and Cheryl Nelson negotiated one or more 
agreements between the Bear companies and Enron Credit Inc.  These documents 
included the above referenced $25 Million guaranty.  I understand that our 
respective commercial groups have agreed to an increased guaranty cap ($100 
Million).  I have learned that Anna is on vacation.  I don't know which Bear 
lawyer will look into this recent guaranty development so I hope that you 
will advise us in that regard.  

Effective May 15, 2001, Enron Corp.  executed an amendment to the March 29, 
2001 guaranty to increase the guaranty cap.  I have faxed a copy of this 
amendment to both Bill Carik and Cheryl Lewis.  Please provide me with your 
fax number and I will fax the amendment to you.

Cheryl Nelson and I look forward to hearing from you.  Please let us know how 
we can further assist.

it's always been my impression that CRM assesses each C/P to determine 
whether it meets not only the SFA but also the CFTC test....[although it is 
true that in many cases if the SFA test is met so will be the CFTC one

What lawyer handles daily financial trading issues?  I need to speak with 
that person about US swap eligibility rules governing US companies, 
specifically, ECTRIC, and who evaluates ECTRIC's counterparties for 
eligibility.  The specific issue has to do with Total as you will see from

Sara,

ECTRI is a UK registered company.  As a subsidiary of ENA, which is 
registered under US law, can my trader sleave deals through ECTRI to get 
around the eligibiilty issue.  We are working with Total to get a 
confidentiality agreement signed but it is taking awhile and we will not be 
receiving financial statements to evidence eligibility for another three 
weeks.

For SFA purposes as they are ulitmately owned by a quoted company on a 
recognised stock exchange then this is sufficient to sign them off.   I don't 
really know whether this makes them an elligible swap participant for the US 
though.

I am not quite sure I understand.  Does SFA requirements mean you have a 
guaranty, financial statements, or other material that establishes them as an 
eligible derivative customer.  One of our marketers continues to try and 
trade with them and I still don't fully understand how they are open in 
London.  Does meeting SFA requirements establish this customer as an eligible 
counterparty under US statutes?

Paul,

I have a trader that is trying to trade financially with Total International 
Ltd., but we have asked that he not until we can sort our some eligibility 
issues.  Prior to speaking with Ben Hamida at Total last week, we had never 
approached them for financial statements or a guaranty that would establish 
them as elibible contract parties.  I noticed that we have significant 
financial trading with them in London.  How have you established eligibilty?  
My trader is asking, since he cannot trade under ENA with Total, if he can 
sleave deals through London.

Any ideas or insight would be helpful.

thanks

Hello Elliot, 
Sorry I couldn't get back with you until now.  Either I am out of the office 
or in meetings all day.  Last we spoke you were going to send me a copy of 
the previous agreed upon ISDA between Heinz and Enron.  I believe you wanted 
our legal contact but is there anyway you can send the copy to my attention.  
I would like to have a copy for my files.  
We have not made a decision yet on linerboard swaps.  I have a meeting with 
my General Manager on Monday PM and hope to know more.  
Can you please send me a copy of the ISDA prior to Monday PM?

Spoke with Tom Moore this morning regarding the last outstanding issue 
(assignment clause for cp) and he is on board with my methodology and agrees 
as well.  He and Yair will propose to Enron replacement language to get us 
where we need to be hopefully.

faxing copies of the confirms to Texaco (in NY and Houston) and we will 
resolve.  I'll keep you posted.

Janine:

First Union National Bank (""FUNB"") entered into a credit derivative trade 
with ENA effective 20 April 2001 (our trader was a London trader).  Although 
ENA has a Master ISDA Agreement  with FUNB (the ""ISDA""), this does not appear 
to be the impetus for the booking since the confirm didn't reference the ISDA.

Is ENA alright confirming trades in this manner?

Karolina and Rod:

This swap has ended up on my desk!  Imagine that.

This transaction ought to be booked between RMT and ETOL.  The existing ISDA 
Master Agreement from December 31, 1998 is between Enron Capital & Trade 
Resources Corp. and ETOL.  We need to create an RMT/ETOL ISDA Master 
Agreement for this 3-year rate swap.

Is ETOL prohibited from entering into swaps with other parties, such as RMT 
(under the terms of the lending documents)?

Please bring me up to date.  Thanks.

Tracy and Tom Moore have come to an understanding regarding the ""Transfer"" 
language for the ISDA Schedule and have agreed that AESC will propse language 
for ENA to review.  We ask that you blackline that language in a final 
blacklined document for us to review.

We need to execute the ISDA Master Agreement (the ""ISDA"") now.  I understand 
that Joe Limone and Brent Hendry have been discussing contingent call options 
and related documentation.  ENA would like to incorporate these potential 
trades and other transactions under the new ISDA 

If you prefer, ENA would be glad to take over the drafting of the ISDA.  
Please let me hear from you.

Good Afternoon Sara,

I have had an opportunity to review this counterparty and have the following 
information for you. Here is a list of the current trades (Interest Rate 
Swaps) for ETOL.



I am attaching the only confirmation that was created and amended for ETOL. 
It is in the name of RMT.

Please call or e-mail me should you require any additional information.

Regards,

Jorge

Bill and Tanya:

I am resending this memo to you in light of what I understand is a 3-year 
deal that Craig Breslau has done with MARTA (Metropolitan Area Rapid Transit 
Authority).  I need to advise Mark Haedicke of the details as soon as 
possible since MARTA is a public entity and we do not have an executed Master 
Agreement with MARTA.  We sent a draft document to MARTA on May 11, 2001.  
Until we resolve the ""capacity"" or ""authority"" issue, there is significant 
legal risk attached to transactions with governmental entities.

I left a message for Jay Williams to please advise me of trade details.

Sara

Not sure how much I can add on this other than a little background, of which 
you may already be aware.

Enron Credit has a trader in Houston.  His name is Seung-Taek Oh.  In respect 
of two of Enron Credit's counterparties, First Union and Swiss Re, Seung-Taek 
trades in the name of ENA, because ENA has ISDAs with these counterparties.  
I had always understood that this was a intended to be a temporary fix while 
Enron Credit Inc was concluding its own ISDAs with these counterparties.  No 
other traders, and in particular no London-based traders, trade with these 
counterparties in the name of ENA.

The particular trade you mention was executed in Houston by Seung-Taek.  I 
had always understood that Seung-Taek had authority to trade in ENA's name.  
It may be worth following up with Jeff Kinneman on this point.

In terms of giving you the full picture, the following may be useful.

Enron Credit is sending a new trader out to Houston.  His name is Nick 
Stephan.  I imagine he will want to trade with First Union and Swiss Re in 
the name of ENA until Enron Credit Inc's ISDAs are concluded.

Denis O'Connell and I have been talking about drafting an ISDA borrowing 
agreement between ENA and Enron Credit Inc.  We'll send a draft through to 
you.

Enron Credit's originator in New York, Bridget Fraser, is talking to a few 
counterparties that want to trade both credit derivatives and commodities.  
The issue we're having to deal with is which Enron entity should face 
counterparties for multi-product ISDAs.  Barrick Gold is the only live one.  
I've been keeping Steve Douglas in the loop on the ENA tax side.  Ed Cooper 
has been involved on the Enron Credit legal side - you may want to contact 
him.

Trust this is of use - feel free to give me a call.

Kind regards

Sara, 
I think Guenther may have been involved in this transaction. He is out of the 
office today but back tomorrow and will follow up with you directly. I will 
be in Houston next week so may stop by to say hello.

Subject: ENA credit derivative transaction

Janine:

First Union National Bank (""FUNB"") entered into a credit derivative trade 
with ENA effective 20 April 2001 (our trader was a London trader).  Although 
ENA has a Master ISDA Agreement  with FUNB (the ""ISDA""), this does not appear 
to be the impetus for the booking since the confirm didn't reference the ISDA.

Is ENA alright confirming trades in this manner?

P.S.  Can't wait to drink some port in those special glasses!

It was great to see both of you and drinking Sara's wine is always fun.  
(Thanks
again, Sara).   At my soon-to-be-age and with my level of coordination and
grace, I think it may be more likely that I'll slip, fall or wreck than go on 
a
vacation before the ""important day.""  If I'm lucky, I may even get re-ended
before then!

Thanks for letting me share Sara's wine and half of the meal last night.
After my re-ending experience it was a very welcome evening, indeed. You
both look great and live interesting lives. I hope we can get together
for Donna's important day some time around July 12th. I am saving the
Cakebread reserve for the occasion. Maybe, we will have some more
interesting vacations, wrecks, or slip and falls to discuss by then.

for ENA to review.  We ask that you blackline that language in a final

We need to execute the ISDA Master Agreement (the ""ISDA"") now.  I understand 
that Joe Limone and Brent Hendry have been discussing contingent call options

If you prefer, ENA would be glad to take over the drafting of the ISDA.  
Please let me hear from you.

Sara, 

Moreover, Keegan represented to me that you requested that she locate for you 
the Securities Loan Agreement for you while I was out and that she went into 
my office and retrieved that document from my Enron Credit Inc. file and gave 
it to you.  So, I am not sure of the source of confusion about not being able 
to find my file but for future reference, the best thing to do is to ask 
Keegan how to contact me immediately and directly - when out the office she 
always knows how to reach me.

Hi Sara, 

(1) For clarification, my voicemail was not full on Friday - I checked it, 
got several messages including one fromTom Doukas and called him and others 
immediately as I arrived.  My voicemail was full on Monday - when I checked 
in with Keegan on Monday late morningshe advised me of such and I deleted the 
calls periodically.  I do realize that I do get a lot of calls and emails due 
to the 50 or so  brokerage related agreements & the numerous deals I am 
working on so I do try to clear the box daily.

(2) I can be of more assistance in the future if, instead of telling Keegan 
you need a file, that you contact me directly. That way, I can make sure that 
you get what you need.   I took a lot of Enron calls and faxes while on 
vacation so I would not have objected had you contacted me directly.  That 
way we do not have to put the burden on Keegan to locate my files -- although 
I am sure she is more than willing to help, I do not think she knows much 
about where I keep particular files or documents.  

(3) Also with respect to Keegan, I wanted to relay to you that she felt 
uncomfortable being quizzed by you or  passing judgment as to why I have 
chosen to receive orthodontal treatment in New York rather than in Houston.  
(The answer to the question is irrelevant.  If I were getting treatment 
across the street from the office, I still could be here to do any work.  My 
getting the treatment in New York, while I am on vacation, does not affect my 
presence in the office or undermine in any way my ability to do my job).  

Equally important,  apparently these were not fair questions of Keegan, as 
she has informed me that they made her feel uncomfortable and she only 
answered because she sensed or thought she was obligated to do so.  Nor do I 
think they are fair of me.  I do not wish to justify my medical decisions 
with my colleagues, especially provided that I am taking vacation time or 
sick time I rightfully  can take.  It was previously represented to me that 
our department policy is that when out for medical reasons, we should provide 
in an email or otherwise convey a general statement - the details are not 
required.  If that is not the policy then please advise.  In any case, if for 
some justifiable reason you have to know such information and you need to 
rely on it, it is best to ask me directly so that you can be sure that the 
information you are getting is accurate.

Stephanie, you may want to clarify all of the facts as well.  That a local 
phone number was disconnected is irrelevant because keegan called my cell 
phone number and spoke with my fiance.  He and Keegan then called my house in 
New York and notified my family that Keegan wanted to reach me.  They 
conveyed that message to me immediately as I walked though the door.  I then 
immediately called Keegan the minute I walked into my house in New York.  

As I mentioned to Sara, if you need to reach me

You may want to clarify this with Keegan as 1) your voice mail was full on 
that Friday, 2) Keegan tried to contact you in New York and the number she 
had for you was disconnected, and 3) we tried to locate the documents that 
Friday and were not able to.

Sara, 

Moreover, Keegan represented to me that you requested that she locate for you 
the Securities Loan Agreement for you while I was out and that she went into 
my office and retrieved that document from my Enron Credit Inc. file and gave 
it to you.  So, I am not sure of the source of confusion about not being able 
to find my file but for future reference, the best thing to do is to ask 
Keegan how to contact me immediately and directly - when out the office she 
always knows how to reach me.

Latin America Energy Investment:
Battling Economic Volatility with Creative Solutions



Latin America has undergone a difficult year of global and regional economic 
volatility combined with the sharp decline in international oil prices. 
Although international oil prices have returned to double digits, many Latin 
American countries are still struggling to stabilize their economies. In 
addition to their economic turmoil within the region, political and 
regulatory risks have been rising, thus making it difficult to secure project 
financing. In this CERA Latin America Energy Watch, the authors examine how 
several companies and financial managers have risen to the challenge of tight 
financing.

Mark/Sara,

We are attempting to get two amendments to the ISDA with AEP right now.  
Mark, you are working on the Amendment allowing for EOL Transactions to not 
need written Confirmations and Sara is working on an amendment that will 
change the Confirming Party to ENA (for some reason, AEP was allowed to be 
the Confirming Party when the Master was drafted.)   At any rate, is it 
possible that we send both of these amendments to AEP at the same time?  We 
want to make sure that AEP views these amendments together and sign off on 
both.  We think they'll be more comfortable signing them both at once rather 
than a couple of weeks apart.

Let me know.

Thanks,

Andrew:

Thanks for the email.

I now have my facts straight.  The account is currently in the name of ""ECT 
Investments, Inc."" (and not Enron North America Corp.).  The specific ECT 
Investments, Inc. account at Morgan Stanley that is being transferred is:  
038-08826-6 (which is the credit book).

I thought you would want to modify the assignment agreement since it is your 
agreement.  I also wanted to be certain that the Annex A description is 
sufficient for you.  

Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Caroline,
As I have said from the outset, before we send them an ISDA, we need to 
obtain from their Bermuda counsel a legal opinion that gives us the 
assurances that we need that (1) all of the Bermuda transactions have been 
duly authorized and are enforceable by us against AIG and (2) we have a 
perfected security interest in any collateral that has been posted by AIG to 
us.  A form of the legal opinion is attached to the confirm.  As to point #1, 
we have no way of confirming this on our own and I understand from Brent 
Hendry that because of various peculiarities with Bermuda law, our only way 
of gaining comfort on this is through the legal opinion process.  As to point 
#2, we have gotten some comfort from our legal counsel on this but again it 
is appropriate to have AIG's counsel opine as to this.

Please call or e-mail me, Sara or Frank if you have any additional questions.

Nikki:

I am a lawyer with ENA.  I understand that you have been involved with the 
execution of the Goldman Sachs & Co. (""GSC"")/ECI Corporate Account Agreement, 
working with both Cheryl Nelson and Stephanie Panus of ENA.

ENA would like to transfer several accounts to ECI.  In connection therewith, 
I am attaching a form of Assignment and Assumption Agreement for that 
purpose.  This document is based upon a similar agreement executed by GSC, 
ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. on January 22, 2001.

I ask that you please advise me of the following:

(1)  What is the effective date of the Corporate Account Agreement between 
ECI and GSC?  Has it been executed by GSC?

(2)  Is the attached form of assignment acceptable?

(3)  Is there anybody else with GSC that needs to be involved with the 
review/execution of the attached assignment?

Please let me hear from you.  Our commercial group is extremely anxious to 
effectuate the transfer.  Thank you for your assistance.

I need to speak with you about the foregoing.

(1)  Re:  the Chase Global Custody Agreemnet

Are you OK with Chase's ability to setoff amounts in any ENA Chase accounts 
against amount which ENA may owe under the Global Custody Agreement?  Does 
ENA have many accounts with Chase?

(2)  Re:  Enron Credit Inc. repo agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. (""GSC"")

By way of background, ECT executed a repo with GSC on 4/25/97.
FYI, Enron Corp. issued a guaranty in the amount of $10 million.

Do you have any concerns with respect to a repo agreement between GSC and 
Enron Credit Inc.?

If possible, could we speak today?  Thanks.

Hi Sara and Stephanie,

 It is my understanding that the paralegals working on the brokerage accounts 
are to (1) send documents to counterparties; (2) track their return and (3) 
keep the fully executed documents received from counterparties in the file 
cabinet next to Stephanie's office.

 In light of our being short-staffed in light of Samantha's absence, I have 
tried to be helpful to our team by assisting in preparing the documents for 
execution & getting some signatures.  I hope that has been helpful.  But once 
Stephanie [or whichever legal assistant assumes her role] notes that the 
documents have gone out, then that person should track the documents and be 
the keeper of records.

Our FX desk has requested an ISDA Master Agreement for ENA's FX trades with:  
Credit Suisse First Boston, London Branch.

The entity with which ENA already has an executed master (effective 4/21/93) 
is Credit Suisse First Boston International, which trades derivatives.

I will have the name of the CSFB lawyer this afternoon.

Can you please prepare a credit worksheet?  Thanks.

Gentlemen:

Attached for your review is a draft of the Schedule to the ISDA Master 
Agreement.   

FYI:  The ISDA Master Agreement is a preprinted form for which the Schedule 
supplements, and such form is not able to be emailed.  Therefore it is not

We look forward to your comments.

Good Afternoon Sara,

I have had an opportunity to review this counterparty and have the following 
information for you. Here is a list of the current trades (Interest Rate 
Swaps) for ETOL.



I am attaching the only confirmation that was created and amended for ETOL. 
It is in the name of RMT.

Please call or e-mail me should you require any additional information.

Regards,

Jorge

Susan:

Rod or Karolina will prepare a credit worksheet for an ISDA Master Agreement 
between ETOL and RMT.  Jorge has a 3-year rate swap awaiting documentation.

Rod/Karolina:  Is there any reason to not use RMT?  Is an ETOL sell-off 
imminent?  If so, would it be in the near term?

Rhett:  If an ETOL sell-off (in whole or part) is imminent, should the deal 
be booked in ENA rather than RMT?

Jorge:  The transaction confirm should be an ISDA format.  Also, please 
verify whether any ETOL deals are on ENA/RMT books and the remaining terms

Thanks..

Sara/Mary,

I very much appologise for taking some time with regards to a reply on the 
credit issues for the ISDA.

With regards to your question on whether ETOL is prohibited from entering 
into Swaps with other parties - I actually do not have the answer to that 
question so I cannot comment on that.

I have looked at the documents and I would like to in as much as possible 
replicate the terms we have with ETOL in the ECT ISDA. I cannot see any 
reason not to go with the same structure as we have in that ISDA. We will 
provide an Enron Corp guarantee in favour of ETOL as well as have a $50M 
collateral threshold (like in the previos ISDA). I further assume that we 
should roll up any outstanding ISDA confirmations with this counterparty 
under this ISDA. With regards to the cap on the Enron guarantee - this is set 
as 10,000,000 for the previous ISDA. Again here I think we can go for the 
same amount.


Please give me a call if you have any questions and we can discuss,

Kind Regards,

karolina

Cheryl:

Attached are Welch's comments.

As you already know, Jennifer is doing the 2-month deal (but no others until 
the ISDA is inked).  We do have to investigate the coop issue under Michigan 
law.  Both the swap CP and the parent have the word ""cooperative"" in their 
names.  Please see Lotus Notes.  You should send an immediate email to the 
department to see if anyone has used Michigan counsel (I saw a single 
reference in the Jurisdictional Database).  We may be able to obtain an 
opinion from McDermott or even Welch's inhouse counsel.

Sara/Mary,

I very much appologise for taking some time with regards to a reply on the 
credit issues for the ISDA.

With regards to your question on whether ETOL is prohibited from entering 
into Swaps with other parties - I actually do not have the answer to that 
question so I cannot comment on that.

I have looked at the documents and I would like to in as much as possible 
replicate the terms we have with ETOL in the ECT ISDA. I cannot see any 
reason not to go with the same structure as we have in that ISDA. We will 
provide an Enron Corp guarantee in favour of ETOL as well as have a $50M 
collateral threshold (like in the previos ISDA). I further assume that we 
should roll up any outstanding ISDA confirmations with this counterparty 
under this ISDA. With regards to the cap on the Enron guarantee - this is set 
as 10,000,000 for the previous ISDA. Again here I think we can go for the 
same amount.


Please give me a call if you have any questions and we can discuss,

Kind Regards,

karolina

Good Afternoon Sara,

I have had an opportunity to review this counterparty and have the following 
information for you. Here is a list of the current trades (Interest Rate 
Swaps) for ETOL.



I am attaching the only confirmation that was created and amended for ETOL. 
It is in the name of RMT.

Please call or e-mail me should you require any additional information.

Regards,

Jorge

Susan:

Rod or Karolina will prepare a credit worksheet for an ISDA Master Agreement 
between ETOL and RMT.  Jorge has a 3-year rate swap awaiting documentation.

Rod/Karolina:  Is there any reason to not use RMT?  Is an ETOL sell-off 
imminent?  If so, would it be in the near term?

Rhett:  If an ETOL sell-off (in whole or part) is imminent, should the deal 
be booked in ENA rather than RMT?

Jorge:  The transaction confirm should be an ISDA format.  Also, please 
verify whether any ETOL deals are on ENA/RMT books and the remaining terms

Thanks..

I am a lawyer with ENA.  I understand that you have been involved with the 
execution of the Goldman Sachs & Co. (""GSC"")/ECI Corporate Account Agreement, 
working with both Cheryl Nelson and Stephanie Panus of ENA.

ENA would like to transfer several accounts to ECI.  In connection therewith, 
I am attaching a form of Assignment and Assumption Agreement for that 
purpose.  This document is based upon a similar agreement executed by GSC, 
ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. on January 22, 2001.

I ask that you please advise me of the following:

(1)  What is the effective date of the Corporate Account Agreement between 
ECI and GSC?  Has it been executed by GSC?

(2)  Is the attached form of assignment acceptable?

(3)  Is there anybody else with GSC that needs to be involved with the 
review/execution of the attached assignment?

Please let me hear from you.  Our commercial group is extremely anxious to 
effectuate the transfer.  Thank you for your assistance.

Sara,

The confirms pulled in under an ENA Master Agreement (dated 9/1/94), not 
under an
ISDA Master Agreement, as Tanya was mentioning.   

I looked in the Financial Trading Agreements database and confirmed the ENA 
Master.

After you've incorporated the changes, please send them back to me, because
Derek is has to send them to George for his review, and then I'll fax them

Let's add these provisions and send off to George and Tanya.  There are 
several blanks to be completed after everyone reviews.

Sara,

The confirms pulled in under an ENA Master Agreement (dated 9/1/94), not 
under an
ISDA Master Agreement, as Tanya was mentioning.   

I looked in the Financial Trading Agreements database and confirmed the ENA 
Master.

After you've incorporated the changes, please send them back to me, because
Derek is has to send them to George for his review, and then I'll fax them 
out:

Stephanie,

I need a bank reference and the approximate net worth and income for Enron
Credit
so that I may complete the required paperwork for the account.  Would you
mind
emailing that to me today?

Thanks,

Comments:

1. We should not have a threshold for these transactions - only KCS
2. Do we need to reference that the Master has been amended in the opening 
paragraph
3. Is there any way to reference the assignment to Brazos?  I just want to 
make sure everyone understands that there are two outcomes for these deals on 
Jun 15:  1) Termination if VPP not done or 2) assignment of swap to Brazos if 
VPP is done.  There should never be a time where ENA has a trades with KCS 
beyond Jun 15.

Thanks,
Tanya

Lisa:

FYI, there has been activity regarding the KCS file, in particular, the 
status of the amendment to permit cross-netting of certain agreements and the 
impact of that amendment now that KCS has emerged from bankruptcy.  Two (2) 
new financial transactions have been executed and there is a VPP looming 
ahead for June 15.  The issue which we were trying to isolate is the effect 
of the amendment to the financial/physical agreements post-bankruptcy.  We 
concluded that KCS is bound post-bankruptcy (Carol St. Clair thought you may 
have had some reservations).  I'll keep you apprised of any developments.

Sara/Mary,

I very much appologise for taking some time with regards to a reply on the 
credit issues for the ISDA.

With regards to your question on whether ETOL is prohibited from entering 
into Swaps with other parties - I actually do not have the answer to that 
question so I cannot comment on that.

I have looked at the documents and I would like to in as much as possible 
replicate the terms we have with ETOL in the ECT ISDA. I cannot see any 
reason not to go with the same structure as we have in that ISDA. We will 
provide an Enron Corp guarantee in favour of ETOL as well as have a $50M 
collateral threshold (like in the previos ISDA). I further assume that we 
should roll up any outstanding ISDA confirmations with this counterparty 
under this ISDA. With regards to the cap on the Enron guarantee - this is set 
as 10,000,000 for the previous ISDA. Again here I think we can go for the 
same amount.


Please give me a call if you have any questions and we can discuss,

Kind Regards,

karolina

Good Afternoon Sara,

I have had an opportunity to review this counterparty and have the following 
information for you. Here is a list of the current trades (Interest Rate 
Swaps) for ETOL.



I am attaching the only confirmation that was created and amended for ETOL. 
It is in the name of RMT.

Please call or e-mail me should you require any additional information.

Regards,

Jorge

Susan:

Rod or Karolina will prepare a credit worksheet for an ISDA Master Agreement 
between ETOL and RMT.  Jorge has a 3-year rate swap awaiting documentation.

Rod/Karolina:  Is there any reason to not use RMT?  Is an ETOL sell-off 
imminent?  If so, would it be in the near term?

Rhett:  If an ETOL sell-off (in whole or part) is imminent, should the deal 
be booked in ENA rather than RMT?

Jorge:  The transaction confirm should be an ISDA format.  Also, please 
verify whether any ETOL deals are on ENA/RMT books and the remaining terms

Thanks..

Michael Moulton did a two year trade with SITA that we need to document under 
a Deemed ISDA.  It is possible that they will end up wanting to use a 
different entity and provide a guaranty.  Please prepare the Deemed ISDA with 
the same credit terms as the original ISDA draft.  Let me know if you have

Hi Sara,
Ok, I think I have properly referenced the side letter in this confirmation.  
Please let me know what changes should be made.

P.S. I am leaving at noon today, so if I haven't heard from you by then, I 
will give you a call tomorrow morning.
Thanks!

Derek:  Gail Shanley (Goldman Sachs & Co. in N.Y.) sent me Enron Credit Inc. 
documents (with Goldman Sachs & Co.).   Enron Credit Limited will be dealing 
with Goldman Sachs International in London.  I'll try to find out who the 
London lawyer is and have the docs sent to Denis O'Connell who is the lawyer 
for Enron Credit Limited.

My London trader, Derek Lee, tells me that no one has received the GSI Master 
Repurchase Agreement.  The Enron Credit Limited lawyer in London is Denis 
O'Connell.  Can you please check with your London counterpart about having 
the document forwarded to Derek and Denis is our London office?  Thanks so

Derek Lee left me a message this past Monday regarding repo agreements (I
assume for your London office).
Can you please let me know if he has received GSI Master Repurchase
Agreements or if I need to follow up on my end.
Thank you.

Hi Sara and Ed!
ConEd wants to get going on an ISDA , in parallel to adjusting as necessary 
the long form for the upcoming transaction.  They believe that the ISDA will 
not be negotiated in time for when they want to execute, thus the parallel 
documents.  
Regarding the annex, the uncoming deals could potentially be swaps, collars, 
or participating swaps.
I think they are quite eager to hear our response.
Thanks,
Janelle

Nikki:

I am a lawyer with ENA.  I understand that you have been involved with the 
execution of the Goldman Sachs & Co. (""GSC"")/ECI Corporate Account Agreement, 
working with both Cheryl Nelson and Stephanie Panus of ENA.

ENA would like to transfer several accounts to ECI.  In connection therewith, 
I am attaching a form of Assignment and Assumption Agreement for that 
purpose.  This document is based upon a similar agreement executed by GSC, 
ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. on January 22, 2001.

I ask that you please advise me of the following:

(1)  What is the effective date of the Corporate Account Agreement between 
ECI and GSC?  Has it been executed by GSC?

(2)  Is the attached form of assignment acceptable?

(3)  Is there anybody else with GSC that needs to be involved with the 
review/execution of the attached assignment?

Please let me hear from you.  Our commercial group is extremely anxious to 
effectuate the transfer.  Thank you for your assistance.

Aaron Armstrong in London is asking for the draft  ISDA.  Have you had a 
chance to review the old credit?  

Please let me know if I can help.  Thanks.

Our FX/currency traders in London need an ISDA with MSCI.  Rod prepared a 
credit work sheet on 6/16/00.  The negotiations never went anywhere.  MSCI 
has now sent their form of agreement.  

Do you want to propose new credit or use the existing credit from last year?

Also, your status report reflects that you also need a custody agreement for 
ECT Investments.  Why?

Mary:

Attached is the latest draft from Chase.    

In particular, please take a look at the following paragraphs:

2.A (the definition of ""Securities"")
5.B (lien on securities)
5.C (setoff)

The ENA contact is Gennaro Contella.  Please leave me or Sheila a voice mail 
and we can arrange a conference call on Monday with Gennaro, Nancy Callahan, 
if necessary (Chase legal) and anyone that you need to conference in on 
behalf of Enron Corp.  The traders are anxious to have this account in place.

Irrespective of which Enron entity takes ownership of this agreement, we were 
looking to you for information regarding existing Chase accounts (in ENA's 
name).  

Thanks for your help.

Martin sent this message to London and Michael advised that Sullivan & 
Cromwell be retained.  With respect to interest by the CFTC in  the proposed 
transaction, would you agree that the same law firm advise on that issue as 
well?  Makes sense to me.  Also, what is Energydesk.com LImited?  Sara

Sara,

I hope you're doing well.  Please see my note to Paul below.  It feels a bit 
like an overkill to turn directly to Sullivan & Cromwell (as suggested by 
Micheal) in respect of a USD 1.25 million transaction.  The target consists 
of about a dozen employees and its business is to advise local energy 
companies on appropriate risk management structures and routines.  My 
understanding is that the target never advises on what trading positions its 
customers should take.  Could there possibly be an interest for the CFTC in 
this worth investigating further?!  I believe the Energydesk.com Limited 
people intend to let Japro survive and continue its current operations (as 
well as serving Energydes.com's customers in the future).  Please advise!

Paul, 

The above entity is a Swedish limited liability company which Energydesk.com 
Limited intends to acquire.  According to the company's Articles, it may 
prepare  analyses, give information, and engage in advisory and consulting 
activities with respect to risk management, energy and power trading; carry 
out strategic and other analyses and advise on strategic and organisation 
development; engage in IT based consulting as well as in any other activity 
ancillary with any the foregoing.  Principally, the company acts as a risk 
management consultant for small and medium seized energy companies in the 
Sweden and Finland.

Will the acquisition give rise to any SFA concerns?!  Despite the general 
extraterritorial application of US securities laws, I'd guess an acquisition 
of a minor Swedish-based operation active in the Nordic market by a U.K. 
entity would be too remote to cause attraction over there.  I may check it 
anyhow, but do you have a feel for the topic?

Martin

Sara,
I have reviewed this briefly and have a couple of issues/comments.
I am concerned about the references to cash accounts.  I need to discuss
with the group.  ENA is not authorized to operate cash accounts.
Overdrafts and advances should not be permitted (sections 2Ciii and 4A)
I need to discuss FX with Laurel.  Again, ENA should not be operating cash
accounts.
Any verbal or fax instruction must be confirmed with callback or other
security procedures.  We have some sample call back procedures, test keys
are mentioned but are messy.  Need to discuss.  3C-authority to act should
be predicated on following the agreed procedures.  Maybe this is implied.
In 2, it is mentioned that info can be given.  I think it should be only if
required by law.
5A, generally, we don't allow fees to be debited.
5C I agree with you 5C is ugly.  I think this must be limited to the assets
in the specific accounts related to the agreement.
My number is 713 355 3814
Mary

Sara,

Here is the link to the Irish entity I just spoke to you about. The Lumber 
Group is looking to get an ISDA in place with this entity but I wanted to get 
your input on the legal side on an entity that is probably 100% owned by the 
Irish Govt.

If you check Lotus Notes, you'll see an entry by Shari Stack (waiting for 
Credit).  I checked my list of requested Enron Corp. ISDA's (see my email to

Paul,

I don't mean to dump this on you, but it was part of my old life.  Do you 
know who would cover an ISDA contract with Enron Corp?  I was working on 
these corporate type contracts for a bit before I left.  If you did not 
assume this responsibility, could you forward to the guilty party.  (I would 
ask Bill, but he's out - as you know).

Hope things are going well otherwise.

Later,

Dear Rod:

It was a pleasure speaking with you yesterday.  As discussed, I found the 
draft from last July and I have attached it below.  Please let me know whom I 
should contact to follow up and I will do.  I greatly appreciate your help in 
moving this negotiation along.  As per notes from my colleague, Joyce Lim, 
this draft was constructed based on our executed ISDA Master with Enron North 
America Corp.
Regards,
Glen  (212) 852-6274

Cathy:  attached is Mary's email which you may not have received.  Let me 
know if you need a separatecopy of the existing (Global Custody) agreement 
draft which ENA has negotiated with Chase.  I am hoping to conference in 
Chase as soon as we can.

Also, Mary mentioned that you should verify with Richard Sage (Enron Credit 
Ltd. in London) whether ECL is currently negotiating with BONY to put another 
""Global Custody Agreement"" in place.  He may be negotiating an almost 
identical agreement (not necessary if Enron Corp. is the contracting party or 
perhaps if ENA ).

Agreement


Sara,
I have reviewed this briefly and have a couple of issues/comments.
I am concerned about the references to cash accounts.  I need to discuss
with the group.  ENA is not authorized to operate cash accounts.
Overdrafts and advances should not be permitted (sections 2Ciii and 4A)
I need to discuss FX with Laurel.  Again, ENA should not be operating cash
accounts.
Any verbal or fax instruction must be confirmed with callback or other
security procedures.  We have some sample call back procedures, test keys
are mentioned but are messy.  Need to discuss.  3C-authority to act should
be predicated on following the agreed procedures.  Maybe this is implied.
In 2, it is mentioned that info can be given.  I think it should be only if
required by law.
5A, generally, we don't allow fees to be debited.
5C I agree with you 5C is ugly.  I think this must be limited to the assets
in the specific accounts related to the agreement.
My number is 713 355 3814
Mary

Gail:

The commercial team is pressuring for a fairly quick implementation of a
repo agreement.  If the consent which I sent yesterday is not satisfactory,
please advise as soon as possible so that I can obtain a repo specific
consent.  Also, could you please submit repo documents to me for review.

I do not know who may have contacted you from the London group (Enron
Credit Ltd.) but we can surely coordinate.  That entity should have its own
form of unanimous consent or resolution.

Thanks for your help.

Mary,
Based upon our recent discussions with you regarding the set up of a Global 
Custody account, you may want to have the same discussions with Enron Credit 
who are pursuing a Global Custody Account with BONY.  Richard Sage is the 
Contoller for the Business unit and Anna is the Settlements person who is 
working to get the account established.

Richard and Anna,
Sara, Laurel and I have been having discussions regarding our requested 
Global Custody account with Mary.  Mary has some specific concerns which she 
may want to make sure are addressed with your set up of the account as well.

Thanks. Sheila

Hey Sam, that has to be one of the ""cheeriest"" cards I've ever received.  
Please thank Leica for her birthday wishes (and how is the old girl doing?).  
Do you remember my 39th at Andrea's with Pat and Dee (I think) and Ron and 
his wife (I've forgotten her name but I remember what she looks like)?  I 
remember your 40th with Beverly and Helen and the walker (you probably 
remember the stripper).  I need your MAILING address so that Phoebe, Chloe 
and I can send you a holiday card.  Are you a bi-city resident?  Do you still 
own Corky's?  Do you have a different venture(s)?  How is Mr. Casey?  How are 
Helen and Beverly?  Do you see them often?  Do you love Atlanta?  You know 
that at my age (it's actually been any my ages) I write in stream of 
consciousness.  I hope this makes sense.  Sara

P.S.  Ain't life grand?

Tanya:

Lots of new activity coming out of London office for the FX desk.

Carr Futures is already an ENA clearing broker and four new agreements will 
be put in place so that ENA can execute trades with the following brokers:

Goldman Sachs Int'l
JPMorganChase
Merrill Lynch Int'l
NatWest

who give the trades up to Carr to clear.

PUD's"".  I'd schedule about an hour.  Thanks.

Mark:

Attached is my current workload report.  I'm beginning to get nervous about 
meeting traders' expectations as I am taking vacation from June 14 - 22 
(seven business days) and I don't know who will be able to pick up my 
emergencies and routine issues.

I have some idea about Mary's and Frank's workload and I have the impression 
that Brent is constantly busy with weather.  I'd like to briefly discuss 
Cheryl's workload  I think it would be a good idea to have everyone submit a 
status report of sorts to you so that you can assess how much is ""project"" 
oriented vs. routine, specific commodity areas, and volume.

FYI, I am trying to limit Cheryl's activity with Gary's group to brokerage 
agreements only.  The huge volume of activity on the brokerage end was 
apparently the result of a recent audit by AA and effort to ""cleanup"" the 
agreement status.  It should be winding down.  I have encouraged Cheryl (as 
have Frank and Mary) to provide you  with a workload report since we really 
want her to be trained in the swap basics.

Also, I will try to schedule a conference call with David Mitchell, you and 
me before I leave (topic is online trading of credit derivatives).  
Currently, only ECL is offering the bankruptcy default swap online (and no 
one is hitting the product).

I'll draft the annex without offering up the ENE guaranty (although you may 
have to speak with them since ENA offered up a guaranty for its repo).  
Please let me know how you want to handle defaults.

Can we resolve tomorrow (Wenesday)?  Am I being too pushy?

Martin sent this message to London and Michael advised that Sullivan &

transaction, would you agree that the same law firm advise on that issue as 
well?  Makes sense to me.  Also, what is Energydesk.com LImited?  Sara

Sara,

I hope you're doing well.  Please see my note to Paul below.  It feels a bit 
like an overkill to turn directly to Sullivan & Cromwell (as suggested by 
Micheal) in respect of a USD 1.25 million transaction.  The target consists 
of about a dozen employees and its business is to advise local energy 
companies on appropriate risk management structures and routines.  My 
understanding is that the target never advises on what trading positions its 
customers should take.  Could there possibly be an interest for the CFTC in 
this worth investigating further?!  I believe the Energydesk.com Limited 
people intend to let Japro survive and continue its current operations (as 
well as serving Energydes.com's customers in the future).  Please advise!

Paul, 

The above entity is a Swedish limited liability company which Energydesk.com 
Limited intends to acquire.  According to the company's Articles, it may 
prepare  analyses, give information, and engage in advisory and consulting 
activities with respect to risk management, energy and power trading; carry 
out strategic and other analyses and advise on strategic and organisation 
development; engage in IT based consulting as well as in any other activity 
ancillary with any the foregoing.  Principally, the company acts as a risk 
management consultant for small and medium seized energy companies in the 
Sweden and Finland.

Will the acquisition give rise to any SFA concerns?!  Despite the general 
extraterritorial application of US securities laws, I'd guess an acquisition 
of a minor Swedish-based operation active in the Nordic market by a U.K. 
entity would be too remote to cause attraction over there.  I may check it 
anyhow, but do you have a feel for the topic?

Martin

		 Subject: Foreign Listed Equity Options - GS update

I spoke with Kara Saxon and Margo Topman, Goldman Sachs Legal, 212-902-9982.
Per our conversation ....

Foreign Listed Equity Options are considered Unseasoned securities because 
they are issued on the date purchased and not widely held (from U.S. point of 
view).    GS has reviewed our ability to trade Foreign Listed Equity Options  
vis-a-vis REG S.  Goldman says that we can execute from our London Office 
(not from States) Foreign Listed Equity Options.  We can settle and hold with 
our current account, documentation  and legal structure with Goldman Sachs.   

Margo said that there is some risk but they do not think it is large.  She 
suggested we do a follow-up with our Securities counsel.  
Sheila

Sara, 
Can we run this by someone?  Margo offered herself as a contact if we need 
more infomation.
Thanks. Sheila

Goldman Sachs has given us the go-ahead to do Foreign Listed Equity Options.  
Kara Saxon at Goldman called me today and will follow-up with an e-mail.  
Goldman Sachs legal has said that we can trade as we currently do as ECT

I will forward Kara's e-mail tomorrow.

Sara or Mary,

Carol asked that I have one of you handle the following request for the 
captioned counterparty with respect to the financial consents.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Carol is handling the consent for EPMI, and set forth below are her 
instructions to Rhonda Denton with EPMI

Rhonda:
Enclosed is a clean and marked version of the MEGA Assignment.  Is the plan 
to confirm these trades under the existing Master with Morgan until a new EEI 
Master is executed?  What is the cutoff date for this assignment?



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Set forth below is original message I received from the Counterparty 
requesting such consents.   I originally thought Carol would handle, but she 
said one of you should handle the financial piece for ENA.   So attached 
hereto is that orignal message and the proposed consents:

Carol,

Please review message below from Kristina Drew @ Merchant Energy.  I thought 
you would be the appropriate lawyer to work on this as it involves EPMI as 
well as a derivative piece with ENA.

FYI:  the assignment is not of immediate need, being that FERC approval must 
secured.

If you do not think this to be the case, please advise as to who should work 
on this matter.

Sara or Mary,

Carol asked that I have one of you handle the following request for the 
captioned counterparty with respect to the financial consents.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Carol is handling the consent for EPMI, and set forth below are her 
instructions to Rhonda Denton with EPMI

Rhonda:
Enclosed is a clean and marked version of the MEGA Assignment.  Is the plan 
to confirm these trades under the existing Master with Morgan until a new EEI 
Master is executed?  What is the cutoff date for this assignment?



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Set forth below is original message I received from the Counterparty 
requesting such consents.   I originally thought Carol would handle, but she 
said one of you should handle the financial piece for ENA.   So attached 
hereto is that orignal message and the proposed consents:

Carol,

Please review message below from Kristina Drew @ Merchant Energy.  I thought 
you would be the appropriate lawyer to work on this as it involves EPMI as 
well as a derivative piece with ENA.

FYI:  the assignment is not of immediate need, being that FERC approval must 
secured.

If you do not think this to be the case, please advise as to who should work 
on this matter.

Per Jay's voice mail to you, could you please take a look at the two exhibits 
attached to the two documents at the bottom of this email and verify the 
trades with Jay.  MEGA wants to transfer the described financial trades and 
the ISDA Master Agreement to Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc..  MEGA is 
making the same request on the physical side.  Thanks.

Rhonda:
Enclosed is a new revised draft of the MEGA Consent marked against the draft 
that they sent to us.  Here is what we have decided to do:

1. As a condition to our execution of this Consent, we will execute an 
amendment to the existing Master with Morgan to (a) insert collateral 
provisions and (b) clean up some of the defined terms in the MEGA confirms.  
I will draft the amendment and Christian will help you and Melissa develop 
the language for the amendment that deals with the confirm clean-up.

2. We need to know from MEGA and Morgan what the transfer effective date is 
that establishes the cutoff date for these trades as between ourselves and 
each of Morgan and MEGA.  My revised draft of the Consent makes it clearer 
how this cutoff date works.

3. We need a contact from Morgan that we can send the form of amendment to.

Call me if you have any questions.

I am still waiting for my Brazilian visa (another single entry, 
unfortunately).  It should arrive next week.  I was hoping to spend the week 
of Sept. 5-11 in Sao Paolo but that is impossible to plan without the visa.  
Maybe the latter part of that week or the next week will work.

If I arrive on a Sat. or Sun., what do you think about the two of us meeting 
over the weekend to work out a plan?  I can then devote all of my time to 
dealing with Tozzini on the physical and financial issues and working with 
originators to explain financial trading procedures.  I will need to 
determine if Jose Emilio (on the physical issues) and Antonio Felix and 
Renato (on the financial issues) will be available to meet during my trip.  I 
have sent them e-mails to at least pose the question.

I know that you are very busy.  Please let me know what you think about my 
proposal.  Also, I apologize for asking you to give up any of your weekend 
time.  Maybe you have another suggestion that will work better for you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

You are fantastic!  It looks like the trip is shaping up for a visit to BA 
around 9/12 with a longer stopover in Sao Paulo several days later which 
could last until 9/25 or the end of September.  Will I have the visa before 
then?  SS

I haven't given up on a multi-entry Visa for Brazil.  I sent over a new 
letter for the Consulate this morning.  This letter states you will be 
visiting Sao Paulo several times during the next 12 months to attend various 
business meetings looking for new trading opportunities and conducting new 
negotiations for a planned trading desk in Enron's Sao Paulo, Brazil office.

Supposedly, the key to a multi-entry Visa is ""new"" opportunities in Brazil.

We should know by tomorrow if the Consulate approves the multi-entry Visa.

No, we insist that the trader make credit aware of new counterparties or 
unusual trades or opportunities prior to transacting.  Credit reviews trades 
each morning and they know what's going on.  ss

I am forwarding to you guidelines prepared for global products trading.  It's 
a good starting point.  I am currently working on guidelines for Argentina 
which will address both physical and financial trading.  Other ""guidelines"" 
exist in limited form for the remote offices in Singapore and Australia.  I 
am checking on London.
I'm not exactly certain as to what you are looking for.  Obviously the 
foreign offices have issues that may not apply in the US (although LA. is 
about as close as you can get to a third world country).  One thing that 
doesn't show up in the attachment is the swap eligibility issue.   Let me 
know how I can help further.  Sara

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EPCA's accounts, EPCA will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

Sara,

After looking at the list, we are on top of most of it:

aquila risk - we should be assigning all the trades to the new Utilicorp ISDA 
and terminating Aquila Risk master
jaron - we have a new ISDA; Jeff probably just isn't reflecting it yet
el paso - Brant is currently negotiating the new ISDA

The following are in negotiation and are Top 10s:
- idacorp
- wps
-pancanadian
-duke energy mktg ltd (i think this one is all but signed)
- mieco
-dynegy canada

I know you have had initial discussions with the counterparties and have 
discussed the need to put new documentation in place with:
- morgan
- vitol

Lastly, we were waiting on Reliant to give us an updated draft ISDA; however, 
now that Randy Baker has left Reliant, they are not likely to address for 
awhile.  Tracy can ask Kelly about trying to get something in place.

The others can probably wait until we get some of the above executed. Dynegy 
and Sempra are probably the most important of those left.  Dynegy should not 
be too difficult; however, Sempra is a master financial/physical and will be 
more problematic.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tanya

Mark:  In connection with Susan F.'s departure, could you please provide a 
copy of her ""project list"" so that we can follow up on 
finalizing/redistributing her workload?  I have lots of questions which I'm 
sure can't be answered this minute, such as:  Shouldn't we help to prioritize 
her work?  Will she continue day-to-day work?  Who will take confirm desk 
calls?, How will this impact Samantha's training (maybe the lawyers should be 
involved now), etc.  

Please let us know when you'd like to ""regroup"".  Thanks.  Sara"

Sara:

    As promised, this email discusses the securities laws issues involved
with equity derivatives, I
then make a few observations about the relationship between the securities
and commodities laws, and I
then makes some comments on the confirmations you sent me (both securities
laws comments and other
comments.

The principal securities laws issues relate to the fact that the equity
derivative itself is a security and to the
issue of whether and to what extent a counterparty=01,s activities in
establishing or unwinding a hedge are
attributable to the issuer.  When Enron enters into a derivative and the
counterparty goes out into the
market to make a purchase, is that purchase attributable to Enron?  When it
unwinds its hedge by making
a sale, is the counterparty=01,s sale attributable to Enron and therefore
required to be registered?  Here are
the principal issues:

1)  Rule 10b-5.  When Enron enters into a derivative, it must be sure it
does
not have undisclosed
material inside information regarding its affairs.  It is my understanding
that the traders are
supposed to check with Rex Rogers on the issue of whether Enron possesses
such information.
Although it could discharge its obligations under Rule 10b-5 by disclosing
the information to the
counterparty, that would probably be unacceptable since the counterparty
would then be in
possession of material inside information and could not engage in a market
transaction to hedge.
Thus, each time it enters into an equity derivative in its own stock, Enron
must be confident that
the public has available to it all material information regarding Enron.

2)  Rule 10b-18.  This rule permits issuers and persons acting in concert
with issuers to repurchase
the issuer=01,s  shares under a =01&safe harbor=018 that says in effect tha=
t if
purchases are made pursuant
to the rule they won=01,t be deemed to be manipulative by reason of the tim=
ing
and amounts of the
bids or purchases.  It is typical for an issuer to require its counterparty
to make purchases
pursuant to the rule.  Sometimes this is a contractual undertaking in the
confirmation, and in
some cases the issuer will simply obtain an oral commitment from the
counterparty to engage in
its hedges pursuant to the rule.  Obviously, it is better to have it in
writing.

3)  Registration of Sales.  If Enron decides to net share settle and issues
shares to the counterparty,
those are obviously restricted securities that cannot be sold by the
counterparty in the absence of a
registration statement.  But what about the resales by the issuer when it
unwinds its hedge that it
has put on by buying shares in the open market?  Are those sales
attributable
to the issuer so
therefore required to be registered?  I have seen lots of counterparties,
based on advice of their
law firms, take different positions on this:

a)  Some counterparties say that they want registration rights covering
resales of shares
purchased in the open market to hedge a derivative with the issuer.  If the
economics of
the derivative are determined based on the net proceeds from the sales, it=
=01,s

a more
difficult case because the issuer itself is realizing benefits and
detriments
from the sales.
b)  Some counterparties say they want registration rights covering resales
of
shares
purchased in the open market to hedge a derivative with the issuer only if
there is a
strong correlation at the onset of the contract between the terms of the
derivative and the
hedge.  It it=01,s a total return swap, for example, there will be a 1:1
correspondence (i.e.
the economics will tell you that the counterparty will buy 100% of the
shares
covered by
the swap immediately upon entering into the swap); but if it=01,s something
like
a collar
with divergent strike prices and involves dynamic hedging where it=01,s not
clear whether
and to what extent the counterparty will make purchases or sales in the ope=
n

market,
then it=01,s not as easy to attribute the counterparty=01,s actions to the =
issuer.

 In those cases
these counterparties look at the correlation and if it=01,s not that great =
they

don=01,t ask for
registration rights.
c)  Some counterparties say they don=01,t want registration rights for resa=
les
of stock
purchased in the open market to hedge their position.

Credit Suisse First Boston falls in category c) with respect to the May 200=
0

confirmation you sent
me. Even though there is a strong correlation between the deal and the hedg=
e

( i.e. even though
in that case they will no doubt immediately purchase 100% of the shares
covered by the
transaction) they are only asking for registration rights with respect to
the
shares that are
delivered by Enron on net share settlement.

4)  Commodities Laws.  Under the commodities laws there are some risks in
doing equity swaps in
that one has to rely on the swaps policy statement rather than the swaps
exemption, but those
risks are probably minimal enough that Enron is willing to take them.  (The
swaps exemption
does not cover equity swaps.)  With respect to equity options, they are
outside the CFTC=01,s
jurisdiction altogether.  Forward contracts present the most difficult
issues
in that there is a lot of
case law and CFTC lore about the distinction between forwards and futures,
and a key distinction
is that forwards are physical delivery contracts that bind the parties to
make and take delivery.
State bucket shop laws outlaw contracts that purport to be contracts for
sale
of a security that are
to be settled based on market price quotations.  So I would counsel Enron
not
to enter into any
forward contract that has a cash settlement alternative.  Although one can
argue that net share
settlement has the same defects, I don=01,t feel as strongly about that bec=
ause

you could get to where
you want to get by physically delivering the  shares and issuing  new share=
s

in payment; the
theory is that you actually delivered shares and just netted them out; that
is not quite as bad as
flying in the face of the case law and CFTC lore on net cash settlement.

The Bear Stearns Confirmation and Cancellation.  I really don=01,t have any
comments on this; I think the
cancellation was effective to cancel the parties obligations.  The
confirmation did not present any
registration issues.  I guess I would say that if you do something precisel=
y

like this you might get them to
agree to make any hedge purchases pursuant to Rule 10b-18, but that=01,s it=
.

The Credit Suisse First Boston Confirmation.  This is an extremely well
written document.  For the
reasons discussed above, I would counsel against entering into this kind of
transaction with the cash
settlement feature, in light of the risk that it could be characterized as
an
illegal, unenforceable futures
contract.  A few other comments: They say automatic early termination
applies, but I think that is a really
bad idea.  Enron had an agreement with a counterparty that took bankruptcy
and Enron did not find out
about it until a few days later, after the market had moved; since Enron di=
d

not know of the termination it
did not unwind its hedge, yet the ISDA said that the amounts payable on
termination would depend on the
termination date pricing.  So Enron took a loss.  You ought to always have
within your control the right to
terminate.  This is especially true of U.S. parties, but I would think the
same would apply to foreign
parties unless there is something peculiar about the law of the jurisdictio=
n

you are dealing with.

Both Confirmations  Both confirmations have language that says that if the
parties have not entered into
an ISDA Master then the counterparties=01, standard form controls.  I think=
 it
is not a good idea to agree to
such language because you are agreeing to something you know nothing about.

Additional Comment.  I think that whenever a counterparty requests
registration rights Rex should be
involved.  I think the CSFB confirmation=01,s provisions relating to
registration are fine, and of course they
can=01,t force us to register because the choice of net share settling is
purely
our choice.  Nevertheless, I
think that Rex needs to be involved so you and Rex need to get this point
across to the business people that
they shouldn=01,t just sign a confirmation and then send it to you and ask =
if
it
is ok.

But my bottom line is the only change I would make would be eliminating the
net cash settlement feature
in the CSFB confirmation.

Muni's and other public entities (state, local and federal) are the type of 
counterparties for which we require legal opinions and the whole ball of wax, 
so to speak, including background documentation, resolutions, etc.  If we 
cannot prove authority to transact, then the agreement may not be enforceable 
(i.e., if the counterparty owes us money, we may not be able to collect).  We 
definitely need to review certified copies of  the counterparty's charter, 
enabling statutes or legislation creating or authorizing the counterparty, 
its bylaws, charter or constituent docs, investment policies, guidelines or 
restrictions, resolution approving the swap (or other) transactions and 
authorizing a person(s) to transact,etc AND a legal opinion (the format of 
which we always provide to the counterparty).    It's best to execute the 
ISDA but we do have an omnibus drafted for municipalities.  Call if you need 
further help.  Sara

I spoke with Marsha Greenblatt (Sempra's trading lawyer).  She was unaware of 
any issues with Sempra's dealing with ECTRIC but recognized that (i) this is 
a credit decision and (ii) trading with ECTRIC has occurred.  Sempra does 
have a London trading operation so maybe the London traders for both of our 
respective companies have been transacting.  Of course, all confirms she 
reviewed were with ECT/Sempra (except for one or two ECTRIC confirms).

Based upon our recent ECT/ECTRIC internal conversation, I don't anticipate 
further confusion.  Thanks for everyone's attention to this matter.  Sara "

Sara,

Dial's Treasurer is scheduled to meet with their CEO on Tuesday to receive 
approval for this deal (not a guarantee but he indicated he wants to finalize 
by Thanksgiving).  If possible, I would like to send him the draft confirm 
today.

I know you are busy.  Please call me at 30418 if you this will be a problem.  
Thanks.

Ed Quinn

Hi Christian!  I wanted to ask you a few questions about the occurrence of 
negative pricing on the west desk.  I'm getting a differenct response on the 
east desk.  Although my interest is financial trading, you may have 
experieced this issue on the physical side (Jeff Hodge has not).  In the past 
on the west desk financial trading, any prices which are negative are deemed 
to be ""0"" (so an average of hourly prices could include some zeroes).  The 
east desk wants to add in the negative numbers.  Please call me to discuss.  
I'd really appreciate it.  Sara"

Hello AFAC and Marcelo:  Attached is a recent ""short list"" of possible 
products which our traders may be interested in trading in the near future.  
The list was created by Bruce Harris who resides in Houston but travels 
frequently to Brazil.  Bruce will join us by telephone next week.  
My goal is to discuss in depth the memo which you created on October 19, 
further research (specifically a memo regarding OTC swaps!) and Bruce's 
list.  Lynn Aven (tax) and Brent Hendry (legal in Argentina) will be present, 
as will Andrea Bertone.  We will conference in Bruce and possibly others from 
Houston.  This will be my last message from Houston as Enron will be closed 
later today for the Thanksgiving holiday and will reopen on Monday, November 
29.  I'll be in our Sao Paulo office that day.  I'm looking forward to our 
meeting on Tuesday, November 30 at 2 pm.  See you both soon.  Regards.  Sara

Subject: Re: Financial Trading in Brazil  

I am not aware of any products that need to be identified prior to 12/31/99.  
Going forward into next year, the following products might be of interest for 
trading.  Our current plan for managing risk is via offshore products through 
Gary's group due to tax and regulatory reasons.

1. Brazil corporate eurobonds
2. Brazil Brady bonds
3. Other country corporate and/or Brady bonds (ie, can a Brazil limitada own 
an Argentine eurobond?)
4. Bovespa index futures
5. R$ currency futures
6. Local Treasury bills (both US$ indexed and R$ rate) such as BBCs, LBCs, 
LTNs, NTNs, NBCs, etc
7. R$ currency forwards
8. Rules/regulations/tax effects on individual stock trades
9. Local company commercial paper (typically trades at 105% to 110% multiple 
to the overnight rate depending on credit).

As discussed, it would be interesting to see what the tax effects are on each 
type of investment, what margin is required, and what offshore alternatives 
are available for items #4-8 (the first 3 are bringing offshore items into 
Brazil, which we might do if there was a tax benefit that could be obtained).

Thanks,  Bruce

Bruce Harris is creating a list which he will forward to you shortly.  Please

Carol:  Edward and I spoke with this counterparty on Wednesday (see Lotus 
Notes entry).  Edward is pushing this deal for closure next week.  Tanya 
knows the credit issues (A2 short term S&P commercial paper rating is 
unacceptable so CP has a MAC).  We expect their outside counsel to have some 
comments which we haven't yet seen.  Guaranty issues (cap amount, demand 
delay).  Nothing has been scheduled formally but I am sure that Edward will 
call you for assistance on Tuesday (he is out of town on Monday).  Marie has 
the file and is sending CP the 1991 and 1993 definitions.  Our discussion 
today was general.  Thanks for your help.  Sara"
