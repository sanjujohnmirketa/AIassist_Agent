New! Five additional RealVideo-based powerpoint-based presentations, with the 
accompanying audio. Running about 30 minutes each, the new selections include:

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office, 
information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

far been an underwhelming success, but a great deal has been learned, and it 
is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to

the internet for energy markets. E. Russell ""Rusty"" Braziel, Chairman and 
Director, Altra Energy Technologies.

Stewart called last Friday and said there would be some deals for the City of 
Roseville to be confirmed.  He did not have deal numbers for these deals, and 
so far, I have not seen any deals for this counterparty.  Do you know 
anything about these deals?  Can check around and see if anyone else knows 
about them?

Anna, I would be happy to have my name as the contact for Kinkos, and I'm 
excited about benefiting from reduced pricing and better quality than 
provided by Sir Speedy.  I'm also very impressed by your initiative in 
contacting George Weber and making these arrangements for the Enron office.  
It is very much appreciated!

Hi Debra,

Would you agree to having your name as the contact person for this 
arrangement?  I certainly wouldn't mind if I were, but I thought it might be 
more appropriate if you were.  Also, if this goes through we could consider 
Kinko's for production jobs instead of Sir Speedy.

Let me know what you decide about our contact name.

Thanks,
Anna

Anna,
We have certain metropolitan areas set up with Kinko's  that get reduced 
pricing through the Enron agreement with Kinko's.   I do not see Portland in 
the listing that was compiled when the agreement was signed last year.  
Portland may have been added later -  I will check it out.

We can add Portland if it is not on the list.   All I need is your address 
and contact person with telephone number.

Dear George Weber,

I retrieved your e-mail address from the gss.enron.com Web site.  I am 
interested in learning more about Enron's pricing agreement with Kinko's.  
Does this agreement apply to offices outside of Houston (we-Enron North 
America-are located in Portland)?  I'm aware of the arrangement with BT 
Office Products, which we currently benefit from.   Also, are there any other 
pricing agreements we would be able to utilize from our office here?

Please reply via e-mail, or feel free to call me at 503.464.7698.

Thank you,

Anna Mehrer

As some of you know, I am leaving Enron and heading to Wyoming for a five 
month ski trip across Greater Yellowstone this winter.  The trip is going to 
be on MountainZone.com, a web site that follows outdoor expeditions.  After 
each part of our trip, we will send in pictures and written updates.  Here is 
the address:

http://ski.mountainzone.com/2001/yellowstone/html/index.html

My email after leaving Enron will be: wgoodbody@hotmail.com

It's been a lot of fun working with everyone here.  All the best in 2001!

Regards,

Winston"

Hi Everyone,

There is a new version of Deal Entry (Ver. 2.6.6.44)  in stage that needs to 
be User Acceptance Tested.



Here are the changes to focus on:

External Exchange fields (Houston Street and True Quote) are now activated.  
(Data can be entered for these fields.)   
Heat Rate Swap deals now display the View Actuals tab for both physical and 
financial deals.  However, only physical deals can be routed.


Please test the application and let me know (by way of email or phone call) 
if Deal Entry is working well, and can be migrated to Production.  We are 
hoping to release it to Prod by tomorrow morning, (December 29, 2000).


Thanks, 
Nadine Costanzo (713)853-9863.

HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! Hope you had a great holiday!
These EES deals were all changed by Carla so they're all in ""Pending 
-Revised..."" status in the system.  It looks like Carla made some changes, 
but then changed it back.  Can you please ask her if we need to send revised 
confirms on any of these deals.

There are two deals for Avista the are marked not to be confirmed.  Can you 
check into these, and if they are not to be confirmed, put a little note as 
to why or who said not to confirm them, so 6 months from now when someone 
says ""Why didn't you confirm this deal!""  I'll have something to jog my 
memory.  (Because I will have slept between now and then!)

Deal Numbers #487050 and 487054

Hi Kate,

I hope you had a Happy New Year's.

Sorry we forgot to include you on the initial email.  Could you please 
coordinate the User Acceptance Testing with your group for the various 
reports that were listed below?  As Laura explained, those reports were 
changed to include a field necessary for those deals that came from an  
External Exchange (Houston Street, Dynegy Direct, True Quote) through EOL.

Thanks for all your help.   Please let Laura or myself know if you find any 
problem with the reports.
Nadine.

Hello.  Hope everyone's holiday was pleasant!

Nine reports have been promoted to Stage and are in need of User Acceptance 
Testing.  These reports have not been changed except to add a field that 
allows you to filter in or out the external exchange information, if the deal 
was brought into EnPower via EOL via an external exchange, such as Houston 
Street or True Quote.  EOL is scheduled to start adding these deals very soon 
and we want you to be ready.

To test the reports, please enter deals into the system and add your own EOL 
number, use the dropdown to pick an External Exchange, and add your own 
External Exchange number.  Then you can track your deal through the system.

I have attempted to identify who would normally use these reports, but if I 
am inaccurate, please just reshuffle them to the appropriate party.  And let 
me know where I am wrong so I can make a note for next time.  Also, I do not 
have a list of which reports the Portland office might use so please just 
test the ones you do use.

please Check that Deal_Schedule_yn flag to no on this.  

We need to fix the underlying bug when we get a chance.  I think it is more 
related to the cross desk deals done with EPMI LT WMGMT instead of EOL

It looks like the entire EIS for the Hermiston Power Project is here.
However, I have yet to locate anything on the Chehalis Project
specifically. I have ordered hard copies of both documents from BPA and
they should be here by Monday, at which point I can make copies and send
them out.

Please look this over and let me know if it will still be necessary to
send hard copies. I will be happy to accomodate either way.

This deal needs to be changed to no confirm (it's a West daily deal).  Also, 
it has an NP-15 delivery point with firm energy.

I'm sorry my reply is so delayed - I was gone for the New Year holiday. This 
deal should have been entered on 12/19. It looks like it's still in there as 
12/20; but I wanted to check with you before changing it. Let me know.

Thanks,

I spoke with Chris, and he said this deal is in the system. He didn't know 
the deal number off the top of his head, but he said Constellation is aware 
of it. Would you like me to research further? Or does everything look okay 
from your end now? Let me know.

Subject: Constellation Deal

hey kate,

if this is not taken care of, would you mind following up on it.  
constellation called and is inquiring on a deal that goes with deal 459996 
done through prebon.  there should be another done around dec 1 with no 
broker, buy constellation, jan 01, 100 mw, np 15, index + 3.00.  this deal is 
not in the system as far as i know.  i spoke with chris mallory about this 
situation and i have not heard from him yet.  so that is why i am emailing 
you, i will be out until jan 2, and i just wanted to make sure someone 
follows up on it.  (i think it should be jeff richters deal, but he is out 
also).

my contact at constellation is tom moleatt, 410-468-3620.  i am also copying 
stephanie on this, so she can be your contact here.  hope it is not too 
confusing, but chris knows about this, unless it will already be taken care 
of by the time you return.

thanks!

This was Stan Cocke's deal, and since he just transferred into mid-marketing 
from real time, he's not used to putting the confimation request into his 
deals. This should be confirmed; but since the deal has already flowed, I 
wanted to check with you before changing anything. Please let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

This deal is coded not to be confirmed, but it flows longer than 6 days which 
is the criteria for creating confirmations.  Can you check with the trader, 
and if it should be confirmed, get a contact and let me know.

Thanks!

I'm having Chris Foster check on these deals. Stewart is overseas for the 
holidays and won't be back for awhile, so in the meantime Chris and I will do 
our best to find out which deals he was referring to. Let me know if anything 
resembling these deals comes up on your end.

Stewart called last Friday and said there would be some deals for the City of 
Roseville to be confirmed.  He did not have deal numbers for these deals, and 
so far, I have not seen any deals for this counterparty.  Do you know 
anything about these deals?  Can check around and see if anyone else knows 
about them?

hey kate,

if this is not taken care of, would you mind following up on it.  
constellation called and is inquiring on a deal that goes with deal 459996 
done through prebon.  there should be another done around dec 1 with no 
broker, buy constellation, jan 01, 100 mw, np 15, index + 3.00.  this deal is 
not in the system as far as i know.  i spoke with chris mallory about this 
situation and i have not heard from him yet.  so that is why i am emailing 
you, i will be out until jan 2, and i just wanted to make sure someone 
follows up on it.  (i think it should be jeff richters deal, but he is out 
also).

my contact at constellation is tom moleatt, 410-468-3620.  i am also copying 
stephanie on this, so she can be your contact here.  hope it is not too 
confusing, but chris knows about this, unless it will already be taken care 
of by the time you return.

thanks!

Yes, please change to be confirmed.  The only thing you might need to do is 
tell the schedulers because you might get a message that warns that you will 
unroute this deal.  They just need to know about it.  Let me know.

Thanks!

This was Stan Cocke's deal, and since he just transferred into mid-marketing 
from real time, he's not used to putting the confimation request into his 
deals. This should be confirmed; but since the deal has already flowed, I 
wanted to check with you before changing anything. Please let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

This deal is coded not to be confirmed, but it flows longer than 6 days which 
is the criteria for creating confirmations.  Can you check with the trader, 
and if it should be confirmed, get a contact and let me know.

Thanks!

As most of you know we have been experiencing some problems with our 
Network.  Tonight starting at 7:30 Cisco doing some troubleshooting with our 
Networking team in Houston.  I have co-ordinated the outages with the Real 
Time Schedulers.  

Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Chris entered this deal thinking that one was missing from a few days 
earlier. He then realized that the deal was already in, and zeroed this one 
out (instead of just killing it - sometimes those guys are in a big hurry!) 
So I'm going to go ahead and kill the deal, thus eliminating the need to 
change these other details. Does that make sense? Sorry for the confusion.

By the way, how were the holidays for all of you gals down in Texas? I spent 
mine on the beach with a Pina Colada in Mexico, and believe it or not, I'm 
actually glad to be back at work. I was beginning to feel worthless, not to 
mention sunburned. Although any minute now I'm going to be ready for my 
noontime siesta!

Hi Kate,
This deal needs to be changed to no confirm (it's a West daily deal).  Also, 
it has an NP-15 delivery point with firm energy.
Thanks!

Oops - I guess the deal can't be killed because it contains liquidated 
strips. I've changed the confirm status to no confirm, and the energy to 
CAISO - so even though the deal has no volume or price, its other details are 
correct.

The holidays for me were really nice.  All my brothers were home so they kept 
me pretty busy.  But it doesn't sound like it compares with yours!  Happy New 
Year!
On another, not so exciting, note, I have another question about the EESI 
deal #481619.  I just spoke with Judy and they say that the price is supposed 
to be $145.00 not $145.05.  Can you check on that one?  It's the only one 
still hanging out there from the mess before the holidays.

This deal is part of a sleeve - we bought Powerex at 145.00 and sold EES at 
145.05. This is standard procedure for these kinds of deals, said the guys at 
the Long Term Northwest desk. They're positive that the deal should include a 
5-cent charge on the sale side; and Mike Driscoll said if EES still disputes 
this, they can call him to verify.

Please let me know if this deal continues to be a problem.

Thanks,
Kate

According to Bob Badeer, these deals were confirmed by Christian Yoder, on of 
our lawyers. I'll check with Christian to see why, and add comments to the 
deals to denote this. Let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Thanks,

There are two deals for Avista the are marked not to be confirmed.  Can you 
check into these, and if they are not to be confirmed, put a little note as 
to why or who said not to confirm them, so 6 months from now when someone 
says ""Why didn't you confirm this deal!""  I'll have something to jog my

Bob Badeer informed me that these deals have already been confirmed, possibly 
by you. Could you let me know if this is in fact true? If it is, I will go 
ahead and make a note in the comments section of the deals.

Hi Kate,

I spoke to Will Smith, and he told me that the best way to approach testing 
these reports, is to compare the old version of the report with the new 
version of the report using the prod database.   Please ensure that the data 
is the same, such as seeing that  the two versions list the same deals, and 
show the same volumes.  However, please keep in mind that  you may see extra 
columns in the stage version because of the  new fields we implemented:  
External Exchange ID  and External Exchange Code.  

You already have the icon for Enpower prod, (what you normally use)  but in 
order to test the stage version of the report against the prod database, you 
need to create a shortcut. Below are the directions on how to create a 
shortcut:

C:\\Enpower\Stage\AggSchVol   your_id   your_password   pwrprodn_ded

1.  Replace AggSchVol with the name of the application that you are testing.  
(Below is a list of all the reports that need to be tested)
2.  Replace your_id and your_password with your own username and password on 
the above line.
3.  Copy that above line (with CTRL-C, but don't paste it anywhere yet).
4.  Minimize all windows until you have your desktop.
5.  Right click on desktop and select New and then Shortcut from the menu.
6.  Paste line on Command line.
7.  Click Next.
8.  Click Finish.
9.  You should now have an AggSchVol.exe (or other application) icon from 
which you can get into that application.


Once again, here is a list of the reports that need to be tested:

AggSchVol    
ConCount    
CPConfirm    
CPTerm    
Credit     
Emissions    
EOL Report (4 tabs within this one) 
FollowUp    
HighPriceDeals 


As always, please call me or Laura Aldis (713-345-4410) if you have any 
questions or comments.  (Laura Aldis is our other Enpower QA tester).

Thanks so much for helping  us test these applications.

Nadine
(713)853-9863.

And if it's at all possible to get the traders names from the brokers when 
they have missing deals, that would be wonderful. I can usually guess by 
using the information given, but sometimes the traders get busy and aren't 
exactly happy about being bugged for missing deals that aren't theirs. I'm 
not sure how it works, but Carla told me the brokers should give you all the

I've just spoken with Christian Yoder, who said he's got the confirmation 
letters for these deals on his desk. He's also planning to call you to 
discuss this further - these deals and several others entered as part of an 
EES acquisition will all be confirmed differently than usual. I'm not 
completely clear on the subject, so I'm going to defer to Christian's legal 
expertise.

But if you have any other questions, please let me know. I can certainly sit 
down with Christian and maybe we can all conference call on the subject.

Thanks,
Kate

There are two deals for Avista the are marked not to be confirmed.  Can you 
check into these, and if they are not to be confirmed, put a little note as 
to why or who said not to confirm them, so 6 months from now when someone 
says ""Why didn't you confirm this deal!""  I'll have something to jog my 
memory.  (Because I will have slept between now and then!)

Deal Numbers #487050 and 487054

I just wanted to check in with you before changing these deals, since it's 
been a few days since your e-mail. Tom Alonso wasn't in the office today and 
I tried reaching him by phone to confirm. These are the prices he has in his 
trade log, so as far as I can tell they are correct. Are you saying that 
these prices need to be switched? Please let me know, and I'll fix it right 
up.

Thanks,

Chris Foster checked and couldn't find anything regarding these deals. His 
take on it was that if Stewart needed them confirmed, he would have passed 
the message along to someone else or left record of the deals numbers 
somewhere. In the meantime, he said, there isn't much we can do as Stewart is 
in Italy and is virtually impossible to reach. 

If I find anything else out I'll let you know.

Thanks,
Kate

Stewart called last Friday and said there would be some deals for the City of 
Roseville to be confirmed.  He did not have deal numbers for these deals, and 
so far, I have not seen any deals for this counterparty.  Do you know 
anything about these deals?  Can check around and see if anyone else knows 
about them?

Please join me in congratulating Kate on her new position at the Deal Control 
desk. She will make the change from Origination to Trading effective 
Wednesday, Nov. 8. We wish her success in the endeavor, even as we are beside 
ourselves at such a loss.

Our new clerk, Theresa Villeggiante, will join the ranks on Thursday. In the 
meantime, please try to ween yourselves away from using Kate's services. 
Direct all requests and assignments to your respective Administrative 
Assistant.  This will help us keep track of tasks and complete them in a 
timely manner.  

Thanks for your help and congratulations, Kate!

No. It looks like these are all the deals Christian Yoder and our other 
lawyers are working on. Christian is writing up confirms for these, and 
actually has a few of them done. He said he'd be contacting Sharen Cason and 
faxing her copies of the finished letters very soon.

Please let me know if you need me to add comments to these deals to make it 
more clear. I'm going to talk further with Christian and Val Sabo on my end 
to better understand what the DEAL is with these deals, because they've been 
plaguing me all day.

I'll keep you posted on the progress of this, but in the meantime you don't 
have to send revised confirms.

Thanks,
Kate

HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! Hope you had a great holiday!
These EES deals were all changed by Carla so they're all in ""Pending 
-Revised..."" status in the system.  It looks like Carla made some changes, 
but then changed it back.  Can you please ask her if we need to send revised 
confirms on any of these deals.

Whew! I've been battling with this thing all day and it's gotten me nowhere. 
The version of  EOL Deal Report I've been using for the past month, and which 
Carla used for several months prior to that, has come down with the winter 
blues and will no longer produce anything. Here is the error message it gives 
me:

Cannot create file c:\eolJF.txt.

It responds this way no matter what combination of requests I give it. One 
interesting detail is that it began doing this on 12/21, the night before I 
left for vacation (thus my delay in dealing with this problem), and on that 
same night I noticed that the report looked different than usual. Actually, 
it looked exactly like the stage version that Nadine and I worked with today. 
It had the new section at the bottom titled ""Uncheck 'Desk Summary Only' to 
enable""; whereas the version I had been using did not.

Our IT guys deferred to you on this subject, so I'm still at a loss as to how 
to test the new stage version of the EOL report, as I have nothing to test it 
against. My feeling is that, even though the new version has a few quirks, it 
would be better than nothing and so should be put into production - because 
in the meantime I'm going to have to use it anyway - it's all I have now!

Thank you so much for your support on this so far. Hopefully we can work 
something out tomorrow.

Thanks,
Kate"

I'm continuing to work with IT in Houston in an attempt to restore the EOL 
Report to its former glory. They are making several changes to the report 
which seem to result exponentially in glitches. As of right now the 
application will not create any kind of file with any kind of data; hence the 
absence of any kind of report. I will keep you informed of our progress.

Thanks for your patience,

The STCA desk will be short 75 MW on peak at NP-15 on 1/4. This is due to two 
sales involving the STNW desk and one involving LTWM which have been zeroed 
out in scheduling but not in EnPower. All three are for 25 MW on peak.

I just wanted to check in with you before changing these deals, since it's 
been a few days since your e-mail. Tom Alonso wasn't in the office today and 
I tried reaching him by phone to confirm. These are the prices he has in his 
trade log, so as far as I can tell they are correct. Are you saying that 
these prices need to be switched? Please let me know, and I'll fix it right 
up.

Subject: EOL Summary - Still Under Construction

I'm continuing to work with IT in Houston in an attempt to restore the EOL 
Report to its former glory. They are making several changes to the report 
which seem to result exponentially in glitches. As of right now the 
application will not create any kind of file with any kind of data; hence the 
absence of any kind of report. I will keep you informed of our progress.

Thanks for your patience,
Kate

Good morning,
We have a note out on the proposed decision on PG&E Corp. and Edison 
International.

? On January 3, the ALJ issued a proposed decision on the purchased power 
undercollection emergency at PG&E Corp. and Edison International. A final 
decision will be issued on January 4.

? The proposal contains interim rate increases of 7%-15% for different 
customer classes. The surcharges would be subject to refunds and 
substantially lower than the 26% and 30% increases requested by PG&E Corp. 
and Edison International, respectively.

? The proposed rate increases would be effective for 90 days. During this 
time the CPUC would consider a more comprehensive audit of the utilities' 
financial condition.

? Significantly, the proposal rejects the utilities' request to end the rate 
freeze. The order would also order the utilities to credit TCBA 
overcollection to the TRA undercollection balance.

? Clearly, the risk of insolvency is much higher now. If passed, the order 
will fall far short of resolving the financial crisis facing PG&E Corp. and 
Edison International. Even if the utilities avoid bankruptcy, we now 
anticipate, more than ever, a tremendous amount of uncertainty concerning the 
economic value of these stocks.

Please call us with any questions you may have.
Regards,
Paul Patterson, 212-325-5876

That is actually the report I'm having problems with. The old EOL JF report 
on your desktop has somehow been replaced by the new stage version. It's 
trying to pull information from the C drive, which does not exist on terminal 
server. Nicolay is working with me to try to figure out why, but most likely 
they'll have to put the stage version into production in order for me to run 
this report again. 

Thanks for the suggestion,
Kate

Kate,

If you log in as myself, you can pull up the EOL JF Report that you were 
using originally.

Effective 12/31/00, El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P., CP ID 72297 merged 
with and into El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P., CP ID 53350.  I have received 
copies of the Secretary of State certificate as well as the Certificate of 
Merger.  Today, I suspended the old record, so that new business will not 
attach to it.  Normally, notification would have been sent out on the 15th of 
the month, but since I have received phone calls, e-mails expressing 
concern,  and  copies of the documents from various groups (I appreciate 
it!), we thought it best to send notification now.  It will also appear on 
the next report.

Thanks,

Cheryl x3-3103"

Hey Kate! I have a trade that Motley did and it shows as a desk to desk 
trade. But BPA sent me a confirmation on the trade. Is this suppose to be 
desk to desk or should the counterparty actually be BPA?

Matt Motley and Mike Swerzbin both said this trade should be desk-to-desk and 
has nothing to do with Bonneville. Could you send me a copy of the confirm 
letter? They'd like to look at it to try and figure out what trade BPA is 
referring to. If it's a hard copy, you can fax it to 503-464-3740. Thanks a 
lot.

Kate

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

Matt Motley and Mike Swerzbin both said this trade should be desk-to-desk and 
has nothing to do with Bonneville. Could you send me a copy of the confirm 
letter? They'd like to look at it to try and figure out what trade BPA is 
referring to. If it's a hard copy, you can fax it to 503-464-3740. Thanks a 
lot.

Hey Kate! I have a trade that Motley did and it shows as a desk to desk 
trade. But BPA sent me a confirmation on the trade. Is this suppose to be 
desk to desk or should the counterparty actually be BPA?

Thanks,

Kimberly Indelicato

Just thought it would be a nice idea if you knew who you were talking to in 
the Houston office.

Thanks! You guys are adorable. When I become technologically advanced enough 
to get a picture of myself onto the computer, I promise to send it over. In 
the meatime, just picture me as a Cindy Crawford type, only thinner. :-)

And on the subject of the BPA deal - I just spoke with Val Sabo, who's 
working with Greg Wolfe and Tim Belden to get this deal done. Apparently it's 
a good deal; it was put into the system and calculated, then taken out and is 
currently being re-negotiated. When Greg and Tim come to an agreement with 
BPA, they will most likely send you a revised confirmation. So in the 
meantime, Val says to hold off doing anything. We'll keep you posted.

Thanks for checking up on this.

Kate

The Networking team will be testing the connection again this evening 
starting at 7:30 PM.  There is a slight possibility that they will need to 
continue the testing over the weekend as well.  If you have any questions or 
concerns please feel free to contact me or Chip Cox.

Thank you for your patience.

""Pretty tired"" is the understatement of the century. What a way to kick off 
my New Year's Resolution of staying home on weeknights. And things promise to 
only get worse - I think Amber and I are getting a place together. I'm not 
sure I'll survive another month of this kind of social life.

You know, ""date with destiny"" is getting a little old. Can you come up with 
something more original?

This was Mike Swerzbin's deal, and I guess he missed it yesterday. We just 
entered it and backdated it for 1/4/01. Deal # is 490867.

thanks,

I just got a hold of Mike, who is aware of these deals but isn't positive on 
the prices. He's going to have to check with the broker on Monday to get it 
right. So as of right now these deals aren't in the system. I'm sorry about 
that.

Thanks,
Kate

They are good deals, but we don't have deal numbers because Mike is out of 
the office right now and said he wanted to check with the broker personally 
before verifying the price. He's aware that the deals will have to go in late 
and be backdated, and that they will not be in his calculation for the day. 
Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing

considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

Hi Kate,
A few quesions about this one.  Why is it no confirm?  Why is it entered so 
funny (instead of just entering off-peak hours, it was entered strip by strip 
for sundays, which makes it come over really strange on the confirm.) It's 
not necessarily wrong, but whoever entered it needs to know that there's a 
much easier way to enter off-peak deals.  And finally, who is the contact?
Thanks so much for your help!  Hope you had a great weekend!

Amber and I actually had a successful house-hunting weekend. Molly decided to 
get in on the bargain at the last minute, and as it turns out, finding a 
3-bedroom house is a lot easier and cheaper than a 2-bedroom. We found three 
places in NE that look great, so mark your calendar for the house-warming 
party in a couple weeks.

As far as Vietnam vacations go, I don't see one in my near future. First of 
all, I find it difficult to take either one of you seriously - your favorite 
phrases are ""baby"" and ""poppa"" for god's sake. Secondly, I have about 10 
countries on my list of places to go that precede Vietnam. And finally, it 
sounds a little precarious to fly halfway across the world to visit someone I 
hardly know who seems to be in serious denial about his status as a man with 
a significant other.

Other than that, you can tell Chris I'll see what I can do.

Kate

Kate,

I'll lay off the ""Date with Destiny"" stuff...I was becoming bored with it as
well.  How was your weekend?  Did you and Amber go house hunting?  I had a
great time at the beach with the boys.  Chris asked me to tell you that he
wants you to come to Vietnam.

Take care,
Roberto

""Pretty tired"" is the understatement of the century. What a way to kick off
my New Year's Resolution of staying home on weeknights. And things promise
to only get worse - I think Amber and I are getting a place together. I'm
not sure I'll survive another month of this kind of social life.

You know, ""date with destiny"" is getting a little old. Can you come up with
something more original?

Kate

Missing deal was input under Matt Motley - 492135

491593 is Prebon - I'll change this after the calc.

492044 has been zeroes out - it was a duplicate of the same deal, which was 
done with APB.

Kate,

 for ref 490710 ( Mike Swerzbin) Prebon just sent over a confirm and the 
broker is showing Enron as the seller and Sempra as the buyer.

for ref 490640 (Mike Swerzbin) Prebon just sent over a confirm and the broker 
is showing Enron as the buyer and Sempra as the seller

Can you check with Mike and verify this because I confirmed this differently 
with Prebon.

Hi Kate, can you please ask all of the traders to add contacts to their 
trades.  Starting today we are confirming west daily trades.  Christian Yoder 
thought it would be a good idea to start confirming these trades.  If you 
look at the attachment below you will see how many deals we will have to open 
up to attach a contact to.  We are going to try to get our IT group to fix 
the system so that the confirm would populate with a default contact whether 
one has been chosen in Enpower or not.  This may take a while for them to do.

Thanks for your help,
Melissa

Hi Kate, can you please ask all of the traders to add contacts to their 
trades.  Starting today we are confirming west daily trades.  Christian Yoder 
thought it would be a good idea to start confirming these trades.  If you 
look at the attachment below you will see how many deals we will have to open 
up to attach a contact to.  We are going to try to get our IT group to fix 
the system so that the confirm would populate with a default contact whether 
one has been chosen in Enpower or not.  This may take a while for them to do.

Thanks for your help,
Melissa

At the suggestion of Tim B. we are going to implement a procedure for Middle 
Market Transcation Deal Entry and Confirmation.  I will be writing this 
procedure.  There have been some confirms sent out recently that were 
inaccurate and some other EnPower entry issues.  More importantly, however, 
Tim simply wants to tighten procedures as a risk control mechanism.  He also 
will be writing procedures for other things various folks in his group do. 
These procedures will be put into a West Trading Procedure Book that is being 
created.  To get this process started (prior to my writing it up), please 
immediately start doing the following:

1.  On every future trade you do, tell the trader taking the position (i.e LT 
NW, ST CA, etc.) that you should be identified as the trader.  By doing this, 
you will be responsible for making sure the deal is confirmed properly.  
Otherwise, they are responsible for the accuracy of the Confirm.  
2.  I will be sent a copy of all MM group confirms from Houston and will be 
putting them into a Master MM Confirms notebook.  When received, I will 
indicate to you that it is here and you will be responsible for checking it 
and making sure it is accurate.  An accurate confirm generally means the deal 
was entered correctly into EnPower.
3.  For all existing deals that you think should be included in this notebook 
because they are a little hairy and you want to make sure your hands are 
clean with respect to an accurate confirm, please make sure I get a copy as 
soon as possible.

Thanks

Chris

The delivery point on this deal originally was confirmed as COB S/N.  Due to 
complications in the P& L calculation, Sean changed the location to PGE 
system and forgot to disable the confirmation.  We have been scheduling it 
and changing it daily back to COB S/N.  Until we figure out a way to properly 
value this deal, it will remain as a PGE to PGE buy/resale.  Please contact 
myself or Sean if you have any questions.

She doesn't have the signed confirm back yet. Sharen asked me about it a few 
weeks ago, and Holli told me she'd send it to the confirms group as soon as 
she got it. She's talking to her contact there right now to find out what's 
going on. I guess she's getting a little fed up of beating around the bush 
with these guys - so hopefully she'll get some concrete answers from them 
today. I'll let you know whatever we find out this afternoon.

I just heard the same.  I was talking to Tim about the requirements being 
made regarding daily confirmations, and the final decision was not to confirm 
PGE daily deals.  Question though,  when we put deals into the system in 
Blotter, they automatically confirm.  Do we have to go into every deal and 
switch the flag or is there a better way around it?

Hi Kate!
I am beginning to see a familiar pattern beginning in the West (-familiar 
because it's the same problem we have with East traders).  There are A LOT of 
deals that need to be changed to ""no confirm.""  I'd like to fax a list of 
them to you so that you can 1st, change their status in Deal Entry to ""not to 
be confirmed"" and 2nd, bug the traders who enter the deals to remember to 
enter them correctly.  Also, you mentioned working with Will Smith in IT to 
get these deals to automatically be ""no confirm"" when the traders enter 
them.  You may want to use some of these as examples so to help IT figure the 
logic behind which deals are confirmed and which aren't.  Please let me know 
your fax number so that i can send you this report.  
Thanks!

I just left you a voice-mail, but thought I'd follow up with a text message 
as well. I can send you lists of all the people who work in each of these 
groups, but not all of them use Enron Online. To make this information as 
efficient as possible, I want to be sure of what you're looking for before I 
send you a huge list of names and make it more confusing than it needs to be. 
The other thing I just thought of is that I run an EOL deal count report 
every night which includes the West Desk's EOL and brokered deal counts for 
the day, month-to-date, and sometimes year-to-date. So I may already have 
this information or may be able to get it very easily. For now, I'll send you 
the list of our traders who use EOL. And please let me know what else I can 
do to assist.

West Power Traders
Tim Belden
Matt Motley
Mike Swerzbin
Mike Driscoll
Bob Badeer
Sean Crandall
Diana Scholtes
Tom Alonso
Mark Fischer
Jeff Richter
Chris Mallory
Jeremy Morris
Phil Platter

Again, these are the traders in this office who currently use Enron Online. 
Our other groups - mid-marketing, origination, and fundamentals - do not 
trade online. I believe that development in San Francisco also does not trade 
online.

Thanks,

Thanks so much for your help!  Those two deals 557772 and 552518 (i think you 
accidentally put 552516) -but, i didn't mean to send you those two, we will 
confirm them.  I guess a couple slipped by me, sorry about that.  Don't worry 
about anything left, if there are any that you couldn't read we'll take care 
of them.  If you need any help dealing with IT to get some of these bugs 
worked out let me know.  Thanks again!
Kim

Subject: Deal Changes - No Confirm

Kim - 
I've finished changing the list of deals you faxed over to no confirm. Please 
let me know if you continue to see these deals on your new deal report. I 
still had questions on some of the Short Term and Long Term Northwest deals. 
On those I will defer to Diana Scholtes. I also have questions on the 
following deals:

557772 - why are we not confirming a daily with Pacificorp?
552516 - why are we not confirming a daily with Riverside?

And there were two deals I couldn't for the life of me read on that fax, so 
you may still see deals showing up that don't necessarily need to be 
confirmed.


Diana - 
I know we had decided not to confirm deals done with Portland General 
Electric, but before I change the following deals to ""no confirm"" I want to 
clarify under what conditions we do not confirm with this counterparty.
 1. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is elsewhere (Mid-C, 
Montana System, etc.), do we confirm?
 2. If the counterparty is something other than PGE and the delivery point is 
Portland General System, do we confirm?
 3. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is Portland General 
System, do we confirm? 
I apologize for asking so many questions, but I've got a long list of deals 
in front of me and before I create an irreparable mess I wanted to check that 
I'm doing this right. Please let me know.

Hey Kate! I received a phone call from a Jim Cross from Automated Power 
Exchange. Now that we are confirming daily's he mentioned that he did not 
want to receive dailys per the APX Master Agreement. He told me that all 
trades are anonimus under the APX agreement and we should not be confirming 
theses. Examples: #563948 and #563381. Some of the trader doing these trades 
are Chris Mallory and Les Rawson. Could you ask them is we should continue to 
confirm these daily's or not?

Thanks

Sharen,

Kate Symes asked me to email you and let you know that we do verbal confirms 
with Valley Electric.  We speak with Valley quite often, and confirm deals 
with them over the phone.  We have never sent them paper confirms, and we 
would like to keep the relationship the way it is.  If you have any questions 
please feel free to contact me.

Thanks,

Subject: Unit Contingent Deals  

I spoke with Les about these deals, and he told me he'd like unit contingent 
SALES confirmed, and unit contingent BUYS not confirmed. I sorted through 
these deal numbers and changed the buys to not be confirmed, and it looks 
like most of the sales already have the unit name in the comments section. 
Following is the list of deals you sent me and notes on what I did:

562211 - changed to ""no confirm""
564613 - changed to ""no confirm""
566060 - unit name is in comments section
566062 - unit name is in comments section
566069 - unit name is in comments section
566071 - unit name is in comments section
566077 - unit is Willamette Albany Paper Mill/comments section is full - ???
566078 - unit name is in comments section
556116 - unit is LV Cogen/added to comments
554737 - unit is LV Cogen/added to comments

Les and I also talked about creating a master list of delivery points and 
their respective unit names for future reference. Please let me know if you 
think that would be helpful. In the meantime, feel free to send these lists 
to me.

Thanks,

There are several unit contingent deals that don't have the unit name in the 
comment section.  Can you have them put in this information.  I know you sent 
us a reference sheet, but I think it would be better if the trader would 
specify the unit in the comment section.

Subject: New CTPY Name - Sierra Pacific Industries

I've gone ahead and entered the counterparty name ""Sierra Pacific Industries, 
Inc."" in Chris Foster's deal #573679, in the interest of moving it along 
through the confirmation process. (The deal was done on 4/6 and flowed on 
4/10.)

I spoke with Bob Ellery (Sierra) yesterday and he seemed fine with the name 
we have in our system, although I'm sure he's not the final authority. Then I 
spoke with the Confirms group today and they were ready to get the deal off 
of their new deal report. So, since I haven't heard anything to the contrary, 
I changed the deal from it's ""new counterparty"" status.

Please let me know if this presents a problem for any of you.

There were several deals that were marked not to be confirmed that appeared 
to be normal west deals that we should confirm. We've already changed them to 
yes, but please check with Sean Crandell to see if he marked them not to be

Hello, I guess if he wants to leave the deals as they are in the system then 
the accounting group will see zero for an index price and they will see the 
index off set price.  If he and Constellation both agree to do nothing to 
these trades (not to revise the confirms or change the index on the trades) 
then we can put notes in the trades explaining that.  I just want to make 
sure that Constellation agrees with however we handle this.

Thanks for your help,

Constellation, so for settlements purposes we're okay - i.e. We've bought the 
same volumes that we've sold, and we end up losing a bit due to the index 
offset - but otherwise the index price won't make a difference.  But I 
suspect he's not thinking of the problem from the confirmation standpoint. 
Could you tell me exactly what needs to happen to clear this up on your end 
so that I can explain it to Bob in a way that might make him DO something? 
I'm sorry for the delay on this - I'm getting ready to call Bob's contact at 
Constellation for him.

Let me know what your ideal solution would be. Should we get Constellation to 
agree to the Dow Jones index? Or should we change the deals to forward fixed 
price? We'll fix this today - I promise.

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Bob, I was wondering if you have contacted Constellation about the 6 
trades that are in the system with the Cal Px as the index price.  All of 
these trades start flowing in July of this year.

The deal numbers are as follows:

453152.01
453175.01
453294.01
462109.01
471888.01
471889.01

Let me know if Constellation agrees to change these deals to the Dow Jones so 
I can send a letter for them to sign.

Thanks,
Melissa

The APX called me today.  They are concerned we are sending them confirms on 
deals that we are doing with them.  Legally this is incorrect as we are 
transacting purusuant to the APX Master, not the Enron Master.  So, please 
try to remember to check the box for no confirms when you transact with the 
APX.

Hi everyone!

I have begun to document all special situations and counterparties that are 
exceptions to our ""not to be confirmed"" rules.  Thus, in the future, when we 
need to answer questions regarding why certain deals are unconfirmed, there 
will be no confusion about where the directives not to do so originated.

Please review this document carefully.  Go ahead and make any changes that 
you'd like -but please change your font color so that I will know which items 
you have added.  I will incorporate all of your edits to the master document 
and save it to a common drive where it can be accessed and updated whenever 
necessary.

If you can think of any additional ""not to be confirmed"" 
exceptions/situations, or more specific details  -please add them.  Please 
let me know if you have any questions.



Thanks for your input,

I've added the unit names to the deals and reminded Les that they need to be

he sent out re: unit names spelled out the answers, but I took another look 
at it and it doesn't seem to really answer anything. I've attached it just in 
case you don't have it anymore - but please let me know if this assists you 
guys in ANY way. If it doesn't, I can probably get him to draw up something 
more useful.

Melissa -
I think we've finally reached a conclusion on the long term PX Index deals. 
I've entered the following comment in the six deals still in the system with 
Constellation at the old index:

Constellation and EPMI have agreed to leave deal at PX Index. Counterparties' 
positions tie out - index price should not be relevant; however, index offset 
will. Per Bob Badeer, 4/18/01. KS

This is exactly how Bob explained it to me, and he said it was exactly as 
Constellation understood it as well. So if this sounds good to you, I think 
we're set. If not, please let me know and we can make whatever changes are 
necessary.

The deal numbers, for reference, are - 
453152/453175/453294/462109/471888/471889

Thanks for your patience on this,

Hello, I guess if he wants to leave the deals as they are in the system then 
the accounting group will see zero for an index price and they will see the 
index off set price.  If he and Constellation both agree to do nothing to 
these trades (not to revise the confirms or change the index on the trades) 
then we can put notes in the trades explaining that.  I just want to make

Just a heads up.  We have targeted tomorrow, March 1 as the start date for 
confirming the daily deals in the west.  Please remind the guys that we will 
need the counterparty contact filled in to prepare the confirmations.  If 
they absolutely do not have a contact, they may use the Documentation 
Department as a contact if this is available.  We are in the process of 
getting this name available for use for most the counterparties."

Hi Kate!
I got your voice mail this morning (I was out sick yesterday).  I did a 
search based on the info you left in your vmail and got deal #531742.  Is 
this the deal you were looking for?  If so, this confirmation letter has been 
executed by Avista Energy, Inc.  Would you like a faxed copy of this confirm?"

Help, I'm confused!  Yesterday I prepared a confirmation for three Montana 
Power deals, # 5467244, 597245, 597246.  I sent it to John Malowney and he 
approved it and I faxed it out. Today I noticed two of the deals have been 
killed and two legs added to the other deal.  I think it is the same deal, 
but can someone put notes into the deals saying what they did and why?

Thanks!"

do not reflect the option in the system.  we will take care of that if we 
exercise the option.  it would be good to get the proper transaction 
execution date in there.

Tim - would you like a copy of this deal's confirmation letter?

Carla - you entered this deal on 2/23/01. Should it be back-dated to match 
trade date on confirmation letter?

Thanks,

There are four deals on the no report that look like they sould be

not to be confirmed?

Thanks and yes, we will need copies of the letters.  If she could send us the 
same copy she sends to the counterparty, then we can put it into our files 
and we won't have to call her repeatedly when we are trying to get a signed 
copy from the counterparty for the files.

effective 1 February 2001.  On the one hand, I will look forward to the 
adventures that retirement offers; but on the other, I will miss working with 
those of you whom I have come to know over the years.  I thoroughly enjoyed

On Saturday, January 13, 2001, an earthquake shook Central America.  The 
earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.6, was centered off of El Salvador's

estimated at nearly $1 billion, nearly half of the country's annual budget.  

Enron employees are encouraged to donate to relief efforts and to take 
advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your 
donation.  Enron will match, dollar for dollar, every donation that you make, 
up to $15,000 annually per employee.  Listed below are a multitude of

for the same amount, to each of the organizations.  Please make sure to write 
""El Salvador"" on your check.

involved a Jan/Feb average temperature call with a maximum payout of 500 mi=

To all:

Over the past few months, Energy Operations has formally established global 
standards.   Exception reporting will officially begin for the West Desk on 
Monday, November 20th.  The exception reporting around these standards will:
help us gauge our performance and highlight areas for improvement
better allocate resources to issue areas
ensure individual and global business controllers are up to date as to 
arising issues

To accomplish this, numerous requirements have been established.  The  
requirement that affects trading is as follows:

Transactions are recorded accurately and timely (completeness, accuracy)
Transactions are recorded with 100% accuracy and valued appropriately in an 
approved risk system for the applicable product
Transactions are input into Enpower or TAGG on date of trade (prior to calc)

HOW THIS AFFECTS WEST TRADERS:

The Risk group in Portland and Confirmations group in Houston will now begin 
reporting any exceptions to the above requirement on a daily basis.   Any 
deals entered late, incorrectly or changed after the calc will require full 
written explanation to the Global Risk Controls group (this includes trader 
name).  The materiality of the deal is not relevant, you can be written up 
for 1 MW deals or 200 MW deals.  The Global Risk Controls group is looking 
for flaws in the process, whether it be people-related or system related.  

This exception reporting begins on Monday.  Please come to the Risk group 
with any questions you may have, we would like the West Desk to appear on the 
exception report as infrequently as possible.  If you have any special deal 
types that you believe will be in violation of the above requirement, please 
notify Risk so we can communicate this to Global Risk Controls.

Thanks for your help in this matter,

West Risk

Good Morning,

Over the last couple of weeks, we've made several recent additions to the 
Portland IT applications team.  We hope that with this new influx of talent 
we will continue to ""raise the bar"" for IT support of Enron's trading 
activities in Portland.

Richard Schweiger is our new Senior Applications Specialist. He comes to 
Enron through RHI Consulting where he contracted at Enron for the last 2 
months and has now converted to full-time.  Richard has several years of 
Visual Basic and C++ programming experience. He has been living in the 
Portland, Oregon area for the past 4 years and is originally from 
California.  His current projects include migration of the California 
Pre-Trade application to the intranet as well as building strong middle tier 
architecture to support the new CAL-Web development.

Michael Tully is our new lead Trading Floor Support analyst.  He recently 
moved from Oklahoma where he was the Lead Help Desk Support for Electronic 
Storage Corporation.  Mike's wife is due with their second baby in January.  
Outside of work, Mike love's to scuba dive.  Mike is currently working for 
Comsys and hopes to eventually convert to full-time.  Mike is replacing 
Wendella Rhoads who recently moved back to Eugene to be closer to family.

Dan Maxwell is a new contract developer from Maxim consulting working on the 
California Pre-Trading application.  Dan currently lives in Boise, Idaho and 
commutes to Portland during the week.  Dan spent the previous year commuting 
to Washington DC developing software for GEICO insurance company.  He is 
originally from Miami, Florida where the beach is the place to be but 
counting is a lost art.  

Paul Kane has recently transferred from the IT infrastructure group to the IT 
applications group to work on SQL support and development.
 
On a sadder note, we will be losing Winston Goodbody on December 18th to a 
six month cross-country skiing trek across Wyoming.  Winston has been 
contracting at Enron for the last year and a half and will be sorely missed.

Thanks,  David Poston

Enron is forming a new organization - - the Enron Xcelerator - - to drive the 
formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John 
has been an essential part of Enron's energy trading success over the years 
and is a key part of Enron Wholesale Services' continuing success story.  
Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of Enron 
NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated Enron's outstanding growth with the 
deployment of EnronOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of Enron 
Americas.

Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks will take 
over as President and CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership, 
Enron has become a technology leader and the leading e-commerce company.  
Joining Philippe as Chief Operating Officer is Greg Piper, currently Managing 
Director of Enron NetWorks.  Greg currently leads Enron NetWork's origination 
activity and was responsible for the creation and deployment of ClickPaper, 
Enron's successful online pulp and paper marketplace.

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their 
achievements and their new responsibilities.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

East Power Group
The East Power Group is off to another strong start in 2001.  The realignme=
nt=20
of the group into regional business units with joint trading, mid-marketing=
,=20
and origination operations has proven to be a catalyst for deal flow,=20
producing both a high volume of transactions and high value.  More=20
transactions were executed in January than any month last year, including o=
ne=20
deal that will bring tremendous strategic value to Enron as well.

Executed in January, was the purchase of two 35 MW coal-fired cogeneration=
=20
facilities located in southeastern North Carolina.  ENA will supply steam t=
o=20
the industrial host, Alamac Knit Fabrics, and will sell power into the=20
merchant market.  The plants are inside Carolina Power & Light's service=20
territory, which is connected to AEP, Virginia Power, Duke, SCEG and SCPSA.=
 =20
These plants are the first purely merchant facilities in North Carolina. =

This deal exemplifies how Enron leverages its talent in that originators fr=
om=20
the East Power Group and Industrial Markets Group joined forces to bring th=
is=20
deal to execution.  They also leveraged the Global Markets group to manage=
=20
the coal supply and emissions issues.

Prospects going forward look promising as a number of high value transactio=
ns=20
are in the pipeline.  Of particular note is The Sandhill Power Project, a 1=
80=20
MW peaking facility currently under construction in Austin.  The facility i=

scheduled to come online in June, in time for the advent of deregulation in=
=20
Texas. The joint venture, between EPMI and Austin Energy, will provide both=
=20
trading groups with a highly flexible asset, enabling them to access=20
real-time volatility while hedging existing obligations.

Additionally, the Fort Pierce (Florida) City Council voted 5 to 0 in favor =
of=20
Enron's proposal to repower the Ft. Pierce Utilities Authority's (FPUA)=20
existing power plant in that city.  Our proposed 180 MW facility will be us=
ed=20
to produce steam to power the H.D. King facility at approximately 20 percen=
t=20
less cost than FPUA can produce it.  According to FPUA officials, this=20
reduction in cost may lead to reduced rates for their ratepayers.  The=20
planned in-service date is summer of 2002.

Industrial Markets
EIM Fundamental Analysis Group grows again!  The Fundamental Analysis Group=

continues to expand its staff and capabilities.  They will be introducing y=
ou=20

On the paper/pulp/lumber side, Bin Wang is responsible for supporting the=
=20
lumber group; Adnan Patel will be assisting with newsprint and structured=
=20
transactions. =20

For the steel group, Doug Parsons and Yana Kristal are providing market=20
analysis and econometric/price forecasting support.  Our latest recruit,=20
David Maxwell, is assisting with the evaluation of a customer management=20
system and developing analytical databases for all product lines. A visible=
=20
enhancement to the group=01,s operations has been the Intranet web site, wh=
ich=20
has been in development for the past three months.  The site will be=20
transferred to a production server by the end of February.  The site contai=
ns=20
all types of industry, market, regulatory, analytical, and financial=20
information for deal analysis. =20

Another major development is the adoption of a customer information=20
management system.  EIM is currently evaluating Siebel Systems, a software=

provider that has developed this type of information tool for EES.

To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful 
and co-operative work relationships. Workplace harassment conflicts with 
ENRON's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can 
violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its 
potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

We are pleased to announce that all employees of EWS and EES will receive 
harassment prevention training soon.  This training is mandatory for all 
ENRON employees.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment
 Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with ENRON values

Please click here (  )  to sign up for the session of your choice.    If you

**Clarification**

Harassment Prevention Training

This training is mandatory for all Enron employees employed since the last 
seminar was conducted  in late 1998 or early 1999.  Those who have already 
attended Enron harassment avoidance training will be offered a refresher 
course in avoiding and preventing harassment.

To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful 
and co-operative work relationships. Workplace harassment conflicts with 
ENRON's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can 
violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its 
potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment
 Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with ENRON values

Please click here (  )  to sign up for the session of your choice.    If you 
have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713 853-0357.

We are pleased to announce that all employees of EWS and EES will receive 
harassment prevention training.  

The dates and times available for the sessions are:


 Friday, Feb 23; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15
  Monday Mar 5; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15; 4:30 - 6:00

All training sessions will be held in the LaSalle Room at the DoubleTree 
Hotel.
There is a $50 charge for each attendee in the training session."

Important Reminder for ENA Employees

ENA will be rolling out the new Concur Technologies XMS Expense Management 
System March 1, 2001.

XMS will replace the Excel Spreadsheet currently submitted to request expense 
reimbursement. PLEASE NOTE: Those people/teams who have not received training 
are still able to submit reports as before, but teams within ENA are asked to 
transition to XMS as soon as possible following the March 1 target. The 
deadline to transition to XMS is April 1, 2001.

There may be a number of ENA administrative assistants who have already 
received hands-on classroom training and are able to submit both their own 
reports and the reports of those people they support.

If you or your administrative assistant need to be trained on XMS, there are 
several options available:

1. XMS Demo
One or more XMS demonstrations had been scheduled in the month of February. 
These demonstrations will give an overview of XMS functionality but will not 
offer hands-on training. 

2. XMS Classroom Training
Please call Maggie Cruz at 3-1816 regarding XMS Training.

3. LEAP online Self-tutorial
Select the following link to access this LEAP self-tutorial.

http://spr2lp1.enron.com/leap_templates/leap_le/login.asp

4. Online documentation
Select the following link to access the written documentation on XMS from 
Concur Technologies.

 http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/xmscheatsheet.doc

Please visit the ISC intranet site for the complete list of documentation on 
XMS.  
XMS also offers an online tour the first time a user logs on.


If you are not able to log into XMS please call the ISC helpdesk 
(713)345-4SAP.

If you have questions about how to use XMS or how to set up 
profiles/workflow, call the Tech Support hotline (713) 853-1411."

The people on the ""To"" list have been selected to attend an ""Energy Math"" 
training session which will be held on March 7th from 9 AM to 5 PM in the 
River Room at Two World Trade Center.  Amy Fitzpatrick will provide you with 
a course outline and background reading (helpful but not mandatory) by Monday 
morning.  We want to have 15 people attend this course.  I realize that this 
is short notice, so if you can't attend please let me know ASAP so that I can 
find a replacement.

I have been working with Jon Koomey, who will be teaching the course, over 
the last couple of months to tailor a training session that will meet the 
needs of people who work on this floor.  The goal is to provide a 
comprehensive overview of computations and analytical tools that are the 
foundation of analyzing energy problems.  The course is loosely based on a 
graduate level course offered at Berkeley (which Jon has taught and several 
people on the floor have taken) and on a book that Jon Koomey recently 
published.

This is the first time that this course, in its current form, is being 
offered.  As a result, it should be viewed as a work in progress.  Chris 
Calger and I would like every person in this office to have the opportunity 
to take this course between now and the end of the year.  We have selected a 
cross-section of people for this first session.  Some people have a lot of 
experience doing analysis while others have little training in this area.  
Some have been working in the energy industry for several years while others 
are new to the business.  We are hoping that the course will be helpful to 
people with different backgrounds.  Each participant in the class is not only 
responsible for learning as much as you can, but is also required to give 
constructive feedback to Jon Koomey and to us on how to make the course 
better.  You will have both formal and informal opportunities to provide 
feedback.  This feedback is part of the program.  If you aren't willing or 
don't feel that you have the time to take this one-day course and provide us 
with thoughtful, constructive suggestions on how to improve the course for 
the next time please let me know and your name will be removed from the list 
for this session.

Based on the feedback from this course, we will make modifications before the 
next course is offered in a month or so.  With your help, we will be able to 
improve the training for the people who come after you.  Thanks in advance 
for your help with this, and I hope that you find this training to be helpful.

We are pleased to announce that Dave Duran will replace Janet Dietrich to 
co-lead the East Power Wholesale business at Enron.  Dave will continue to 
run the highly successful Generation Investments business.

The East Power team will continue to have a single income statement and joint 
accountability toward its financial goals as was set out in the 
reorganization in late 2000.

Within Dave's Generation Investments group; Michael J. Miller will lead the 
effort to acquire new QF projects, Chuck Ward will lead the restructuring 
efforts on existing QF projects, and Carl Tricoli will lead the initiative to 
develop and market capital products to IPP's.  In addition, Mitch Robinson 
will lead a new initiative to evaluate opportunities with coal fired 
generation.  Dave and Kevin Presto will attempt to leverage the Generation 
Investments business and the Origination activities through a tighter 
integration between the two groups.

Dave has over nine years of direct experience in gas and power origination at 
Enron including an outstanding performance over the last couple of years 
building the Generation Investments business.  He also spent two years 
managing Enron's Retail Gas Marketing business in Dublin, Ohio.

The East Power group has had a great start to the year and we feel confident 
that the leadership team of Kevin and Dave will lead to continued success."

It doesn't say how much capacity was impacted, but it sounds like  a 
localized problem in San Diego rather than a statewide gas import  problem.? 
I thought it was nice of Mr. Winters to add his expert  commentary.

California Power Plants Get Jolt
As Natural-Gas Supplies Are  Cut

By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal  

LOS ANGELES -- Southern California power plants, already stressed to their  
limits last summer, got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp  
curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity. 

The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce  
electricity. But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns 
that  an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is 
putting the  reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk. 

That's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S.  
burn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able 
to  shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were  
constructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel  
flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than 
gas  and generally has been costlier. 

In California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San  
Diego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to 
grow  new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical 
emergencies last  summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had 
hoped to solve the  problem by speeding up construction of new generating 
plants. Now, they're  finding the state may be building its way out of an 
electrical problem and into  a gas problem. 

One official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single  
fuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a  
comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas 
and  electricity affect each other. ""We don't just need new generating 
plants  and transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too,"" said Terry 
Winter,  chief executive officer of the California Independent System 
Operator, the  organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity 
supplies.  ""You can't look at these things in isolation."" 

The natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company,  
San Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful  
of industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. 
In  California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural 
gas,  and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are 
generating  plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns  
some of the older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil. 
But  it didn't like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution 
when  they burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that 
power  plants here need to operate. 

The San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was 
short  of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, 
including  many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now 
undergoing repair  after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer. 

What's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough 
to  begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers 
and  not big power plants. 

The problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because  
gas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation, 
but  especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard 
last  summer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic 
feet of  gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% 
less. Prices  also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million 
British thermal units  to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are 
down about 8% from a year  ago. 

""Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the  nation,"" said 
John Lavorato, chief operating officer of Enron North  America, a unit of 
Enron Corp. of Houston. But he said they're headed up in  the Northeast, 
based on cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two weeks.  

High prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. 
In  California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was 
$228  per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times 
the price a  year earlier.

IMPORTANT EPMI POLICY REGARDING HARD COPY DOCUMENTS
WHILE LITIGATION IS PENDING

This policy is in addition to my prior email about the procedure for
handling email and electronic documents.  While most of what we do is
contained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when hard
copies are made or needed for running our business.  Here is how you must
handle those hard copy documents:

1. The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are
used in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep those
documents until further notice.  If space becomes a problem, please contact
Debra Davidson who can arrange for storage.

2. What constitutes a document?  In some instances you will have one
copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy
that may be clean.  For these purposes both are considered documents and
both must be saved.  Similarly, if several people have copies of the same
document, each separate copy is considered a separate document.  On the
other hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left over
that were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so long
as you keep the ones that were used.   If you keep handwritten notes for
your work, those would be considered documents as well.  Telephone notes,
charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents.   If
you have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it should
be saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.

3. The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hard
copies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesale
electricity market litigation.  If hard copy documents are discarded, at a
later point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for failing
to preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.

4. Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages from
friends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by this policy
and you may do with them as you wish."

I am excited to announce a major initiative called iBuyit, a new online 
purchase and payment tool.  Each of you will be able to use iBuyit to order 
or approve purchases from pens to pipe and cable to computers.  Our Global 
Strategic Sourcing (GSS) and Global Accounting groups have teamed up with 
each of your Business Units to build a tool designed to meet your specific 
needs.

Special iBuyit features include:
? An eCatalog to help you quickly find the items you need
? Shopping baskets to store your purchases
? Simple recurring purchases 
? Automatic routing of invoices for coding and approval

iBuyit will be implemented in stages across ETS, EBS, EES, EWS, Corporate and 
Europe during 2001.  

Over the next few months, you will be hearing more about iBuyit from your 
business unit leadership, including what it can do for you and when you can 
expect to use it."

Lately, people have been asking about anonymity.  It seems that some might 
like to go ""incognito"" on eSpeak.  But, the purpose of eSpeak is to encourage 
open communication, and communication can't be open unless all participants 
are open about who they are.  So, we will continue to require you to log in 
with your eThink IDs and passwords if you want to ask a question during an 
eSpeak event.
There are ways to ask questions anonymously at Enron.  You may send an e-mail 
to the Office of the Chairman e-mail address -- this goes to Ken Lay and Jeff 
Skilling.  You may also use interoffice mail to send a printed question to 
Ken or Jeff anonymously.
These two avenues have always been available.  It bears mentioning, however, 
that they have not been used nearly as much since eSpeak hit the scene.  You 
might say that open communication has caught on at Enron."

As you are aware, Enron signed an agreement with Blockbuster Inc. last summer 
to launch an entertainment on-demand service.  We announced today that we are 
discontinuing our exclusive relationship with Blockbuster in order to expand 
the offering by developing direct relationships with content providers and 
distribution partners.

We have made tremendous progress toward our goal of becoming the leading 
provider of entertainment on-demand over a digital platform.  We rolled out 
the trial service in Seattle, Portland, Salt Lake City and New York in 
December, and today subscribers are buying movies on-demand using the service 
we created.

However, the exclusive relationship with Blockbuster has not yielded the 
quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting, new 
on-demand service.  Now that we have proven the concept, we want to take our 
service to the next level by adding content and subscribers on an accelerated 
basis.  We feel that this can be best achieved by pursuing entertainment 
on-demand independently.

We intend to initiate discussions with various content providers for 
delivering their content over the Enron platform.  We remain very positive 
about the potential of this business for EBS and Enron and will keep you 
apprised of our progress."

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state. "

We regret to announce that with the reduced emphasis on developing large 
infrastructure projects in certain countries, a number of individuals have 
elected to leave Enron.  Diomedes Christodoulou, formerly Chief Commercial 
Officer of Enron Broadband Services, James Bannantine, formerly CEO of Enron 
South America, and Sanjay Bhatnagar, formerly CEO of Enron Broadband Services 
for the Middle East and Asia, have elected to leave Enron to pursue other 
opportunities.  Diomedes, Jim and Sanjay built and led strong and talented 
teams at Enron.  We wish all of these individuals the very best in their new 
endeavors."

Rick Causey recently announced a new online purchase and payment tool called 
iBuyit.  One of the special iBuyit components is an automated accounts 
payable feature that will improve the way you code and approve invoices. 

As of May 1, you will be able to access iBuyit Payables and
? choose budget codes from simple drop down menus
? receive e-mail when you have an invoice that needs to be coded and/or 
approved; and
? view an electronic image of the actual invoice

These improvements will help you assign codes more accurately and will reduce 
the time you spend processing invoices for payment.  The AP tool will also 
begin to eliminate the need for coding sheets or other paper information 
currently in use.  

This tool will provide us the opportunity to transition our Houston-based AP 
processing functions to a third party, SourceNet Solutions.  This transition 
is expected to be completed by August 2001.

You will hear more about the iBuyit initiative, features of the AP tool and 
training opportunities in the coming weeks.  Please contact your AP 
representative if you have any questions."

In the last week, five new ideas have been posted to the Idea Vault and 
routed for review, including Enron Airline Services, the Enron Office Locator 
and the use of geostationary satellites to read meters.  
We also have a success story to share.  Tony Pickett suggested that Enron 
compile a glossary of terms (abbreviations, acronyms and industry jargon) and 
make it available online.  The New Hire Network has stepped up to make this 
idea a reality.
Visit the ThinkBank today and drop an idea in the Idea Vault!


This week, we are releasing a new version of eSpeak!  From the audience 
perspective, the changes are very subtle.  We've added features such as a 
time stamp on each posting, the ability to format responses, and we've even 
put the speaker's photo inside the transcript window (in case you forget 
who's hosting the event).  From eSpeak's perspective, we've smoothed out some 
things  behind the scenes.  We hope you'll take a look at the new site and 
let us know what you think about it.  
The next eSpeak will take place on Thursday, Mar. 29 at 10 a.m. Houston 
time.  Mark Koenig, executive VP of Investor Relations, will discuss Enron's 
investor relations function and provide a stock update.

 

Hey, check out this cool, stainless steel mug!	It's almost as cool as this mouse 
pad!

	
	

Both the mug and the mouse pad are available at the Signature Shop online, 
with lots of other really neat eThink stuff.  Buy some today!

In order to better align our engineering and operations capabilities with t=
he=20
commercial businesses they support, we are pleased to announce the followin=
g=20
organizational change will be effective immediately.  A new business unit,=
=20
Enron Engineering and Operational Services (EEOS), is being formed which wi=
ll=20
include our existing operations in Enron Engineering and Construction Compa=
ny=20
(EE&CC), Operational Energy Corporation (OEC), and National Energy Producti=
on=20
Corporation (NEPCO).

Brian Stanley, as President and Chief Executive Officer, and Keith Dodson, =
as=20
Chief Operating Officer will provide the leadership for this new=20
organization, reporting to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale=20
Services.  NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand-alone business under=
=20
John Gillis, President.

With the majority of EE&CC and OEC=01,s activities focused on assets and=20
projects which are in Wholesale Services, this will better align the effort=
s=20
of EEOS with the commercial businesses it supports.  While EEOS will be a=
=20
stand-alone unit within Enron Wholesale Services it will work very closely=
=20
with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports.

This realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabiliti=
es=20
in a single business segment and should ensure that innovation and best=20
practices are shared and implemented across our many operations and will al=
so=20
allow for better identification of priorities and more effective allocation=
=20
of resources to these projects.  Consistent with this approach, Development=
=20
Engineering will have dual reporting to both EEOS and the business units=20
which they support. =20

With an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wid=
e=20
variety of new development opportunities available to Enron, it is critical=
=20
that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design,=20
construct, commission, and effectively manage and operate Enron=01,s assets=
 on a=20
global basis.

This new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhanc=
e=20
these demonstrated capabilities and provide us with a sustainable advantage=
=20
as we advance our business strategy around the world.

Please join us in congratulating Brian and Keith on their new assignments.

I recently went through the list and weeded out the ones that don't have 
deals under them.  Unfortunately, Enpower contains the CPs for Canada and the 
Emissions group, which are sometimes similar names.  Sometimes Europe 
attaches CPs by mistake and we have takenf them out also.  Name changes and 
mergers also complicate things.  What we do is keep an eye out for the 
incorrect CP and try to inform the traders when they are picking the wrong 
CP.   Believe me, if the developers could differentiate the CPs in Global CP, 
it would be done.  I guess the issue is how much time and money it would 
require to change CP to feed just our CPs.  And on APS, they have informed us 
that they are still trading under both names until 1/1/01 and credit is okay 
with this.  I could go on and on about all the issues, but you get the idea.  
Welcome to Enron!

Subject: Enpower: Counterparty Name Changes

Hi Rhonda -

I was told you're the person to contact regarding changes in the Enpower 
counterparty list. Several items are outdated or have gone through many 
different versions, and it's made somewhat of a confusing situation for the 
traders and others who do deal entry. My sensitivity to this is heightened 
because I'm new to the Deal Control position here at the Portland West Desk, 
and I'm still getting used to which names we use and which we don't. Monica 
Lande suggested I ask you about it, although she pointed out that if we've 
ever booked a deal under any of these counterparty names, then they need to 
stay in the system. 

I'm wondering if there is any way to weed out some of those extra selections. 
For example, Duke and El Paso both have five different names in the system; 
Arizona Public Service Company has become Pinnacle; and other names were just 
tests that are no longer used. 

Please let me know whenever you have a free moment - this is certainly not an 
urgent request, and I completely understand if the list needs to stay as is. 
Just checking.

Thanks,
Kate

FYI....

EnTelligence?
No, its not spelled wrong, it's the name of a prospecting website designed =
to=20
deliver market information on existing and potential customers to commercia=
l=20
trading, mid-marketing, and origination teams.  It also delivers management=
=20
reports to analyze Enron=01,s position within the key industries that we se=
rve. =20
Presently, commercial groups have multiple methods for acquiring potential=
=20
customer information.  This system will standardize their resource tools an=
d=20
add consistency to their prospecting processes.  EnTelligence combines=20
information from internal databases such as Global Counterparty, Credit=20
Aggregation System (CAS), Sitara, Enpower, and ERMS with information from=
=20
external data sources such as Dun & Bradstreet and I.H.S Energy Reporter to=
=20
identify customer prospects.  By providing the capability to filter and=20
search by region, industry, company size, or energy consumption levels, the=
=20
prospecting process is shortened and the identification of strong prospects=
=20
improved. Available reports include Market Penetration, Industry Prospectin=
g,=20
Comparison Prospecting, Company Profiles, Family Tree, Top Customers, and=
=20
Inactive Accounts.  Currently only Natural Gas and Power physical deals are=
=20
loaded, but financial deals will be included soon, as well as other=20
commodities. =20

Alternatively, you can also access the site from Enron's homepage, under th=
e=20
Information & Services section, go to the link called ""EnTelligence"".

To view deal data, a user will need to submit an eRequest and select either=
:=20
Trader, Manager, or Sr Manager security.  I would also recommend to add the=
=20
following applications to your eRequest: Dow Jones Interactive (DJI), and=
=20
Live Link.  DJI is to be able to view market information and Live Link is o=
ur=20
desktop documentation system which enables the user to view a contract from=
=20
your computer.

The following attachment is a sampling of a Market Penetration report=20
displaying a count of companies in the industry code ""Electric Services"" of=
=20
the total number Enron has dealt with and the total number of companies Enr=
on=20
has not dealt with yet.  Also, a sample of Enron Power Marketing Group's To=
p=20
customers for physical deals within the last 12 months.
=20

Give the system a test drive and let us know what you think! Any questions,=
=20
please call the EnTelligence helpdesk  at  713-853-3147.  Our website link=

Over the last couple of years we have had numerous social events including 
holiday parties, company-sponsored outings to Edgefield, post-quarterly 
meeting outings, and going away parties.  While I hope that people thoroughly 
enjoy themselves, I ask that you keep in mind that we all have to act 
professionally and responsibly during and after these events.  I have been 
working with Chris Calger and Amy Fitzpatrick to put together some guidelines 
for company-sponsored social events:

The company will provide soft drinks, beer, and wine.  You may choose to 
order other beverages at your expense.
Functions will run for a specified period of time.  If there is an open bar, 
we will establish a time certain after which Enron will not pay for any 
additional drinks.
If you require assisance getting home, please contact a taxi and submit the 
fare for expense reimbursement with no questions asked.  The last thing in 
the world we want is to have people break the law or put their safety and the 
safety of others in jeopardy.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks for your cooperation."

Earlier this week I was pleased to announce that Enron's new procurement an=

requested IT hardware from IT Central.  But there is still more to come! On=

supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable processing centers.  The new=20

process by capturing invoices as scanned images at a central point of recei=

and routing them electronically for coding, payment authorization, and issu=

resolution.=20

In preparation for this transition, there are some simple changes to the wa=
y=20
you currently order and pay for goods and services.  Following these change=
s=20
will ensure that your invoice is correctly processed through the iBuyit=20
Payables system.=20

Effective immediately, provide vendors with the following information when=

the purchaser electronically through iBuyit. =20

Do I need to use an EID for non-purchase orders?
Yes.  When ordering goods and services with a non-purchase order, the=20
purchaser should provide the vendor with the appropriate EID.  It is your=

responsibility to communicate to vendors that an EID is now required for=20
non-purchase orders.

Do I need to use an EID for purchase orders?
No.  When ordering goods and services with an approved purchase order, you=
=20
should provide the vendor with a purchase order number as you currently do.=
 =20


What if I do not know my EID?
All Enron employees are assigned an EID number. If you purchase goods and=
=20
services on behalf of Enron, you need to know your personal EID number.  Yo=
u=20
can access your EID number in eHRonline.  Logon to eHRonline, choose=20

Wednesday, April 11 at 10 a.m. Houston time, join Gene Lockhart, president & 
CEO of The NewPower Company on eSpeak.  Gene will answer your questions about 
electric restructuring in Texas.
Can't make it then?  Not to worry:  You can submit a question right now!  Go 
to the eSpeak site and post your question in Gene's event.  He will respond 
to it during the live event, and you can read the transcript later for all 
the answers.


Here is an eMeet game that everyone can play!  Suppose your group is under an 
evil spell cast by a witch.  Who is the witch, what is the spell and what 
words were uttered to cast it?  Sound absurd?  It really isn't.  Going 
through this thought process might help you ""exorcise"" problems in the 
workplace.  Share your evil spells on eMeet in the ""What's your evil spell?"" 
category.


By now, most of you have gotten the message that it's time to cut costs at 
Enron.  Do you have a simple suggestion for how we might do this?  Post it in 
the Idea Vault in the new category:  Cost Reduction.  ThinkBank.  Make a

I would like to announce the following management changes within the Analyst 
/ Associate Program, which are effective immediately.

Traci Warner will assume responsibility for Recruiting for the Western 
Hemisphere.  Traci joined Enron's Associate Program in 1995 and has held 
positions in Business Development, Origination, and Public Relations at Enron 
Energy Services, Enron North America and Enron Broadband Services.

Ted Bland will assume responsibility for Career Development (including 
rotations) for the Western Hemisphere.  Ted has been with Enron since 1989 
and has held several roles in Origination and Business Development within 
Enron Wholesale Services.  Most recently, Ted was assigned to the 
commercialization of some activities within Human Resources.

Anna Jansson, who is based in London, will continue to lead all efforts for 
the Associate / Analyst Program in the Eastern Hemisphere.  Anna has been 
with Enron Europe for the past three years and, most recently, has been 
responsible for setting up the EBS Human Resources function in Europe.

Please join me in working with Traci, Ted and Anna to ensure the success of 
this important program.

Netiquette.  What's that?  

Well, in case you didn't know, Netiquette is the proper use of e-mail.  
Because we all spend a large portion of our day communicating with customers, 
vendors and co-workers via e-mail, here are some tips to help you polish your 
e-mail skills and send you on your way to Netiquette success. 

Short & Sweet
Keep your messages concise and to the point.

Cluless In . . .
The subject line can be a couple of words or a short phrase that gives the 
reader a hint to the contents of your message.

ARE YOU ANGRY?
The use of UPPERCASE text is the equivalent of yelling in the world of 
e-mail.  Lower the case and, thus, your e-mail voice.

Are You Still Angry!!!??
Watch out for excessive punctuation like exclamation points.  If something is 
important, put it in words, not exclamation points.

We Can Become Too Attached
Think of your reader and, whenever possible, put your message in the body of 
the e-mail rather than in an attachment.

Does Everyone Need To Know?
Be careful when you send replies to ""all recipients"" of an e-mail.  Ask 
yourself if everyone really needs to see your response.  If not, you'll be 
using up disk space, cluttering inboxes and slowing the mail servers 
unnecessarily.

Spellcheck Is Your Friend
Like printed documents, e-mail deserves a review to assure that grammar and 
spelling are correct.

Privacy On The Net?
There is no such thing as private e-mail.  Never send anything by e-mail that 
you would not want to see on the front page of tomorrow's newspaper.  There 
are no security guarantees with electronic mail.

Eyes Only In Cyberspace
Avoid sending any confidential or sensitive information via e-mail.  
Remember, it's very easy for someone else to forward messages you considered 
confidential.  Even messages sent as ""Confidential"" can be copied.

Quick Tips -- Refine Your Skills
Long paragraphs are hard to read.  Break them up into smaller ones of two to 
three sentences.
The use of abbreviations should be minimal.
When sending e-mail outside Enron, keep it plain and simple.  That means no 
elaborate use of formatting tools, such as bold, indent, etc.
Your e-mail signature should be the same one you use on printed documents.
Address people in business e-mail the same way you normally would in person 
or in a letter (e.g., Bob: or Ms. Smith:)
Sarcasm is dangerous to use in e-mail.  Remember, e-mail does not convey 
emotions."

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enro=

America=01,s Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital,=
 we=20
have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit=

f=20
creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas=
,=20
with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are=20
allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge.=20

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this ye=
ar=20
will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets.=20
Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the=20
capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will =
be=20
maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownersh=
ip=20
Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will=
=20
be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC=20
process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital char=
ge=20
at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structure=
d=20
off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred=
=20
cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge.=20
Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be=
=20
priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America=01,s overall credit=
=20
capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital=
=20
Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way th=
e=20
Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used=20
specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted=20
above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out=
=20
to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America=
=01,s=20
sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the=20
organization.=20

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165."

Dave -
I'm the new Deal Control staff person here in the Portland office, and I've 
been told you're the person to contact regarding counterparty match-ups for 
our futures deals this month.

The futures were done today, and if you could let me know of the 
corresponding counterparties as soon as you find out, that would be very 
helpful. If there is anything I should know about your job or how we might 
help each other work better, please let me know.

Thanks a lot,
Kate

Friends and co-workers:

 I have accepted a job trading next-day power in the Entergy region effective 
January 2nd.      I will be reporting directly  to Rogers Herndon and,  
ultimately,   Kevin Presto.        This move gives me the chance to be closer 
to family and an opportunity to further develop my trading skills.      This 
would not have been possible without  the tremendous opportunities that were 
available to me during my three year stay in Portland.    

I would like to thank the entire floor for their help in making the Real Time 
& also the Services Desk a success this year.       The decision to leave was 
extremely hard,   given this level of support.     

 I am confident that next year will be a great one for each of you and I wish 
you luck in your careers at the Big E!       

Thanks,     

JMF                        "

Samuel,

Please set up Kate Symes as a trader with access to all of the West power 
desks.    She is taking over for Carla Hoffman as a Deal Control specialist.
She frequently has to enter California deals (PX,  ISO,  etc) in addition to 
bilateral transaction deal entry.

If you have questions,  please give me a call.

Thanks,
JMF

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Mark Frevert and Mark Haedicke

Hello, I left a message for David Dupre and he has not called me back.  If 
you want to have Matt call Tim Cannon at Sempra that would be fine.  His 
phone number is (203) 355-5190.  I don't know why this has been so 
difficult.  If I hear from David I will let you know.  I want to know how he 
handled these deals in the past.

Thanks,
Melissa

Just curious - did you ever catch up with Larry Joe Hunter regarding the Long 
Term Southwest desk's futures deal with Sempra? I'm wondering if I should 
grab Matt Motley before he goes home today to let him know he needs to get a 
hold of Tim Cannon about the ADT. Let me know when and if you talk to him.

Thanks,
Kate

Hello, I just spoke with Joe Hunter.  His group is supposed to call you and 
ask if you want to ADP the deal.  Then they notify the brokers to let them 
know.    Joe Hunter's group will handle this part of the process in the 
future.  In the future when these trades are entered into Enpower we would 
like for you all to put a comment in the deal saying that it is a deal that 
when physical off of the NYMEX.  We do not want to confirm these 
transactions.  We sent a confirmation letter on this deal and that is what 
caused all of the confusion.   Regardless if the deal has been ADP'd or not 
we do not want to confirm these transactions since they were originally done 
on the NYMEX.  So please let everyone know to put a note in the deal so we 
won't confirm them and hopefully we won't have all of this confusion again in 
the future.

Thanks for you help!

Let me know if you need me to do anything else.
Melissa

Subject: Re: Futures Deal w/ Sempra  

I've spoken with Tim Cannon at Sempra, who said that what he needed was for 
our broker and his broker to talk to each other and agree that this deal has 
gone physical and is no longer on NYMEX. Then I talked to Matt Motley, who 
talked to his broker, who will now talk to Sempra's broker and hopefully 
solve this once and for all.

You're right though. There's no need for it to be this difficult, especially 
when we do it every month. I think it would be really helpful if we could get 
a hold of Dave Dupre to find out how this was handled before. If we can't, I 
guess we'll just have to determine who will take responsibility for making 
sure these deals are recognized as physical by both parties. I would be happy 
to do that each month when we exercise our futures options, but I want 
everyone involved to be aware of the procedure.

Thanks a lot for helping on this. Please let me know if you find out anymore.

Thanks,
Kate

Hello, I left a message for David Dupre and he has not called me back.  If 
you want to have Matt call Tim Cannon at Sempra that would be fine.  His 
phone number is (203) 355-5190.  I don't know why this has been so 
difficult.  If I hear from David I will let you know.  I want to know how he 
handled these deals in the past.

Thanks,

Just curious - did you ever catch up with Larry Joe Hunter regarding the Long 
Term Southwest desk's futures deal with Sempra? I'm wondering if I should 
grab Matt Motley before he goes home today to let him know he needs to get a 
hold of Tim Cannon about the ADT. Let me know when and if you talk to him.

Thanks,
Kate

Sharen:

As we discussed, here is the Del. Pt. language for sales at NP and SP15.  For 
any sale beyond April 2002 (not purchases), we might want to use this 
language, but only if the trader requests it in a note on the deal entry.  If 
the trader does not request it, it is our understanding that you will try to 
catch it and notify us to make sure the new language is not desired by the 
trader (Use me as a contact and I will ask the trader).  It is understood, 
however, that if the trader does not request the language and you do not 
catch it the trader bears the risk.

Thanks

Chris

The goals should be a mixture of short-term and long-term goals.  For 
example, a short-term goal could be to learn more about the functionality of 
Enpower, while a long-term goal could be to move to the European office to 
manage logistics.  It is important for management to know employee goals so 
that management can help the employee get to where they want to go.

If you have any questions, ask your manager or me."

For those of us in Enron Americas, the following is for your information.

I contacted Eric Thode, Director of Public Relations, to ask when we should 
start converting our business cards, letterhead, envelopes, etc., to say 
Enron Americas.  He was traveling at the time he received my message but had 
Jennifer Walker in his office call me back.  Eric recommended we use Enron 
Americas when ordering anything new with the company name on it from this day 
forward.  He thought work was being done on the ""big announcement"" about 
getting the name changed on everything, and he would contact me next week to 
discuss.  When I hear anything new, I'll let you know.

Contact me if you have any questions."

We are going to start using a single application to wait for PX prices in the 
morning (get funky) and to upload specific prices manually.  Whereas in the 
past we used an application called PX_Live and an application called 
PX_Capture, we will now use just one application called PX_Capture.

You can get to this application from the Portland menu (Start > Programs > 
Portland > Scheduling > PX_Capture.exe).  The PX_Live choice will go away 
from your menu choice."

I'm forwarding your message to the group here -we all wanna give you a big 
hug!  I never really said anything to Carla because I liked working with her, 
but that was always kind of a sticking point with the folks here in Houston 
-she never would tell us when something was changed so we would always have 
to run extra reports to make sure that we caught everything that might have 
gone into pending.  It wasn't a huge deal, but it certainly helps if you 
wanna drop an email or give us a call to let us know when anything changes 
-that's how we do it here; everyone knows to tell documentation when they 
revise any deals.  Also, don't forget to put notes in anytime you change 
anything in Deal Entry to CYA.  So glad to have you and I can't wait to meet 
you!
Not sure how good a tan you're gonna get around the New Year, though.  I 
could let you know about some good tanning salons while you're in town (j/k).
Thanks again!
Kim

Subject: Re: Deal #471740 Mieco  

She didn't ""warn"" me that you were cheesy, but she did mention you were a 
peach too! And anyway, I love cheesy e-mails.

But since I'm writing, I might as well mention that I have a deal that was 
changed last night by one of our traders, and I think it needs to be 
re-confirmed. It's deal number 476435 - Mark Fischer caught his own error and 
changed the delivery point from Palo Verde to Mid-C. 

And speaking of confirms and all that good stuff, that's one area I was never 
really told about; so if you or anyone else in your group has any information 
to share - anything that I could do to make your jobs easier or to make our 
jobs synchronize better - PLEASE let me know. I'm very humble about how much 
I have to learn, so the more people teach me, the better.

I believe I'll be coming down to Houston after the new year to meet people, 
tour the place, and get a suntan! So if you don't want to call or e-mail with 
every detail, you can compile them all and give me the run-down when I'm 
there. Whatever works for you guys - just let me know.

Thanks a lot,
Kate

Effective in the California scheduling sheet for 12/10 on, we are using a new 
method to access Enpower data.  There will be very little difference to users 
of the sheet, but behind the scenes we have substituted calling an Oracle 
stored procedure via ADO for what we had before, which was executing a SQL 
string via DAO.  When you go to pull in the daily data you may notice a 
slight difference in the form: the choice we had before of selecting between 
ADO and DAO is gone.

There is one difference in the sheet you need to know about.  This concerns 
what happens when a deal with a counter party that does not exist in our 
local counter party tables comes in via the Oracle query.  In the past, this 
counter party and the deal's hourly amounts would appear in the spreadsheet, 
but when we went to write CAPS templates, that counter party would not 
appear.  Someone would then tell me needed to add the counter party to our 
local counter party tables.

Now what will happen is that the name UNKNOWN will appear in the sheet with 
the hourly amounts for the missing counter party.  As before, whatever this 
missing counter party is will not appear in the CAPS templates.  You will 
still need to tell us what counter party is missing.  You will figure out 
which one it is in the same way you have in the past.  We are working on a 
process that will look up these missing counter parties and takes care of 
everything automatically."

We have discovered an ingenious new problem plaguing the CA scheduling 
spreadsheet.  I do not know how this happened, but here is the symptom.  You 
open a spreadsheet and you see a little version number behind the name like 1 
or 2.  For example:

ca1212.xls:1
ca1212.xls:2

Sometimes you may see a file's name several times under Window as if you 
somehow have several copies of the same spreadsheet open.  This apparently 
results from selecting Window > New Window.  Never, ever select New Window!  
I repeat: NEVER, EVER SELECT NEW WINDOW!  Once a worksheet has this version 
number it is ""contaminated"" and all sorts of other problems appear.  I'm sure 
you have noticed new errors popping up when you open or close one of these 
files.

I am going to create a new worksheet for the 13th from an older file that 
does not have one of these version numbers.  And we will hope this doesn't 
happen again.  Please be careful with this.  It sounds trivial but can in 
fact really screw things up."

I just created a new spreadsheet for the 13th.  I created this sheet from the 
7th, which was the last sheet we had without this little version problem.

Note that any special jurry-rigging you have done to the sheet in the last 
few days WILL NOT BE THERE because I had to go back to the 7th.

To repeat my favorite phrase of the day:

NEVER, EVER SELECT NEW WINDOW!"

Welcome to the Official PGE PARK NEWSLETTER.  This newsletter has been
created by Portland Family Entertainment (PFE) to give you an insider's
view on PGE PARK, the home of the Triple A Baseball Portland Beavers and
A-League Soccer Portland Timbers.

For more information, please visit our web site at www.pgepark.com, or
call the Ticket Hotline at (503) 553-5555.

PGE PARK CONSTRUCTION OVERVIEW
When PGE Park is completed next spring, event patrons may be surprised
to see the magnitude of this exciting renovation.  In partnership with
the City of Portland, PFE will manage a $38.5 million renovation of the
former Civic Stadium to enhance fan enjoyment standards, meet modern
design codes and honor the historic character of this 1926 landmark.

Soon to be the premier outdoor event venue in the region, PGE Park will
feature:

*  New convertible playing surface, adaptable to all events.

*  New baseball dugouts and bullpens.

*  Major League Baseball field dimensions.

*  Vintage style wrought-iron fence along 18th Ave. allowing passerby a
view of all PGE Park events.

*  New seats and wider concourses.

*  New restrooms and baby-changing stations.

*  New concession stands and kiosks with improved menu options.

*  Fred Meyer Family Deck featuring an old-fashioned soda fountain.

*  Yet-to-be-named Widmer field level bar and grill, featuring grills
and full beverage service.

*  Affordable Pavilion Boxes, Field Boxes and Club Seats for
high-quality corporate entertainment.

*  State-of-the-art sound system and new theatre organ.

*  Americans with Disabilities (ADA) Compliance.

*  Current seismic code compliance.

*  ... and much more!

PGE PARK CONSTRUCTION UPDATE
Virtually every area of the construction site is currently under
construction.  From elevator pits and structural elements to field boxes
and underground utilities, it's all coming together for our Spring 2001
opening.

The main concourse along 20th Avenue (the first base side), demolished
during the Portland Rockies' season last summer, is re-emerging as a
wider, lowered concourse.  Steel beams and metal decking are being
placed for a major concrete pour in the near future.  This will be the
most visible reconstruction element to date in the project.

Concrete has already been poured at the field level in the area of the
new soon-to-be-named Widmer Bar and Grill.  This field-level area will
have both an open air patio and a space built under the seating bowl for
a true early 1920's bar feel.  Selecting your favorite bar stool for a
view of the game is only a few months away!

We will soon be adding a Construction Update Photo Gallery to
www.pgepark.com.  We will keep you posted on when this exciting feature
is added.  If you would like to receive photos as an attachment, please
email us at info@pgepark.com.


PFE NAMES TRIPLE-A AND SINGLE-A BASEBALL TEAMS
After an outpouring of fan feedback, Portland Family Entertainment went
with tradition when they announced that the Triple-A Baseball Pacific
Coast League club will be called the Portland Beavers.

""Baseball is a game deeply rooted in tradition,"" said Mike Higgins, PFE
vice president and Beavers general manager, who made the announcement.
""The name and logo will also integrate well with the nostalgic look and
feel that PGE Park will have when it opens next spring.""

Portland Family Entertainment also announced that it has named its
Northwest League Single-A Baseball Team the Tri-City Dust Devils.
Formerly the Portland Rockies, the Dust Devils will begin play in the
Tri-Cities Stadium in Pasco beginning summer 2001.

PFE partnered with the Marathon Media Group of Tri-Cities to conduct a
poll and contest of their radio listeners to select the team name.
Respondents were able to vote on the Marathon Media web site.
Richland's Rosalie Swanson was selected at random, from the many Dust
Devil entries, as the grand prizewinner of two club-level season tickets
for the team's inaugural season.

For information on Beavers Club Seats and Season Tickets, call
503.553.5555 or fill out our online questionnaire at
http://www.pgepark.com/old_site/infoform.html.


VANCOUVER'S RICK SWEET NAMED BEAVERS MANAGER
The San Diego Padres didn't have to search far to find the right guy for
the job as today Vancouver, Washington resident, Rick Sweet, was named
manager of the Pacific Coast League's Portland Beavers.  The Padres also
announced other additions to the Beavers staff including Darrel
Akerfelds as pitching coach; Roy Howell as coach, and John Maxwell as
the club's trainer.

""We felt it was important to hire a manager that had significant
managerial experience,"" said Tye Waller, Padres' director, player
development.  ""It was also important for us to hire someone who had ties
to the local community.  That's not always an easy combination to come
up with, but we clearly achieved that in hiring Rick.  Rick, Darrel and
Roy have all played in the big leagues and that experience will be a
tremendous asset in the development of our younger players.  In John we
have a first class trainer and will do a terrific job in looking after
our guys.""

Sweet has 12 seasons of experience as a minor league manager and was
named Pacific Coast League manager of the year in 1994, while managing
the Tucson Toros as they defeated the Portland Beavers for the PCL
championship.  He joins the Portland's new Triple-A team from the
Montreal Expos where he served as their minor league field coordinator
for the past two years.  During the 1998 season, Sweet managed the
Double-A Harrisburg Senators to the Eastern League title.

Sweet also reached the majors as a switch-hitting catcher with the Mets,
Seattle Mariners and Padres.  He made his major league debut on April 8,
1978 with the Padres.  Sweet homered in his first Kingdome at-bat after
joining Seattle in 1982.


CONWAY NAMED TIMBERS ASSISTANT COACH
The Portland Timbers have named former player, captain, and coach, Jimmy
Conway, as assistant coach for Portland's new A-League soccer club.
Through an agreement between the Timbers and Oregon Youth Soccer
Association (OYSA), Conway will continue to serve in his current role as
OYSA's director of coaching, a position he has held since 1982.

""Jimmy was my first choice for the position of assistant coach and I am
delighted that he was available to join our staff,"" said Timbers head
coach, Bobby Howe.  ""Not only is he an outstanding member of US Soccer's
National Coaching Staff, but he also has a first class international
playing background.  I also want to recognize and thank OYSA for their
spirit of cooperation in allowing us to 'share' with them Jimmy's
knowledge and experience.  I think it will be a great benefit for our
professional players and Oregon's youth soccer players.""

Prior to coaching, Conway had an outstanding playing career making 20
caps for the Republic of Ireland from 1966-1977.  As a midfielder,
Conway made over 300 appearances for Fulham in England's First Division,
where he scored 66 goals for the Cottagers.  In 1976, he transferred to
Manchester City of the English Premier League before joining the Timbers
in 1978.  He was named captain of the Timbers in 1979 and was promoted
to the position of player-coach in 1980 by then head coach, Don Megson.
He retired from playing professionally in 1982.


TIMBERS ADD SECOND TRYOUT DATE TO MEET DEMAND
The Portland Timbers announced today that they have reached capacity for
their first public tryout scheduled for Saturday, November 11 at Tigard
High School and will add a second public tryout in January to meet
demand.

tryout will be announced in December.  The November 11 Timbers Open
Tryout will feature players from the local market as well as New York,
Texas, Illinois, New Jersey, Minnesota, Iowa, California and Alabama.

Meet the head of the leading firm in our business.

Imagine the opportunity!

Imagine that the leading energy company in the world has picked you to run 
the  company that it expects to be the leading retail energy company in North 
America.

So you get a sharp competitive edge in the back room, you recruit IBM as a 
co-owner assuring you the lowest cost per customer by a factor of two or 
three.

To get your foot in 27 million doors you recruit AOL as a co-venturer with a 
commitment from AOL to promote NewPower's wares.  You do an IPO and take in 
about $700 million for working capital.  The IPO is over and the quiet period 
it required.  But the most important silver spoon -- so that you get your 
energy at the best price and to protect you against price spikes -- you get 
up front 30 Enron-trained   risk managers and traders.  Can you imagine 
having to recruit them?

To make sure this team is run by the optimum chief they picked Eugene 
Lockhart,  most recently president of Consumer Services at AT&T and before 
that president of BankAmerica's Global Retail Bank with its consumer, 
commercial and small business banking services delivered through 3,000+ 
branches.

Now, Lockhart's talking about his plans.

Restructuring Today had lunch with Lockhart Thursday and reported in detail 
(to read the full story see attachment):

? How NewPower intends to actually start up the retail industry?  What is the 
heart of NewPower's business plan?
? How they'll make money in markets where margins may seem too thin.
? How he's going to have 600,000+ customers next month and easily a million 
by the end of 2001.
? What percentage of their sales come from the NewPower website.  What figure 
is he using for cost of customer acquisition?
? Lockhart plans to have by the end of the first quarter or at the latest the 
second quarter 750,000 customers making them by far the largest unregulated 
retail  marketer in the US.
? How does he think utilities will compete with the NewPower paradigm?
? What marketshare do they expect to get at first and then by 2005?
? What does he see as his biggest challenge?
? Why is this a good time for NewPower to invade California markets?
? Why will NewPower succeed where Enron failed?
? What's the role of backward dating in forward market margins?
? Where NewPower gives a 20-25% discount on the commodity portion of a bill, 
what kind of margin can it make now?
? How do higher prices help NewPower?  ""We're actually in a very good 
position given (that) the gas cost increases perversely will work in our 
favor ... ""
? ""We have a 10-year, exclusive agreement with IBM whereby we can issue a 
bill, collect the money and care for a customer at lower cost than anyone 
else in the industry by several orders of magnitude.""

We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who took the time =

respond to the Pulse survey conducted in October.  Your feedback is very mu=

appreciated.
The survey helps identify inhibitors that keep you from accomplishing your=

iers=20
that keep employees from achieving their personal best.
Out of the 2,299 ENA/EGM/EIM employees invited to participate in the survey=
,=20
1,478, or 64% responded.  Enron uses an outside firm, Watson Wyatt, to=20
tabulate data and report results.  A synopsis of what we heard from you has=
=20
been added to our intranet site.  The site address is=20

Our Strengths

Strengths are based on the highest percentages of favorable responses to=20
survey questions:=20

 * Employees are satisfied with their benefits     87%
 * Employees can believe information from top management   78%
 * Employees would recommend ENA/EGM/EIM as a good place to work 78%
 * Supervisors/Managers treat their employees fairly    76%=20
 * Supervisors/Managers encourage teamwork     73%
 * People are treated with respect       72%
 * ENA/EGM/EIM is well managed       72%

Improvement Opportunities

Improvement opportunities are based on the lowest percentages of favorable=
=20
responses to survey questions:

 * Communication/Information Flow       35%
 * Information Technology        32%
 * Workload          26%

We are pleased with these results because they exhibit a strong belief in=
=20
Enron=01,s core values of Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.=
 =20
These results are indicative of the quality of our employees at all levels.

The Pulse survey enables us to focus on real issues affecting each employee=
. =20
We will evaluate these results and consider remedies to the inhibitors that=
=20
affect us on a daily basis.  Your ideas are welcomed and we will be seeking=
=20
your input.  Great strides have been made since the first survey in 1996, a=
nd=20
we intend to continue in this vein. =20

Please plan to take part in future surveys, which will continue providing=

valuable information to help build a successful organization.  Again, thank=

Everyone,

We have just received an order from the California Attorney General requiring 
all employees (except legal, admin, and human resources staff) to take the 
following steps immediately:

   1.  Save all e-mails, i.e., don't delete any e-mails.
   2.  Do not delete any information in databases.
   3.  Do not delete any word processing files or file fragments.
   4.  Do not delete any excel spreadsheets or calendars or scheduling 
programs. 
   5.  Any other electronic data not otherwise covered.

This request is being made in connection with the California AG's 
investigation into electricity prices.  We do not know how many other 
companies have received a similar order, but there is no reason for us to 
assume at this time that Enron has been singled out.  

Over the next few days we will be working with our technology group to figure 
out the most efficient way to manage this request.  This is a serious matter 
and we strongly urge every person affected by this request to cooperate fully 
with this order.  We appreciate your help with this and will keep you 
apprised of any changes in policy.

Tim Belden and Chris Calger

Listed below are dates and actions required to finish the year-end PRC 
process.  Please make a note of these dates and perform any required 
actions.  If you have questions, please contact me.

December 15:  All PRC meetings and ratings will be finalized for Sr. Director 
and below positions.
January 25:  Performance reviews must be completed by this date.  All 
performance review information, including bonus payment and salary increase, 
must be communicated to employees.
February 5:  Bonus payment made to eligible employees.

Since we have many new employees, I thought I would provide the following 
information and philosophy about our performance review system.  Enron is 
very proud of its employees and is known for hiring the most talented people 
available in the marketplace.  I believe that is true in West Power Trading.  
The challenge for managers is to provide valuable feedback, and the most 
accurate rating, to employees so they can enhance their performance and 
progress in their current roles and within the company.

There are basically two objectives to our performance review system.

Career Development/Feedback on Performance:  This part of our performance 
review system includes the meetings and discussions surrounding the following 
four documents that are in each review package:  Goals, Expectations, 
Accomplishments, Feedback.  Employees prepare a listing of their Goals to 
accomplish by the next review period and a list of their Accomplishments 
since the previous review period.  Managers prepare Feedback and prepare a 
list of Expectations during the next review period.  These documents are the 
cornerstone for constructive two-way feedback during a performance review.

Performance Rating:  Enron uses a merit-based approach to determine 
promotions, raises, and bonuses.  This is accomplished in the PRC 
(Performance Review Committee) meetings.  In these meetings, the ENA 
management team assigns a performance rating to each employee.  We attempt to 
make this process as fair and objective as possible.  For West Power Trading 
employees, each person's performance is assessed relative to responsibilities 
defined in the ""Expectations"" document.  Performance is also gauged relative 
to your peers throughout ENA--Portland, Houston, and Calgary.  Each person's 
manager had tremendous input into this process.  I personally represented 
each person in our group in the final ENA PRC meeting in Houston.  I feel 
confident the process was fair and that the tremendous achievements of our 
office were acknowledged.

The following is a review of the various rating categories.

NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:  Does not meet most expectations.  Demonstrates some of 
the criteria.  Further development needed in most areas.

SATISFACTORY:  Meets many but not all expectations.  Demonstrates most of the 
criteria.  Further development needed in many areas.

STRONG:  Meets most and exceeds some expectations.  Role model for some of 
the criteria.  Further development needed in some areas.

EXCELLENT:  Exceeds most expectations.  Role model for most criteria.  
Further development needs are minimal.

SUPERIOR:  Consistently goes above and beyond expectations.  Role model for 
criteria.  Very little need for growth and change at current level.

My commitment to you is that by January 25, you will receive your 
career/development feedback and your performance rating.  Hopefully this 
information aids you in understanding the PRC review system.  If you have any 
questions about the process, please see your manager or me.  Also, Amy 
FitzPatrick would be happy to answer any questions you have or provide 
assistance with the PRC Process."

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =
=20
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=
tee. =20
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20

Committee membership is also shown on the attached list.

 We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital =

This is the preliminary report for December 2000.  Fortunately, you have seen 
most of the information during the month because the overlays on name changes 
were reported as they occurred.  The additions, that were not previously 
reported, are highlighted.





The ERMS short name changes will be made on Monday, December 18, after 1:p, 
CST.  Please note that the short name for American Public Energy Agency, CP 
ID 51134, will also be changed as indicated.  This was a name overlay on the 
Nov. 2000 report (see bottom tab on the spreadsheet).   It will change from 
ENERGYAME to AMERPUBENE.

Records will be inactivated on Jan 1, 2001.



HAPPY HOLIDAYS!

Enron Benefit Plans 
Summary Annual Report    

The basic financial and insurance information on the back of this page, as 
well as the material below, provide a Summary Annual Report for the Enron 
Benefit Plans.  The annual report for each plan has been filed with the 
Internal Revenue Service, as required by the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). 

NOTE:  You may receive a report for a benefit plan in which you are not a 
participant or under which you are not entitled.  Entitlement to benefits 
under any of the plans is based on the provisions of each plan.


Your Rights to Additional Information

You have the right to receive, upon request, a copy of the full annual 
report, or any part thereof, for any plan.  For insured plans, insurance 
information (including any sales commissions paid by insurance carriers) is 
shown in the annual reports.

To obtain a copy of the full annual report, or any part thereof, for any 
plan, write or call:

Enron Corp
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX  77002-7311

(713) 853-6161

You also have the right to receive from the plan administrator, on request 
and at no charge, a statement of the assets and liabilities of the plan and 
accompanying notes, or a statement of income and expenses of the plan and 
accompanying notes, or both.  If you request a copy of the full annual report 
from the plan administrator, these two statements and accompanying notes will 
be included as part of that report.

You also have the legally protected right to examine the annual report at the 
main office of the plan (Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX  
77002-7311) and at the U.S. Department of Labor in Washington, D.C., or to 
obtain a copy from the U.S. Department of Labor upon payment of copying 
costs.  Requests to the Department should be addressed to:  Public Disclosure 
Room, N-5638, Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of 
Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.

For your information--

Eric Thode, the Director of Public Relations for Enron, sent the email below 
to let us know that after a lot of discussion with the legal department, the 
decision was made to retain our company name of Enron North America, while 
the offices of Dave Delainey and John Lavorato will use Enron Americas.  Eric 
suggested that if we have ordered any business cards or stationery with Enron 
Americas that we re-order and use Enron North America.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Debra --

Stop the presses....I just received new information regarding the name 
change.  We have decided to keep everyone as Enron NOrth America or Enron 
South America.  The only people who will use Enron Americas are Dave Delainey 
and John Lavorato.  Hope this does not cause a problem.  If it does, please 
call me to discuss.  I'm sorry for the incorrect information a week or so ago.

Eric

Hi Corry and Kate,

Option Exercise has been fixed and migrated to stage.  Could you (or members 
from your group) please test it and let me know if it is working according to 
the way you use it?  Although we did some pretty thorough regression 
testing,  we want to ensure that we didn't miss anything from a user 
perspective since this is such an important Enpower application.  We are 
hoping to release Option Exercise to prod either later today, or early 
tomorrow, once we have gotten your approval.

If you have any questions or comments, please email or call me at:  
(713)853-9863.

Thanks,
Nadine (Enpower-QA)."

Although we will miss her greatly, both personally and professionally, we 
wish the best for Kim Ward who will be moving to Houston to be part of a new 
Gas Middle Marketing Group.  She will  be focusing on marketing physical and 
financial trading products to gas consumers in the Southwest and California.  
Kim was part of the first pioneering crew that moved to Portland to start-up 
our trading operation.  Her contributions have been tremendous.   Kim's last

As everyone is surely aware after last night's going away party, John Forney 
is heading back to Houston to trade the Short Term Entergy market.  Bill 
Williams III will be assuming responsibility for the Real Time desk and will 
report to Greg Wolfe.  There are three major areas of responsibility that 
Greg and Bill will be focussing on in 2001.  The first is the management of 
EPMI's physical power flows.  This entails checking out with counterparties, 
handling cuts, and ensuring that all of our risk and settlement systems 
reflect the proper information.  The second area is trading done by the Real 
Time group.  Each day, our Real Time desk combs the market looking for 
attractive trading opportunities.  The third area is the Services Desk.  The 
Services Desk provides scheduling and settlements services to customers who 
don't have the staff or systems to do it themselves.  We have seen our 
Services business grow dramatically this year.

Greg Wolfe will be ultimately responsible for the efforts of the Real Time 
desk and our Services business.  Les Rawson will continue in his role on the 
Services desk and will report to Greg.  Bill Williams will be responsible for 
the day to day operations of the Real Time desk.  Greg will continue to work 
closely with the middle market group and will maintain some of his coverage 
responsibilities.  Chris Foster will continue to manage the Middle Market 
group."

Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in=20
2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=
he=20
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=
e=20
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=
=20
and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=
=20
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=
e=20
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=
=20
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=
=20
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=
=20
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=
=20
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=
=20
our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=
nd=20
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=
=20
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=
e=20
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=

in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are=20

a) East Power =01) a single East Power Team incorporating trading, mid-mark=

Texas Gas =01) the Texas Gas Team will be managed by Tom Martin. This team =

producer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor=20
relationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor=20

Julie Gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identifi=

i) Energy Capital Resources =01) there will be no changes to this group=20
currently lead by C. John Thompson and Scott Josey.  John and Scott will=20

As a final note in the interest of keeping things simple, Enron Americas wi=

As a result, we will continue to conduct business under these two operating=

Many of you know that my wife, Sue, and I are expecting a baby any day now.  
When Sue stopped by the office on Tuesday, we were both pleasantly surprised 
by the wonderful gift basket and gift certificate to -- you guessed it -- 
Baby's R Us that the people on the floor gave to us.  The sage advise and 
warm wishes expressed on the card were particularly appreciated.  Thank you 
so much.

The continued growth of the Enron Europe office and related businesses has 
prompted a change in the management of Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) in 
London.  Effective in early January, 2001, Ted Murphy will transfer to the 
London office and manage the RAC activities which includes credit/market risk 
and underwriting. Ted will continue to manage the Enron Global Market Risk 
activities.  Steve Young, currently managing RAC in London, will begin a new 
assignment within  EBS, also in London.

The Houston Market Risk group will be managed by David Port.

As Enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses, it 
is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent 
and accurate manner across the company.  Hopefully this realignment will 
accomplish that goal.

Please join me in congratulating Ted, David and Steve on their new 
assignments."

For your information, the organizational change below will not bring about a 
change in administrative coverage for West Power Trading.  Anna Mehrer will 
continue to support Greg Wolfe as part of the Middle Market and Services 
group.  Kathy Sheppard will continue to support Bill Williams III and Real 
Time.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Organizational Update

As everyone is surely aware after last night's going away party, John Forney 
is heading back to Houston to trade the Short Term Entergy market.  Bill 
Williams III will be assuming responsibility for the Real Time desk and will 
report to Greg Wolfe.  There are three major areas of responsibility that 
Greg and Bill will be focussing on in 2001.  The first is the management of 
EPMI's physical power flows.  This entails checking out with counterparties, 
handling cuts, and ensuring that all of our risk and settlement systems 
reflect the proper information.  The second area is trading done by the Real 
Time group.  Each day, our Real Time desk combs the market looking for 
attractive trading opportunities.  The third area is the Services Desk.  The 
Services Desk provides scheduling and settlements services to customers who 
don't have the staff or systems to do it themselves.  We have seen our 
Services business grow dramatically this year.

Greg Wolfe will be ultimately responsible for the efforts of the Real Time 
desk and our Services business.  Les Rawson will continue in his role on the 
Services desk and will report to Greg.  Bill Williams will be responsible for 
the day to day operations of the Real Time desk.  Greg will continue to work 
closely with the middle market group and will maintain some of his coverage 
responsibilities.  Chris Foster will continue to manage the Middle Market 
group.

Subject: Re-Alignment

Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in=20
2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=
he=20
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=
e=20
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=
=20
and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=
=20
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=
e=20
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=
=20
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=
=20
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=
=20
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=
=20
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=
=20
our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=
nd=20
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=
=20
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=
e=20
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=
ls=20
in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are=20
being implemented:
a) East Power =01) a single East Power Team incorporating trading, mid-mark=

and origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Kevin Presto and=

Janet Dietrich who will report to the Enron Americas - Office of the Chairm=

offices which are managed by Rob Milnthorp and Max Yzaguirre respectively. =

Both Rob and Max will continue to report to the EA OOC.
d) U.S. Natural Gas =01) there are several changes anticipated in this busi=

consistent with the goals and objectives described above. The changes=20
primarily affect the East, Central, West and Texas gas regions. Each region=

Eastern, Western, Central and Texas gas markets.  The team will be=20
responsible for covering the LDC=01,s, muni=01,s/co-ops, industrials, IOU=
=01,s, IPP=01,s=20
and the producers.  There will be an increasing focus on the upstream side =
of=20
the business including the producers, transporters and storage providers in=

addition to market area opportunities. The team will utilize all of ENA=01,=

product capabilities including the gas commodity, assets and capital. Each =

these groups will report directly to the EA OOC;
East Gas =01) a single East Gas Team incorporating trading, mid-market and=

origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Scott Neal and Frank=

Vickers who will be returning from Portland to join this team. =20
West Gas  =01) in a similar manner, a West Gas Team will be formed co-manag=
ed by=20
Phillip Allen and Barry Tycholiz, who will be joining us in Houston from th=
e=20
Canadian team. The Denver office under Mark Whitt will be integrated under=
=20
this team.
Central Gas =01)  in a similar manner, a Central Gas Team will be formed=20
co-managed by Hunter Shively and Laura Luce. The Chicago office will be=20
integrated into this team.
Texas Gas =01) the Texas Gas Team will be managed by Tom Martin. This team =
will=20
continue to manage the gas trading business around HPL until the pending sa=
le=20
is concluded in Q2 2001.  After the sale of HPL, this team will build a Tex=
as=20
gas business without ownership of the HPL assets. =20
Financial =01) this group will continue to be managed by John Arnold with n=
o=20
significant changes.
Derivatives =01) this group, lead by Fred Lagrasta, will offer derivative a=
nd=20
financial mid-market products and services to the natural gas market=20
specifically targeting CFO=01,s and treasury departments.  Fred will contin=
ue to=20
maintain certain existing mid-market accounts with a number of producer and=
=20
industrial accounts where relationships are well formed. Otherwise,=20
mid-market coverage will gravitate to the regions. The New York office gas=
=20
marketing efforts will continue to be managed by Fred.
Upstream Products =01) this group, lead by Jean Mrha, will develop several=
=20
distinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market.  Thi=
s=20
group will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions.=
=20
This is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and=
=20
greater market penetration in the upstream segment.  These products include=
=20
producer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor=20
relationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor=20
services, wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital=20
products.  In addition, Jean will manage our Bridgeline joint venture with=
=20
Texaco. =20
Gas Structuring =01) this group will be lead by Ed McMichael, reporting to =
Frank=20
Vickers, will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams.
Gas Fundamentals =01) this group will be lead by Chris Gaskill, reporting t=
o=20
Hunter Shively, will provide fundamentals to all the gas teams.   =20

Julie Gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identifi=
ed=20
projects including long-term supply/demand analysis and, natural gas=20
transportation capacity trading opportunities.
=20
There is an expectation of some customer overlap between the gas and power=
=20
groups; for example, the combination utilities and the IPP=01,s.  The teams=
 will=20
coordinate with regard to the combination utilities like Con. Edison or=20
PG&E.  With regard to the IPP=01,s, to the extent that the product offering=
=20
involves an underlying power position, the power teams will manage. We have=
=20
asked Janet Dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two=20
organizations in Houston.=20

e) Technical/Restructuring - In the effort to consolidate and centralize ou=
r=20
technical resources (engineering, development, operations, pipeline) to=20
ensure that this skill base is available to all ENA groups and utilized=20
productively across the organization, Brian Redmond will form and manage th=
e=20
Technical Services Group.  This group will manage ENA=01,s technical risks =
and=20
will provide, on a cost basis, technical services for the entire ENA=20
organization. This group will manage the interface with EE&CC and OEC.  In=
=20
addition, the Restructuring Group, currently managed by Dick Lydecker, will=
=20
report to Brian Redmond.  This group is currently monetizing a large portio=
n=20
of the merchant investment portfolio given our current strategies.  This=20
group will have continuing responsibility to manage troubled commodity and=
=20
capital transactions that need considerable time and attention to manage ri=
sk=20
and monetize.=20

In addition to these responsibilities, Brian will manage the pending sale a=
nd=20
transition of the HPL asset over the next couple quarters as regulatory and=
=20
securities approvals are obtained in order to complete the sale.  Brian wil=
l=20
report to the EA OOC.

f) Principal Investing  =01)  with the departure of Jeff Donahue to new=20
opportunities in EBS, ENA=01,s venture capital function will be managed by=
=20
Michael L. Miller.  This group makes small investments in distributed=20
generation, power quality and technology companies that can benefit from=20
Enron=01,s distribution channels and expertise.  Michael will report to the=
 EA=20
OOC.

g) Corporate Development =01) Tim Detmering will assume the corporate=20
development responsibilities for ENA as Jeff transitions to his new role an=
d=20
will report to the EA OOC.

h) Generation Investments =01) there will be no changes to this group manag=
ed by=20
Dave Duran. Dave will continue to report to the EA OOC.

i) Energy Capital Resources =01) there will be no changes to this group=20
currently lead by C. John Thompson and Scott Josey.  John and Scott will=20
continue to report to the EA OOC.

As a final note in the interest of keeping things simple, Enron Americas wi=
ll=20
have two operating divisions  - Enron North America and Enron South America=
. =20
As a result, we will continue to conduct business under these two operating=
=20
companies; therefore, eliminating the need to change legal entities et al. =
=20
If you are currently a commercial employee of ENA or ESA you will continue =
to=20
conduct business in that company.=20

We look forward to another exciting year in the North American energy=20
market.  This is certainly a company unrivaled in the marketplace with the=
=20
most talented employees.  The opportunities are endless.  We wish you and=
=20
your family a very happy and safe holiday season.

FYI...

Kate, I believe you asked that short name changes not be done before 7:a.  
Whether that's your time or my time, I know I won't be doing them at that 
time.  :-)  It will more likely be around 10:a CST, and then I will send 
notification to Jeremy, Sanjeev and Oscar.  Just know that every Friday, 
short name changes will be made.   Give me a call if you have any concerns.

Happy Holidays!

Subject: ERMS Short Name Changes

Dear All,

This note is to summarise our meeting today regarding the timing and 
notification of changes to ERMS short names in GCP and ERMS. 

Timing
As discussed, the Credit Aggregation System requires that short names are in 
sync in GCP and ERMS.  As a result, we agreed to change ERMS short names in 
both systems every Friday morning and only at that time.

Notification
Notification of the need to change a short name in ERMS currently comes to 
ERMS IT from a variety of sources.  It was agreed that an effort would be 
made by GCP to centralise all requests in the formal Name Changes & Mergers 
Report.  Sanjeev/Oscar are to aid this effort by forwarding to Cheryl Johnson 
the names of people who currently bypass the Report and contact ERMS IT 
directly.

Please let me know if there are any comments on or additions to this summary.

Thanks, and happy holidays!

Kathryn

The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

We have negotiated procedures with the
California Attorney General's office allowing each of you to manage your
email and hard drive capacity while still preserving business information.


Starting today, please implement the
following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

(4) DATABASES: do not delete any information
in DATABASES.

(5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any
information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.

(6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not
delete any information.

(7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any
OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

(8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.


In our negotiations we have discovered no
reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the
Attorney General.  We will update you as we learn more.

Please respond promptly to this notice via
email an e-mail to me.  Your email should state that you understand and 
intend to comply
with the important business information retention policies stated above.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Good morning,
We have a note out on the proposed decision on PG&E Corp. and Edison 
International.

? On January 3, the ALJ issued a proposed decision on the purchased power 
undercollection emergency at PG&E Corp. and Edison International. A final 
decision will be issued on January 4.

? The proposal contains interim rate increases of 7%-15% for different 
customer classes. The surcharges would be subject to refunds and 
substantially lower than the 26% and 30% increases requested by PG&E Corp. 
and Edison International, respectively.

? The proposed rate increases would be effective for 90 days. During this 
time the CPUC would consider a more comprehensive audit of the utilities' 
financial condition.

? Significantly, the proposal rejects the utilities' request to end the rate 
freeze. The order would also order the utilities to credit TCBA 
overcollection to the TRA undercollection balance.

? Clearly, the risk of insolvency is much higher now. If passed, the order 
will fall far short of resolving the financial crisis facing PG&E Corp. and 
Edison International. Even if the utilities avoid bankruptcy, we now 
anticipate, more than ever, a tremendous amount of uncertainty concerning the 
economic value of these stocks.

Please call us with any questions you may have.
Regards,
Paul Patterson, 212-325-5876

I believe Melissa had talked to you about checking once again to see if these 
deals should be against the PX index.  It is our understanding that we are 
going to have to move everything that is against that index to another index 
at some point.

Thanks!

These deals were entered to flatten out the traders' positions in the PX. You 
shouldn't see the index being used on any deals past tomorrow (the exchange 
closes effective Feb. 1), but Bob Badeer and Matt Motley both had positions 
they needed to back out of. They turned around and bought the same amount at 
the Dow Jones index. Hope this helps!

Ditto.  These two are priced against the PX index also.

This deal lis entered against the PX index.  We have been told by Chris 
Foster that this index is going away.  Can you check and see if this is the 
correct index?

Kate, Melissa gave me the spreadsheet with all trades that need to be changed 
from Cal PX to Dow Jones SP/NP. After looking up the trades in Enpower these 
are the ones that have not been changed to reflect Dow Jones SP/NP. Could you 
please let me know when these might me changed? The ones in bold have been 
killed in Enpower.


Thanks,

Monica Lande also came up with a list of our outstanding deals with the PX. 
It contains most of the same deals that are found in your spreadsheet, and a 
few that aren't. Also, Bob Badeer has become the leader-by-default of this 
""project."" Let me know if you'd like me to talk with him about our progress 
or have him call you. I'm not sure how involved you are, or how involved 
you'd like me to be, but I thought I'd keep you up to date on the happenings 
over here. Again, please let me know how I can help.

Thanks,
Kate

Bob Badeer is handling the negotiations of the index changes, and he has 
assured me that all deals liquidating within this month have been updated.  
He is still working out the other deals.  If this is causing you any 
difficulty, please let me know.

Thanks,
Monica

Hi Bob, I was wondering if you have contacted Constellation about the 6 
trades that are in the system with the Cal Px as the index price.  All of 
these trades start flowing in July of this year.

The deal numbers are as follows:

453152.01
453175.01
453294.01
462109.01
471888.01
471889.01

Let me know if Constellation agrees to change these deals to the Dow Jones so 
I can send a letter for them to sign.

Thanks,
Melissa"

I just talked to Bob, and I don't know if he's responded yet, but I thought 
I'd fill you in anyway. He's been talking to his contact at Constellation 
about changing these deals over, but hasn't received a concrete answer yet. 
I've reminded him and he said he WILL talk to the guy and resolve it today. 
I'll keep on it, and let you know when these deals have been changed.

Thanks,
Kate

Hello, I hate to bug you with this.  Whenever you can spare a second would 
you ask Bob about this?  I am afraid it is going to slip through the cracks.

Thanks for your help!

Kate,

I was not aware that it was being faxed.  I found out that T Jae Black on the 
East Trading desk was faxing it.  I went ahead and contacted her to let her 
know that there was not necessary.  You should receive an updated Credit 
Watchlist every Monday.  Please email me if you don't receive it.

Thanks,
Veronica

Subject: Credit Watchlist Faxes

I was just told that we are being sent the Credit Watchlist Update via fax, 
in addition to the one you send me via e-mail every couple weeks or so. Since 
I already receive and print out the list for all of our traders and 
mid-marketers, I thought it might cut down on some work for someone if they 
didn't have to fax it to us as well. I don't know if that person is you, or 
if you might know who I can contact; in any case, Iwe don't need the 
watchlist faxed to the Portland office. (Anything to take one extra step out 
of the day, right?)

Please let me know if I should contact somebody else.

Thanks so much,
Kate

Just FYI - This should cut down on the paper trail a bit.

Kate,

I was not aware that it was being faxed.  I found out that T Jae Black on the 
East Trading desk was faxing it.  I went ahead and contacted her to let her 
know that there was not necessary.  You should receive an updated Credit 
Watchlist every Monday.  Please email me if you don't receive it.

Thanks,
Veronica

I was just told that we are being sent the Credit Watchlist Update via fax, 
in addition to the one you send me via e-mail every couple weeks or so. Since 
I already receive and print out the list for all of our traders and 
mid-marketers, I thought it might cut down on some work for someone if they 
didn't have to fax it to us as well. I don't know if that person is you, or 
if you might know who I can contact; in any case, Iwe don't need the 
watchlist faxed to the Portland office. (Anything to take one extra step out 
of the day, right?)

Please let me know if I should contact somebody else.

Thanks so much,
Kate

Effective 12/31/00, El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P., CP ID 72297 merged 
with and into El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P., CP ID 53350.  I have received 
copies of the Secretary of State certificate as well as the Certificate of 
Merger.  Today, I suspended the old record, so that new business will not 
attach to it.  Normally, notification would have been sent out on the 15th of 
the month, but since I have received phone calls, e-mails expressing 
concern,  and  copies of the documents from various groups (I appreciate 
it!), we thought it best to send notification now.  It will also appear on 
the next report.

Thanks,

Cheryl x3-3103"

I talked to Bill Williams and told him a quick (but not always perfect) way 
to see if it is the correct CP is to select the CP and then click on the Deal 
Clearing tab.  If there is a contract there or if you click on the arrow and 
a number is there, we have a K with that entity and it is the correct CP.  If 
it is blank under Global Contracts even after you click on the arrow, we do 
not have a contract with that entity and you have probably chosen the wrong 
CP.  I will also send him a list of entities we have Ks with, but he did not 
want them to have to look at a list.  Its probably a learning curve but at 
least this is a step in the right direction.  Let me know if you can think of 
other ways to help them.

Subject: Re: Incorrect Counterparties  

I've received some feedback from the Real Time group regarding these 
counterparty discrepancies. Apparently, they were never given notice of the 
correct counterparty names, and chose what seemed to be the most logical 
name. Can we come up with a system or master list of usable counterparty 
names for these guys to refer to when faced with an array of choices? (i.e. 
There are five different names under Transalta.) 

The concern lies with our daily correction report, which I generate and which 
includes all deals that have been changed and the name of the person who made 
the ""error."" This report can weigh unfairly against a trader who may be 
unaware of the difference between ""Dynegy Marketing & Trade"" and ""Dynegy 
Power Marketing."" I feel like there has to be a more efficient way to avoid 
these errors than publishing them in a report that gets sent throughout the 
company.

If you could help me compile this master list, or direct me to someone who 
can, I would greatly appreciate it. 

Thanks,
Kate

Due to the larger than normal volume of activity, the report is being 
distributed earlier this month.  The goal here is to give everyone more time 
to move deals and contracts on those records scheduled for inactivation on 
03/01/01.    You have received notification on the name changes as they have 
occurred.  

Please find attached the Name Change/Merger Notification Report for February 
15.  To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select Enable 
Macros and Read Only.
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Mar 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.  

As always, please contact me at x33103 with any questions or concerns."

Due to the larger than normal volume of activity, the report is being 
distributed earlier this month.  The goal here is to give everyone more time 
to move deals and contracts on those records scheduled for inactivation on 
03/01/01.    You have received notification on the name changes as they have 
occurred.  

Please find attached the Name Change/Merger Notification Report for February 
15.  To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select Enable 
Macros and Read Only.
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Mar 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.  

As always, please contact me at x33103 with any questions or concerns.

Due to the larger than normal volume of activity this month, the preliminary 
report was distributed early, on 02/09/01.  This is the FINAL report for 
February.   Please note that the changes, since the preliminary report, are 
on the ""February 01 Changes"" tab, and the detail is on the ""Feb 2001"" tab.   
You have received notification on the name changes as they have occurred.  

Please find attached the Name Change/Merger Notification Report for 
February.   To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select 
Enable Macros and Read Only.
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Mar 1
 Please adjust paper size to fit your needs

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:




Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.  

As always, please contact me at x33103 with any questions or concerns.

Please find attached the Name Change/Merger Notification Report for January.  
To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select Enable Macros 
and Read Only.
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Feb 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.  "

EPMI just signed an EEI with the Port of Oakland - in addition we did a 
monthly deal for March.

The deal is as follows:
EPMI sell 7 MW of power flat at NP-15 for the month of March.  The price is 
$208.  The contact is Wing Lau (phone number is 510-627-1457).

I will be out on Wednesday and would like to review the contract on Thursday 
- scheduling will need to get it into the system 

Please call me on my cell phone with any questions (503-807-0920).

Thanks!

Stewart

We are adding a new generator, Sierra Power Corp..  They are going to start 
scheduling in perhaps as few as a couple days but more likely next week.  
They are set up in EnPower (I checked).  Please confirm that we are all set 
to go from yor perspective.

Thanks!!

We have duplicate records in the system. 

Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, CP ID 55900, and

Deutsche Bank AG, CP ID 92230

Credit has verified that the correct legal name should be Deutsche Bank, AG.  
A record in that name was just created in GCP in Feb '01.  In order to 
preserve the history on the old record, and since one name is just an 
abbreviated form of the other, I will make the correction on the older 
record, 55900 to change it to ""AG"" and suspend the newer record, 92230, 
pending inactivation on 04/01/01.  This is not an overlay, so I wanted to 
provide some explanation in advance. 

Please note the overlays.  These changes were made in GCP today, with the 
noted exception.  The summary of those changes are on the ""Mar 01 Changes"" 
tab (refer to bottom left corner), to see the detail for those entries, see 
the ""Mar 2001"" bottom tab.

Shortname changes will be coordinated w/ ERMS IT on Friday, March 16.

Records will be inactivated on April 2, 2001.





Thanks,

Cheryl x33103"

Attached is the preliminary report for March, 2001.  Please note that there 
are overlays that were completed in the system TODAY, but most were completed 
prior to this distribution and notification was sent at the time the changes 
were made.

Please also note that I will be out of the office tomorrow, so I will make 
the shortname changes in GCP this evening, after 5:p.  ERMS IT will make its 
changes tomorrow morning, Friday, March 16.

Records will be inactivated on April 2, 2001. 

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.

Attached is the FINAL Name Change/Merger report for March 2001.  Please note 
that the most recent overlays are on top because unlike the others, prior 
notification has not been given.  These were just done last night and this 
morning.  For the complete report, go to the bottom tab, ""March 2001"".

The shortname changes will be coordinated with ERMS IT today, Fri, 03/23/01.

Records will be inactivated on Mon, April 2, 2001.

FYI - On the Feb 2001 report, there were several PG&E entities that went 
through name changes to El Paso entities.  There were also 3 TECO 
conversions.  We did not have the documentation to support those changes, as 
noted on the report.  As of 03/22/01, all documentation for those changes are 
in hand.

Regarding the Coastal/El Paso merger, the documents that support name changes 
as a result of that merger, have been received.  If you are interested in 
more details regarding the remaining entities, they are attached below.

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.  

Please call if there are questions or concerns.

Kate, 

I just spoke to DeeDee of Pinnacle West, we verballed deals and she said all 
deals should be under the Pinnacle West name unless for Bloomberg 
transactions.   Please review the following 

Mark Fischer
563906.01  non brokered > cp name should be Pinnacle West
563907.01  non brokered > cp name should be Pinnacle West

562226.01  Bloomberg, cp name should be Arizona Public Service.  (Evelyn 
inquired about this yesterday)

Thanks for your help!

Hello, I hate to bug you with this.  Whenever you can spare a second would 
you ask Bob about this?  I am afraid it is going to slip through the cracks.

Thanks for your help!

Subject: Constellation Cal Px trades

Hi Bob, I was wondering if you have contacted Constellation about the 6 
trades that are in the system with the Cal Px as the index price.  All of 
these trades start flowing in July of this year.

The deal numbers are as follows:

453152.01
453175.01
453294.01
462109.01
471888.01
471889.01

Let me know if Constellation agrees to change these deals to the Dow Jones so 
I can send a letter for them to sign.

Thanks,
Melissa

Hello Kate,
APS and Pinnacle...We ran into a problem checking out for the end of the 
month, because a few deals had Pinnacle in the system, but Bloomberg on the 
bro confirm.  We had to ch them to match the broker confirms, because APS 
showed the deals as APS on there side.  They are trying to segregate 
companies little by little.  We have been told by Rhonda, our contract 
administrator that trading under both names are legally correct, both are 
under WSPP.  

DeeDee from Pinnacle said all trades are with Pinnacle unless Bloomberg 
trade; then cp should be APS.  DeeDee said shortly all trades will be under 
Pinnacle, but did not give me a specific date.       

Please let the traders know that all trades should be with Pinnacle West, and 
APS that are transacted with Bloomberg.  No, we will not have problems 
recognizing the old name, Rhonda says they will just be assigned over to 
Pinnacle, but we will not have to revise confirms.  Hope this helps!
Thanks
Stephanie

563906 - changed to Pinnacle West
563907 - changed to Pinnacle West
562226 - changed to APS

Regarding the last deal, Mike Driscoll talked to his broker at Bloomberg last 
night and asked him to change their confirm to say Pinnacle West. The broker 
said he'd check on it, but that Bloomberg hadn't switched their contract over 
yet and he didn't know if they could check a deal out under the new name. So 
we left it, under the impression that Bloomberg was actually in the wrong. My 
question is - has APS switched over to Pinnacle West entirely, and when or if 
Bloomberg starts recognizing Pinnacle as the counterparty are we going to 
have problems with deals containing the old counterparty name? I'm just 
trying to clarify, so I can let the traders know what to expect. Thanks for 
your help.

Kate

Kate, I don't know if you've received any response, but new counterparty 
requests should be directed to the Global Counterparty group.  In this case, 
Sam Schott should be able to help you as he does requests for alpha S-Z.  
Bernice Rodriguez is his back up.  I set up Enron entities.

Thanks,

Cheryl x33103

Subject: New CTPY Name Request

Because I'm not quite sure who to direct this request to, I'm e-mailing 
everyone I think might be involved in entering new counterparty names. One of 
our mid-marketers has executed a deal with Sierra Pacific Holding Company, 
which is a new counterparty name and needs to be added as a choice in 
Enpower. Please let me know if I've contacted the correct people, and if I've 
contacted the incorrect people. (Sorry!)

Thanks,

Hello, I have sumitted a formal global counterparty request for this new 
counterparty.  I will let you know when it is set up.

Thanks,
Melissa

Subject: New CTPY Request

I just heard from Samuel (thanks for your message!) that I need to send 
Rhonda new counterparty information in order to get their names added to the 
system. I called Rhonda, but it turns out she's out of the office for the 
first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa. (That's a 
short explanation of why I'm sending this info. to all of you.)

Anyway, following is the information connected with the new counterparty name 
Chris Foster has requested:

Name: Sierra Pacific Holding Company, dba Sierra Pacific Industries
Address: PO Box 496028
    Redding, CA 96049
Or: 19759 Riverside Ave.
      Anderson, CA 96007
Phone: (530) 378-8179
Fax: (530) 378-8139
Contact: Director of Energy Resources - Robert Ellery

I also have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you'd 
like me to fax that over. Just let me know how I can help. We've already 
entered Chris's deal into the system with ""New Counterparty,"" so the sooner 
we can change that the better.

Thanks,
Kate

Attached is an inactivation of Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, L.P., CP ID 
93330 and an overlay of Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, Inc., CP ID 54292.   
Per the March 2001 report, this entity converted to a limited liability 
company.    We did not receive any documentation at that time.  Ten days 
later, it converted again to a limited partnership.  Per our normal 
procedures, a new record was created for the limited partnership.  The ""Inc"" 
record was to be inactivated on 04/02/01.  In the meantime, a legal opinion 
was issued to state that this should be treated as a name change and that an 
overlay should be done.  I have overlayed the ""Inc"" record with ""LP"", and the 
newly created LP record, CP ID 93330 will be inactivated.

Please find attached the FINAL Name Change/Merger Notification Report for 
January.  To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select 
""Enable Macros"" and ""Read Only"".   The Jan 01 Changes tab summarizes 
additions to the report since Jan. 15.  
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Feb 1

For more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.

Hello, Samuel Schott in Global Counterparty called this company and he was 
told that they should be set up in our system as Sierra Pacific Industries, 
Inc.  The contract has the long name on it so I am planning on asking Rhonda 
Denton about this tomorrow when she comes in.  I am not sure if it will work 
this way or not.  If you know anything else about this let me know.  Sierra 
Pacific Industries, Inc. is in Enpower but I am not certain if we should use 
that name.

I will let you know what Rhonda says tomorrow.  
Thanks,
Melissa

Subject: New CTPY Request

I just heard from Samuel (thanks for your message!) that I need to send 
Rhonda new counterparty information in order to get their names added to the 
system. I called Rhonda, but it turns out she's out of the office for the 
first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa. (That's a 
short explanation of why I'm sending this info. to all of you.)

Anyway, following is the information connected with the new counterparty name 
Chris Foster has requested:

Name: Sierra Pacific Holding Company, dba Sierra Pacific Industries
Address: PO Box 496028
    Redding, CA 96049
Or: 19759 Riverside Ave.
      Anderson, CA 96007
Phone: (530) 378-8179
Fax: (530) 378-8139
Contact: Director of Energy Resources - Robert Ellery

I also have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you'd 
like me to fax that over. Just let me know how I can help. We've already 
entered Chris's deal into the system with ""New Counterparty,"" so the sooner 
we can change that the better.

Thanks,
Kate

Hello Kate,

Sierra Pacific Industries, Inc. has been linked to EnPower.

Regarding the deal Chris Foster did on 4/6 with Sierra Pacific Holding Co. -

Bob Ellery, Sierra's Director of Energy Resources, and Steve Hall, one of 
Portland's most expeditious lawyers, have decided to execute the deal under 
the designation Sierra Pacific Industries, which is also named in the master 
agreement. We still, however, need this name added to the counterparty list 
in EnPower.

Thank you all for your help on this, and I appreciate your future assistance

Hello, Sierra Pacific Industries, Inc. is a choice in Enpower.  Is this the 
correct name with the ""Inc."" on it?  I am assuming that Steve Hall said it is 
OK to use the master agreement for this trade.

Thanks,

Subject: New CTPY Name Request

Because I'm not quite sure who to direct this request to, I'm e-mailing 
everyone I think might be involved in entering new counterparty names. One of 
our mid-marketers has executed a deal with Sierra Pacific Holding Company, 
which is a new counterparty name and needs to be added as a choice in 
Enpower. Please let me know if I've contacted the correct people, and if I've 
contacted the incorrect people. (Sorry!)

Thanks,

Subject: New CTPY Request

I just heard from Samuel (thanks for your message!) that I need to send 
Rhonda new counterparty information in order to get their names added to the 
system. I called Rhonda, but it turns out she's out of the office for the 
first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa. (That's a 
short explanation of why I'm sending this info. to all of you.)

Anyway, following is the information connected with the new counterparty name 
Chris Foster has requested:

Name: Sierra Pacific Holding Company, dba Sierra Pacific Industries
Address: PO Box 496028
    Redding, CA 96049
Or: 19759 Riverside Ave.
      Anderson, CA 96007
Phone: (530) 378-8179
Fax: (530) 378-8139
Contact: Director of Energy Resources - Robert Ellery

I also have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you'd 
like me to fax that over. Just let me know how I can help. We've already 
entered Chris's deal into the system with ""New Counterparty,"" so the sooner 
we can change that the better.

Thanks,
Kate

When the contract is fully executed, just forward it to me in interoffice 
mail.  I do have questions about the name that the contract has been written 
under and the name that the deals are under in Enpower.  Sierra Pacific 
Industries, Inc. is in global counterparty and the deals have been changed in 
Enpower to this CP.  The problem is that the contract and the confirms will 
not agree as to who is the correct CP.  We have always confirmed deals under 
the name of the entity with whom we have a contract.  Please let me know if 
the name will be changed on the contract to reflect the correct CP or will we 
amend the contract to add ""Inc."" to the end of the name and set up this dba 
in global counterparty.  I need to know before we can confirm these deals.

In additiona, Geir has entered a transmission deal for this CP.  578812.  
Should this be a buy/resale?

When we do not have a transmission contract with an entity, we usually do a 
buy/resale to cover the transmission over their system.

Sam, Please contact this CP (info on Kate's previous email) or find the dba 
information online with D&B or Lexis Nexis so that we can get the true 
lowdown on this name.  I don't think we should take the trader's information 
as gospel, for as you know, they are not always accurate.  Please let me know 
as soon as you get this information.  Thanks.

Subject: New CTPY Name - Sierra Pacific Industries

Looks like we might have to modify this name in EnPower after all - The dba 
on our master agreement is ""Sierra Pacific Industries"" with no ""Inc."" at the 
end. I just spoke with Bob Ellery over at Sierra, and he confirmed that, 
although the company is a corporation, they never use ""Inc."" in their 
contracts. Thus, our confirm letters would not match up with the master 
agreement because of those three pesky letters.

Just let me know if this causes a problem for either of you. In case you'd 
like to reference it, the deal number we're attempting to modify is 573679 - 
it's a buy from Sierra done by Chris Foster on the 10th of April. 

Thanks again for all your help.

According to Rhonda we never use BP Amoco however, she thinks the Calgary

Please note that the name change from FirstWorld Communications, Inc. to 
Verado Holdings, Inc. was just completed today 04/12/01.

Please find attached the Preliminary Name Change/Merger Notification Report 
for April.  To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select 
Enable Macros and Read Only.

Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on May 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.

Because of credit reasons, the name above will remain the name under the 
contract.  Global Counterparty has agreed to set up this dba as listed on the 
contract.  Once this CP has been set up, I will need the trades moved to this 
CP and the deals will need to be reconfirmed in the accurate name.  

If there are no objections, I will move the deals and instruct the confirm 
person to resend the confirms.  I will also move the contract to this new 
name.  Genia will prepare the amendment covering just the change in the 
credit provisions.

If Portland holds the fully executed original, please forward to me at your 
earliest convenience.  If you have any questions or further instructions, 
please contact me at X35871."

What about 573679, 579822, 579826 and the 2 transmission deals that are in 
Enpower?  I will change them as soon as Sam gets the CP set up if its okay 
with you.  Then I can tell Kim Hundle to resend the confirms.

Thanks for following up on this, Rhonda. I believe you just spoke with Chris 
about the executed original of this contract. Please let me know what else I 
can do to speed this process along. I ran a search for deals the West 
Services desk has done with this counterparty (which were entered with Sierra 
Pacific Industries, Inc.) and came up with only three deal numbers. They are:

580832
580137
580136

Would you like me to change these over? Or are you doing that along with the 
re-confirmation? Please let me know when you get a chance.

Thanks,
Kate

There were quite a few changes made yesterday.  Please see the attached 
notification report for the summary and detail.

IT TAGG - Please note that short name changes will come from the Jan 2001 
report AND Feb 2001 report.  I will begin making the changes tomorrow at 10:a 
as usual.

The font and page size for this report has been reduced but feel free to 
change the page set up as needed.  The reason the report is set up on A4 
paper is that A4 prints automatically anywhere in the world.  Legal paper 
isn't readily available everywhere, so this format is the best compromise.

Please find attached the Final Name Change/Merger Notification Report for 
April 2001.  To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select 
Enable Macros and Read Only.
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on May 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

  
Please call me with any questions or concerns.

To Everyone,

The following are revisions to the final report for April 2001.  I am 
providing details here, and the updated report is also attached.  

Tom Brown Resources Ltd., CP ID 96309 is the result of an amalgamation with 
Stellarton Energy Corporation, CP ID 64040.  Stellarton Energy Corporation 
will be inactivated on 05/01/01.  Have Certificate of Amalgamation and 
Articles of Amalgamation in hand.

Please also note that the Western Area Power Administration-""Upper Great 
Plain"" record, CP ID 81177, will be corrected to read ""Western Area Power 
Administration-""Upper Great Plains Region"".  The record that was overlayed 
per the report, CP ID 35194, will be inactivated as a duplicate record.  
These changes have been included on this revised report and the changes have 
been made in GCP today.  These are branch locations by geographic area of the 
US Dept. of Energy, and there is no documentation for these changes.

I have also just received a name correction that may as well be included in 
this report -
      From Greer Comm. of Public Works, CP ID 36393, to Commission of Public 
Works, City of Greer




Please call me with any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Cheryl x33103"

Rhonda Denton has just informed me that all deals according to Michele 
Chalmers with Pinnacle West  should be traded with the counterparty as 
Pinnacle West not Arizona Public Service.  No deals should be under Arizona 
Public just because Bloomberg is having problems or what ever re-doing the 
contract.   

From this day forward please tell all our guys to please choose Pinnacle West 
not Arizona regardless of what Bloomberg says.  If they have any questions 
please have them contact Rhonda Denton at 853-5871 or Michele 
Chalmers(Pinnacle West) at 602-250-3824.


Thanks!
Evelyn

These two deals are in as the wrong counterparty.  I am asking Rhonda to 
inactivate this name so he won't keep using it.  I think it is a real long, 
involved name starting with ""the"" rather than city of Oakland.  Go figure how 
someone alphabetizes!  Can you check into this.

This is a Tom Alonso deal; and it's for heavy load, and since 12/31 is a 
Sunday, the term will actually end on 12/30. I can change the end date in 
deal entry if that makes things less complicated; but either way the deal 
will end on the 30th. Please let me know.

This is actually deal #471975, which I just fixed because Jeff forgot to put 
the broker name in there. It is with Prebon.

I don't know if you saw my second e-mail, but I checked it out with Chris 
Mallory, who did the deal, and he verified the price at $214.95. If Prebon 
still disputes this, let me know and I'll have Mallory talk to Prebon.

Yes, Mike would like special language included in this deal's confirm letter. 
I spoke with him and a couple of the other traders, who said that they were 
aware of the change coming in April-02, but weren't aware they needed to 
enter comments in the deal. I'm sending an e-mail out to all of them to 
remind everyone to enter comments in deals that go past April-02 if they want 
special language.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Hi Kate,

This should have said $1,728 for August.  Sorry.  kyle

Cara, thanks.  All the deals look good.  However, if at all possible, we 
really need to have annuities to reflect each months activity.  In order for 
each months activity to be correctly booked into SAP, we need it divided out 
this way.  Right now it looks like we have $4,928 for September.  We need it 
to show $1600 for Spetember and July and $1,728 for July.  Thanks.  Kyle

The annuity amount is reflective of the charge for the entire deal, the date 
is just the day it was put in the system.  If you multiply the volume of leg 
1 by .05, the amount of the annuity is the result.

The AutoScheduling for the July pieces is now done.  

360937.1  for 7/1-7/31
360940.1  for 7/10 - 7/31

Diana, we really need to get these deals fixed this week.  Joy cannot 
checkout with PGET and I cannot check out with EES for July or August until 
these deals are fixed.  Just as a reminder, PGET needs to have the price 
zeroed out from July 1 forward.  EES needs to have the price zeroed out, 
except for the 5 cent offset, for July 1 forward.  Currently, July 1 - Aug 21 
still have prices in them.  We also need to have the 5 cent offset corrected 
for EES on our purchase side (the offset is going the worng way).  Please 
call me to let me know what we can do to ensure this change takes place this 
week.  Thank you.  Kyle 3-7579

We are long in Enpower for tomorrow due to a parking arrangement with EPE at 
PV.     We added this deal late,  so make sure that the EPE dispatcher knows 
of this late preschedule of energy to EPE.
We are long the following hours/mws:

He 7-10    3mw's
He 11-22     10mw's

The length is reflected on deal #476644 and this energy should be marketed 
hourly.    We need to communicate early with EPE and make sure that this goes 
as smoothly  as possible.     Once sold,  of course enter the sale( under ST 
SW book)  and route to the length.
This deal is completely ST SW in Enpower and we will share any profits with 
ST SW.

Thanks,
JMF

This deal is in ""Pending - revised after sent to Ctrpty"" status.  Some 
changes have been made to the deal, but it still has an SP-15 delivery point 
with Firm Energy.  Can you please find out whether it's the delivery pt. or

Subject: December 8th changes and needs for more

Geir and Bill,

OK,

At MidC we are -2 on LLH,  we also show a 2 mw buy from MPC at Hotsprings.  
If we used transmission for this, we need to put it in.  Did you use our 
existing Benton?

Then all that we will have left is 16 mw's open for HE 23-24 at MPC system,  
and 2 mw's for the same hours at Mid C (SCL deal)

I reduced the EPMICALPOOL deals by an equal amount, and that gets us balanced 
all the way.

Come to me first, and I can help you sort it out from there.  The only stuff

Thank you! 

The itemization was absolutely no problem, and please let me know when I can 
do things like that to make your job go more smoothly. I know the market got 
chaotic late yesterday; so I probably could have assumed that our net 
position would be off today and at least one other person would know that. 
But it seems that in this business, assumption can cause a small problem to 
breed and multiply into one of mammoth proportions down the line. So I 
thought I'd ask. In the future, is it you I should come to, or real time?

Thanks again for your help.

Kate

1. There is length at Montana System Border 2 mw HE 7-24.  The Smurfit is 
ramping down, and we will be Long PGE.  The deal # 477754.  Enpower says     
        Montana System,but it is really their generation length @ Colstrip.  
This is yours to toy with.




2. Also,  We have a length at PGE system  PGE Buy at system 
#478218            

The sale side of the buy/resale with Portland is PGE deal #478216   , sourced 
by the following:Benton Trans deal # 477768 HLH, 477770 LLH, and 
BPA(T)Deal@NOB # 406156, Export Deal 477678.
This length @ PGE system is yours to sell as well.

There is an hourly trader named Geir Solberg whose trades appear on our 
reports to be confirmed.  We go into each trade and change them to not to be 
confirmed.   The other hourly deals do not appear on these reports.  I think 
perhaps his defaults are not set correctly.  Can you check with him on this. 
I don't know why his are appearing on the reports and not other hourly deals.

Thanks!  "

Hi Kate,

Yes, these are deals 478198 and 478199. Both are entered under Natsource, and 
should be for Q1-01. 478199 was entered with the wrong price (165.05). It 
should be 164.95, and I'll change it when the Risk girls are done with their 
calc.

Hi Kate,
We had a deal with Hinson Power Company, Inc. yesterday that we ended up not 
confirming because the comments said that it was a buy-back of part of a 
one-off deal and that Legal would prepare a special confirm.  There are no 
comments entered for these deals that would indicate that they are the same 
type of deal.  Are they?  Should we prepare a confirm letter?
Thanks!

I show now two Smurfit Deals,

403522 for 25 flat, at 54.65,    and 246859.1 for 15  hlh, AND 25 hlh,   and 
246859 for 15 llh AND 25 llh.

I have zeroed out the 25's from 246859 in Scheduling, and we are flat now.  I 
did not change it in the deal because we were calcing, and I want to check 
with Diana first before doing it.

What I show in Scheduling is a sale to Smurfit for 40 mw flat, which is what 
is actually scheduled

Hi Kate, I just changed deal # 473100 from Monday through Friday to Monday 
through Saturday.  This deal was manually entered by us because it failed the 
EOL bridge.  When we manually entered it the wrong days were chosen.  I have 
fixed it and we will send a revised confirm to the counterparty.  I am not 
sure if you normally tell risk when you make a change.

Hello, I think that deal # 476147 might should have been entered as a buy 
resale instead of as transmission.  There are not any other transmission 
deals in the system with this counterparty.  If you would not mind looking 
into this and letting me know I would appreciate it.

Kate,

Geir is out of the office until Monday, I will change the counterparties in 
the deals for him.  If Houston asks again, you can let them know that it is 
taken care of.

Thank you for the heads up...

I talked to Diana Scholtes last night about this deal, and she looked at it 
this afternoon. She says the deal is definitely not entered correctly, but 
because it was done for the days when we got hit with transmission cuts, she 
wants to look into it a little further before she changes or kills it. She 
said she'd reconcile it tomorrow, and we'll let you know what we've done then.

Thanks for your patience,
Kate

Hello, I think that deal # 476147 might should have been entered as a buy 
resale instead of as transmission.  There are not any other transmission 
deals in the system with this counterparty.  If you would not mind looking 
into this and letting me know I would appreciate it.

Thanks!

Hey

Just for the record I would like to make clear that I did not enter these 
deals. Our new trader  uses my tradee id when I work with him.( He writes 
entered by ......   in the comment section. I will point out the mistake to 
him so we can make sure it does not happen again.

its okay, its not a big deal, i just wanted you to change it instead of me, 
just to be sure.  i am always usually in such a hurry when i talk to you.  
but, since it has slowed down a bit......i wanted to let you know you are 
doing a wonderful job, and you really are a pleasure to work with.  again i 
am sorry if it seems like i am always in a rush, just tell me to chill out.  
but, thanks for being so great.  i will pass that on to the traders when i 
get a chance!

Since it is a sleeve with EES, I receive all there daily spreadsheets, I will 
check there and see what date it is under.  We'll hold up and I will let you 
know.  Thanks

Subject: Re: Deal 474440.01  

This deal was a sleeve done for EES, and we've had problems with the trade 
dates on these before. EES reported this trade to us on 12/6/00, and it was 
Matt Motley's understanding that the trade was executed the previous day. He 
doesn't care either way, but he suggested you talk to someone at EES - maybe 
Jubran Whalan or Neil Bresnan - about what their intent was with the date.

In the meantime, I can change the date to 12/4 if you'd like. What would be 
best? E-mail or call and let me know.

Thanks a lot!

Whatever you changed on this deal, it now reads that it flows 32 hours a 
day!  You have five strips in, each flowing for 16 hours.

Also, when you change a deal, if you could make small note about what you 
changed in the comment section of deal entry, if really makes things go 
faster.  We know what change to look for when we make the revision.

Let me know when it is fixed.

been told that one or the other of them will be in today, and I'll find out

Happy Holidays!

We have a few problems with deals with EES.  We have tried to get them 
straightened out here, but I think it has come to the traders duking it out.  
Our contact at EES, Judy Dyer has checked these deals with her traders and 
they won't come around to our way of thinking on these deals.

Deal #481619 should be $145.00 even.  The trader says the deal was done 
direct and they are not paying the 5 cent charge

Deal # 480433 should be killed.

Deal # 481620 is not input correctly.  This is another one where the hours 
have been duplicated.  The first strip and the last strip repeat 10/29 for 
the same hours.  This makes the total Mws on the deal doubled by the amount 
that flows that day which is 400.

Thanks and you have a Merry Christmas, ya' hear!"

They just had it as 12/5/00 in the system and with the deal being done 
direct, it is tough to have proof from my end when the deal was done.   Is 
this okay?  We just ensure the trade dates match up so it will ease the end 
of month check out, to make sure there was not more then one deal out there 
that it could be confused with.  But the deal on our end was done on 12/6/00 
correct?

Apparently, these are deals we entered in an attempt to cancel an existing 
contract with Hinson - so they are not actual purchases of power, which I 
believe is where the confusion over the confirm letters began. Christian is 
working on the legal aspect of how best to confirm these ""deals,"" but as is 
so often the case with these guys (and especially around the holidays), they 
slipped out of the office before giving me an answer. So we'll get this done 
tomorrow morning. I'm sorry for the delay!

You're on the job girl!  I just got your email.  Don't worry about all the 
errors, if they didn't make mistakes, we wouldn't have a job, and it's no 
worse now than it's ever been.  But you are very responsive and fun to work 
with -that makes all the difference!  Just a little positivity (can't have

I just changed both of these deals to CAISO energy, instead of Firm. I

I checked the other side of it, deal #481621, and sure enough it also had the

You're on the job girl!  I just got your email.  Don't worry about all the 
errors, if they didn't make mistakes, we wouldn't have a job, and it's no 
worse now than it's ever been.  But you are very responsive and fun to work 
with -that makes all the difference!  Just a little positivity (can't have 
too much of that!)

I just changed both of these deals to CAISO energy, instead of Firm. I 
noticed that the one you asked about, #481620, was part of an EES sleeve, so 
I checked the other side of it, deal #481621, and sure enough it also had the

Kate, 
I called earlier to check out with Prebon, of course all the West guys were 
gone to checkout, I spoke to a broker on the NY desk.
Please check the price of deal 
484076.01 (Mark Fischer)   $325.00  (broker thought price looked like 330.00)
484077.01                                $350.00

Mark's got the price in for deal #484076 as $325. He's gone now, but I 
checked with Tom Alonso, who also trades on the Short Term Southwest desk, 
and he said it's definitely 325. Let me know if the broker still disputes 
this. As for 484077, it's in the system as $350 - is that correct?

This deal is coded not to be confirmed, but it flows longer than 6 days which 
is the criteria for creating confirmations.  Can you check with the trader, 
and if it should be confirmed, get a contact and let me know.

hey kate,

if this is not taken care of, would you mind following up on it.  
constellation called and is inquiring on a deal that goes with deal 459996 
done through prebon.  there should be another done around dec 1 with no 
broker, buy constellation, jan 01, 100 mw, np 15, index + 3.00.  this deal is 
not in the system as far as i know.  i spoke with chris mallory about this 
situation and i have not heard from him yet.  so that is why i am emailing 
you, i will be out until jan 2, and i just wanted to make sure someone 
follows up on it.  (i think it should be jeff richters deal, but he is out 
also).

my contact at constellation is tom moleatt, 410-468-3620.  i am also copying 
stephanie on this, so she can be your contact here.  hope it is not too 
confusing, but chris knows about this, unless it will already be taken care 
of by the time you return.

thanks!"

There are two deals for Avista the are marked not to be confirmed.  Can you 
check into these, and if they are not to be confirmed, put a little note as 
to why or who said not to confirm them, so 6 months from now when someone 
says ""Why didn't you confirm this deal!""  I'll have something to jog my

Hi Kate,
This deal needs to be changed to no confirm (it's a West daily deal).  Also, 
it has an NP-15 delivery point with firm energy.
Thanks!

12/20; but I wanted to check with you before changing it. Let me know.

hey kate,

if this is not taken care of, would you mind following up on it.  
constellation called and is inquiring on a deal that goes with deal 459996 
done through prebon.  there should be another done around dec 1 with no 
broker, buy constellation, jan 01, 100 mw, np 15, index + 3.00.  this deal is 
not in the system as far as i know.  i spoke with chris mallory about this 
situation and i have not heard from him yet.  so that is why i am emailing 
you, i will be out until jan 2, and i just wanted to make sure someone 
follows up on it.  (i think it should be jeff richters deal, but he is out 
also).

my contact at constellation is tom moleatt, 410-468-3620.  i am also copying 
stephanie on this, so she can be your contact here.  hope it is not too 
confusing, but chris knows about this, unless it will already be taken care 
of by the time you return.

thanks!

Yes, please change to be confirmed.  The only thing you might need to do is 
tell the schedulers because you might get a message that warns that you will 
unroute this deal.  They just need to know about it.  Let me know.

This was Stan Cocke's deal, and since he just transferred into mid-marketing 
from real time, he's not used to putting the confimation request into his 
deals. This should be confirmed; but since the deal has already flowed, I 
wanted to check with you before changing anything. Please let me know.

This deal is coded not to be confirmed, but it flows longer than 6 days which 
is the criteria for creating confirmations.  Can you check with the trader, 
and if it should be confirmed, get a contact and let me know.

This deal is part of a sleeve - we bought Powerex at 145.00 and sold EES at 
145.05. This is standard procedure for these kinds of deals, said the guys at 
the Long Term Northwest desk. They're positive that the deal should include a 
5-cent charge on the sale side; and Mike Driscoll said if EES still disputes 
this, they can call him to verify.

Please let me know if this deal continues to be a problem.

And if it's at all possible to get the traders names from the brokers when 
they have missing deals, that would be wonderful. I can usually guess by 
using the information given, but sometimes the traders get busy and aren't 
exactly happy about being bugged for missing deals that aren't theirs. I'm 
not sure how it works, but Carla told me the brokers should give you all the 
information at their disposal. If they don't, or won't, let me know and I'll 
have our traders talk to them.

Hey Kate! I have a trade that Motley did and it shows as a desk to desk 
trade. But BPA sent me a confirmation on the trade. Is this suppose to be 
desk to desk or should the counterparty actually be BPA?

Thanks,

Kimberly Indelicato

Hi Kate,
A few quesions about this one.  Why is it no confirm?  Why is it entered so 
funny (instead of just entering off-peak hours, it was entered strip by strip 
for sundays, which makes it come over really strange on the confirm.) It's 
not necessarily wrong, but whoever entered it needs to know that there's a 
much easier way to enter off-peak deals.  And finally, who is the contact?
Thanks so much for your help!  Hope you had a great weekend!

Kate, 
I received a call from Tricia Allen of Tacoma, and she was inquiring about 
two deals that happened yesterday:  Deal 491893.01, she agrees with
Deal 491916.01 she does not agree with  
I left her a message that they showed as good deals in our system and she 
called back and said she does not agree with Deal 491916.01.   Can you check 
with Sean Crandall and have the two traders talk. 
Thanks

confirmations states: 

The average day ahead, post congestion price for the Constrained Price as 
published by the California Power Exchange for the on in the period of 
delivery stated herein plus 3.00.

Thanks! I handed off the fax to Christian, who said he was extremely busy 
today but would try to get to it this afternoon. In the meantime, I've been 
told by Chris Mallory that the most important issue is that all 
index-forwards get uniform confirmation language. As far as what that 
language is, I'm not sure. Is this different than the confirm letters you've 
received in the past? Let me know if you need me to expedite the process and 
get someone else's opinion.

Thanks,
Kate

Sharen,

This price is 29.9 for 287238,  The corresponding deal is 287289 and that 
price has been changed to 29.95 to reflect the .05 cents we are charging EES 
to do this exchange.

As for 487052, I have down here on my list that 487050 is the corresponding 
deal.   I gave the list we had to Kate Symes,  It seems that Bob had 
decreased a few of the buy prices by .05 cents and increased the sell side to 
the original deal price to collect the .05 cent for epmi. 

Please contact Kate with further inquiries.  She will check into this.

According to the audit viewer, you entered this deal.  It is part of the PGET 
acquisition.  The documentation we have on this deal indicates the price 
should be 29.90.  

Also, we have documentation that indicates there should be another deal that 
matches the terms of #487052, but I thought it should be with PGET.  Number 
487052 is with EES.

Can you check into these and let me know.

Kate, 
Pwx called this mroning to verbal a deal that  was sleeved with EES.  I do 
not see it in system, although I see the deal on EES spreadsheet that I 
receive daily.
the deal is Enron Buys Pwx   Q4 2001 25mws   255.00  done direct  trade date 
1/8/01  Matt Motley trader
then Enron Sell EES  Q4 2001  25mws   $255.05

Should this be in the system and if so do you have deal numbers on the 
above.  I believe we sleeved the deal for EES and Pwx.

Kate, 
Pwx called this mroning to verbal a deal that  was sleeved with EES.  I do 
not see it in system, although I see the deal on EES spreadsheet that I 
receive daily.
the deal is Enron Buys Pwx   Q4 2001 25mws   255.00  done direct  trade date 
1/8/01  Matt Motley trader
then Enron Sell EES  Q4 2001  25mws   $255.05

Should this be in the system and if so do you have deal numbers on the 
above.  I believe we sleeved the deal for EES and Pwx.

Matt doesn't have any trade like this for 1/8. I spoke with Judy at EES, and 
she's going to have Jubran call Matt to duke it out over whether or not this 
is a good trade. I'll let you know what those guys decide.

Hey Kate! I received a BPA trade that Mike/Greg did and under Special 
Provisions on their confirmation it reads:

This is a remarket of Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Company power. KAC's 
point-to-point transmission agreement will be utilized. KAC's scheduling 
agent may request changes to the delivery point(s) under alternate point of 
delivery capabilities associated with KAC's transmission agreement. BPA shall 
accommodate the scheduling of such changes.

Is this language o.k. ?

This is to summarize our previous discussion:

EPMI took an assignment of ALL EEMC's (an affiliate of EES) deals with PG&E 
Energy Trading  - Power, L.P. (PGET) whereby EPMI is now buying all of the 
power from PGET.
EPMI then acts as ""sleeve"" for EES and sells the power to EES with a $.05 
sleeve fee
With respect to the specific EEMC deal # ACW672, EEMC originally was buying 
75MW from PGET at a price of $29.90.
After taking over EEMC's portfolio, EPMI, PGET and Avista Energy entered into 
a 3-party assignment, assumption and settlement agreement whereby EPMI and 
AvistaEnergy ""took out"" PGET of the picture for 50MW of the 75MW piece.
By doing so, EPMI thus is buying 50MW from Avista Energy and the remaining 
25MW still from PGET
The new 50MW piece from Avista Energy results in a purchase price of $29.80 
and a sale price of $29.85 to EES.  [the reason for the price decrease is 
because when we entered into the 3-party agreement, in order to ""take out"" 
PGET we had to pay them their profit in that deal stream ie monetizing their 
spread of $.10 per MW]
The remaining 25MW piece from PGET kept the SAME PRICING of $29.90 since we 
left that 25MW block alone.

If you have any additional questions, please call me.

Thanks! I handed off the fax to Christian, who said he was extremely busy 
today but would try to get to it this afternoon. In the meantime, I've been 
told by Chris Mallory that the most important issue is that all 
index-forwards get uniform confirmation language. As far as what that 
language is, I'm not sure. Is this different than the confirm letters you've 
received in the past? Let me know if you need me to expedite the process and 
get someone else's opinion.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate,
I received and index trade into NP15 that Chris Mallory did. For Price the 
confirmations states: 

The average day ahead, post congestion price for the Constrained Price as 
published by the California Power Exchange for the on in the period of 
delivery stated herein plus 3.00.

Is this language o.k. to accept on the confirmation.

Thanks,

This is an automated function of Deal Blotter. I have called Will Smith to 
let him know it's malfunctioning; but all deals not using NP15, SP15, or ZP26

For Ref 499391 I don't think this is a good deal because Prebon only shows 
one off-peak deal like this and it is our reference 499390.

Kate, I have a couple of confirms I received from BPA with the following 
info. I spoke with BPA and they said that their trader had talked to Sean 
Crandall and agreed to Mid Columbia as the Delivery point, however in the 
Enpower they have Northwest Delivered. Could you please check into:

#492613.01, 492612.01, 492611.01, 488524.01, 488523.01 These all say NW in 
the system but BPA has Mid C on confirm

#491609.01 This trade has a trade date of 1/8/01. But on BPA's confirm they 
have a trade date of 1/5/01. Could you ask Mike who did the trade which is 
correct?

Thanks,

Kimberly"

trader and get him to enter names.  The confirmation has to have a contact

2001

Enron Sells Southern California Edison

jan 10-31, 2001

We received an executed confirmation letter from the cp but the deal number 
is not avaliable (the fax machine cut off the deal number)  {just collecting 
all the confirms for the California situation.}

the deal numbers I have located are 492137.01, 492152.01

Mike Swerzbin is going to contact the trader at SCEM - these are good deals. 
They were originally done on EOL, then changed to direct trades. Once they 
talk, I'll get back to you and let you know if they decided to keep or kill 
the deals.

This is the deal that was originally in as not to be confirmed and was 
changed to be confirmed.  Well, I have confirmed twice because it keeps going 
into pending status.   The auditor indictes that carla is going into the deal 
and changing something that causes it to go into pending.  Can you check into 
this and find out what she is changing, if we need to keep sending revised 
confirmations, wha'sssss uuup with this deal?

If you would put a note in the comment section in deal entry, that would be 
great.

Sorry for the delay - it's taken me a while to track down the answer to this, 
because Chris Foster, the trader on this deal, is still unclear as to the 
answer. Basically, the deal keeps getting cut by the Cal-ISO, which is why 
Carla goes in and changes the volumes sometimes. But Chris thinks that in the 
end we might not be cutting the deal financially, just physically on a 
day-by-day basis. Given that, we only need the first, original confirm sent 
out - if revised confirms have been sent, let's go ahead and send them the 
original one and leave it at that. 

Chris Foster said he would get back with me this afternoon - he's meeting 
with Real Time and Schedulers right now to sort out this issue.  I apologize 
that this wasn't more clear before. Should I add a note in the comments 
section of this deal to clarify? Or should I just check the deal back to ""no 
confirm""? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

This is the original confirmation letter we sent out.



Unfortunately, before I found out anything about all this, I sent out a 
revised confirmation when the deal was changed and went into a pending 
status.  This is the revised confirmation letter that went out.



These are the only two that have been sent to the counterparty.  I have put a 
note into the TAGG system that should let us know not to send another revised 
confirmation.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks for the phone list.  Kimberly Hundl is soooo jealous!"

These two deals are entered with a special counterparty name that looks like 
it may have been set up for some special deal.  There is another counterparty

If it doesn't make any difference, I will change these to the other CP name.  
This one is not attached to templates and would need some database changes to 
prepare a confirmation under this name.  If this is not ok, let me know.

I checked with Heather, and it turns out this second NCPA counterparty 
shortname was set up to distinguish between two different SC numbers. But 
it's only for internal use - both counterparty names have the same billing 
information, etc. So Heather said the deals are fine as they are. I'm going 
to find out more about this after the afternoon rush dies down - just so 
we'll know for the future when to use which shortname.

I have changed the Index Multiplier for all of the days in January.  The days 
that were not at a mulitplier of 1.05 have been changed to that amount. Also, 
there was no deal in for 1/9, and 2 identical deals for 1/10.  I modified one 
of the 1/10 days to the 1/9 amount.

I will begin autoscheduling these shortly so the price will show.

Judy at EES has different totals for these two deals.  For #498865 at NP15, 
she has total volume of 13,319.  For #497869 at SP15 she has a total volume 
of 8516.6.  Do you know of any reason that these total volumes would be 
different than what EES is showing?

Broker is right - deal has been changed.

By the way, I checked out audit viewer on deal 505066, and it showed that I 
had changed the deal from Amerex to APB yesterday afternoon. It didn't show 
any other changed after that - so I've put a call into Duong Luu to figure 
out why the change didn't save, or why it defaulted back. Just FYI.

Kate,  

A request (below) has been made to fix a deal that was entered by Tom and 
Mark incorrectly (through the option exercise function in deal blotter).  The 
deal numbers and legs that need to be fixed are listed below.  Instead of 
being a forward transaction, these legs should be entered as index forwards.  
We are paying the DJ PV index plus $5 or 5%, whichever is more.  Therefore, 
if daily prices were more than $100 at palo verde, the offset should be 1.05.

I know that i have totally confused you but let me know of any questions you 
might have and I will be glad to help.

Thanks,

Kim

Caroline,

Deal #420886 legs 3-7 have no price attached to the deal.  Would you please
add the DJPV index plus an offset of 5%.  On legs 2 & 8 the offset needs to
be changed from $5.00 to 5%.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank You,
Katrina

Sorry for the slow reaction time - this is the contact information Greg Wolfe 
gave me, and he Sean Crandall confirmed that (he was in the midst of putting 
a Conoco deal in the system). As for why it was taken out of the GCP system, 
I have no idea. If you know of anyone around here who would have called for 
that to be de-activated, let me know. Otherwise, our traders still know Jack 
Wells as the contact. Hope that helps.

Are these two deals part of the original Conoco deal # 347356 that they are 
extending or something different?  We need to know because we have to add 
something in the confirmation if they are extensions of the original deal.  
Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?

Sorry, I didn't see these deals when I sent the first email.  Kimberly Hundl 
had sent you a note about the contact.  Are these deals like the other two 
deals, and should be confirmed totally separately from the deal #347356.  
Sorry to be so difficult, but we get into trouble everytime we confirm a 
Conoco deal because of the special language that needs to be included on 
deals that are part of #347356, and we never get any notes that tell us 
whether or not it is part of the extension of the original deal.

Thanks!

According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal 
was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just 
buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only 
connection. Let me know if you need more of an explanation from the traders, 
but our take is that these deals are separate.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Deal 507430 and 507417

Are these two deals part of the original Conoco deal # 347356 that they are 
extending or something different?  We need to know because we have to add 
something in the confirmation if they are extensions of the original deal.  
Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?

Thanks!

Kate, I think these trades are suppose to be FPL Energy Power Marketing in 
Enpower. Currently they are in as Florida Power & Light. I received 
confirmations from FPL Energy Power Marketing. Could you please talk to 
Mallory about the counterparty name.

Thanks!"

Those are east trades and you probably don't have access to them.  I just 
bundled west and east so you can ignore them.

No, that's fine. But because of the new global standards, we're required to 
produce and report all corrections made on west power deals each day. So I 
was looking into these deals to get trader names, terms, etc., but 3 of them 
wouldn't pull up. 507901, 506767, and 507900 don't seem to be in the system. 
Are these the correct deal numbers? Let me know when you get a chance.

the end date at the top of the screen in Deal Entry and the one listed in the

This probably happened because he is a daily or hourly trader and in the past 
we have not seen these deals to see the notes to add the contacts.  With the 
change in the criteria for confirmation, we will now view these deals and add 
the contacts as they come across.  If anyone has a list of contacts they want 
added, please send the names and the company name and we will put them into 
the system.

Subject: Re: contacts  

I forwarded this e-mail on to all our traders to give them a heads up about 
the new process. I did receive feedback from one trader, Mark Fischer, who 
said that when he began with Enron he was always told that if a contact name 
was not in the system that he was supposed to enter it into the comments 
section. He did this diligently under the pretense that eventually these 
names would be added to the system, but they apparently never were. He wanted 
to let me know of this, especially because when the traders are hurriedly 
entering deals, they probably won't always take the time to type in the 
contact name in the comments section.

Let's see if we can update this list somehow. Let me know who I can contact 
for this or how we can set this up.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: contacts

Currently, we do not confirm west deals that flow 6 days or less so we have 
not had to be real difficult about contact names in deal entry.  However, 
starting February 1, we are going to confirm all next day deals in the west 
using the same criteria we do in the east - that is - deals 3 days or less 
are sent on a confirmation that does not require a signature and everthing 
else on a letter requiring a signature.  Hourly deals will not be confirmed.  
So it is very important that the traders fill in a contact name when they are 
entering deals.  The confirmation letter cannot be prepared without a contact 
name.  It stops the whole process.  We are not going to be able to put names 
in every time they do not.  

If they do not see the contact they want in the drop down list,  put the 
correctly spelled first and last name in the comment section in deal entry 
and we will add this contact to the list and it should appear the next day.

If you can help us out with this, maybe we won't have to keep asking you for 
contacts.

Thanks!

Kate, that would be me. I need to see if the New Counterparty is the State of 
California Dept. of Water Resources or if the counterparty name in Enpower is 
correct: California Dept. of Water Resources. If it is the second one then we 
can choose the CP in Enpower. If it is the first one then we need to set them 
up in Global. This is Kerri Thompsons broker. I am also copying her so she is 
kept in the loop. Please let me know.

These two deals do not have contacts but are coded to be confirmed.  Can you 
check and see if she does want them to be confirmed and if so, please add 
contacts.

We are still planning on confirming the daily deals in the west, but we have 
run into system problems so we have pushed the start date back a little.  
I'll let you know when we have a definite date.

Kate:

As we've discussed, the switch from PX to DJ index still seems problematic 
for deal # 404980 (the original deal).  Please double check the deal entry in 
the new deals you've created (#512726.1 and #512743.1) to substitute the 
original one, and let us know how things are going asap so we can correct our 
distorted P&L report.

This deal was entered as New Counterparty which is fine for a short period of 
time.  However, within a few days someone needs to make sure to change the 
deal to the correct counterparty name.  Can you look into this and let me 
know?

To all:

I ran a minibook valuing the Merced correction (as of yesterday's curves), 
and confirmed that the LTNW book will lose approximately $6.8MM in value 
after the calc today.  This reverses the $7MM gain that was incorrectly shown 
in the LTNW book on yesterday's DPR.  Please let me know if there are any 
questions.

Thanks,

Sharen,
I saw that there was a note on this deal that Legal prepared the confirmation 
and Holli Krebs sent it to the counterparty herself.  Can you obtain a copy 
of what they sent for our files.  There is nothing in Livelink and if we 
would ever need to reproduce the document we would have nothing.  Also, it 
shows that it has not been singned unless Portland has a signed copy.

Kim

This deal was entered as New Counterparty which is fine for a short period of 
time.  However, within a few days someone needs to make sure to change the 
deal to the correct counterparty name.  Can you look into this and let me 
know?

Thanks!

For deal 515363 traded yesterday, Matt has the cp as Sierra Pacific however, 
Prebon has Nevada Power Company.

Kate, please ask Sean Crandell if the following deals need the ""special 
phrase"" ..The Parties agree and acknowledge that this Transaction is 
connected with the transaction referenced in Deal No. 347356.1 entered into 
between the Parties on May 31, 2001.

Jack Wells of Conoco called and said that the phrase should be included in 
confirmations: 506549.01..506550.01..506551.01 and 507417.01 and 507430.01.  
Please ask trader if deals are related to the 347356.01.  Sharen has inquired 
once before and we were under the impression that the deals were separate and 
not included.  Please let us know.

Thanks

Jack Wells is the contact for both - I've added his name to deal #507417. 
According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal 
was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just 
buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only 
connection. Let me know if you need more of an explanation from the traders, 
but our take is that these deals are separate.

Thanks,
Kate

Are these two deals part of the original Conoco deal # 347356 that they are 
extending or something different?  We need to know because we have to add 
something in the confirmation if they are extensions of the original deal.  
Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?

Thanks!

Hi Kate,

I think Mike traded  deal 516618 late because I did not confirm this deal 
with Prebon yesterday.
Prebon shows 16mw and Enpower has 10mw.

It looks like you made quite a few changes to some deals and I don't see 
anything in the comment section.  Can you just take a quick look and see if 
you know what you changed on any of these.  If not, I can look it up in the

All the rest of the deals I entered for Mike Swerzbin yesterday in my deal 
blotter, which defaults to Short Term California. I noticed immediately after 
saving the deals that they were under the wrong desk, and changed them to 
Long Term Northwest in deal entry. Are there other problems with the deals? 
The only change should be the desk. Please let me know.

Mike still has not returned my calls, and is not at work today. I checked 
with Mike Driscoll, Swerzbin's assistant, and he confirmed that 517876 should 
be $300. It's an EES spread, and the other side (deal #517877)  is $313 - is 
that what Amerex is looking for? He also checked into 517891 and found that 
the delivery point should be SP-15. It's been changed.

Let me know if there are further questions.

Thanks,
Kate

If its just an internal move, then it doesn't get paid as far as I 
understand.  Its an internal thing.  Thanks for the info.  Unify is the 
system that creates our invoices.

These ARE a kind of desk-to-desk deal, but officially they are 
cross-portfolio deals, because they cross from the ENAEXEC to WEST portfolio. 
I'm not familiar with Unity, but let me check around here and see if anyone 
knows where these deals should be settled. Also let me know if the fact that 
they are cross-portfolio deals helps you at all. That's all I know right now.

Hello
I have a question, should the Counterparty on this trade be Peco Energy?
We have Constellation but bro does not know trade as Constellation

Tom Alonso's name is on bro confirm (Peco) but deal 459243.01 is under Mark 
Fischer (COnstellation)

Thanks

Kate, I think Tom Alonso entered this trade under the wrong counterparty. I 
think it should be FPL Energy Power Marketing instead of Florida Power and 
Light. I received a confirm from FPL Energy Marketing for this trade. Can you 
as Tom and then change in system if I am correct.

Thanks for your help!"

Kate, called to verball non broker deal,
I didn't realize Diana and Valerie are working on this with Sharen here in 
the Houston office.  I gave him the expiry date of 6/29/01, he inquired why 
it was an expiry date, he thought it was exercised upon daily, just double 
checking..........just fyi

This deal looks to me like it needs to be confirmed, but it was marked no 
confirm.  Do you know of a reason why it shouldn't be confirmed?  If not, I 
need a contact name so that i can send out a letter on it.
Thanks!

Hi Kate, Deal # 509086.01 is still in the system at the PX index instead of 
the Dow Jones SP-15 index.  This trade was done on January 30, 2001.  We just 
received the new index language from Steve Hall in Portland.  I was going to 
confirm this trade but it has the old index.  There is another deal done the 
same day that has been changed (509087) to the new index.  I know some of the 
deals that are not flowing have not been changed because Bob Badeer is still 
negotiating with the counterparties.  Is this one that can be changed since 
it started flowing Feb 1?

Let me know,

Thanks,
Melissa"

Kate,

I understand that the deals are not actually flowing on Sunday but for 
auditing/reporting purposes per Melissa Murphy, these deals need to display 
the correct term of 2/17 only instead of 2/17-2/18.

The deals are:  523881, 523882, 523877, 523875, 523876, 523879, 523880, 
523883, and 523884



Thanks!!

1. Because 2/18 is a Sunday and this is an off-peak deal, no hours will be 
counted for 2/18. If you need me to change the term anyway, I can. Let me 
know.
2. The rest of these deals traded on Bloomberg after Jeff Richter and Chris 
Mallory left for a power marketing conference. This caused many problems, as 
you can see. Following are the added or corrected deals: 

  1) 523831 - changed from Dynegy to Reliant - corrected
  2) 524481 - buy Duke/March-01/NP/265.00] - added
  3) 524482 - same terms - added

Let me know if you have any further discrepancies with these deals.

Thanks,
Kate

Can you have Matt Call Prebon on this deal?  It has been a very hectic 
morning!!

Please let me know the outcome.

Matt Motley - 524308 in trade log as buy Aquila/May-01/25 mw/Prebon at 
$260.00 - Matt is tied up in conference right now, but judging from the other 
May deals in his blotter and from his curves, this price is correct. $160 is 
about $100 less than anything else trading at that time. Ask Prebon where 
they got that from..

Let's start over: 


ISSUE 1-Mike Swerzbin
deal 524248 and deal 524266
This two deals checkout with Amerex fine.  Amerex has one deal at 50 mw and 
we have two identical deals at 25 mw.

deal 524247
This deal checks out with Amerex fine.

The deal that I am missing is Enron buys from EES 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for 
Q3'01 at $285.95.


ISSUE 2- Mike Swerzbin
deal 524267
 Amerex has 50 mw and we have 25 mw.

ISSUE 3- Dianna Scholtes
deal 523984
Amerex has price as $345 and we have price as $335.


This has been a terrible ordeal and I will be so glad when everthing is 
resolved!!!

Thanks
Evelyn

This deal is the same as all the others Carla Hoffman entered yesterday - in 
the interest of time, she entered all deals with a Saturday-Sunday mask in 
Deal Blotter. If the deals were on peak, she said it shouldn't matter that 
they were marked to flow both days, because Sunday is all off-peak hours. I 
explained this in a couple e-mails yesterday - I guess I got confused about 
who I told. Carla said she's done this before and it shouldn't be a problem. 
Please let me know if you agree with this. In my opinion, just taking the 
time to explain the discrepancy in the 10 or 12 deals that were entered this 
way actually took more time than it saved. What do you think?

Kate,
Amerex has a deal on their web checkout traded by Diana on 2/14 where:
Enron buys from Coral 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for 2/15-2/16 at $420.00

I do not see this deal in Enpower.  


When I checked out with Amerex on the 14th all deals were confirmed.  When I 
cleared their deals all deals were cleared.
It is our policy to go back and check their web site for additions, changes 
etc. once every week for the week before and this deal popped up.

Can you please check to see if the schedulers received any confirmation of 
flow for this deal from Coral?

Thanks!!

When you change this to no confirm, please put a note in the comment section 
about why we are not domfirming it, because it falls within our guidelines to 
confirm and at somepoint, I will be asked why we did not confirm this deal.

Thanks!

Deal should be no confirm. It was done by Stan Cocke in Services, and those 
guys deal directly with their counterparty contacts. He thought he marked 
this no confirm, but must have defaulted to confirm anyway. I'll change deal 
as soon as risk is done with their calc.

Hi Kate!
I just want to make sure that this is the correct counterparty name.  Usually

When you change this to no confirm, please put a note in the comment section 
about why we are not domfirming it, because it falls within our guidelines to 
confirm and at somepoint, I will be asked why we did not confirm this deal.

Thanks!

Deal should be no confirm. It was done by Stan Cocke in Services, and those 
guys deal directly with their counterparty contacts. He thought he marked 
this no confirm, but must have defaulted to confirm anyway. I'll change deal 
as soon as risk is done with their calc.

As you know, we do not have a contract with Transalta Energy Marketing Corp. 
but with Transalta Energy Marketing (US) Inc.  I am changing this deal to 
that CP.  

Let me know if you have any objections or if you prefer to make the change

know Carla preferred to make the changes herself.

I have a question about how this deal is entered.  You have it entered as 
every day of the week including Sundays and Holidays for the hours 7 -22.  I 
think that will duplicate the off peak hours you have entered for Sundays on 
#533134.  It is already flowing Sundays, 24 hours on #533134.  Is this in 
addition to those hours or is it a duplication?

Also, do you want these two confirmed on one letter or as two separate 
deals.  If together, please put a note in the comment section of deal entry 
sp we will know to confirm both on one letter.

Thanks!"

Hi Kate,

I spoke with Jeff Richter this morning and the index sleeve he did on 
yesterday with EES (deal 533084) and Sempra(deal 533085) is incorrect in 
Enpower.  He said he would change the publication code to reflect Dow Jones 
SP-15 Peak instead of Dow Jones NP-15 Peak on both of these deals.

Can you please check with Jeff to see what the status is on these changes. 
The EES deal has been changed. The Sempra deal has not been changed.

Thanks!!

Tom Alonso's name is on bro confirm (Peco) but deal 459243.01 is under Mark 
Fischer (COnstellation)

Thanks

Can you change the time zone to PPT so that the strips accurately splits the 
zime change for April.


The first strip should be   4/1 - 4/1    M-S    PDT   07-22
The next strip should be  4/2 - 4/30  M-S   PDT   07-22

Kate,

these are the following deals I have amended the time zones to PPT instead of 
PST and amended the strips to reflect the change:
534066
534473
534077
534078
534064
534058

Also, these are only the brokered deals between Tom and Mark.  There may be 
some non-brokered deals in enpower with a flow of April and the time zone 
needs to be changed to PPT and the strips amended as well.  Can you please 
run a query and check the other deals to make sure the time zone is correct 
because if not they will not be scheduled correctly for April. 

If you have any question please call me.  


Thanks!!"

This deal has a strange delivery point -ZP-26.  Is that right?  It might be,

Do you know what ever happened with this price? I never received a new 
confirmation with the price of $90 from FPL.

Kate, same thing on this trade. I think it should be FPL Energy Power 
Marketing b/c I received a confirm on it. Secondly on the confirm it states 
that hour 0100-0600 is priced at $95.00 and then again at hours 2300-2400. 
7-22 is priced at $140. However I do not show in the system 1-6 and 23-24 at 
$95. Did he forget to put in the off peak or is FPL incorrect.

Thanks,

Tom entered this trade as Firm and FPL says on their confirmation as

At the suggestion of Tim B. we are going to implement a procedure for Middle 
Market Transcation Deal Entry and Confirmation.  I will be writing this 
procedure.  There have been some confirms sent out recently that were 
inaccurate and some other EnPower entry issues.  More importantly, however, 
Tim simply wants to tighten procedures as a risk control mechanism.  He also 
will be writing procedures for other things various folks in his group do. 
These procedures will be put into a West Trading Procedure Book that is being 
created.  To get this process started (prior to my writing it up), please 
immediately start doing the following:

1.  On every future trade you do, tell the trader taking the position (i.e LT 
NW, ST CA, etc.) that you should be identified as the trader.  By doing this, 
you will be responsible for making sure the deal is confirmed properly.  
Otherwise, they are responsible for the accuracy of the Confirm.  
2.  I will be sent a copy of all MM group confirms from Houston and will be 
putting them into a Master MM Confirms notebook.  When received, I will 
indicate to you that it is here and you will be responsible for checking it 
and making sure it is accurate.  An accurate confirm generally means the deal 
was entered correctly into EnPower.
3.  For all existing deals that you think should be included in this notebook 
because they are a little hairy and you want to make sure your hands are 
clean with respect to an accurate confirm, please make sure I get a copy as 
soon as possible.

Thanks

Chris

We are researching this deal and need your help.

Could you take a look at this deal?  I've pulled the audit viewer and the 
deal tickets.  My real question is - what deal do we actually have 
confirmed?  Leg 3 was the deal we carried on our books that had the expiry in 
March.  Since Modesto did not exercise, we realized a rather small fortune 
and want to make sure it was a real deal.  

I think we do not want to contact our counterparty but we do want to pull the 
deal records for confirm.  Can you help?

Evelyn, I'm so sorry I haven't found these deals yet! I've left messages with 
Mike Swerzbin and Matt Motley, but I don't see these trades in either of 
their logs - or even in the short term trade logs. One of those guys should 
be back in the office momentarily, and I'll let you know when I've talked to 
them.

Hi Kate, Lindy Conrad a trader from Seattle City Light called me today.  She 
thinks the price for deal # 537565.01 should be $360.00 instead of $350.00.  
She said that Sean Crandall was our trader.  

Let me know what you find out.
Thanks,

Hello, I noticed that deal # 253768 is an index deal with EES that has not 
been changed from the CAL PX to the Dow Jones index.  Could you ask Valerie 
or Bob Badeer if this deal should be changed?  I was going to send them a 
revised confirm.

Kate:

The deal 412868.1 was changed per Stewart Rosman and Jeff Richter requests.  

The deal 412868.1 was entered wrong for Sundays as:
0100-0600  MTWTFSa 15MW 
2200-2300 MTWTFSa 15MW
0100-2400 Sun, H  15MW
0700-2200 MTWTFSa 20MW

where it should be: 
7*16 and 7*8

Therefore, I zeroed out all volumes in 412868.1 and basically created a new 
leg (412868.2) to make the deal as what it should be.  

However, since today is 3/8 and the power for 3/4 (last Sunday) has already 
flowed/liquidated according to the wrong deal entry (412868.1 for 15MW, where 
it should be 20MW) and the trader told me the counterparty will make up the 
5MW this coming Sunday (3/11); therefore, I entered two new legs to account 
for these adjustments we need to make:

412868.3 LT-CALI sells 5MW  for 3/4
412868.3 LT-CALI buys 5MW for 3/11

We will need to confirm with the traders if we need to re-confirm these new 
deals/legs created.

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Fran

Hi Kate, 

Can you please let Phil know that he should be testing deals in the enpower 
test database not the actual system.  

Thanks

This was just a practice deal entered by Phil yesterday to test our new 
version of deal entry. He zeroed out the volume, but neglected to kill the 
deal or at least change it to no confirm. So this is NOT a good deal - I'm 
killing it now.

Testing was done in the test database; however, once they released the new 
version of deal entry into production, they tested one more time to make sure 
that the new fields were pulling into our scheduling reports. It was a 
precautionary measure taken so that we wouldn't enter deals all day long only 
to find out that they wouldn't show up in the Enpower to CAPS report at the 
end of the day. Sorry for the confusion.

These deals were entered as flowing all days, and should have just been Mon - 
Sat. This was my fault, as I didn't know my computer defaulted to all days. 
(This has since been fixed!) I've changed them in the system and was told to

Can you check with Cara and see if this deal should have been put in as a 
buy/resale.  We don't have transmission with this entity (WAPA-CRSP).  Let me 
know.  "

Hi Kate,
I called Seattle City Light to verbally confirm this deal and they said that 
it should be Off Peak.  I spoke with Matt Motley who agreed.  Can you change 
this deal to Off-Peak hours?  If you want to check with Matt, that's fine.  
We're not supposed to make any changes to West deals otherwise I'd do it 
myself.
Thanks!

Tracy just told me this counterparty (PPL Montana) is still pending credit. 
Mike Swerzbin said he would prefer to wait this out, because he stands to 
make money on the deal. So in the meantime, I've been told by credit that we 
can't enter the deal in the system and calc it. I'm not sure how this works 
in your case with the Prebon check-out, but basically it's a pending credit 
deal that will potentially show up in our system once EPMI and PPL Montana 
reach an agreement. Does that help? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

This deal was done on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Jeff thought it 
was the same thing as Dynegy Direct. I've changed it to ICE as broker, but 
I'm wondering if these are different brokers, or why Jeff would have thought 
they were the same....???

yes- so this is what prebon is saying on this deal 549052:
Enron buys from Pacificorp 25 mw of peak BOM Mid-C at $141.00

Thanks!!

Sean Crandall said the price on this is correct (241), but he thought the 
deal was supposed to run through the end of the month. He was just walking 
into a meeting with Tim Belden while I was trying to figure this out with 
him, and he asked that I not change anything until he gets out and can look 
at it more closely. A price of $141 is awfully low for a peak deal flowing at 
Mid-C tomorrow - actually lower than the off-peak prices - so it sounds a 
little suspicious. I'll let you know when he gets out of the meeting.

Thanks,
Kate

Prebon agrees now because the confirm is exactly what we have, however, can 
you change both strips to reflect 3/15-3/31 in enpower (deal 549052).

We've changed this to a BOM deal (term 3/15 to 3/31), but Sean still 
recognizes this as an on-peak deal with a price of 241.00. Let me know if 
Prebon still disputes.

We came across some deals on the not to be confirmed report that look like 
they should be confirmed.  Can you check and see why these came up not to be 
confirmed.  We thought we had fixed the system so that the daily deals in the 
west would default to be confirmed so I need to know if this was a conscious 
decision or something the comuter is defaulting to.  Am I making sense?  Call 
me if you need to interpret this message!

oops, I meant 549775 (not 550838) i think needs to be CAISO.  sorry about 
that.

I've changed 549777 to CAISO energy, but 550838 looks like it already has 
CAISO energy in it. Let me know if it was a different deal number that had a 
problem. And you're right - that's not bad at all!

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate,
Deals #549777 and #550838 are both firm with sp-15 delivery points.  that's 
all for now though.  not bad so far, huh?
Thanks,
Kim

Brain glitch!  It was two legs of the same deal!

I also found #550042 and 550048 that look like it needs to be confirmed also.

Thanks!

I think this is an issue with Diana's deal entry, because I just asked Sean 
Crandall and he said you can go ahead and confirm all of these deals. I've 
changed the confirm status, and I'll look into it more later this afternoon 
when the traders are less busy. Also, did you mean to write 549903 twice, or 
is there another deal number?

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate, I know you are working on this problem.  This deal will not let me 
save it because it wants the schedule type filled in.  Let me know if there 
is a schedule type I can choose or if I should just wait until the problem is 
fixed.

Thanks,

These deals have shown up on the not to be confirmed report.  Do we confirm 
them?  I am sorry there are so many of them, but with the new policy of 
confirming west daily trades, we are having a hard time figuring out just 
what should be confirmed.

Kate, I am working with Brooklyn Couch with EES on the March power activity 
and she has a deal referring to the schedule received from you.  Deal  # 
547478.1 we have peak @ $164.15, off peak @ $99.90.   EES shows per the 
schedule $174.15 & $109.90.

I spoke with Virginia and we agreed that variances which are listed as part 
of the schedule I will forward to you.  All others will go in to DMS.

Please let me know what you find out.

Thanks,

Kate I spoke with Phil about this deal this morning and I just called but he 
away at lunch.

Per our Rhonda, can you tell him that deal 553645 should be changed Allegheny 
Energy Supply and that we should no longer do any deals under Merrill Lynch.  
Also, can you let the schedulers know about the name change of this deal.

The confirmation is still coming over with 32 hours a day, but I can fix it 
to read 16 hours a day as long as it is valuing correctly for you guys in the 
calc.  This is very strange.  I don't know why it is coming over like that.  
Let me know if they get it fixed, or if this is something we are going to

I've changed the deal - we're running into some problems rolling out the new 
Full Service Power application. Apparently it's messed with some details of 
Deal Entry, including the deletion of strips. So you'll see three strips in 
this deal, two of which have no price and no volume. I hope that's okay! Will 
Smith in Houston IT is working on it now. Let me know if you see the right 
term and volume now.

Thanks,
Kate

doubled up and it is running 32 hours a day.

I'm trying to get ahold of Jeff Richter on this, but without the brokers 
around we probably can't get it done tonight. I would just say we have a 
discrepancy with the broker at this point. Let me know if that's okay.

Jeff,
Here is a spreadsheet with prices and deal #'s for yesterday.  We couldn't 
get the energy out of NP, and really didn't get a decent price for it in 
NP-15.
All the deals are flat for your book.  Wish we could have done better.  If 
you have questions, just let me know.
Thanks, 
Bill

It's changed to APS. I'm wondering about the status of APS and Pinnacle - I

not APS. Is this incorrect? Do you know who might know about that?

559066----I just checked with Prebon and for some reason they show price as 
$258.00 on this deal.
559091----Is a good deal with Bloomberg.

Therefore, the only deal in question now is 559066 and Prebon shows $258 as 
price and we show $358.

Please advice.

I'm a little confused - 559066 is a Prebon deal under Mike Swerzbin's book. 
559091 is a Bloomberg deal under Matt Motley's book. I just talked to Mike 
Driscoll and he said these both have the correct brokers on them and there 
were two deals. ????

That's weird, because nothing traded for nearly that low for April today. 
Mike's exact words were, ""there's no way it's $258."" So if anyone from Prebon 
is still there, let them know the trader is sticking with his price.

Thanks,
Kate

559066----I just checked with Prebon and for some reason they show price as 
$258.00 on this deal.
559091----Is a good deal with Bloomberg.

Therefore, the only deal in question now is 559066 and Prebon shows $258 as 
price and we show $358.

Please advice.

I'm a little confused - 559066 is a Prebon deal under Mike Swerzbin's book. 
559091 is a Bloomberg deal under Matt Motley's book. I just talked to Mike 
Driscoll and he said these both have the correct brokers on them and there 
were two deals. ????

Kate deal 559066 is identical to deal 559091.  Prebon does not recognize 
559066.  Were these duplicates?

BLOOMBERG
Matt Motley
559091 - sells to Idaho, 50 mw, April, Mid-C, $358

Tom Alonso
559010 - price is changed to $160
He is still entering last two deals.

AMEREX
Mike Swerzbin
559062 - buys AEP, 25 mw, Cal-02, PV, $140
And Tom said he didn't have anything to do with this deal - Mike said MW were 
correct.

Subject: Deal Changes - No confirm

Just wanted to give you an update on my progress so far - I'm changing these 
deals in between each of my other daily tasks, and I'm also having a hard 
time reading some of the deal numbers. I've made it through the first page 
and a bit of the second. I've changed all but four of the deals to ""no 
confirm."" Here are the questions I have on those deals:

1. 552516 - why are we not confirming a City of Riverside deal? Should I ask 
Jeff?

2. 553037 - looks like it's already ""no confirm""

3. 553666/667/668 - are we not confirming any deals where PGE is the 
counterparty? I thought it was just where PGE System was the delivery point?

4. 553926 - this deal is killed. Do we have to change settings on killed 
deals as well?

Also, if you have a slightly bigger copy of the document you faxed over, or 
if you could e-mail it to me, that would save me a lot of guessing time. 
Thanks for your help!

Kate

log now to keep his secrets safe! Well that didn't work too well for us 
today, because the two missing deals were right there at the bottom....with 
no deal numbers! Anyway, Jeff said he'd enter these in the morning, and if

The missing Richter trades are all EES sleeves that he neglected to enter 
before leaving for Houston this afternoon. Since Risk is running their calc, 
Chris Mallory said he's enter the deals first thing in the morning. 

The Fischer deals - 563728 and 563729 - have been changed to Constellation, 
per Matt Motley who did the trades.

And the other two deals where the brokers have been changed look fine. Would 
you let me know beforehand next time, just in the offhand chance that the 
trader entered other things in the deal incorrectly? Thanks for your help.

This is a unit contingent deal.  We have been told that we have to have the 
unit name to include in the confirmation when we confirm these deals.  Can 
you have the traders add the unit name in the comment section whe they do 
unit contingent deals?

Thanks!"

Hello, can you check these deals and see if the counterparty name is wrong.  
They are in as Enmax Corporation and we are wondering if they should be Enmax 
Energy Corporation.  The contract did not come over correctly so we wanted to 
make sure the counterparty name is correct before we set up a new contract.

Thanks,
Melissa

Hello, 563928 is a deal that went physical off of the NYMEX.  I am not sure 
who entered the trade but if we could get you all to put a comment saying the 
trade went physical off of the NYMEX that would help us alot.  We do not 
confirm these trades.  We sent a confirm out to the counterparty for this 
trade and referenced the incorrect contract.

Thanks for your help,

This was a futures contract done by Matt Motley, and I entered the forward 
deal. I wasn't aware that futures deals don't get confirmed. I only knew that 
when the contract expires, I need to enter a forward deal in EnPower to hold 
the trader's position. It looks like you've already added a comment about the 
trade going physical off of the NYMEX. Is there anything else you'd like me 
to add? If not, I'll just make a note in the comments section of forward 
deals entered in place of expiring futures contracts, and I'll mark ""no 
confirm"" on these deals as well.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, 
#562373 was an EOL trade that Chris Mallory did. When it was done on line the 
delivery point was NP-15 now in Enpower it has been changed to SP-15. Could 
you check with Chris if this is correct. I thought that we were not allowed 
to change EOL trades. If he did then I will have to get with Legal to find 
out what our next step would be.

Thanks,

Mike did a deal with these terms but a price of 380 - deal is #571917. But he

Yep - the trade's there all right. I just talked to Mike again and he said 
he'd love to take the trade, but he's sure it's an error. To avoid any 
confusion later, and because he's already left the office for today, let's 
have Mike talk to his Amerex broker tomorrow morning and clear this up. He 
just might get a sweet deal out of it!

Mike did a deal with these terms but a price of 380 - deal is #571917. But he 
said a price like $292.50 doesn't sound right for Sept. - possibly May?

Hello, Sierra Pacific Power Company called me and they don't recognize this

Kate, This is a Tom Alonso trade. For these two trades they are entered as 
Florida Power & Light. FPL Energy Power Marketing sent a confirmation over on 
this trade. Could you ask Tom if he entered the trade incorrectly for both 
deal numbers. Secondly on #570450 the confirmation shows a price of $80. We 
have $85.00 in the system. Which one is correct?

Thanks,

I've added the fee - these are supposed to default when traders enter the 
deals in Enpower, but for some reason Bloomberg fees aren't coming through 
lately. I'm checking with IT on this.

Kate, we have created the confirm that represented the original deal.  Total 
400 mws, we have sent the confirm to Idaho, broker confirm matches original 
deal, Melissa said we usually do not reconfirm deals that were cut.  We have 
put a comment in deal entry commenting that the deal was cut.  Just as long 
as you have all recorded on your side, with the mws.  Hope this helps.

Subject: Re: Deal 565759.01  

I'm sorry my response has been such a long time coming on this issue, but 
I've visited with almost every department in our office trying to figure out 
what happened to this deal. Basically, Idaho got their scheduled cut by the 
Cal-ISO, which in turn means we have to cut our schedule flowing to Idaho. So 
Jeremy Morris, one of our California schedulers, cut the first Idaho deal he 
found and passed the remainder of the schedule to Real Time to fill, which 
they did in a separate deal. So EPMI and Idaho are in agreement that the 
schedule got cut, but that we kept them whole by selling the remainder to 
Idaho in the hour-ahead market. 

Now the question is, how do we confirm the deal? From your side, is it better 
if we leave the deal as-is, or restore it to the original 25 mw off peak and 
kill the real time deal (which wouldn't really be an accurate representation 
of what happened)? Just let me know, and we'll do what we can to help.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate:

Can you please modify that deal that you made the price $140 yesterday to 
make it for the 6th only?  The 7th is all at $150.

Thanks

Chris,
Good morning!  Hey, one thing I probably did not clarify to you yesterday on 
was that when the new deal ticket was set up for the $140 price strip (Deal 
#576468.1), the deal should only be in for (4/6/2001) according to APX's 
statement (not including 4/7/2001).  Therefore, the entire offpeak for your 
deal would be booked on Deal #572069.1 for the $150 price for 4/7/2001.  Let 
me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Chris,
One more quick thing on 4/6/2001- APX is showing 2 different prices for 
offpeak ($140 & $150 - different MW per strip).  EPMI is showing $150 @ 12/MW 
per offpeak hours.  This difference amounts to a $144 difference (APX has 
lower invoice).  Can you verify?  Everything else is fine....talk to you next 
week.  Have a good weekend.

These deal have NP/SP delivery points with firm energy.
576522
576512
576523
576517
576513
and 576511, but this one is also the wrong CP name.  Reliant HLP doesn't 
trade in the west.  I think it should be Reliant Energy Services.

What's the status?

I see several sales to Puget in Diana's blotter at a $375 price, only one 
with Amerex, and it's for 50 MW. I'll need to get ahold of her in the morning 
to verify the brokers on these. I'll let you know as soon as I do.

Attached is the FINAL report for Nov 2000.  The additions to the preliminary 
report have been highlighted.

Please note that on the preliminary report for this month, Sempra Energy 
Solutions, LLC  (""Solutions"") was listed under old record information to be 
inactivated on 12/01/00, and Sempra Energy Sales LLC  (""Sales"") was listed as 
the new record information.  For the documentation received, this information 
was correct, HOWEVER, there was a subsequent change for which there is no 
documentation.  I have verified with the Counterparty that ""Sales"" was a 
fictiticious name used to distinguish the Kentucky office from the California 
office.  Through reorganization, it was decided that both offices would use 
the ""Solutions"" name.  Since ""Solutions"" already existed and ""Sales"" is a 
fictitious name, they had no documentation to support that change.  The 
""Sales"" record has been suspended pending inactivation on 12/01.







All short name changes will be made this afternoon, approx. 1:p CST, Nov. 
22.  


Records will be inactivated on Fri afternoon, Dec. 1.


Thanks,

Cheryl x3-3103

Are you talking about the broker fee?
Yes the fee is $15.00 Flat per Bloomberg's confirmation on both of these 
deals.

PREBON
Bob said Matt Motley gave him this deal to do. Is that going to fly with 
Prebon?
I guess this is o.k. but they were insisting that this deal was done with 
Matt not Bob.

I've never seen anything but a .005 broker fee on Bloomberg deals. Tom Alonso 
wanted to know when that fee changed.......we're confused!

And the Matt-Bob deal swap - I guess it was just a last minute decision on 
their part, and they should have let the broker know. Matt said the trade 
needs to stay in Bob's book, and just to check it out as a good trade with 
EPMI. Let me know if you still have problems with this.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate I will have to submit a code change to our Enpower guys to reflect the 
$15.00 flat fee change for 1 or 2 days deals.  Currently this can't be coded 
based on the duration of these deals because we currently have a code for 
daily deals(meaning 1 day only) and a code for short term deals ( meaning 
anything 1 day or more but less than 1 month) and a code for long term deals 
(meaning anything more than 1 month).   If the fee was per mw, I could simply 
go and edit the broker table fee but since this is a flat fee, the codes have 
to be adjusted to reflect such.

I have submitted a request and I am waiting on a response.  I will keep you 
updated.

Kate, I am changing the forwards to the HOlding Company.  There are 2 
transmission deals with Sierra Pacific Industries that I think should be 
Buy/Resales.  We do not have transmission with either entity.  Can you check 
and see if the counterparty should be changed or they should be Buy/Resales?  
Thanks."

I've changed deals 581499 and 581605 to Sierra Pacific Power. They're suposed 
to be transmission deals, they were just in with the wrong counterparty name. 
And thanks again for working so hard to finalize this Sierra Pacific Holding 
Co. thing.

One more question, I promise.  Bob Badeer did this deal and entered it as 
Sierra Pacific Industries and I just changed it to Holding Company.  Should 
it have been Sierra Pacific Power Company because the delivery is Palo Verde 
and the Holding Co. deals are all SP15.  "

Audrey,

Concerning deal #579038:  This was a mistake on my part, the price should in 
fact be $80 (as the APX is showing).  I've fixed the price in Enpower.

Concerning deal #581335:  This trade did take place between Enron and Sierra 
Pacific Industries (not the APX).  I mistakenly put that deal in under the 
wrong counterparty.  I've fixed the counterparty in Enpower.

I will ask Fran Chang to autoschedule both deals.  Let me know if I need to 
do anything further.

Thanks,
Stan

Subject: Re: 586775  

I just spoke with Heather Dunton in Risk, and she said they've had problems 
valuing index forward deals that settle at the last 5-day NYMEX average. So 
to remedy the situation, they're taking a fifth of the volume out of the deal 
each day, beginning five days prior to the expiry date. In this case, the 
expiry date is 4/25/01, so they began with taking 5 MW out of deal 585480 and 
putting it into a fixed price forward deal - 586775. Each day Heather will 
take another fifth of the volume in 585480 and put it into 586775, and she'll 
average the fixed prices each day to eventually end up with the last 5-day 
average. That's the long and short of why this new forward deal - 586775 - 
doesn't need to be confirmed. Our position with Deseret stays the same - it's 
just split between two deals temporarily. 

Please call Heather or me with any questions. She's going to add another 
comment in both deals to indicate the changes she'll be making, so it should 
be apparent to everyone that 586775 does not need to be confirmed at any 
point. When we get to the expiry date, Heather will kill that fixed forward 
deal, since the index price will pull into the system and 585480 will value 
properly.

Sorry for the winded explanation, but I thought it was better to give you 
more than less!

Thanks,
Kate

Can you check with the trader on this deal.  We have had to change several 
deals input with this CP name.  I believe it should be FPL Energy Power Mktg. 
not  Florida Power & Light Company.  I think one is a utility which would be 
local and one is a marketer, who can trade anywhere.

Thanks!

Rhonda is checking with Bloomberg's Contract person because she said these

Yes this is the first time I've seen unrestricted Mid-C on any of their 
confirmations.  Normally they have into Mid-C on the confirmations which I 
know should be Mid-C excluding the into part.  Anyway, I will wait to clear 
this two deals.  Keep me informed.
Below is the two confirms they sent me.

595511 - buy Idaho, May, Mid-C, 330

And on the Bloomberg confirms re: Mid-C - I'm pulling up the contract through 
Livelink, because Sean wants to make sure the language does not allow for 
curtailment at Mid-C if another unit in the path goes down. He says our Mid-C 
is unrestricted anyway, so we shouldn't need another name in Enpower. Is this 
the first time you've seen this delivery point name in a confirmation? Hold 
off on this confirm for just a minute while I go over this with Sean.

Thanks,

I think this deal should have been entered as ""no confirm.""  Can you please 
change it?  If I am wrong, please let me know.

And if you wouldn't mind strolling through the trade floor and smacking all 
the new hourly guys around who keep entering their deal with ""yes agreement"" 
instead of ""not to be confirmed"" -that'd be great too (might relieve a little 
stress also!)

If John Malowney is okay with the confirmation he reviewed, I'm fine.  I made 
the changes he suggested and sent it out, so if nothing else needs to be done 
for the confirmation, then yes, please add some notes in the comment section 
of deal entry about what happened.

Subject: Re: Montana power  

I'm really sorry about the confusion - I actually just got filled in myself. 
I entered these deals for Mike Swerzbin yesterday, but he gave me an 
incorrect delivery point (mid-columbia instead of montana system border). 
Then Cara Semperger, in Scheduling, went in to change the delivery point and 
felt that the deal should be combined into one with three legs instead of 
three separate deals. 

So, in the end, she killed 597244 and 597245, and added two legs to 597246. 
I'm not sure she talked to John Malowney about any of this, otherwise he 
probably would have told her that he already approved the confirm letter.

Please let me know if you'd like comments added to this deal, and I'll do it 
right away.

Thanks for your help on this,
Kate

Help, I'm confused!  Yesterday I prepared a confirmation for three Montana 
Power deals, # 5467244, 597245, 597246.  I sent it to John Malowney and he 
approved it and I faxed it out. Today I noticed two of the deals have been 
killed and two legs added to the other deal.  I think it is the same deal, 
but can someone put notes into the deals saying what they did and why?

Thanks!

deal so that we can send out the confirmation letter and the number we have

That's what I was confused about because Prebon shows this deal as peak and 
we show it as peak and I know it is the other side of a sleeve.  Can you 
double check with Bob for accuracy.

Does this mean that 598738 should be off peak hours as well? Because 598739

to have the same hours......

Let me know, and I'll change them accordingly.

I double-checked with Bob, and he said Prebon reported these two trades as 
peak. The other two were in fact reported as off-peak - he just entered them 
incorrectly. But as far as this sleeve goes, there's no way one side is peak 
and the other isn't - Prebon has to make up their minds!

Again, let me know what you find out. Until then, we recognize the two trades 
as they are.

Good morning Ladies!
This deal has two different terms entered.  One says 12/1/00-12/31/00 (in 
which case, it needs to be changed to ""yes/agreement"" and the other says 
12/1/00-12/1/00 (in which case, we don't confirm).
Please let me know.
Thanks!  Glad to have you with us Kate!!!

I've handed this over to Jeff Richter, who will speak with his contact at 
Aquila to sort this out. We were both confused about the discrepancy, 
however, because if the deal didn't exist there would have been problems in 
scheduling on Oct. 12; and so far we haven't heard anything. I'm sorry this 
didn't get taken care of more quickly, but Jeff was in a meeting this 
afternoon.

Thanks,

I've checked with Matt Motley and changed 458712 and 458718 to reflect broker 
fees of .0075.

I've left a message for Mike Swerzbin to double-check. He has 457489 entered 
in his log book with no broker fee, but 459812 says nothing either way; so 
I'd like to get ahold of him before I change anything.

Thanks,

Can you please get a contact name and phone number for this counterparty from 
Mike Swerzbin as soon as possible? -I need to get a verbal confirm on this 
deal so that we can send out the confirmation letter and the number we have 
in the system has been disconnected.  Also, we're checking on that other deal 
that I asked you about yesterday (I thought we confirmed it under the 
original deal # so I wasn't sure if we needed to confirm it again)

Hi Kate,
Just checking on this deal.  Is this gonna be an exchange for physical and 
the counterparty name will be added later?  It's been ""new"" for a couple of 
days now, which is fine, I just wanted to make sure someone is working on it.

running for three months, December through February.  Could you check with

Please check with the trader.  This should probably be Transalta Energy

They need to choose the company that has the (US) in it.  Let me know.

I'm not exactly sure where the spreadsheet on our site comes from. Our 
preference is to keep everything in our SQL Server database, and many of the 
people that you mentioned have read access to that. When Julie Sarnowski gets 
back from vacation next week, let's talk about uploading these data to the

Subject: Dow Jones Index Prices - Database Access

I'd like to inquire about the Dow Jones index price database currently being 
maintained by the Fundamentals group. It's come to my attention - by virtue 
of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several 
people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests 
from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put 
the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the 
index prices in order to run one of her reports.

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your 
spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow 
Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the 
other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile 
the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you. 
(I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)

Thanks,
Kate

I'd like to inquire about the Dow Jones index price database currently being 
maintained by the Fundamentals group. It's come to my attention - by virtue 
of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several 
people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests 
from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put 
the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the 
index prices in order to run one of her reports.

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your 
spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow 
Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the 
other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile 
the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you. 
(I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)

Thanks,
Kate

I am sure this is what we want to capture.  When you get a chance, tell me 
how you get the volume done each day so I can find it and incorporate it into 
our graph.

Hello fellow team members.

So I have recruited all of you to help out in the Enron Elves program. The 
program is designed to help raise funds to buy gifts for a family and 
currently, we (West Desk) has sponsored three families. Our family has two 
kids with a single parent (mother). There is an 11-year old daughter and 
8-year old son.

I hope that everyone will do their best to help out. We basically need to 
raise money by asking people we know and even companies that some of you 
might have ties with and then we go shopping and finally wrap the presents 
and deliver them to the family. 

The money should be in by Friday December 15th and the gift wrapping is 
scheduled for Tuesday December 19th. We will go shopping for the gifts in 
between then.

We need to keep track of the amount of the donation, name and address of the 
person that donated so that they are able to use the donation as a tax 
deduction.  If you have any other questions or ideas about gifts or raising 
money, feel free to stop by my desk or email me. 

Happy Thanksgiving and let's go raise some money.

Jeffrey Oh

Kate,
I am in the confirmation group with EES and try to tie out our confirmtions 
with the EPMI list I receive from Kim Hundle (EPMI), on a weekly basis.  This 
file would be great help with this process.  Is there any way you could send 
this to me as well? This would help me determine who the problem is with.  I 
would appreciate it.  
Thanks

Kate, I am checking out EES February deals with Brocklyn Couch and problems 
were noted on two deals 512775.1 on the 5th & 527967.1 on the 22nd.

EES was not agreeing to what we (Enron Power) has in Enpower.  Per Phil 
Platter our numbers are correct and the worksheet needs to be updated to 
reflect Enpower.

EES stated they will adjust their numbers once they get an updated sheet. 
Thanks,

Mark "

Dear Kate, 

Just a heads-up that I sent this to Bill,  so he may be asking you what the 
problems have been with EES.
Could I bring by the discrepancies a bit later?

Thanks,

Virginia

Dear Bill, 

Please read forward below.
I've seen a few problems with EES lately.  Last month, Kate Symes took care 
of the differences (she knows more about EES).  You may want to contact her 
to find out what has been happening lately to cause the differences.  Sorry - 
don't know much more.

Virginia, please take a look at DMS #'s  7365 & 7367.  These are the start of 
the EES differences for March.  Both of these have to do with the ST-Whourly 
desk where we are lower by $5.00 then what EES has.  I spoke with Thresa and 
she suggested we have Bill Williams look at these in case their is a trend 
started for the month and we can catch it now.

Thanks,

Mark

Dear Kate,

Thanks for your response.  It appears that we sent EES the wrong prices in 
the spreadsheet that we sent to them.  Bill said he would make the changes, 
so I won't bring this over to you (not yet anyway).   I also told Mark in 
Houston what is happening, so this will hopefully be done.

Thanks for your help.

Virginia

Subject: Re: EES Changes for March  

Yes, that's fine if you bring the discrepancies by later. Or I can swing by 
your desk to get them. I think I know why Mark is confused about the price. 
At the beginning of this month we started running into situations where we 
had to purchase from EES in addition to selling to them - which is all we had 
been doing to cover their load before. We determined, however, that when EPMI 
buys from EES, the price should be $5 less than our fixed price average for 
the day. (When EPMI sells to EES, the price is $5 more than the fixed price 
average.) In this way, we're still making our profit from the coverage of 
their load. Either the correct price is not reflected in the spreadsheet we 
sent them, or we purchased at the wrong price - we were working the kinks out 
right at the beginning of March, so it makes sense that they'd have questions 
regarding that time frame.

Also, I've already talked with Daniel Kang at EES to work out some 
discrepancies with him. He asked about volumes at the beginning of March, but 
didn't seem to have a question about price, so I'm wondering if everyone over 
there is communicating with each other. Please let me know what I can do to 
resolve this - and feel free to send Mark my way when he has questions. 

Kate

Things are looking very good.  I verified that all the deals below that were 
autoscheduled came thru, all look good from what I can see.   Brooklyn is 
still looking at the real time deals to verify if they received all updated 
ones.  

The only deal that I see that their may be an issue on is 535568.1 where the 
peak hours are still at 1070.75.  Any more information on this one?


Thanks

Subject: March EES-EPMI Revisions

I've attached the EES March Dailies spreadsheet. It should reflect the latest 
volumes and hopefully will clear up some of the discrepancies we're seeing 
between EES and EPMI. Also, I've autoscheduled the following deals in an 
attempt to feed them through to the CARP report. Please let me know if you 
see the changes come through, Mark. 

The autoscheduled deals are:

533090 - 3/1/01-3/31/01
535419 - 3/2/01
535420 - 3/2/01
566081 - 3/1/01-3/31/01
550208 - 3/15/01



The last deal I'm checking on is #535568 - in your spreadsheet you said EES 
saw the on peak hours totalling 1070.75 MWH and believed the on peak hours 
should actually total 1016.75 MWH. Below are the volumes I see both in the 
EnPower deal and in the March Dailies spreadsheet. 


+____________
=         1016.75 

Maybe we need to autoschedule this one as well? Please let me know how the 
CARP report looks now, and call me with questions. Hopefully this wraps it up 
for March!

Thanks,
Kate

Hey Kate,

For 4/15 and 4/16, our schedules that we sent you show a Riverside 
Generatioin component of 0.8 every hour (SP15).  This is not reflected in 
your current April update.  The EnPower columns for these days should be 
increased by 0.8 for every hour.  Right?

Also, The generation component that I sent you for Wednesday and Thursday 
(which I sent Monday morning) had a generation component of 0.8.  In reality, 
it was actually 0.55.  I didn't have the generation schedule from Riverside 
and had to assume a value so I assumed it would be 0.8 because that's where 
it had been for a while.  In your current file, you have the correct value of 
0.55.  How did you know this?  Did Riverside call you to tell you they were 
at 0.55 instead of 0.8?  Let me know.  Thanks.

So, I got the scoop from Phil, and he says that YOU called him and told him 
the Riverside deal would be decreased to .55 from the usual .8 - go figure! 
Also, it looks like Jeremy just missed the .8 mw of generation in the 4/15 
and 4/16 sheets, which in turn I did not include in your sheet. I've revised 
it and attached the spreadsheet, but please let me know if you have any other

(which I sent Monday morning) had a generation component of 0.8.  In reality, 
it was actually 0.55.  I didn't have the generation schedule from Riverside 
and had to assume a value so I assumed it would be 0.8 because that's where 
it had been for a while.  In your current file, you have the correct value of 
0.55.  How did you know this?  Did Riverside call you to tell you they were 
at 0.55 instead of 0.8?  Let me know.  Thanks.

Dan

I spoke with Kim Hundle and deal # 458802 is not with EES I wasn't sure if I 
had wrote the number down wrong or not.  Sorry.    I also spoke with Neil 
Bresnan after we had spoke and he had said it should be no problem getting 
you on the list.  I will check again and I apologize for the delay.
Thanks

We agree to pay a premium of $5 per MWH for power purchased by EPMI to cover 
EES's load during March. We will revisit this arrangement during the second 
half of March when it becomes clear what our on going load will be in 
Southern California. 

Thank you all again for your help over the last month !

I just checked this deal in Audit Viewer and found that Bob had entered it 
this afternoon, then backdated it for 1/8. I was going to ask him about the 
delivery point just as you called him - sorry we crossed paths. Let me know

I've had a request from Matt Motley to begin receiving this table on a daily 
basis. Carla Hoffman said Bob Badeer had asked for it before, and for 
whatever reason she held off distributing it to all the traders.

I'd like to know if there is some reason why we don't send the EOL table to 
all the traders on a daily basis. If not, may I copy them on this in the 
future?

Thanks,
Kate

This has been changed. And regarding the EES acquisition from the end of last 
year, I spoke with Kim Hundl briefly about it yesterday. I was a little 
unclear about the question in your e-mail to Carla, which was forwarded to 
me. Please give me a call or shoot me an e-mail, and we'll figure this out. 
Tracy Ngo, our Portland credit person, knows all about it, so between us we 
should be able to clarify this.

Thanks,
Kate

 I just received the e-mail regarding your visit to Portland (Monica Lande 
forwarded it to me). Regarding that, I would definitely be interested in 
gaining access to Livelink. Monica explained that Livelink is a system that 
allows one to view confirms, in which case it would greatly benefit my 
position to have access to it. I look forward to your visit, and to working 
with you in the future.

Matt doesn't have any trade like this for 1/8. I spoke with Judy at EES, and 
she's going to have Jubran call Matt to duke it out over whether or not this 
is a good trade. I'll let you know what those guys decide. 

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, 
Pwx called this mroning to verbal a deal that  was sleeved with EES.  I do 
not see it in system, although I see the deal on EES spreadsheet that I 
receive daily.
the deal is Enron Buys Pwx   Q4 2001 25mws   255.00  done direct  trade date 
1/8/01  Matt Motley trader
then Enron Sell EES  Q4 2001  25mws   $255.05

Should this be in the system and if so do you have deal numbers on the 
above.  I believe we sleeved the deal for EES and Pwx.  
Contact at EES, Judy (backoffice 7138535490)  Jubran Whalen is EES trader.

Thanks

Hey Mom!
Just wanted to give you my new email address!  Job is going well, I'll tell
you all about it when I have more time.  Also, new address is 515 Clarkson
#207, Denver 80218.  I'll let you know when I get my phone.  Apartment is
funky but big, good price, neat location.  Can you give me Kate's email
address?  Can't seem to find it.  Anyway, let me know when you get this so I
know it's working.  Hope all's well in Portland.  It has been gorgeously
sunny everyday here - snow on saturday!!  Also, I have a couple interviews
(one with Starbucks - whatever, it pays the bills!).  But if you can
possibly contribute to the something-for-me-to-sleep-on fund I would
appreciate it so much, as I am moving into my apartment on Monday and will
be bedless until my first paycheck.  Okay, tell everyone I said hi and that
I wish you were all here!  Love, Anna"

When you are scheduling the two Wheelabrator units, please use the following 
counterparties in CAPS:

MARTEL_2_AMFOR:  Wheelabrat
WSENGY_1_Unit 4:  WheelSHAST

We account for these separately and thus they need to be scheduled as two 
separate entities.  

In Enpower there are two counterparties set up as well:

MARTEL_2_AMFOR:  WHEELABRMA
WSENGY_1_Unit 4:  WHEELABRSH

Thanks and let me know if you have any questions,

Kourtney

Both Mike Swerzbin deals were in incorrectly. We've changed them, and added 
the last deal for Matt Motley. 

495106
Off Peak

495175
50 MW

Matt's deal should show up any minute.

Thanks,

Looks like Amerex has this in as a peak deal. Bob shows off-peak, says Amerex

Amerex checked out incorrectly - Mike Driscoll just talked to the broker, who 
was aware of that and said they would re-check out. Let me know if he 
communicates this to his back office.

Hey Kate! I received a BPA trade that Mike/Greg did and under Special 
Provisions on their confirmation it reads:

This is a remarket of Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Company power. KAC's 
point-to-point transmission agreement will be utilized. KAC's scheduling 
agent may request changes to the delivery point(s) under alternate point of 
delivery capabilities associated with KAC's transmission agreement. BPA shall 
accommodate the scheduling of such changes.

Is this language o.k. ?

Okay, it's taken me a while to track down the answer on this, but here it is. 
Apparently Greg Wolfe and Tim Belden just signed off on this confirm letter 
and faxed it down to you guys. Greg wasn't sure whose attention it had been 
put to, but hopefully the word got back to you that the confirm language was 
fine and the deal was signed off on. If you need another copy of the 
agreement, let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

Hey Kate! I received a BPA trade that Mike/Greg did and under Special 
Provisions on their confirmation it reads:

This is a remarket of Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Company power. KAC's 
point-to-point transmission agreement will be utilized. KAC's scheduling 
agent may request changes to the delivery point(s) under alternate point of 
delivery capabilities associated with KAC's transmission agreement. BPA shall 
accommodate the scheduling of such changes.

Is this language o.k. ?

Kimberly Indelicato

Okay, I know for a fact that Natsource has been yelled at by our traders at 
least once today. NONE of these deals should have broker fees on them. Here's 
the deal....

488121 - no fee
488122 - other side of spread - FEE

495306 - no fee GUARANTEED, says Tom Alonso

495206 - no fee
495207 - other side of spread - FEE

If they still dispute, let me know and I'll sick the traders on them. Sorry 
for the hassle.

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Everyone,

There is a new version of Deal Entry (Ver. 2.6.6.58)  in stage that needs to 
be User Acceptance Tested.

The changes were actually for Australia (wrong date/time showing, problem 
with EOL) and London (fix to default settings).
These changes should actually be invisible to Houston so you should see no 
difference between the way it was working before and now.

Please test the application (as you would normally use it) and let me know 
(by way of email or phone call) if Deal Entry is working well, and can be 
migrated to Production.  We are hoping to release it to Prod by this evening, 
(January 12, 2001).


Thanks, 
Nadine Costanzo (713)853-9863.

It looks great, Nadine. I entered a couple different deals and played around 
with them a bit, and I don't see any changes. So from my end you can go ahead 
and move this version to production.

Thanks for all the hard work.

Portland West Desk lawyers have completed the application to become a 
participant in the Dow Jones survey at NP-15 and SP-15 delivery points. As 
soon as possible, we would like to begin executing deals against these 
indices. In order to do this, we will need to access to them through EnPower, 
in both Deal Blotter and Deal Entry.

If you could facilitate the addition of these two indices into EnPower, we 
would appreciate having access to them by Tuesday. Please let me know what 
steps we need to take at the West Desk to help complete this process. To the 
best of my knowledge, we simply need the ability to choose the Dow Jones 
NP-15 or SP-15 index in the PubCode list in Deal Blotter and Deal Entry. We 
also need to be assured that when these deals are settled, the correct data 
will be pulled into EnPower from Dow Jones. 

Thank you for your help and cooperation. I will be in touch on Monday.

Welcome to the Official PGE PARK NEWSLETTER.  This newsletter has been
created by Portland Family Entertainment (PFE) to give you an insider's
view on PGE PARK, the home of the Triple A Baseball Portland Beavers and
A-League Soccer Portland Timbers.

For more information, please visit our web site at www.pgepark.com, or
call the Ticket Hotline at (503) 553-5555.

PGE PARK CONSTRUCTION OVERVIEW
When PGE Park is completed next spring, event patrons may be surprised
to see the magnitude of this exciting renovation.  In partnership with
the City of Portland, PFE will manage a $38.5 million renovation of the
former Civic Stadium to enhance fan enjoyment standards, meet modern
design codes and honor the historic character of this 1926 landmark.

Soon to be the premier outdoor event venue in the region, PGE Park will
feature:

*  New convertible playing surface, adaptable to all events.

*  New baseball dugouts and bullpens.

*  Major League Baseball field dimensions.

*  Vintage style wrought-iron fence along 18th Ave. allowing passerby a
view of all PGE Park events.

*  New seats and wider concourses.

*  New restrooms and baby-changing stations.

*  New concession stands and kiosks with improved menu options.

*  Fred Meyer Family Deck featuring an old-fashioned soda fountain.

*  Yet-to-be-named Widmer field level bar and grill, featuring grills
and full beverage service.

*  Affordable Pavilion Boxes, Field Boxes and Club Seats for
high-quality corporate entertainment.

*  State-of-the-art sound system and new theatre organ.

*  Americans with Disabilities (ADA) Compliance.

*  Current seismic code compliance.

*  ... and much more!

PGE PARK CONSTRUCTION UPDATE
Virtually every area of the construction site is currently under
construction.  From elevator pits and structural elements to field boxes
and underground utilities, it's all coming together for our Spring 2001
opening.

The main concourse along 20th Avenue (the first base side), demolished
during the Portland Rockies' season last summer, is re-emerging as a
wider, lowered concourse.  Steel beams and metal decking are being
placed for a major concrete pour in the near future.  This will be the
most visible reconstruction element to date in the project.

Concrete has already been poured at the field level in the area of the
new soon-to-be-named Widmer Bar and Grill.  This field-level area will
have both an open air patio and a space built under the seating bowl for
a true early 1920's bar feel.  Selecting your favorite bar stool for a
view of the game is only a few months away!

We will soon be adding a Construction Update Photo Gallery to
www.pgepark.com.  We will keep you posted on when this exciting feature
is added.  If you would like to receive photos as an attachment, please
email us at info@pgepark.com.


PFE NAMES TRIPLE-A AND SINGLE-A BASEBALL TEAMS
After an outpouring of fan feedback, Portland Family Entertainment went
with tradition when they announced that the Triple-A Baseball Pacific
Coast League club will be called the Portland Beavers.

""Baseball is a game deeply rooted in tradition,"" said Mike Higgins, PFE
vice president and Beavers general manager, who made the announcement.
""The name and logo will also integrate well with the nostalgic look and
feel that PGE Park will have when it opens next spring.""

Portland Family Entertainment also announced that it has named its
Northwest League Single-A Baseball Team the Tri-City Dust Devils.
Formerly the Portland Rockies, the Dust Devils will begin play in the
Tri-Cities Stadium in Pasco beginning summer 2001.

PFE partnered with the Marathon Media Group of Tri-Cities to conduct a
poll and contest of their radio listeners to select the team name.
Respondents were able to vote on the Marathon Media web site.
Richland's Rosalie Swanson was selected at random, from the many Dust
Devil entries, as the grand prizewinner of two club-level season tickets
for the team's inaugural season.

For information on Beavers Club Seats and Season Tickets, call
503.553.5555 or fill out our online questionnaire at
http://www.pgepark.com/old_site/infoform.html.


VANCOUVER'S RICK SWEET NAMED BEAVERS MANAGER
The San Diego Padres didn't have to search far to find the right guy for
the job as today Vancouver, Washington resident, Rick Sweet, was named
manager of the Pacific Coast League's Portland Beavers.  The Padres also
announced other additions to the Beavers staff including Darrel
Akerfelds as pitching coach; Roy Howell as coach, and John Maxwell as
the club's trainer.

""We felt it was important to hire a manager that had significant
managerial experience,"" said Tye Waller, Padres' director, player
development.  ""It was also important for us to hire someone who had ties
to the local community.  That's not always an easy combination to come
up with, but we clearly achieved that in hiring Rick.  Rick, Darrel and
Roy have all played in the big leagues and that experience will be a
tremendous asset in the development of our younger players.  In John we
have a first class trainer and will do a terrific job in looking after
our guys.""

Sweet has 12 seasons of experience as a minor league manager and was
named Pacific Coast League manager of the year in 1994, while managing
the Tucson Toros as they defeated the Portland Beavers for the PCL
championship.  He joins the Portland's new Triple-A team from the
Montreal Expos where he served as their minor league field coordinator
for the past two years.  During the 1998 season, Sweet managed the
Double-A Harrisburg Senators to the Eastern League title.

Sweet also reached the majors as a switch-hitting catcher with the Mets,
Seattle Mariners and Padres.  He made his major league debut on April 8,
1978 with the Padres.  Sweet homered in his first Kingdome at-bat after
joining Seattle in 1982.


CONWAY NAMED TIMBERS ASSISTANT COACH
The Portland Timbers have named former player, captain, and coach, Jimmy
Conway, as assistant coach for Portland's new A-League soccer club.
Through an agreement between the Timbers and Oregon Youth Soccer
Association (OYSA), Conway will continue to serve in his current role as
OYSA's director of coaching, a position he has held since 1982.

""Jimmy was my first choice for the position of assistant coach and I am
delighted that he was available to join our staff,"" said Timbers head
coach, Bobby Howe.  ""Not only is he an outstanding member of US Soccer's
National Coaching Staff, but he also has a first class international
playing background.  I also want to recognize and thank OYSA for their
spirit of cooperation in allowing us to 'share' with them Jimmy's
knowledge and experience.  I think it will be a great benefit for our
professional players and Oregon's youth soccer players.""

Prior to coaching, Conway had an outstanding playing career making 20
caps for the Republic of Ireland from 1966-1977.  As a midfielder,
Conway made over 300 appearances for Fulham in England's First Division,
where he scored 66 goals for the Cottagers.  In 1976, he transferred to
Manchester City of the English Premier League before joining the Timbers
in 1978.  He was named captain of the Timbers in 1979 and was promoted
to the position of player-coach in 1980 by then head coach, Don Megson.
He retired from playing professionally in 1982.


TIMBERS ADD SECOND TRYOUT DATE TO MEET DEMAND
The Portland Timbers announced today that they have reached capacity for
their first public tryout scheduled for Saturday, November 11 at Tigard
High School and will add a second public tryout in January to meet
demand.

The exact date, location, and other details for the Timbers second
tryout will be announced in December.  The November 11 Timbers Open
Tryout will feature players from the local market as well as New York,
Texas, Illinois, New Jersey, Minnesota, Iowa, California and Alabama.

The Timbers 28-game regular season will kick-off in late April 2001 and

Game the first week of October.  A-League opponents include the
archrival Seattle Sounders, Vancouver 86ers, Rochester Raging Rhinos,

""TIMESHARE"" PROGRAM ENABLES COMPANIES TO SHARE SUITES CONVENIENTLY AND
AFFORDABLY
Companies can now purchase PGE Park Pavilion and Field Boxes for a half-
or quarter-season, without having to go through the hassle of finding
their own sharing partner.  That means companies can enjoy a
high-quality corporate suite for as little as $9,845!  Companies
purchasing full and half-boxes save even more, with PFE paying the City
of Portland's 10% user fee.

Located directly behind and above home plate, Pavilion Boxes command
terrific sightlines for all sporting events.  If you're looking to
experience events from the players' perspective, discover more about our
Field Boxes.  Their unique ""dugout"" position offers one of the most
exciting locations in any U.S. ballpark.  Pavilion and Field Boxes
feature many convenient amenities including:

*  Reserved Parking Right Across the Street

*  Food and Beverage Service (with affordable prices and NO minimum
orders):  prices are the same
as if you purchased it yourself, but our wait staff gets it for you.
For your convenience, we will also offer a catering menu for advance
orders and planning.

*  Telephone and Television/Cable Service:  Pavilion and Field Boxes
even include a VCR so parents can keep young ones entertained with their
favorite videos.

*  Electronic Ticket Redistribution for your guests:  Have you ever sent
out your tickets, only to have a guest cancel their plans to join you?
Since our tickets are bar-coded, you don't have to worry about getting
the tickets back from your guest.  Our bar-coded tickets allow us to
reassign the tickets to another guest of your choice; tickets will be
waiting for them when they arrive at PGE Park.

*  Concierge Service and more!

As a special offer, companies purchasing Pavilion Boxes, Field Boxes or
Club Seats now receive a FREE 100-, 30- or 20-person Group Night at a

I'd like to enroll in the Enron Savings Plan program; however, when I was 
navigating through the savings plan website, I started wondering if the 
retirement plan and the self-directed brokerage account are the same thing. I 
think you probably have some information regarding these plans. Could I 
borrow that later this afternoon, or even better, sit down with you for a 
minute to clarify which plans I am eligible to enroll in and when? Thanks in 
advance for your time.

Kate - 

401K and the cash balance retirement plan are 2 separate plans.  You are 
automatically enrolled in the cash balance plan - you would be eligible to 
participate for the year 2000.  Going forward, at the end of each year, Enron 
will set aside 5% of your salary into an account (Enron directs these 
funds).  This account has a 5 year vesting period meaning that you must stay 
with the company for 5 years to be eligible to receive these funds when you 
leave. 

Does this help?

Amy

So I don't need to do anything in order to be a part of the ""cash balance 
plan""? When I pull up my account information from the ""Savings Plan"" website, 
it says my investments and balances are zero, so I assume I need to enroll in 
this myself if I want to be a part of it. The plan I'm referring to allows 
you to invest up to 15% of your before-tax income in either Enron Corp stock 
or a variety of mutual funds. In this plan, up to 6% of your contributions 
are matched by Enron, beginning one month after your hire date. I guess my 
question is - What is this plan called? And if I enroll in it myself online, 
will I be doubling up on something Enron has already done for me? If this is 
not the retirement plan, what is?

I'm sorry to ask so many trivial questions. I just want to make sure I've 
taken advantage of all the programs and not neglected opportunities because I 
thought they were automatically given to me.

Thanks,
Kate

Please find attached the Name Change/Merger Notification Report for January.  
To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select Enable Macros 
and Read Only.
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Feb 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.  "

TFS broker checked out wrong. We just spoke with him and he said he had 
corrected it with the back office. Should be cleared up now.

How goes it, girlfriend? I just got your message - sorry I haven't been in 
touch yet, and I can give you all the excuses in the book about how I've been 
swamped with work, play, life in general, but we both know I'm just flaky, so 
there's no point in explaining it.

Anyway, I'm so excited to hear you're doing well in your new Rocky Mountain 
dwelling, but you left me here with no good pissing and moaning (and getting 
""pissed"") buddies. So I checked out airfares to Denver, and found one for 
$118 roundtrip! Can you freakin' believe it? Anyway, you have to purchase and 
use the ticket by the end of March, so I was thinking a little spring break 
action was called for. Do you think you'd be settled enough by the end of 
March to accomodate a portly older sister for a few days? Let me know, and 
I'll do the deal.

Got to go - business abounds at Enron as usual. I'll try to drop you a line 
tonight when I have more time to write. Do you have a phone number? Amber was 
in Denver over the weekend, and she and Monica called me trying to get ahold 
of you, but I had no idea where to look. (Except somewhere in Denver, but 
from what I've heard it's a fairly big place.)

Write back soon, or call - I want to know how the internship is. But more 
importantly, how's the unlimited Starbucks coffee?

Love,
Kate"

Just wanted to let you know I haven't forgotten you. All our traders and 
schedulers have been in a meeting this afternoon, and as soon as they got out 
the frenzy of trading and scheduling began again. I'm going to give things a 
minute to settle down, and then ask around as to how people would like their 
Livelink training.

I'll get back to you soon.

Thanks,

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =
=20
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=
tee. =20
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20
management policy and corporate strategy.  The Enron Corporate Policy=20
Committee membership is also shown on the attached list.

 We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital =

Yo sista,

Sorry I've been so MIA.  You know how it is: move to a new city, lack the
money to buy groceries or put roof over head let alone purchase a calling
card.  I am enjoying my internship and even starbucks (it's kind of fun!),
but I am DEAD broke and trying to figure out how to pay rent this month.  So
I guess nothing's new . . .

Outward Bound is nice.  The ""office"" is an old renovated house about six
blocks from my apartment, which is a godsend when it snows (which it did
today, a lot).  The people here are generally really mellow - I'm sure you
can imagine.  Lots of ""bro!"", ""dude!"" and ""no worries!"" like we're
Australian surfers or something.  I actually heard somebody call some slides
(as in picture slides) the ""slidey-slides"" the other day.  But they're all
super nice, and I have my own desk and phone and voice mail, so I feel
important.  Starbucks is pretty fucking funny (again, use your imagination).
Everyone I work with is tall, skinny, male, goateed, and painfully in the
closet.  And you should hear the crap that people order - they actually have
a CODE for ""half-caf"" now.  Idiots - do you even know what actual coffee
tastes like?

So I heard you're moving in with Molly and Amber.  That should be fun.
Honestly, Kate, I love it here, but I think I'll be back sooner than I
thought.  I'm starting to think I could be really happy in Portland.  But
you can't beat the weather in Denver - it's sunny practically everyday!  And
the guys here know how to buy pants that fit properly over their shoes.  You
have to visit!  Our apartment is big and we could go out with Monica and it
would be really fun!  My phone number, by the way, is (303) 777-7132.  So
call me if you ever get those free long distance thingies that cell phones
tend to get.  Okay, let me know the gossip in p-town.  Love, anna

How goes it, girlfriend? I just got your message - sorry I haven't been in

So didya hear the Blazers creamed the Nuggets last night? I always knew the 
Pacific Northwest would dominate in sports - they're not battling with that 
ol' Rocky Mountain High if ya know what I mean.

Well I'm sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday - work was hectic and I 
knew that if I started an e-mail to you it would either be half-assed or I'd 
never finish it. Well, I'm going for the former now, because I realized there 
would never be a good time to divulge the full and sordid details of what's 
happening around here, and all the while I wait, more and more important 
nuggets (get it!) of gossip are accumulating.

So it's quite appropriate that you wrote yesterday with roommate issues - 
mine could not be worse. Amber took off for the ""library"" on Thursday night 
and came home.....four days later. After Molly and I had a mild freak-out 
session on Friday - which included calling everybody she's every known, 
including Chris and the police - we heard through the grapevine that Marky 
McCulloch, of Neidermeyer cousin fame, was in town from none other than 
Denver and the two were having a secret and James-Bond-like rendezvous at the 
beach. Well that was all well and fine, other than the fact that she DIDN'T 
TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and we had been planning a housewarming party this 
weekend for the past month and she DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and she 
moved kitty into the house but still hasn't told our landlords or paid the 
$500 deposit, oh, and also, SHE DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING. So many 
things were wrong and bizarre about that, but none more than her attitude 
when she walked in the door Monday afternoon. Let's just say I spared no lung 
muscles in telling her exactly what I thought about her selfish, childish, 
idiotic, and most importantly, psychotically self-important behavior. She had 
the gall to defensively scream back that she didn't tell us BECAUSE SHE 
DIDN'T WANT TO LIE. Hmmmm. Not only did she not want to lie - how sweet - but 
she couldn't have told us because Molly and I have suddenly developed an 
insatiable urge to spread fervent and widespread rumors about Amber's love 
trysts. Now, I KNOW there's nothing I'd rather be doing.

Anyway, enough of that. She and I have reached an understanding that just 
because we're roommates does not mean we have to be friends. We've never been 
good at that anyhow. In other news, we had an amazing housewarming party. I 
really wish you could have been there. Molly and I didn't know 90 percent of 
the people there, which is a good thing because it meant they were all 
interesting, successful, gracious and cute. I think there were about four 
girls there - you could tell who planned the party. Sadly, no love 
connections were made that evening, but I've decided that's my new M.O. - 
keep 'em guessing. My friend Michael from Maui who now lives in Seattle came 
down with his friend Jordan who happens to be hot and writing an article for 
Food & Wine magazine. Very interesting guy, but potentially in the closet, so 
I'm keeping my distance. But they invited me up to Seattle next weekend for a 
five-course meal and $100 bottles of wine at some Microsoft dude's mansion. 
Definitely sounds like my crowd. Should I wear my dirty jeans or my clean 
jeans?

I've got my eye on flights to Denver, but right now it's looking like the end 
of March before I can scrape up that kind of cash. Amber on the other hand 
will be there five times before that because some psycho over there keeps 
buying her tickets. That's fair for ya.

Okay, that's all I can do for now, but call me tonight and we'll do the rumor 
mill justice. Take care and hang in there - we'll be booting a roommate soon 
if you feel like coming back to Portland.

New! Five additional RealVideo-based powerpoint-based presentations, with the 
accompanying audio. Running about 30 minutes each, the new selections include:

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office, 
information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

MANAGING BILLING. The complex requirements for managing billing and

Officer, Peace Software.

execution, reduced transaction costs, increased number and frequency of 
transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to

the internet for energy markets. E. Russell ""Rusty"" Braziel, Chairman and 
Director, Altra Energy Technologies.

Thanks. Mike's looking it over. Says it's not okay until he talks with 
Cominco, so it probably won't get faxed back right away, since these guys are 
in the middle of a busy trading morning. But I'll call or e-mail as soon as 
they've worked out a revised confirmation.

This is to summarize our previous discussion:

EPMI took an assignment of ALL EEMC's (an affiliate of EES) deals with PG&E 
Energy Trading  - Power, L.P. (PGET) whereby EPMI is now buying all of the 
power from PGET.
EPMI then acts as ""sleeve"" for EES and sells the power to EES with a $.05 
sleeve fee
With respect to the specific EEMC deal # ACW672, EEMC originally was buying 
75MW from PGET at a price of $29.90.
After taking over EEMC's portfolio, EPMI, PGET and Avista Energy entered into 
a 3-party assignment, assumption and settlement agreement whereby EPMI and 
AvistaEnergy ""took out"" PGET of the picture for 50MW of the 75MW piece.
By doing so, EPMI thus is buying 50MW from Avista Energy and the remaining 
25MW still from PGET
The new 50MW piece from Avista Energy results in a purchase price of $29.80 
and a sale price of $29.85 to EES.  [the reason for the price decrease is 
because when we entered into the 3-party agreement, in order to ""take out"" 
PGET we had to pay them their profit in that deal stream ie monetizing their 
spread of $.10 per MW]
The remaining 25MW piece from PGET kept the SAME PRICING of $29.90 since we 
left that 25MW block alone.

If you have any additional questions, please call me.

Here's the latest I've heard from Willie Harrell, the Global Management staff 
member in charge of this job. I spoke with him briefly, and he said he 
expected to have the indices available in Enpower this afternoon. 

Jeff Richter is currently consumed with sorting out EES discrepancies for 
today, but we'll work on the new spreadsheets this afternoon.

I'll keep you posted.

Thanks,

Thanks! I handed off the fax to Christian, who said he was extremely busy

told by Chris Mallory that the most important issue is that all 
index-forwards get uniform confirmation language. As far as what that 
language is, I'm not sure. Is this different than the confirm letters you've 
received in the past? Let me know if you need me to expedite the process and

Kate,
I received and index trade into NP15 that Chris Mallory did. For Price the 
confirmations states: 

The average day ahead, post congestion price for the Constrained Price as 
published by the California Power Exchange for the on in the period of 
delivery stated herein plus 3.00.

Is this language o.k. to accept on the confirmation.

Thanks,

I'm so sorry it's taken me this long to get back to you. It's been truly 
chaotic around here with the California situation, and the lawyers are 
obviously preoccupied, so Christian hasn't gotten back to me yet. I finally 
went back to Chris Mallory, and we determined that the language in this 
confirm is fine as long as it matches the confirm language for the original 
deal - 459996. This was the sale to Constellation at index + $1, but now that 
we're trying to clear all our positions with the California Power Exchange, 
we had to buy it back at index + $3. Does that make any sense, or am I just 
rambling? It's been a long day. Check the confirm for 459996, and make sure 
485446 matches up. Otherwise, call me.

Thanks for your patience,
Kate

This deal is with PG&E.  I thought they were going into bankruptcy.  Can you 
check and see if this is a wrong co name or what.

You're right - bankruptcy is a likely move for PG&E. But this deal was 
entered in place of an existing position we had with PG&E in the California 
Power Exchange, and it's been approved by our legal and credit departments.

Let me know if you have further questions.

Thanks,
Kate

498837 has been changed to Natsource.

499013 - Mike Swerzbin disputes this checkout - has 190.00 price in trade log 
and checked out at that price with his broker at APB. Now they're having APB 
look into it. I'll let you know when they resolve the price.

499013 was changed to a price of 180. Mike is having the broker pull their 
tapes for today, but we won't get that information until tomorrow. In the 
meantime, we're giving them the benefit of the doubt. I'll let you know if 
anything else changes.

Who's ready to rhumba? Crystal Ballroom holds salsa classes on the first 
Tuesday of every month. The hour-long class begins at 7p.m., with live music 
and dancing afterward. Cost is $8 for the whole evening. The other Tuesdays 
of the month have live music and dancing, no class unfortunately. Anyway, I'm 
sure it won't take us more than an hour to become master Latin dancers on par 
with Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera.

Do you want to try it out? Next class is Feb. 6. Mark your calendars and tell 
all your coordinated (and/or good-looking) friends to come along.

I think you're right, but the trader just took off for lunch. I'll check with 
him and kill the duplicate deal if necessary, then let you know when it's 
done.

Just spoke with Sean Crandall - he killed deal #499391. This has happened 
before, and seems to be a glitch in Deal Blotter when traders enter off peak 
deals. I'll talk with IT about it; but thanks for catching this in the 
meantime.

I've run across what seems to be a glitch in Deal Blotter; although it may be 
caused by the default settings in a specific trader's blotter. A few times 
over the last several weeks, our traders at the Short Term Southwest desk 
have entered off peak deals by choosing the ""off"" selection under the ""Hours"" 
heading. But the mask doesn't change to include Sundays and Holidays, and the 
traders then enter another deal to compensate for this. What we've found then 
is that the original deal did in fact include a strip for Sundays and 
Holidays, round-the-clock hours.

My question is - when you enter an off-peak deal in Deal Blotter, does it 
automatically read that as Mon. through Sat. off-peak hours AND Sundays and 
Holidays round-the-clock? Even though the mask does not change to show 
Sundays and Holidays? I'm just wondering if there is an easier way to assure 
that we've entered off-peak deals correctly other than double-checking them 
in Deal Entry.

Please call or e-mail when you get a chance. Again, this could be just a 
matter of incorrect settings in someone's blotter; but I'd like to make sure 
either way.

Thanks for your time,
Kate"

Mike Swerzbin is going to contact the trader at SCEM - these are good deals. 
They were originally done on EOL, then changed to direct trades. Once they 
talk, I'll get back to you and let you know if they decided to keep or kill 
the deals.

Thanks,

Mike Swerzbin is going to contact the trader at SCEM - these are good deals. 
They were originally done on EOL, then changed to direct trades. Once they 
talk, I'll get back to you and let you know if they decided to keep or kill 
the deals.

Thanks,
Kate

Sorry I didn't get back to you on this sooner - Mike Swerzbin talked with his 
SCEM trader that day, and they agreed to both of these deals. Just to 
clarify, there are still two EOL trades that net out these direct trades. All 
four are good. Direct trade deal numbers are:

493989
Sell SCEM
Jun-01
198.00
Mid-C

493988
Sell SCEM
Jun-01
195.00
Mid-C

Let me know if SCEM back office still has no record of these. Otherwise, 
they're good to go.

Thanks,
Kate

It's Matt Motley's deal, but all the traders just got out of a meeting, so 
they're still entering deals. It should show up any minute.

Kate, I have a couple of confirms I received from BPA with the following 
info. I spoke with BPA and they said that their trader had talked to Sean 
Crandall and agreed to Mid Columbia as the Delivery point, however in the 
Enpower they have Northwest Delivered. Could you please check into:

#492613.01, 492612.01, 492611.01, 488524.01, 488523.01 These all say NW in 
the system but BPA has Mid C on confirm

#491609.01 This trade has a trade date of 1/8/01. But on BPA's confirm they 
have a trade date of 1/5/01. Could you ask Mike who did the trade which is 
correct?

Thanks,

Re: the BPA deals - Sean Crandall said for pricing purposes it doesn't matter 
whether the delivery point is in as Mid-C or NW delivered. The only reason he 
entered NW delivered is because there was transmission involved. For your 
purposes, Sean said it's fine to change the delivery point to Mid-C (NW 
Delivered) in the confirms, but he didn't want to have it changed in EnPower 
because that would mess with the routing.

Does that make any sense? Let me know if you need it changed in EnPower, and 
I'll talk to Sean.

Thanks,
Kate

We will be short in Real Time Position Manager both at NP-15 and SP-15 for 
1/18/01 until Friday morning. It seems that four deals were entered by EES 
under the wrong desk, affecting our position instead of theirs. Following are 
the details of where, when, why and by how much we're out. Read this 
carefully....

SP-15 - Short 1950.64 MW
 Deal #500492 - 67.89 MW short off peak
 Deal #500493 - 87.97 MW short on peak

NP-15 - Short 2883.08 MW
 Deal #500494 - 102.61 MW short off peak
 Deal #500495 - 128.89 MW short on peak

If any one of you has better luck than I have at accessing EES deals in deal 
entry, by all means get rid of these. Or if you happen to speak with Suneet 
Sharma, our good friend who entered the deals in question, by all means tell 
him to do the same.

Thanks,
Kate"

On Saturday, January 13, 2001, an earthquake shook Central America.  The 
earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.6, was centered off of El Salvador's 
central coast.  The death toll is currently at 700, and the damage has been 
estimated at nearly $1 billion, nearly half of the country's annual budget.  

Enron employees are encouraged to donate to relief efforts and to take 
advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your 
donation.  Enron will match, dollar for dollar, every donation that you make, 
up to $15,000 annually per employee.  Listed below are a multitude of 
organizations that are offering aid to the victims of this earthquake.  To 
print a Matching Gift form, please click here and then click on gifts, grants 
and giving.  Please fill out the form and send it with your check to 
3AC-1409.  We will send the money collected, along with a check from Enron 
for the same amount, to each of the organizations.  Please make sure to write 
""El Salvador"" on your check.  

If you have any questions, please contact Misha Siegel via email.  
Thank you, in advance, for your support!

GLOBAL FLASH

UK Gas Update
This week the Bacton- Zeebrugge Interconnector surprised the market by=20
switching flow direction from UK Import to Export despite European spot=20
prices being lower than UK prices.  The Interconnector's operating rules=20
allow this to happen at present. Several shippers are lobbying to have thes=
e=20
rules amended to be able to react more quickly to market forces.  This flow=
=20
direction switch coincided with the recent cold snap increasing demand=20
substantially to 430mcm which in turn has resulted in a surge in prompt UK=
=20
prices. =20

EOL activity during this period has been particularly active as we benefit=
=20
from the increased volatility in the market.=20

Enron has several fuel switching options at our Teesside installations whic=
h=20
we use to protect our positions.

Fine weather in Japan
Over the New Year, Enron Japan completed a weather transaction with BTM,=20
which acted as a broker to the deal.  The deal, whereby we bought the optio=
n,=20
involved a Jan/Feb average temperature call with a maximum payout of 500 mi=
ll=20
JPY.   The transaction acted as a trigger leading to further transactions. =
=20
While not a major deal financially, this deal is significant as it offers a=
n=20
indication that the Japanese weather market is developing and is growing in=
=20
size.  Takuro Shioda in our Tokyo office did a great job during the=20
negotiations. =20

TPS Gains ISO 14001 Accreditation
On 30th November Teesside Power Station gained accreditation to the=20
internationally recognised Environmental Management System (EMS) ISO 14001=

standard.

ISO 14001 is an international standard that specifies the requirements for =

third-party certification. The accreditation will encourage cultural change=

by establishing disciplines that ensure policy objectives are met and a=20

I see that both of these deals have counterparty contact names in them now - 
did this get taken care of by somebody else? I'm sorry for the late response 
- I was out sick on Friday. Let me know if there's something else I can do on 
these deals.

I thought this was important information for you to have. 


RAPE   -   Self Protection 


Hi, girls!  I just finished taking the most amazing self-defense class, 
sponsored by Shandwick, and I wanted to share some really valuable info with 
you before it goes out of my head. 

The guy who taught the class has a female friend who was attacked last year 
in the parking garage at Westport Plaza in St. Louis one night after work 
and taken to an abandoned house and raped.  He started a women's group and 
began teaching these classes soon after.  This guy is a black belt in karate 
and trains twice a year with Steven Segall.  He and the others in this group 
interviewed a bunch of rapists and date rapists in prison on what they look 
for and here's some interesting facts: 

The #1 thing men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle.  They are most 
likely to go after a woman with a ponytail, bun, braid or other hairstyle 
that can easily be grabbed.  They are also likely to go after a woman with 
long hair.  Women with short hair are not common targets. 

The second thing men look for is clothing.  They will look for a woman who's 
clothing is easy to remove quickly.  The #1 outfit they look for is overalls 
because many of them carry scissors around to cut clothing and on overalls 
the straps can be easily cut. 

They also look for women on their cell phone, searching through their purse 
or doing other activities while walking because they are off guard and can 
be easily overpowered. 

The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape a woman is in the 
early morning, between 5 and 8:30 a.m. 

The number one place women are abducted from/attacked at is grocery store 
parking lots.  Number two is office parking lots/garages. 
Number three is public restrooms. 

The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a woman and 
quickly move her to a second location where they don't have to worry about 
getting caught.  Only 2% said they carried weapons because rape carries a 
3-5 year sentence but rape with a weapon is 15-20 years. 

If you put up any kind of a fight at all, they get discouraged because it 
only takes a minute or two for them to realize that going after you isn't 
worth it because it will be time-consuming.  These men said they will not 
pick on women who have umbrellas, or other similar objects that can be used 
from a distance, in their hands.  Keys are not a deterrent because you have 
to get really close to the attacker to use them as a weapon. 

So, the idea is to convince these guys you're not worth it.  Several defense 
mechanisms he taught us are: 

? If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage or 
with you in an  elevator or stairwell, look them in the face and ask them a 
question,  like what time is it, or make general small talk, I can't believe 
it is  so cold out here, we're in for a bad winter. Now you've seen their 
face and could identify them in a lineup, you lose appeal as a target. 

? If someone is coming toward you, hold out your hands in front of you 
and yell Stop or Stay back!  Most of the rapists this man talked to said 
they'd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed that she would not be 
afraid to fight back.  Again, they are looking for an EASY target. 

? If you carry pepper spray (this instructor was a huge advocate of it 
and carries it with him wherever he goes), yelling I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY and 
holding it out will be a deterrent. 

? If someone grabs you, you can't beat him with strength but you can 
by outsmarting him.  If they grab your wrist, pull your wrist back so your 
hand is in waving position (palm facing forward) and twist it toward 
yourself and pull your arm away.  It is hard to hold onto wrist bones that 
are moving in that way.  They stumble toward you and you stumble back, so 
you can use that momentum to bring the same out and backhand them with your 
knuckles in the forehead, nose or teeth. 

? If you are grabbed around the waist from behind, pinch the attacker 
either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or in the upper inner 
thigh.  HARD.  One woman in a class this guy taught told him she used the 
underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her and was so upset she 
broke through the skin and tore out muscle strands - the guy needed 
stitches.  Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand 
it.  It hurts. 

? After the initial hit, always go for the groin.  I know from a 
particularly unfortunate experience that if you slap a guy's   balls (sorry 
to be graphic) it is extremely painful.  You might think that you'll piss 
the guy off and make him want to hurt you more, but the thing these rapists 
told our instructor is that they want a woman who will not cause a lot of 
trouble.  Start causing trouble and he's out of there. 

? When the guy puts his hands up to you, grab his first two fingers 
and bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing down on 
them as possible.   The instructor did it to me without using much pressure 
and I ended up on my knees and both knuckles cracked audibly. 


Of course, the things we always hear still apply.  Always be aware of your 
surroundings, take someone with you if you can and if you see any odd 
behavior, don't dismiss it, go with your instincts.  You may feel a little 
silly at the time, but you'd feel much worse if the guy really was trouble. 

Please forward this to any woman you know, it's simple stuff that could save 
her life.

of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet

considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

Kate-
Can you verify with Mark that there were two identical trades done on Jan 8, 
2001

Enron Sells Southern California Edison
100 mws
sp-15
165.00
jan 10-31, 2001

We received an executed confirmation letter from the cp but the deal number 
is not avaliable (the fax machine cut off the deal number)  {just collecting 
all the confirms for the California situation.}

the deal numbers I have located are 492137.01, 492152.01
Just making sure  one is not a duplicate.

Kate,

If you would you, please start to draft a letter to the vendors for the 
solicitation of the raffle gifts?  We will probably need two letters, one to 
thank the vendor for their participation last year (I have the list of 
donated items) and another for new vendors that we will be soliciting.  

Here are a few points we need to make:

Thanks for particpating last year
Name the charity(s), a worthy cause type thing
State they are a current vendor in our system
The vendor name will be announced at the party, good advertising
Attach the article from last year

There may be more, but that is what comes to mind right now.  Since we will 
be using the merge feature we can insert the name of the vendor in the body 
of the letter.

Thanks!

Mollie"

of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet

Please find attached the FINAL Name Change/Merger Notification Report for 
January.  To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select 
""Enable Macros"" and ""Read Only"".   The Jan 01 Changes tab summarizes 
additions to the report since Jan. 15.  
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Feb 1

For more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.

This is the deal that was originally in as not to be confirmed and was 
changed to be confirmed.  Well, I have confirmed twice because it keeps going 
into pending status.   The auditor indictes that carla is going into the deal 
and changing something that causes it to go into pending.  Can you check into 
this and find out what she is changing, if we need to keep sending revised 
confirmations, wha'sssss uuup with this deal?

Thanks! "

Sorry for the delay - it's taken me a while to track down the answer to this, 
because Chris Foster, the trader on this deal, is still unclear as to the 
answer. Basically, the deal keeps getting cut by the Cal-ISO, which is why 
Carla goes in and changes the volumes sometimes. But Chris thinks that in the 
end we might not be cutting the deal financially, just physically on a 
day-by-day basis. Given that, we only need the first, original confirm sent 
out - if revised confirms have been sent, let's go ahead and send them the 
original one and leave it at that. 

Chris Foster said he would get back with me this afternoon - he's meeting 
with Real Time and Schedulers right now to sort out this issue.  I apologize 
that this wasn't more clear before. Should I add a note in the comments 
section of this deal to clarify? Or should I just check the deal back to ""no 
confirm""? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

Hey again!
Thanks for the quick response!  Damn!  Anyway, I'm bummed that you don't
have your ticket down here for that weekend, but there are PLENTY of other
weekends to come visit.  I'll be here for a while.  We'll plan something
soon.  I think that weekend I may ask for a couple days off and drive up to
Bend.  I wonder if it's cheaper to drive than to fly?  I'll let you know
what I'm doing and maybe you can come down and visit...or I'll be up in
Portland soon anyway.

Sooooo - Your house sounds SO awesome!  That's such a cool neighborhood,
too!  I can't believe you're moving on Friday.  I know what you mean about
things like that sucking all of your money away.  kate, I'm sooo sick of my
job these days.  I'm seriously going to spend my weekend looking for fun
things to do with my life.  I really want to be a massage therapist!  How
fun would that be.  I just want to do something that I like doing and not
something that i have to do because i need money.  I guess I need money
anyway, but it's brutal!

We are too young for this I swear.  If you're ever ready to move somewhere
exotic, let me know.  I'm down to go whenever!  It's funny that you said you
look like a real-life ash tray...I seriously got out of my car this morning
on my way to work and caught a glimpse of myself in the window reflection
and had to stop and drop my jaw.  I seriously look like a puffy-eyed old
hag!  Its highly disturbing.  I'm calling my hairdresser NOW to make an
appointment for a cut and color.  :)  don't i sound so cheesy?  I love it!

So write me soon!  How's amber doing?  Still with that new guy, malcom?  :)
Hows your boy life?  Any prospects?

Write more soon!  I'm bored.

Love ya!
Joan

Joaner Boner -
Well, in my usual slacker fashion, I haven't bought my plane ticket yet -
so I totally think you should go to Sunriver. I might come visit you there
if there's room. But an S.F. visit is imminent, I swear. I'll call you soon
to discuss the alcoholism of your co-worker/boyfriend, as well as the
techniques for acquiring this sexy body for the new year. Work is consuming
my life and eating me whole - very chaotic what with hiding all the power
from you guys and whatnot. Imagine the pressure. Another reason it might
not be the best time for me to come is that I'm moving on Friday. Amber and
Molly and I found a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's
kickass. But it's sucked away all of my money and will probably take over
every free moment for the next month just to get it set up. If you want,
you should stop by for a sleep over on your way to Bend. We'll throw a
party. And what's up with the wrist disease? Are you not taking your
calcium or something? I'm convinced that these wacky desk jobs are aging us
youthful beauties prematurely. At least that's the excuse I like to give
when I come in to work looking like I just bathed in a life-sized ashtray.
Call me soon - I'm really curious to find out why Brooks is doing the
chicken dance EVER let alone in your room in the middle of the night.
Wheeew!

Happy Sexy Body New Year,
Kate

Subject:  Sexy Body for the New Year!!!


Hey Kate -
My subject line is a duplicate of an email I received this morning from
some
beauty .com site.  Steve Cross puts me on all of these stupid mailing
lists,
so I thought I'd be retarded and put that in my subject line because it's a
stupid subject!

Anyway, how are you doing these days?  I wanted to write and see if you
really got your ticket to come visit over President's Day weekend!  I
totally want you to come down!!!  I'd be so excited.  If you don't, though,
I think I'm going to look into going up to Bend for the weekend to chill in
SunRiver and snowboard a little!  Maybe you could meet me there and stay w/
me at my parents house?  Ash is going up for sure.  If you're coming down
here, that's GREAT!  I'd be SOOO excited.

I'm on complete crack today, if you can't tell.  I have carpal tunnell,
too.
Last night I woke up at 2am to Brooks coming home from a drunken night out
and he started doing the chicken dance in my room and almost knocked over
my
entire shelf, tv, etc.  Then he started babbling about nothing, passed
straight out and started totally snoring.  So I didn't get back to sleep
until like 4:30 and had to wake up at 6.  I was livid this morning.  I'm
such a bitch, but I need my sleep!  Dammit.

Anyway, write soon!   I miss you!
joan

hey - how's your sexy body? don't have much time right now, but thought i'd 
drop a line to tell you that i'm so broke i'm considering picking up some 
unmentionable weekend job and therefore cannot make it down there for 
prezzy's day weekend. i'm so pissed! but it will happen soon - and anytime 
you're up here you need to stay with me - we have a guest bedroom for gosh 
sakes. also, i met malia at a party the other weekend - talk about a freakin' 
small world! she was so sweet, but then i'm not surprised - she'd have to be 
to put up with you. (ha, ha) anyway, take care, call me soon, and toast my 
absence with a bottle of wine tonight.

Following are the prices for fixed sales between EPMI Short Term California 
and EES for 1/25. Chris Mallory has turned this task over to me, and I'm 
working from my own spreadsheet, which I inadvertently deleted this morning. 
Please let me know if you'd like a copy of the spreadsheet as well as the 
prices each morning, or if the prices are sufficient. 

NP-15
 On Peak - $273.50
 Off Peak - $204.43

SP-15
 On Peak - $216.53
 Off Peak - $189.35

Thanks,
Kate"

If you would put a note in the comment section in deal entry, that would be 
great.

Sorry for the delay - it's taken me a while to track down the answer to this, 
because Chris Foster, the trader on this deal, is still unclear as to the 
answer. Basically, the deal keeps getting cut by the Cal-ISO, which is why 
Carla goes in and changes the volumes sometimes. But Chris thinks that in the 
end we might not be cutting the deal financially, just physically on a 
day-by-day basis. Given that, we only need the first, original confirm sent 
out - if revised confirms have been sent, let's go ahead and send them the 
original one and leave it at that. 

Chris Foster said he would get back with me this afternoon - he's meeting 
with Real Time and Schedulers right now to sort out this issue.  I apologize 
that this wasn't more clear before. Should I add a note in the comments 
section of this deal to clarify? Or should I just check the deal back to ""no 
confirm""? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

This is the deal that was originally in as not to be confirmed and was 
changed to be confirmed.  Well, I have confirmed twice because it keeps going 
into pending status.   The auditor indictes that carla is going into the deal 
and changing something that causes it to go into pending.  Can you check into 
this and find out what she is changing, if we need to keep sending revised 
confirmations, wha'sssss uuup with this deal?

Could you fax over the original confirm so Chris can look it over and make 
sure we won't need additional language or confirms sent? I just want to make 
sure he's aware of everything that's going on and backs up my comment in the 
deal.

Thanks,

This is the original confirmation letter we sent out.



Unfortunately, before I found out anything about all this, I sent out a 
revised confirmation when the deal was changed and went into a pending 
status.  This is the revised confirmation letter that went out.



These are the only two that have been sent to the counterparty.  I have put a 
note into the TAGG system that should let us know not to send another revised 
confirmation.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Chris looked these over and we agreed to just re-send the original 
confirmation letter, because the ISO may make cuts again - in fact, the 
revised confirm is no longer correct. I put a comment in the deal instructing 
no revised confirms to be sent, per Chris Foster.

Also, Chris noticed that the counterparty contact name in the letters was 
incorrect. The new contact at ARCO is Alicia Izarraraz. Her number is (562) 
499-3234. I hope this helps.

Thanks,
Kate

Diana Scholtes was the trader on these. She's not in today, but Sean Crandall 
said that a 1/8 trade date was okay. I've changed all the deals.

Hey dork!

Just wondering how it's going over there in P-town.  I am doing well.  I
applied for a job here at Outward Bound, so I may be staying here for
awhile.  I met a super-cute guy who I will have to tell you all about - I
think this may actually become a normal relationship or something of the
like.  Michelle and I are doing well, although her decorating style bothers
me a little.  First of all, she's obsessed with candles.  Our living room
looks like the parlor at a whorehouse.  Are you still coming to visit?  I
hope so!

Also, can you send me Monica's phone number if you think of it?  I feel
settled in enough now to call her.  Tell me what's up with you!  Any big guy
stories?  Moved yet?  Let's chat.  Love, Anna"

See attached summary for some excellent FERC decisions thanks to regulatory 
affairs in Houston and D.C.  Given that FERC appears to be applying some of 
these decisions to all utilities in these regions, I would assume we could 
argue that the FERC requirements should apply in the West too.

Subject: FERC Staff Investigations on Midwest and Southeast Bulk Power Systems


On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power 
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a 
Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff 
(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of 
information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed 
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller 
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no 
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically 
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, 
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the 
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement 
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by 
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other 
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to 
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of 
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff 
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of 
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro 
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply 
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and 
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions 
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports 
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well 
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such 
standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that 
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that 
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could 
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics 
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a 
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the 
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a 
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the 
commodity and services.  

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, 
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission 
Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such, 
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service 
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff 
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information 
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated 
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack 
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants 
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an 
""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with 
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were 
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and 
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even 
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The 
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are 
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose 
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission 
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open 
Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to 
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission 
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, 
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market 
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an 
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In 
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased 
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one 
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for 
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe 
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction 
increased in the Midwest.  

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information 
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for 
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission 
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and 
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and 
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, 
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs 
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market 
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully 
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, 
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that 
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed 
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the 
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching 
the Rules for Fun and Profit."")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, 
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided 
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper 
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all 
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and 
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO 
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security 
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region 
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The 
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit 
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is 
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of 
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially 
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas 
of non-compliance.  

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, 
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow 
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information 
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under 
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a 
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption 
and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could 
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the 
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, 
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits 
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have 
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have 
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide 
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the 
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the 
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on ""passively"" 
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory 
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, 
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.


Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (""VIU"") model has 
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the 
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs 
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due 
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, 
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and 
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the 
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development 
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and 
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted 
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the 
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have 
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to 
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform 
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant 
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this 
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than 
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were 
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better 
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased 
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to 
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to 
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE 
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence 
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be 
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence 
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes 
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how 
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns 
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation 
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In 
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff 
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of 
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access 
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack 
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In 
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission 
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to 
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied 
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the 
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting 
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a 
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without 
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication 
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises 
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive 
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by 
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC 
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do 
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs 
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In 
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated 
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the 
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, 
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same 
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision 
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a 
""problem area"" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission 
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law 
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of 
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong 
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In 
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists 
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the 
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park 
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the 
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including 
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange 
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to 
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an 
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not 
displayed in error.  It is ""up to individual Managers discretion.""  ((FRCC 
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine 
competition.

Oh wow - don't tell me you're a NUGGETS fan now! That is so wrong. I can't 
write for long just now because the ever-flourishing energy crisis is keeping 
us all very busy here at The Big Ron, as I so affectionately call it. Right 
now I'm on the cusp of either becoming a raging workaholic or cashing in my 
chips to become a professional beach bum. I know I already tried that and 
thought it wasn't for me, but trust me, one more month of this crap Portland 
weather and I'll ship myself right over to the Caribbean. And yes, I'm 
definitely coming to visit. It won't be for a couple months because this 
house move is going to set me back a bit. Let's just say I'm hoping I'll be 
so poor I'll be forced to lose weight in February. But I'm really excited - 
we move in on Friday - and the house is so cute. You have to at least come 
home to visit sometime so you can see it. I might even bring Kitty over, but 
Molly vehemently opposed the idea, and you know how Kitty doesn't like to be 
unsettled once she's staked her territory. (Big Kitty lives in daily fear.) 
Anyway, call me soon - you can call collect, or call and yelp into the phone 
and hang up - I'll know it's you and call back.

I'm stoked you're liking Denver - I really have to experience this ""Rocky 
Mountain High"" for myself. Please don't turn into a stoner ski bum and lose 
all fashion sense to the point of mistaking Patagonia and Tevas for catwalk 
wear. Hey, and you need to tell me more about this ""normal"" guy. You've got 
to watch out for those, you know - that's how the truly psycho ones disguise 
themselves. No, don't listen to me - I'll be bitter and single till I'm so 
old I have to get cats and live out my life like the crazy woman that I am. 
And this obsession with candles? You know you could head that off by setting 
up hundreds and hundreds of smoke alarms all over the house, or tell her that 
you just saw a special on 20/20 about houses burning down via over-decoration 
with candles. 

Hey - do you have a freaking job there? That's the only thing I haven't heard 
about. You must like it or you wouldn't have applied to stay, but I need 
DETAILS, I need DIRT. Call me soon, we'll dish.

Love,
Kate

Hey dork!

Just wondering how it's going over there in P-town.  I am doing well.  I
applied for a job here at Outward Bound, so I may be staying here for
awhile.  I met a super-cute guy who I will have to tell you all about - I
think this may actually become a normal relationship or something of the
like.  Michelle and I are doing well, although her decorating style bothers
me a little.  First of all, she's obsessed with candles.  Our living room
looks like the parlor at a whorehouse.  Are you still coming to visit?  I
hope so!

Also, can you send me Monica's phone number if you think of it?  I feel
settled in enough now to call her.  Tell me what's up with you!  Any big guy
stories?  Moved yet?  Let's chat.  Love, Anna

I should forward the information on to you for use in the next floor card.

New! Five additional RealVideo-based powerpoint-based presentations, with the 
accompanying audio. Running about 30 minutes each, the new selections include:

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office, 
information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

RETAIL: WHAT WENT WRONG, HOW TO FIX IT. Retail electric deregulation has thus 
far been an underwhelming success, but a great deal has been learned, and it 
is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

MANAGING BILLING. The complex requirements for managing billing and

CIS and CRM technology. Energy Retailers must embrace the next evolution of

Officer, Peace Software.

execution, reduced transaction costs, increased number and frequency of 
transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to 
energy markets wrought by the web, and it's just beginning. Implecations of 
the internet for energy markets. E. Russell ""Rusty"" Braziel, Chairman and 
Director, Altra Energy Technologies.

There were quite a few changes made yesterday.  Please see the attached 
notification report for the summary and detail.

IT TAGG - Please note that short name changes will come from the Jan 2001 
report AND Feb 2001 report.  I will begin making the changes tomorrow at 10:a 
as usual.

The font and page size for this report has been reduced but feel free to 
change the page set up as needed.  The reason the report is set up on A4 
paper is that A4 prints automatically anywhere in the world.  Legal paper 
isn't readily available everywhere, so this format is the best compromise.

Happy Monday - or whenever it is that you are blessed with the receipt of 
this message. A funny thing happened to me on my way to upload the PX deals 
on Friday. I went to process the data and was rudely stopped by an error 
message stating the following:

Error establishing lock on Trader ID and Trader Date: Trader Already Locked 
(_InboxAC11AC92.913Aoc376A1622250.4) 

Interesting, isn't it? So I entered the PX deals manually and went along my 
merry way. Just thought you should know."

Ernest - I was just wondering if I'll start getting e-mails reporting the 
NP-15 and SP-15 indices. Are these reports generated? If so, who should I 
contact to get them? Thanks for all your help in this matter.

505434 - Killed.

505066 - Changed to APB.

505313 - Changed to APB. (505229 - Kept the same.)

Hope this all makes sense - for not trading much today these guys are 
screwing up left and right!

Ernest - I was just wondering if I'll start getting e-mails reporting the
NP-15 and SP-15 indices. Are these reports generated? If so, who should I
contact to get them? Thanks for all your help in this matter.

These two deals are entered with a special counterparty name that looks like 
it may have been set up for some special deal.  There is another counterparty 
name out there that looks just the same only without the very last series of 
letters.  I will check here and see if anyone knows the difference.  There is 
a note in the Global System that says Heather Dunton had this CP set up.  If 
you could check with her and see if it should be used for these deals or if 
the other CP should be used.

I checked with Heather, and it turns out this second NCPA counterparty 
shortname was set up to distinguish between two different SC numbers. But 
it's only for internal use - both counterparty names have the same billing 
information, etc. So Heather said the deals are fine as they are. I'm going 
to find out more about this after the afternoon rush dies down - just so 
we'll know for the future when to use which shortname.

Kate

I checked in Jeff's trade log - he just stepped into a meeting - and 504970 
had been crossed out to show 50 MW. But 505118 only has 25 MW. Does this 
sound correct? I'm a little confused about what you're asking - should the 
deals match at 50 MW on peak? Or is one 25 and one 50?

I just want to clarify something, because we were here until about 9 p.m. 
last night trying to flatten our position, and just figured out this morning 
that we were off due to the Williams deal that I changed yesterday evening. 
Apparently Jeff Richter didn't do any deals with Williams for 50 MW through 
APB, but he did do one for 50 MW with Prebon. So I'm wondering why APB was 
checking out like this? If possible, I'd like to avoid this in the future. 
Let me know if you can find anything out from APB.

Thanks,
Kate

A fellow employee has been diagnosed with the measles.  If you have any 
concerns, I would encourage you to contact your physician.  

The employees who are most at risk are:
Women who are pregnant.
Anyone who has not been immunized and has not had the measles.

If you require a visit to the doctor for a vaccination or check-up as a 
result of potentially being exposed to the measles, Enron will reimburse you 
for your medical co-pay.  Please submit a copy of your receipt to me for 
processing.

If you have any questions or I can be of further assistance, please contact

If it doesn't make any difference, I will change these to the other CP name.  
This one is not attached to templates and would need some database changes to 
prepare a confirmation under this name.  If this is not ok, let me know.

I checked with Heather, and it turns out this second NCPA counterparty 
shortname was set up to distinguish between two different SC numbers. But 
it's only for internal use - both counterparty names have the same billing 
information, etc. So Heather said the deals are fine as they are. I'm going 
to find out more about this after the afternoon rush dies down - just so 
we'll know for the future when to use which shortname.

These two deals are entered with a special counterparty name that looks like 
it may have been set up for some special deal.  There is another counterparty 
name out there that looks just the same only without the very last series of 
letters.  I will check here and see if anyone knows the difference.  There is 
a note in the Global System that says Heather Dunton had this CP set up.  If 
you could check with her and see if it should be used for these deals or if 
the other CP should be used.

Thanks!

That sounds fine - in fact, I think in this case that Sean Crandall just hit 
the wrong counterparty name. Since this looks like it might be a problem for 
you guys in creating confirms, I'll let the traders know to be sure of which 
NCPA shortname they're choosing.

it may have been set up for some special deal.  There is another counterparty 
name out there that looks just the same only without the very last series of 
letters.  I will check here and see if anyone knows the difference.  There is 
a note in the Global System that says Heather Dunton had this CP set up.  If 
you could check with her and see if it should be used for these deals or if 
the other CP should be used.

Thanks!

A Real Time guy mistakenly sold to Coral instead of using their established 
PGE transmission deal. 505750 has been killed and the transmission has been 
re-scheduled under deal #146517.

Pinnacle West is still working on moving all its operations from Arizona 
Public Service Co. to Pinnacle. In the meantime, all TRANSMISSION deals 
should still be made using the counterparty name ""Arizona Public Service 
Company."" All other deals are made with ""Pinnacle"" itself. This should change 
sometime in the next month, according to the confirmation group in Houston. 
Let me know if you have any questions.

I have changed the Index Multiplier for all of the days in January.  The days 
that were not at a mulitplier of 1.05 have been changed to that amount. Also, 
there was no deal in for 1/9, and 2 identical deals for 1/10.  I modified one 
of the 1/10 days to the 1/9 amount.

I will begin autoscheduling these shortly so the price will show.

This sequence of e-mails is a little confusing, so I highlighted the parts 
you probably want to focus on in red. Like I said, I've been staring at these 
deals for too many hours now to see clearly what went wrong. As far as I can 
tell, either APB or Jeff Richter was checking out wrong. Now I just want to 
get to the bottom of it! Aaaaaaaa!

Subject: Re: apb checkout  

I just want to clarify something, because we were here until about 9 p.m. 
last night trying to flatten our position, and just figured out this morning 
that we were off due to the Williams deal that I changed yesterday evening. 
Apparently Jeff Richter didn't do any deals with Williams for 50 MW through 
APB, but he did do one for 50 MW with Prebon. So I'm wondering why APB was 
checking out like this? If possible, I'd like to avoid this in the future. 
Let me know if you can find anything out from APB.

Thanks,
Kate

Judy at EES has different totals for these two deals.  For #498865 at NP15, 
she has total volume of 13,319.  For #497869 at SP15 she has a total volume 
of 8516.6.  Do you know of any reason that these total volumes would be 
different than what EES is showing?

Broker is right - deal has been changed.

By the way, I checked out audit viewer on deal 505066, and it showed that I 
had changed the deal from Amerex to APB yesterday afternoon. It didn't show 
any other changed after that - so I've put a call into Duong Luu to figure 
out why the change didn't save, or why it defaulted back. Just FYI.

Dear PMA Reader:

We've arranged with the publisher of the weekly newsletter, The Desk, to 
redistribute a copy of it's current Special Topic Issue, free to PMA 
subscribers. This week, The Desk goes beyond the realm of weather-based or 
other exotic derivatives and digs deep into the possibility of a market for 
solar (or space) weather derivatives. And more specifically, how they might 
be used in the power business. It's a fascinating topic and one that should 
be on everybody's radar screen. Enjoy the free issue.


Regards,
The Staff of the PMA

          POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY

                March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas

http://www.pmaconference.com/0103Agenda.pdf

EVERY CRISIS HOLDS OPPORTUNITIES:

Power shortages boost merchant power, distributed generation, peak shaving, 
real-time pricing and energy management. Some states are delaying their 
retail choice programs, but others are moving ahead, confident that they have 
benefited from the lessons learned by the pioneering jurisdictions. Electric 
price volatility drives growth in the risk management business.

Credit and cash flow are squeezed, but financial products provide solutions. 
Gas price volatility is a reminder-- coal was and remains the great source of 
energy for our country. Dot-coms seem to have been exposed as just ordinary 
businesses-- but online trading in energy is the single most robust area for 
transactions on the net. The IPO market hasn?t been kind to technology 
stocks-- but it likes energy issues. Broadband trading has been slow to take 
off, but powerline telecom may solve the real problem-- access to ""the last 
mile"".

Please join us at the Power Marketing Association?s annual spring meeting, 
""POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY"" March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas, for 
presentations on these topics and more!

Warmest Regards,

Sorry for the slow reaction time - this is the contact information Greg Wolfe 
gave me, and he Sean Crandall confirmed that (he was in the midst of putting 
a Conoco deal in the system). As for why it was taken out of the GCP system, 
I have no idea. If you know of anyone around here who would have called for 
that to be de-activated, let me know. Otherwise, our traders still know Jack 
Wells as the contact. Hope that helps.

Thanks,
Kate

Sean is entering the first deal as we speak. I will let you know as soon as 
we have a deal number.

Sean said he is sure the second deal was done through Prebon. No one is there 
right now, but he will double-check with them. Again, I will let you know as 
soon as we confirm this.

Thanks,
Kate

I know this is way before your time, but ------
Our contact at EES is calling and asking for a copy of the confirmation for 
this deal.  We never prepared one because it was coded not to be confimed.  
Can you check with the trader and see if anyone up there remembers if this 
was confirmed as part of something else or why it was marked not to be 
confirmed or anything else about it.

Thanks!"

Kate,
I am in the confirmation group with EES and try to tie out our confirmtions 
with the EPMI list I receive from Kim Hundle (EPMI), on a weekly basis.  This 
file would be great help with this process.  Is there any way you could send 
this to me as well? This would help me determine who the problem is with.  I 
would appreciate it.

I can certainly send you this file each day - I hope it can be of some help. 
All the deals it lists are with EPMI Short Term California, which is myself 
or Jeff Richter; so I'm not sure how helpful it will be in determining which 
desk or counterparty you have discrepancies with. While we're on the subject 
of sharing files, though, I had spoken with the confirmation group in Houston 
about the deal file you send them each day. They suggested I ask to be added 
to the list so I can better assist their group in finding discrepancies in 
EPMI-EES deals. If that's okay with you, I would appreciate receiving it.

In the meantime, I'll copy you on the EES sale prices starting tomorrow.

Thanks,
Kate

Are these two deals part of the original Conoco deal # 347356 that they are 
extending or something different?  We need to know because we have to add 
something in the confirmation if they are extensions of the original deal.  
Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?

Jack Wells is the contact for both - I've added his name to deal #507417. 
According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal 
was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just 
buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only 
connection. Let me know if you need more of an explanation from the traders, 
but our take is that these deals are separate.

Thanks,
Kate

          POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY

                March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas

http://www.pmaconference.com/0103Agenda.pdf

EVERY CRISIS HOLDS OPPORTUNITIES:

Power shortages boost merchant power, distributed generation, peak shaving, 
real-time pricing and energy management. Some states are delaying their 
retail choice programs, but others are moving ahead, confident that they have 
benefited from the lessons learned by the pioneering jurisdictions. Electric 
price volatility drives growth in the risk management business.

Credit and cash flow are squeezed, but financial products provide solutions. 
Gas price volatility is a reminder-- coal was and remains the great source of 
energy for our country. Dot-coms seem to have been exposed as just ordinary 
businesses-- but online trading in energy is the single most robust area for 
transactions on the net. The IPO market hasn?t been kind to technology 
stocks-- but it likes energy issues. Broadband trading has been slow to take 
off, but powerline telecom may solve the real problem-- access to ""the last 
mile"".

Please join us at the Power Marketing Association?s annual spring meeting, 
""POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY"" March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas, for 
presentations on these topics and more!

Warmest Regards,
Glenn Lovin
Executive Director

Sorry, I didn't see these deals when I sent the first email.  Kimberly Hundl 
had sent you a note about the contact.  Are these deals like the other two 
deals, and should be confirmed totally separately from the deal #347356.  
Sorry to be so difficult, but we get into trouble everytime we confirm a 
Conoco deal because of the special language that needs to be included on 
deals that are part of #347356, and we never get any notes that tell us 
whether or not it is part of the extension of the original deal.

Thanks!

Jack Wells is the contact for both - I've added his name to deal #507417. 
According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal 
was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just 
buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only 
connection. Let me know if you need more of an explanation from the traders, 
but our take is that these deals are separate.

You're definitely not being difficult - it's good for us to know these 
things. I'm going to check with Mike Swerzbin on this - he's the trader on 
347356 - after the morning trading dies down a bit. Just wanted to let you 
know I'm not ignoring you.

Thanks,
Kate

I've changed these deals to FPL Energy Power Marketing. Chris wasn't aware of 
the difference.  I'm trying to come up with a summary list or some other kind 
of reminder to send out to the traders today. I.E. is FPL part of Florida 
Power & Light? What's a quick and easy way to determine which counterparty 
you're trading with? 

We've just been bombarded with reports of incorrect counterparty names in our 
deals, and more often than not the traders are unaware of or indifferent to 
the difference. For your sake (and ultimately theirs, since these errors will 
start adding up in the daily correction report), I want to develop a more 
efficient system of checks and balances. If you have any suggestions (other 
than asking the traders to wake up and pay attention!) please let me know 
when you get a chance. I'll just be brainstorming today....in between 
changing incorrect counterparty names!

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, I think these trades are suppose to be FPL Energy Power Marketing in 
Enpower. Currently they are in as Florida Power & Light. I received 
confirmations from FPL Energy Power Marketing. Could you please talk to 
Mallory about the counterparty name.

Thanks!

Thank you for the reminder, Rhonda. I'm going to send out another 
announcement this afternoon to all our traders along with the daily

the counterparty names they choose.

Thanks again,

No, that's fine. But because of the new global standards, we're required to 
produce and report all corrections made on west power deals each day. So I 
was looking into these deals to get trader names, terms, etc., but 3 of them 
wouldn't pull up. 507901, 506767, and 507900 don't seem to be in the system. 
Are these the correct deal numbers? Let me know when you get a chance.

Those are east trades and you probably don't have access to them.  I just 
bundled west and east so you can ignore them.

I've received some feedback from the Real Time group regarding these 
counterparty discrepancies. Apparently, they were never given notice of the 
correct counterparty names, and chose what seemed to be the most logical 
name. Can we come up with a system or master list of usable counterparty 
names for these guys to refer to when faced with an array of choices? (i.e. 
There are five different names under Transalta.) 

The concern lies with our daily correction report, which I generate and which 
includes all deals that have been changed and the name of the person who made 
the ""error."" This report can weigh unfairly against a trader who may be 
unaware of the difference between ""Dynegy Marketing & Trade"" and ""Dynegy 
Power Marketing."" I feel like there has to be a more efficient way to avoid 
these errors than publishing them in a report that gets sent throughout the 
company.

If you could help me compile this master list, or direct me to someone who 
can, I would greatly appreciate it. 

Thanks,
Kate

I talked to Bill Williams and told him a quick (but not always perfect) way 
to see if it is the correct CP is to select the CP and then click on the Deal 
Clearing tab.  If there is a contract there or if you click on the arrow and 
a number is there, we have a K with that entity and it is the correct CP.  If 
it is blank under Global Contracts even after you click on the arrow, we do 
not have a contract with that entity and you have probably chosen the wrong 
CP.  I will also send him a list of entities we have Ks with, but he did not 
want them to have to look at a list.  Its probably a learning curve but at 
least this is a step in the right direction.  Let me know if you can think of 
other ways to help them.

Hi All,

Here's a preview of a story that should be going up on our site soon.

Greater Yellowstone Ski Traverse

Update for Leg 1: South Pass to Cora

By Win Goodbody

The weather gods must have been in a good mood.  Maybe they had a good New
Year=01,s party.  On previous trips to the Wind River Range I had grown
accustomed to spending large blocks of time in the tent, waiting for storm
after storm to subside.  If one of every two days was suitable for venturin=
g
outside, I considered it a bit of luck.  But this time was different.  In
the middle of January we enjoyed an amazing 18 consecutive days of good
weather for our 130 mile ski traverse of the Wind River Range.

The drive south toward Lander, WY revealed an alarming lack of snow, both i=
n
the mountains and lower down where we hoped to start.  This has not been a
good winter so far in the Yellowstone region, and we wondered what
conditions would be like in the Wind Rivers.  Luckily, with the final gain
in elevation as we neared the Continental Divide and South Pass, enough
coverage materialized for us to ski away from the car.  We had day packs an=
d
70 pound sleds.

Starting out with an approach of several days across lowlands was an
interesting way to ease into the trip.  Instead of driving right up to the
base of the mountains, we had to work a little bit to get there.  Even
though we were on open range with scattered trees, this was some of the
trickiest route finding we would encounter anywhere on the route.
Steep-sided drainages and mini-gorges suddenly appeared in the otherwise
mildly rolling terrain, requiring detours and delays.

For a few days we thrashed across the prairie landscape, moving toward
distant peaks that didn=01,t seem to be getting much closer.  The 10 or 12
inches of snow on the ground were completely rotten, and our movement was
half skiing, half snowshoeing.  Each step sank to the ground, and ski tips
snagged in exposed sage brush.  When we came upon a perfectly groomed but
empty Continental Divide Snowmobile trail, we took advantage of it to
quickly reach the Little Sandy drainage, our entrance to the mountains.

We were by now settling into our routines: relearning winter camping skills=
,
dividing repetitive tasks, and adjusting to the cold.  With only about 11
hours of daylight, our schedule was remarkably busy.  It was a struggle to
get moving by 10 each morning even though we got up at 7.  Lunchtime arrive=
d
immediately.  Just as quickly the sun dipped behind a peak and it was time
to make camp.  After eating dinner we scurried into our down bags for a 12
hour sleep.  The days flew by, and we focused on putting miles beneath the
sleds while the good weather lasted, not knowing it would last indefinitely=
.
  We were comfortable, but every waking moment was occupied and there was n=
o
time for relaxing.  We seemed to be always on the move.

The price to be paid for clear sunny days is clear cold nights, and about a
week into the range, when we were up above 10,000 feet nearly all the time,
we had our first taste of real cold.  It was the night we camped in the
Cirque of the Towers, and we were in our floorless cook tent.  We had
excavated a basement a few feet down to the ice of Lonesome Lake.  Except
for the entranceway, all the sides of the tent were flush with the snow
surface, and with both stoves going it was pleasantly warm inside.

After dinner as we sat reading I sensed some sort of change.  Then I knew
what it was.  Searing cold air was draining into the tent and spilling
across the floor like a poisonous gas.  You could feel it cool your face,
try to get inside your clothes, turn your water bottle into a frozen brick.
I imagined my candle snuffing out, refusing to burn at such an obscene
temperature.  I went outside to check my key chain thermometer under a sky
of blazing stars.  The cheap gadget was maxed out.  It was at least =01)25 =
F.
The cold was like a deafening air raid siren.  There was no escaping it.

That same cold was to stay with us most nights and mornings for the next 8
or 9 days.  In the evening before going to bed I would check the
thermometer.  All the red fluid was huddled in the ball at the bottom, too
scared to try for a run up toward the numbers.  It was the same each
morning.  The daily temperature swings were tremendous.  We would go from
=01)25 F (or lower) to 20 F in a matter of hours in the morning.  The warm
midday sun was always a relief, but it didn=01,t last.  Our joy at being ab=
le
to ski along in just a shirt was tempered by the knowledge we would soon be
wearing every layer of clothing we possessed.  In the evenings, as soon as
the sun went down the temperature headed south with merciless speed.

Deep cold is to the sense of touch what the Grand Teton or Old Faithful or =
a
radiant sunrise are to the sense of sight.  It is truly an amazing natural
phenomenon to be reckoned with.  We marveled at it again and again, this
thing you cannot see or hear or smell.  It is both beautiful and horrifying=
,
an undeniably authentic experience that leaves an imprint on your memory,
but with luck not on your toes or fingers.  It might be hard to explain why
it is a fascinating spectacle to behold, but there is no denying that it is=
.
  As the days went by, we became students of this strange, invisible force.
But of course we still got cold every day.

Our good weather continued, and we knocked off high pass after high pass on
our voyage north.  Some days we even crossed two passes and multiple
drainages.  For mid winter, we were really moving fast.  With so little sno=
w
on the ground, at least we were not delayed by having to worry about
avalanches.  Without consciously deciding to do so, we were in fact
traveling harder during the day, stopping later each night, and spending
less time readying a good camp.  More and more we were going flat out all
day and then just collapsing at night to wake the next morning and do it
again.

Our traverse was imperceptibly developing all the classic symptoms of what =
I
have come to know as a death march.  Though a death march typically occurs
at the end of a tour when the desire to exit is so strong it can make you g=
o
all day or all night without thinking of the consequences, a death march ca=
n
also occur at any time during a trip.  For example, if you discover you
haven=01,t brought enough food you might need to go full bore for days on e=
nd.
Or maybe you hear a storm is coming and decide to turn on the after burner
to reach a safe haven.  Probably the defining characteristic of a death
march is that you never intend to get into one to begin with.  But there
comes a point when, like an investigator, you step back for a minute,
examine the evidence of your daily life, and it suddenly dawns on you that =
a
death march is in full swing and you are powerless to stop it.  The horror!
The horror!

At the outset of the leg, we were putting in good days because we wanted to
get up into the high peaks where the real trip would begin.  Once we were
there, we wanted to put in some good days while the weather lasted, to make
some progress before the inevitable endless blizzard that would surely
descend.  After we had been going about 10 days and did some math based on
the miles we had covered and what still lay ahead, we realized that we woul=
d
not have time to exit as we had originally planned.  In fact even after
cutting off some substantial passes and distance, it was still going to be
all we could do to make it out in the time allotted.  So we decided to put
in more good days.   We always had a reason for not resting, for going hard
day after day.  One night while thawing my foot out over the stove, I
realized we were not going to have a single rest day.  We were going for it=
.
  We had gotten sucked in.  We were on a death march.

The long days alone would have been manageable, but we had a growing proble=
m
that was interfering with our ability to recover and rest each night.  Our
sleeping bags were filling with ice, which impaired their ability to loft
and hence insulate us.  This is a common problem in extreme cold.  As you
sleep, you radiate moisture and heat.  The moisture passes through your
sleeping bag and escapes into the air.

When it is very cold, however, the temperature difference between the air
inside your bag and the air outside is too great for moisture to pass
through the bag=01,s outer skin.  As moisture goes to move that last millim=
eter
from the comfortable 70 F temperature inside the bag to the outside air, it
gets walloped with a 100 degree temperature difference (let=01,s say it=01,=
s =01)30 F
out).  Instead of escaping, the moisture freezes on the inside of the bag=
=01,s
outer shell.  This problem seems to be worse with high tech laminate
materials designed to impede the flow of moisture (usually rain) into the
bag from the outside.

This is a cumulative condition and gets worse each day as another night=01,=
s
moisture is added to what is already frozen in the bag.  Unless the bag is
thawed out and dried, there is no solution, and you will reach a point wher=
e
all insulating qualities have been lost and you are better of just sleeping
on your insulated pad in your clothes.  We had already taken to wearing mos=
t
of our clothes inside our sleeping bags, and this just barely worked.
Still, more and more of each night was spent tossing and desperately
huddling into some new contorted position in an attempt to avoid feeling th=
e
hideous cold of yet another clear night.

As light at the end of the tunnel appeared, our daytime efforts reached a
fever pitch.  Day 12, 8.5 miles.  Day 13, 9 miles.  Day 14, 7 miles.  Day
15, 9.5 miles.  And these were by no means easy flat miles.  They were
trailbreaking miles up and down passes, all above 10,000 feet.  Reaching th=
e
entrance to Titcomb Basin, we veered northwest toward the origin of the
Green River at Peak Lake.  Originally we had planned to go north from
Titcomb past Gannett Peak as far as Downs Mountain, the last peak above
13,000 feet in the Winds, before falling off to the west down Roaring Fork,
eventually reaching the Green River drainage.  But because of time, low
snow, and a desire to live we had altered our course to head directly down
the Green.

Going over the top at Cube Rock Pass, we caught a glimpse thousands of feet
down the Green River drainage.  The end was near but we were still looking
at another two days to get to Green River Lakes campground, where we hoped
to solicit a snowmobile ride for the remaining 20 miles to our car in Cora.
The view down the upper Green as it plummets from near Peak Lake is
shocking.  We silently gazed 10 miles down a classic, deeply carved, thickl=
y
forested valley wedged between impassable rocks walls.  Toward their
northern end the Winds turn into a series of high, broad plateaus above
11,000 feet, and the chief difficulty exiting is finding some way down.
Many of the drainages that cut this plateau are gorges, sheer cliffs, or
other features unfriendly to ski tourers with sleds.  As we had changed our
exit route, we had not gone all the way north to the real plateaus.  But
even here getting down was going to take some doing.

Day 16 was the first time we allowed that most cruel of thoughts to enter
our minds: perhaps this was the day we would get out.  Eating pizza in
Jackson tonight?  Sleeping indoors, not encased in an ice tomb?  No more
holding frozen body parts over an open flame?  Perhaps.  We slowly suffered
up Vista Pass, where the summer trail leaves the Green River for about 8
miles and descends a neighboring creek.  I had got into the habit over the
last few days of proclaiming that some feature or other was =01&really goin=
g to
be the last uphill=018.  Usually as soon as this sentence hit the air we wo=
uld
round a corner to glimpse another uphill ahead.  But I was undeterred by
past failed prophecies and once again suggested to Joe that =01&this is it=
=018.
He said nothing.

Whereas early in the trip I felt strong and had been happy to break trail
for hours at a time, the death march and lack of sleep had taken their toll
and the wheels were coming off.  I had no enthusiasm for leading.  I felt
like the walking dead and just wanted to follow, my eyes locked on a track
in front of me, legs trudging on automatic pilot.  But as I grew weaker, Jo=
e
became unstoppable.  He was increasingly pulling the boat over the final
days, and I was happy to let him. Especially going downhill though tricky,
steep sections he raced far ahead.  Perhaps it was a desire to escape my
singing that drove him forward.  I sang many pop songs, past and present,
but refused to sing Neil Diamond, Joe=01,s favorite artiste.  As this dispu=
ted
issue festered, Joe seemed eager to put more and more distance between the
two of us.

As it turns out, Vista Pass really was the last uphill, and now it was time
to go down.  After a few hours of easy traversing, we lost the trail and
decided to descend a steeply falling stream choked with enormous boulders.
Seemed like a good idea at the time I guess.  Joe was in front, skiing
straight downstream and stopping only for the most absurd drops.  He was
soon out of sight.  Following his track was a bit of an eye opener.  It fel=
t
like the cartoon where you come upon a set of ski tracks that split around =
a
tree.  In leather boots and telemark bindings with a large sled, Joe was
sticking 4 and 5 foot drops.  I stared in disbelief at the smooth sled trac=
k
that went over the top of a boulder, then straight down for a few feet, the=
n
continued on.  I had more solid AT gear, but there was no way I was doing
that.  I was sure I=01,d break a ski.

Later, Joe confided that the way he=01,d been able to descend these boulder=
s
was to surf down sloughs of snow.  As he went over the tops of rocks, snow
would slide off and cushion his descent and landing.  But as the second guy
down the course, I enjoyed none of this extra padding.  It was all gone.
Instead of using the Hartney straightline method, I tried side stepping dow=
n
from the top of the boulder, turning my skis perpendicular to the fall line
that my sled wanted so desperately to follow at great speed.

It didn=01,t work too well.  Shorn of most of their snow, the boulders, it
turned out, were covered with glare ice.  Again and again I would be just
about to take the final step down when my skis would slip.  I fell over my
skis downhill, face-planting in the stream bed.  The sled then crashed on
top of me.  I struggled to release skis and waist belts.  Once I had to get
out my shovel and dig to find a pole that went astray in a particularly
juicy fall.  To make matters worse, I was getting wet from these repeated
snow baths.

Some time during this carefree afternoon I looked down and noticed that
where the solid metal tow bars of my sled connected to the plastic hull
there was a grave problem.  The connection points were tearing away from th=
e=20
body and threatened to come off altogether.  When and if that happened, I
would be reduced to fashioning a rope and stick contraption to bind the sle=
d
to my body.  I shuddered to think what such a caveman era contraption might
do to our progress and tried to face plant less often on the rest of my
stream run.

At last the track I was following left the creek, and I thrashed down into
dense woods where I found Joe looking at the map and having a snack.  It
looked like he=01,d been there for quite a while.  I waited for some sign f=
rom
him that maybe the creek had been kind of tough.  Nothing.  I acted
nonchalant:  =01&That was fun.=018  =01&Yeah,=018 Joe said.  =01&I broke my=
 sled it looks
like,=018 I countered.  =01&Oh really?=018  Finally, I had to ask.  =01&Did=
 you fall at
all back there?=018  =01&What?=018  He was looking at the map.  =01&Oh, no.=
  I did have
to slow down at one point though.=018  Here I=01,d spent the last hour egg
beatering down the creek like someone just introduced to skis.  And Joe had
to slow down once.  The poor kid.

Needless to say, we didn=01,t make it out that day.  But we did make it to =
the
valley floor.  Flat ground at last!  Now I could claim that there would be
no more uphill or downhill.  But all was not yet goodness and light, and we
soon found ourselves wallowing in some of the worst snow imaginable.  Deepe=
r
than the snow we had battled through at South Pass, it exhibited the same
general characteristics.  Deeply rotten and unsupportable, yet dense and
heavy, it was nearly impossible to move through.  We were snowshoeing again=
,
pulling our ski tips out of the snow at each step and stepping on the
surface, only to sink down a foot.  Pure hell.  Too spice up what promised
to be hours, and possibly days, of fun battling our way out, I decided to
make a quick sight seeing trip to the other side of the Green River.  After
plunging through the ice and almost losing a ski in the swift flowing
current, I reluctantly came back across and started sloshing down the trail
like a good boy.  My skins were now coated with ice which removed any
possibility of sliding on them.  Oh well.  That night we made a fire and fe=
d
it with prehistoric glee, which somewhat warmed our outlook and dried my
boots.  But we still weren=01,t out.

Day 17.  Joe and I don=01,t need to verbalize this, but it=01,s just sort o=
f
understood that there is absolutely no way we are not making it out today.
No chance of not getting out today.  Nope.  I mean zero chance.  We even ge=
t
up in the dark for an early start to ensure that no matter what the day may
throw at us (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, meteors, etc.) we are still
making it out.  As I flee the ice bag, I notice it=01,s only =01)10 F down =
here in
the sultry valley.

Even though he broke trail most of yesterday, Joe is out in front again.
The snow is worse than ever.  Somehow even with a trail to follow I can=01,=
t
really keep up.  I occupy myself with bitter, frivolous =01&Well, at least
we=01,re not getting attacked by a moose=018 kind of thoughts.  I look arou=
nd for
some small forest creature to curse at.  Anything to divert attention from
the pain in my feet and legs.  Damn pikas.  Bloody chipmunks.  But there=01=
,s
nothing about.  Staggering along, I feel almost like a third party to our
plight, like I=01,m watching it on tv.  Tra la la.  This is pretty fun, I l=
ie
to myself.

But our suffering pays off.  We come upon a lake.  Could this be Green Rive=
r
Lakes?  We consult the map.  Surely there must be some mistake.  I wait for
Joe to inform me that we=01,ve made a wrong turn and are actually in northe=
rn
British Columbia, hundreds of miles from the nearest road.  But no.  As if =
a
ramp of light had descended from parted clouds to our feet, the lake lies
there like a highway.  Trumpets are sounding.  Angels are fluttering above
motioning us forward.  Not only will trail breaking be easier, we now have
certifiable proof that we are only 4 miles from Green River Lakes
campground, a snowmobiling mecca.  It=01,s only about 1 pm and clear and su=
nny.
  Surely there will be hundreds of people out on a day like this, even if i=
t
is a Tuesday.  We have visions of having to fight back hordes of attractive
female snowmachiners, all clamoring to be the ones who will give us a ride
back to Cora, 20 miles distant.  We=01,ll probably need flak jackets.

We pick up the pace.  Or rather Joe picks up the pace.  Apparently he think=
s
he may still have a good chance of competing in some nordic events in the
2002 Olympics in Salt Lake, because he=01,s going down the lake like a rock=
et.
He=01,s not even going in a straight line.  He=01,s swerving all over the p=
lace,
going like a madman for the finish line.  He doesn=01,t care because WE ARE
GETTING OUT TODAY!  One thing I do have going for me is that I can plot a
straight course for the point where we will exit the first lake, so I regai=
n
some time.  We cross the first lake.  There are ski tracks in the snow.
Humans!  At the second lake, where the wilderness boundary ends, I am about
as happy as I have ever been to see snowmobile tracks all over the place.
But strangely, ominously, no machines.

At 3 pm we are at the campground.  Snowmobile tracks everywhere.  It=01,s j=
ust
a matter of time, I tell myself.  They=01,ll be here.  We reach the far end=
 of
the campground where the road heads off for Cora and do some gear
rearranging, readying ourselves for that magic ride.  We scatter things all
over the road, effectively blockading it.  Nobody is getting by here withou=
t
picking us up.  The sun is still shining and it=01,s downright warm.  As a
little joke, I take my sleeping bag out and set it on a tarp to begin the
drying process which, I imagine, will really kick into gear in about three
hours when we=01,re back in Joe=01,s living room in Jackson and have turned=
 up the
thermostat to about 85 F.  Just a bit of fun putting the bag out like this.
I mean, it=01,s not like we=01,re going to need the thing tonight.

Total silence.  Wonder where they are, these =01+bilers?  Must be a local
tradition to stop at this time each afternoon for a moment of silence or
something.  We start getting a little upset.  Almost indignant.  Don=01,t t=
hese
people know how to have fun?  Where are they?  A day this beautiful and
noone=01,s out on their machines?  Where is everyone, off cross country ski=
ing
or something?  Sun=01,s going down now.  For god=01,s sake WHERE ARE THEY?!

And then, just as faint as the sound of a mosquito, we hear it.  A little
buzz.  Was that the wind?  No, I still hear it.  Could it be a =01( plane?
Buzz.  Buzz.  Buzzzzzzz.  No sound could be more soothing, more friendly,
more welcome at that moment than this: the sound of not one but several two
stroke engines heading our way.

We finally crack.  Screams, high fives, arms raised.  Hysteria, release.  W=
e
knew it!  We knew we=01,d make it out tonight!  Victory is ours!  We are go=
ing
to live!  After a minute or two I realize that maybe if I stop shouting and
set about repacking the crap I=01,ve strewn all over the road we=01,ll look=
 a
little more appealing.  A little more like someone these gracious, heroic,
good-natured =01+bilers will want to pick up.  I lower my arms, wipe the te=
ars
off my face, and start jamming the ice bag back into its stuff sack.

We start cleaning up.  In an instant we are already mentally back in
Jackson.  Back in town.  Back indoors.  As if transported by a futuristic
machine, we are no longer at a remote trailhead 20 miles away from a town o=
f
maybe 200 people in the middle of nowhere in Wyoming.  We are home.  We are
warm.  We are about to have dinner.  Joe=01,s in the shower.  I=01,m checki=
ng my
email.  Beam me up, Scotty.

For some reason the =01+bilers (there are 4 of them) have stopped almost a =
mile
short of our little shanty town and have turned off their machines.  Now
that doesn=01,t look good.  The sun has just gone behind a peak, and in abo=
ut
15 minutes the temperature will go into freefall.  We can=01,t imagine why
anyone would come the 20 miles out here and not go all the way to the lake,
which is on the other side of us.  They=01,re probably playing a game of
rock-paper-scissors to decide who will be the lucky two to host us on the
ride back, but we are sure not taking any chances.  Maybe they just haven=
=01,t
seen us.  Before I can suggest that he=01,d probably enjoy some brisk skiin=
g
after such a slack 17 days, Joe has stripped off his skins and is skating
down the road toward our motorized friends to make sure all is well with,
uh, you know, the pickup and the ride back and everything.

I get out my telephoto lens to watch and maybe document this historic
meeting.  I=01,m sure that as soon as he gets the aok I=01,ll be hearing a =
lot of
noise from Joe.  I imagine the bilers=01, responses:  =01&You skied 130 mil=
es from
where?  Good lord, son, you get on the back of this machine and we=01,re go=
ing
back to my place for a full blown steak dinner right now.  Here, I=01,ll ju=
st
call ahead and get that in the works.=018  =01&Now wait just a minute there=
, Bill.
  Who said we=01,re going to your place?  We=01,re having it at my house.=
=018
=01&Jimmy, over my dead body.  We=01,re going to my house and we=01,re havi=
ng a

anyone else tries to contribute one penny to the expense, there=01,s going =
to
be a fight.  It=01,s all on me.=018  =01&Sorry, Bobby, but it=01,s just not=
 going to be
like that at all.  We=01,re going to my place, we=01,re eating for two days=
, and
then I=01,m taking them to meet the Governor before we head to Acapulco for=
 a
week.  And I=01,ll be damned if my two daughters aren=01,t coming with us.=
=018  I
start to get a warm fuzzy feeling.  These are my people!  I=01,m determined=
 to
try snowmobiling as soon as possible.  Maybe even convert.  Screw this
skiing stuff.  I want horsepower!  I start singing as I pack up my sled.

The first sign of trouble is when the four riders start their machines and
set off headed toward me.  But Joe remains standing in place like a fence
post.  He=01,s not moving at all.  I figure he=01,s just so bowled over by =
all the
outlandish offers of hospitality we=01,ve received that he=01,s wondering h=
ow
we=01,re going to be able to make it out of Cora in less than a week.  What
with all the parades, barbecues, snowmobiling with the mayor, square dances=
,
and motivational talks at the high school, we may have to push back the nex=
t
leg of our Yellowstone traverse by at least a few days.  Here come the
=01+bilers.  Joe is still doing his frozen in place routine.  This does not
look good.

I reluctantly clear a path to let the four riders through our barricade.
Well, they may be getting to the lake, I think, but they can=01,t get out. =
 The
most worrisome thing is that they do not stop to talk to me, and only one
even waves.  No eye contact at all.  That=01,s alright, I think.  Out of
consideration for us they=01,re hurrying as fast as they can to get a glimp=
se
of the lake and then they=01,re going to zip back and get us.  We=01,ll tal=
k back
at their place.  They just don=01,t want us to spend a single additional mi=
nute
outside.  How kind of them.  That=01,s why they didn=01,t stop.

Then it hits me.  The music stops, the needle goes screeching across the
record.  We=01,re in trouble here.  Something is terribly, terribly wrong.
This is just not how people who are about to bring us home to feast with
their extended family should be acting.  Joe is moving now at least.  He ha=
s
taken his skis off and is walking back toward me at a very slow speed.  I
shout to him, =01&Well?=018  No response.  =01&Joe?=018  =01&JOE!=018  I re=
peatedly shout at
him as he approaches within 100 yards.  He=01,s not answering.  God this lo=
oks
bad!  I instantly readjust my internal fun meter from being back in Jackson
watching tv to Defcon 5.  I=01,ve been yanked out of the shower and I=01,m =
at the
North Pole having just been given the news that the pickup flight is not
coming and we have to make the 1400 mile trek home by dogsled.  And we don=
=01,t
have any sled dogs so we=01,ll be using marmots instead.  It=01,s pretty cl=
ear we
are not getting a ride back with the boys.

Joe confirms this with very few words when he arrives.  The party consisted
of a Wyoming guide and three clients from Michigan.  The guide mumbled some
bologna about how he could lose his license if anyone saw him giving us a
ride.  Joe kind of tried to laugh this one off at first but then realized
the guy was serious.  He did not want to help us, who knows why.  This
outcome was so unexpected and so incomprehensible to us that we just sat
there at first.  It was like a truck coming across someone in the Sahara
Desert.  =01&Sorry, I=01,d love to pick you up, but you might put your feet=
 on the
dash and smudge the leather.=018  Would any skier coming across a broken do=
wn
snowmobiler 20 miles from the road refuse to help, refuse to lend a hand in
any way?  We couldn=01,t fathom this.  Where was the back country fellowshi=
p,
the shared camaraderie of a couple of hearty souls out in Wyoming=01,s
wildness?  Sorry.  It wasn=01,t there this time.  We were crushed.

The previously valiant ambassadors of world peace and brotherhood, now
hateful, bubble-headed practitioners of an idiotic, environmentally damagin=
g
sport, came roaring back from the lake on their gas pigs.  I stared at them
menacingly.  They did not stop.  Good thing for them.  We spent 20 minutes
on tirades and diatribes best not recalled in print, and then we got out ou=
r
pathetic list of options.  We had already gone about 10 miles that day.  I
don=01,t know about Joe, but after 17 straight days of going for it, I was =
a
mess.  It was 4:00 pm.  Another 20 miles separated us from the car and
salvation.  We could either camp and continue in the morning, or keep going
a little further until dark.  Or, of course, we could commit to the grand
finale death march.

We decided on the death march.  We would eat dinner, pack it up, and go
until we got to the car.  Just another 20 miles.  It wouldn=01,t be so bad.=
  A
rational person might have pointed out that we were looking at a 30 mile da=
y
(and night), but our thinking was not exactly sharp as a laser.  From step
1, I knew it was a mistake for me, but Joe definitely had the fire for
getting out.  We set off at nearly full speed with evening coming on and
rich alpenglow coating all peaks in sight.  Every step hurt.  Every minute =
I
wanted to stop.  I lasted about an hour before seriously considering
stopping for the night.  Another key characteristic of the death march is
that one person wants to do it and the other really doesn=01,t but just goe=
s
along with it.  It was clear who was in which role.  This was sort of a new
experience for me, for I usually played the guy trying to get the other to
keep going.  Not this time.  I knew Joe was not going to be happy when he
heard I wanted to stop.

For a seeming eternity I heard myself mouthing the words, =01&I think we sh=
ould
stop.=018  But I held on.  Just another step.  Take another step and see ho=
w it
felt.  It felt bad.  My feet were on fire.  My legs were slightly numb down
the sides.  I was hobbling.  I felt about as comfortable on skis as Woody=
=20
Allen.  But the worst thing was that we had no way to measure our progress.
We did not recognize the route, could not assess how much farther, had no
landmarks.  It could be another hour or another 10.  I had myself convinced
we could ski four miles an hour.  By that math, we should be able to reach
Cora in time for last call.  Or at least in time to round up an angry mob o=
f
torch-bearing villagers to go hunt down the four =01+bilers who were guilty=
 of
crimes against humanity and must pay!

Darkness.  Temperature down to a cheery =01)10 F.  Real heat wave here in t=
he
shadow of the Wind River Range.  It=01,s another clear, windless night on t=
he
range as we slowly, painfully make our way out of the mountains.  The ice
hard road crunches under our skis.  Dead silence otherwise.  At last, the
pyschological brutality of simply not knowing how much longer breaks me, an=
d
2=20
 hours into the death march, even though I have convinced myself we must
be half way, I mouth the words.  I=01,m not asking, I=01,m telling.  As sel=
fish as
that may be, I can=01,t go on.  I know Joe is severely displeased, but he
agrees silently, and we stop to set up the tent.  In 10 minutes we are
huddling in the ice bags, praying for warmth.

Looking back, I am amazed we survived as long as we did on the trip with ou=
r
sleeping bags considering the state they were in.  Usually the bag is a saf=
e
house, a place to go when all else goes wrong, a place to retreat to.  But
in our case it was the opposite.  Because the weather was so perfect, the
days were our sanctuary, the place we could recover from our torment in the
bags and get warm again.  Had it not been for the perfect weather, we could
not have lasted.  But we managed to just barely hang on and tolerate our
sleeping bags as they became of less and less use each day.

Until they were of no use whatsoever.  Inside the tent, we are both
thrashing around in our bags fully clothed.  I put on my down jacket inside
the bag for the first time.  Luckily we both have down pants which we have
been wearing to sleep for more than a week.  The bags are doing more harm
than good at this point, but we don=01,t really get that.  The thought does=
n=01,t
occur to us to try sleeping without the bags.  It=01,s obvious that neither=
 one
of us is asleep or headed anywhere remotely near sleep.  For the first time
on the trip I am not satisfactorily warm at night.  I can survive, but it i=
s
not going to be comfortable.  Maybe we=01,d be better off going for the car=
.  I
can=01,t face that unknown quantity.  Another 2=20
 hours?  More?  I realize we
are looking at a sleepless night: 9 hours of waiting for the sun to come
back around.

After an hour Joe announces he can=01,t sleep and wants to keep going.  He=
=01,s
wet and cold and getting worse in the ice bag.  We talk about it and decide
he will go for the car and I will stay the night, continuing at first light=
.
  The thought of getting out of the bag, cold as it is, putting on frozen
boots, hitching up the sled and continuing almost makes me want to get
physically ill, but Joe still has something left.  He departs at 9 pm, back
out into the cold, clear Wyoming night.

I drift in and out of sleep.  I actually do attain some warmth, but somehow
I am also getting wet.  Must have slipped off my pad.  Don=01,t care.  I am
cramped and crippled, a few limbs need blood, but rolling over acts like a
huge vacuum that takes away any heat I have, so I lie still.  My watch says
3 am when I check it.  Only another few hours and I'll be on my way.  I eve=
n
consider getting up right then and continuing but don=01,t.  I think of Joe=
 and
the brutal death march he must have faced, or might still be facing.  Hope
he makes it.  I drift off again.

4:30 am.  I hear a noise.  Sounds like an engine.  It=01,s not a snowmobile=
.
Not high-pitched enough.  Sounds like=01( a car!  In the space of one minut=
e I
go from sleeping to wide awake and out of the ice bag.  I know exactly
what=01,s happened, and I am ecstatic.  It=01,s Joe!  He has driven the car=
 back
down the snowmobile trail to get me!  Bugles are sounding and the cavalry i=
s
thundering over the hill, flags all around.  No time is spent wondering
exactly how Joe got the car here.  Before he has it turned around I am out
of the tent and furiously packing my sled.

We have the tent down and my gear in the car in under five minutes.  I slip
under skis and sled poles into the passenger seat and want to cry when I
feel the heat blast from inside.  Joe=01,s had the heater on high for hours=
.
We head off with music playing and Joe hands me a glazed donut.  The
contrast is too stark.  It can=01,t be real.  I keep waiting to wake up in
northern Iceland with the tent blown to shreds and our bags frozen hard as
coffins.  But I am awake, and we are homeward bound at last.

Joe happily relates his tale like he=01,s telling me who won the Super Bowl=
,
and I look for a bullet to bite down on to stop my screams.  He left the
tent to resume the death march at 9 pm.  We figured we were half way, so he
was looking at another two or three hours at most.  More than five hours
after leaving the tent, close to 2:30 am, Joe reached the car.  It started.
Just the thought of going that long, not knowing whether it might have been
another five hours, is too much for me to consider.  Suddenly all my past
death march experiences were transformed into happy jaunts in the country
with birds chirping in comparison with Joe=01,s saga.

After starting the car, Joe made for a local convenience store and stocking
up on junk food and coffee, then returned to the trailhead.  At Green River
Lakes we had joked how the snowmobile trail was hard enough to drive on.
Noticing there was no gate between the parking lot and trail, Joe eased his
Ford Escort up onto the trail.  The car didn=01,t sink in at all.  He kept
going and was soon whizzing down the trail.  =01&So how far was it from the
tent to the car?  Did you measure?=018 I asked.  =01&12 miles.=018

With the heater on full and early morning of our 18th day starting to show
itself in the rosy eastern sky, we point the car toward a breakfast of eggs=
,
bacon, and pancakes.  We had gotten away with murder and we knew it.  Never
in our wildest dreams could we have hoped for such good weather.  We had
done nothing to deserve it.  But with this unprecedented window thrown open
to us, we had breached the Wind River Range=01,s defenses and squeaked thro=
ugh.
  In January.

Joe pops in a Neil Diamond tape and starts singing along.  I=01,ve got some
things to learn from this guy.

Thought this might be useful for you to have as well. I highlighted the deal 
numbers that concern your desk in red. I know these are really nitpicky 
errors, but it might be worth reminding these guys of the correct 
counterparty names.

I checked with Sean, who said he's finished entering his deals. Mike is just 
finishing up with his. Jeff Richter, however, still has about 8 deals to 
enter. This should be done within the next few minutes.

Please let me know if these don't come through shortly.

These deals were entered to flatten out the traders' positions in the PX. You 
shouldn't see the index being used on any deals past tomorrow (the exchange 
closes effective Feb. 1), but Bob Badeer and Matt Motley both had positions 
they needed to back out of. They turned around and bought the same amount at 
the Dow Jones index. Hope this helps!

          POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY

                March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas

http://www.pmaconference.com/0103Agenda.pdf

EVERY CRISIS HOLDS OPPORTUNITIES:

Power shortages boost merchant power, distributed generation, peak shaving, 
real-time pricing and energy management. Some states are delaying their 
retail choice programs, but others are moving ahead, confident that they have 
benefited from the lessons learned by the pioneering jurisdictions. Electric 
price volatility drives growth in the risk management business.

Credit and cash flow are squeezed, but financial products provide solutions. 
Gas price volatility is a reminder-- coal was and remains the great source of 
energy for our country. Dot-coms seem to have been exposed as just ordinary 
businesses-- but online trading in energy is the single most robust area for 
transactions on the net. The IPO market hasn?t been kind to technology 
stocks-- but it likes energy issues. Broadband trading has been slow to take 
off, but powerline telecom may solve the real problem-- access to ""the last 
mile"".

Please join us at the Power Marketing Association?s annual spring meeting, 
""POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY"" March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas, for 
presentations on these topics and more!

Warmest Regards,

Currently, we do not confirm west deals that flow 6 days or less so we have 
not had to be real difficult about contact names in deal entry.  However, 
starting February 1, we are going to confirm all next day deals in the west 
using the same criteria we do in the east - that is - deals 3 days or less 
are sent on a confirmation that does not require a signature and everthing 
else on a letter requiring a signature.  Hourly deals will not be confirmed.  
So it is very important that the traders fill in a contact name when they are 
entering deals.  The confirmation letter cannot be prepared without a contact 
name.  It stops the whole process.  We are not going to be able to put names 
in every time they do not.  

If they do not see the contact they want in the drop down list,  put the 
correctly spelled first and last name in the comment section in deal entry 
and we will add this contact to the list and it should appear the next day.

If you can help us out with this, maybe we won't have to keep asking you for 
contacts.

Thanks!"

I forwarded this e-mail on to all our traders to give them a heads up about 
the new process. I did receive feedback from one trader, Mark Fischer, who 
said that when he began with Enron he was always told that if a contact name 
was not in the system that he was supposed to enter it into the comments 
section. He did this diligently under the pretense that eventually these 
names would be added to the system, but they apparently never were. He wanted 
to let me know of this, especially because when the traders are hurriedly 
entering deals, they probably won't always take the time to type in the 
contact name in the comments section.

Let's see if we can update this list somehow. Let me know who I can contact 
for this or how we can set this up.

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate,
Please have a look at the term on this deal.  There is a discrepancy between

I'm not sure if someone else got to this before I did, but I see the same end 
date at the top and bottom of this deal - 6/30/01. Let me know if this needs 
to be changed, or if it's not showing up correctly for you. 

Thanks,

strips at the bottom.  Is the correct end date 6/30 or 6/1? 
Thanks!

I'm not sure if someone else got to this before I did, but I see the same end 
date at the top and bottom of this deal - 6/30/01. Let me know if this needs 
to be changed, or if it's not showing up correctly for you.

Okay - third time's the charm. After cuts were made by the Cal-ISO last 
night, I sent you a revised volume schedule of our sales to EES for 1/31; 
however, I failed to change the total load at SP-15 to reflect cuts. Now 
you'll see the CORRECT revisions made at all delivery points. Let me know if 
you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate

No, this was incorrect. I'll tell you something - Real Time is having 
problems figuring out who they do and do not trade with. We're going to have

Subject: contacts

Currently, we do not confirm west deals that flow 6 days or less so we have 
not had to be real difficult about contact names in deal entry.  However, 
starting February 1, we are going to confirm all next day deals in the west 
using the same criteria we do in the east - that is - deals 3 days or less 
are sent on a confirmation that does not require a signature and everthing 
else on a letter requiring a signature.  Hourly deals will not be confirmed.  
So it is very important that the traders fill in a contact name when they are 
entering deals.  The confirmation letter cannot be prepared without a contact 
name.  It stops the whole process.  We are not going to be able to put names 
in every time they do not.  

If they do not see the contact they want in the drop down list,  put the 
correctly spelled first and last name in the comment section in deal entry 
and we will add this contact to the list and it should appear the next day.

If you can help us out with this, maybe we won't have to keep asking you for 
contacts.

Thanks!

I think I found what you're looking for:

www.ferc.fed.us

Once you get to the home page, click on the ""gas"" icon. From there, hit the 
link to the ""FERC Gas Tariffs Page."" Then it gives you a choice of viewing 
the tariffs in HTML or saving them to a different file. 

I wasn't quite sure how you wanted to review this information. The website is 
updated every 30 days, or so it said, so you may just want to keep it 
bookmarked and check it out whenever you need the information.

If I totally missed the mark, please let me know and I'll keep looking."

This probably happened because he is a daily or hourly trader and in the past 
we have not seen these deals to see the notes to add the contacts.  With the 
change in the criteria for confirmation, we will now view these deals and add 
the contacts as they come across.  If anyone has a list of contacts they want 
added, please send the names and the company name and we will put them into 
the system.

I forwarded this e-mail on to all our traders to give them a heads up about 
the new process. I did receive feedback from one trader, Mark Fischer, who 
said that when he began with Enron he was always told that if a contact name 
was not in the system that he was supposed to enter it into the comments 
section. He did this diligently under the pretense that eventually these 
names would be added to the system, but they apparently never were. He wanted 
to let me know of this, especially because when the traders are hurriedly 
entering deals, they probably won't always take the time to type in the 
contact name in the comments section.

Let's see if we can update this list somehow. Let me know who I can contact 
for this or how we can set this up.

Thanks,

Kate, that would be me. I need to see if the New Counterparty is the State of 
California Dept. of Water Resources or if the counterparty name in Enpower is 
correct: California Dept. of Water Resources. If it is the second one then we 
can choose the CP in Enpower. If it is the first one then we need to set them 
up in Global. This is Kerri Thompsons broker. I am also copying her so she is 
kept in the loop. Please let me know.

Thanks,

Kimberly

Here's the long and short of the contact name list. It sounds like now that 
the confirmation group is taking the time to look at all daily deals, they 
might pay attention to daily traders' needs as well. Let's hope.

If you could possibly write down contact names that still aren't in the 
system, I'll send it on to the IT group in Houston and we should be able to 
get them in the system shortly.

Thanks,
Kate

                March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas

http://www.pmaconference.com/0103Agenda.pdf

EVERY CRISIS HOLDS OPPORTUNITIES:

Power shortages boost merchant power, distributed generation, peak shaving, 
real-time pricing and energy management. Some states are delaying their 
retail choice programs, but others are moving ahead, confident that they have 
benefited from the lessons learned by the pioneering jurisdictions. Electric 
price volatility drives growth in the risk management business.

Credit and cash flow are squeezed, but financial products provide solutions. 
Gas price volatility is a reminder-- coal was and remains the great source of 
energy for our country. Dot-coms seem to have been exposed as just ordinary 
businesses-- but online trading in energy is the single most robust area for 
transactions on the net. The IPO market hasn?t been kind to technology 
stocks-- but it likes energy issues. Broadband trading has been slow to take 
off, but powerline telecom may solve the real problem-- access to ""the last 
mile"".

Please join us at the Power Marketing Association?s annual spring meeting, 
""POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY"" March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas, for 
presentations on these topics and more!

Warmest Regards,
Glenn Lovin
Executive Director

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing

considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

I've changed it to be confirmed. Chris Mallory usually does mostly daily 
deals, so his deal blotter probably defaults to no confirm.

Thanks,

I guess the broker resolved this - I checked and it is APB's deal. Let me 
know if there's still a discrepancy.

          POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY

                March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas

http://www.pmaconference.com/0103Agenda.pdf

EVERY CRISIS HOLDS OPPORTUNITIES:

Power shortages boost merchant power, distributed generation, peak shaving, 
real-time pricing and energy management. Some states are delaying their 
retail choice programs, but others are moving ahead, confident that they have 
benefited from the lessons learned by the pioneering jurisdictions. Electric 
price volatility drives growth in the risk management business.

Credit and cash flow are squeezed, but financial products provide solutions. 
Gas price volatility is a reminder-- coal was and remains the great source of 
energy for our country. Dot-coms seem to have been exposed as just ordinary 
businesses-- but online trading in energy is the single most robust area for 
transactions on the net. The IPO market hasn?t been kind to technology 
stocks-- but it likes energy issues. Broadband trading has been slow to take 
off, but powerline telecom may solve the real problem-- access to ""the last 
mile"".

Please join us at the Power Marketing Association?s annual spring meeting, 
""POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY"" March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas, for 
presentations on these topics and more!

Warmest Regards,

New! Five additional RealVideo-based powerpoint-based presentations, with the 
accompanying audio. Running about 30 minutes each, the new selections include:

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office, 
information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

RETAIL: WHAT WENT WRONG, HOW TO FIX IT. Retail electric deregulation has thus 
far been an underwhelming success, but a great deal has been learned, and it 
is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

MANAGING BILLING. The complex requirements for managing billing and 
commodities in the deregulating energy industry cannot be met with current 
CIS and CRM technology. Energy Retailers must embrace the next evolution of 
energy customer management (ECM) solutions. Paul Grey, Chief Technology 
Officer, Peace Software.

THE INTERNET AND THE VELOCITY FACTOR. Greater price transparency, faster 
execution, reduced transaction costs, increased number and frequency of 
transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to 
energy markets wrought by the web, and it's just beginning. Implecations of 
the internet for energy markets. E. Russell ""Rusty"" Braziel, Chairman and 
Director, Altra Energy Technologies.

I checked with Diana Scholtes, the trader on this deal, and she said the 
counterparty was supposed to be CERS - California Energy Resource Schedulers. 
I've changed the name, but let me know if your records still show California 
Dept. of Water Resources.

Thanks,
Kate

I believe Melissa had talked to you about checking once again to see if these 
deals should be against the PX index.  It is our understanding that we are 
going to have to move everything that is against that index to another index 
at some point.

Thanks!

These deals were entered to flatten out the traders' positions in the PX. You 
shouldn't see the index being used on any deals past tomorrow (the exchange 
closes effective Feb. 1), but Bob Badeer and Matt Motley both had positions 
they needed to back out of. They turned around and bought the same amount at 
the Dow Jones index. Hope this helps!

I've added two new swaps to reflect the change from the California PX to the 
Dow Jones index after 1/31/01. The following deal numbers cover the whole 
term of the deal.

404980 - 9/1/00 through 1/31/01 @ PX NP15 Index
512726 - 2/1/01 through 8/31/03 @ DJ NP15 Peak Index
512743 - 2/1/01 through 8/31/01 @ DJ NP15 Off-Peak Index

Both new deals have comments that link them back to the original deal. Let me 
know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate

I've changed all the deals I could find that contained the counterparty name 
""California Department of Water Resources - CDWR"" to ""California Energy 
Resource Schedulers - State of California."" The following deal numbers are 
those that have been changed. If you come across other daily deals, most 
likely done by EPMI Short Term California or Short Term Northwest, let me 
know and I'll change those counterparty names too.

The Prebon broker was pulling his tapes this morning when I asked Chris about 
it - he said he'd let me know as soon as they worked it out. I just checked 
with Chris again, and apparently the broker pulled tapes from the wrong day. 
But we should know soon. I'll e-mail you right away.

I don't see any deals with any of these terms in Tom's trade log for today. 
He's left the office, and I've left him a message on his cell phone - but 
until then, I can't really say if this is good or not. Could it be a Mark 
Fischer deal?

Looks like Tom forgot this deal on Friday - I've just entered it. Deal # is 
514006. One thing I didn't check on was whether it was off-peak or on-peak.

I don't see any deals with any of these terms in Tom's trade log for today. 
He's left the office, and I've left him a message on his cell phone - but 
until then, I can't really say if this is good or not. Could it be a Mark 
Fischer deal?

Salt Lake City, confident the power will be there for you when your business 
needs it.

INVESTMENT BANKS POWER UP THEIR ENERGY PRACTICES
Wall Street is hungry for the latest hot sector, now? that deals from 
Internet and telecommunications companies have slowed.... Large investment 
banks? such as Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith 
Barney Inc.--as well as? second-tier players like ING Barings and 
Rothschild--have been adding talent with expertise in? utilities and power 
companies. 

TIGHT WATER SUPPLY SEEN AS CALIFORNIA COPES WITH POWER CRISIS
They are predicting low Sierra Nevada snowpack levels throughout the summer 
in California, which depends heavily on runoff to power hydroelectric plants.

power generation in Florida by 2007.

Just FYI -
The tie point and Cal PX deals we uploaded this morning did in fact load as 
Enron Online deals. Oh joy!

I talked to Will Smith, who said he thought he'd heard this complaint before 
and very cordially agreed to take a look at it. I just thought I'd keep you 
informed of the latest episode in what I'm sure will be an award-winning 
series. (How about ""The Good, the Bad, and the Cal PX Bridge""?)

These two deals do not have contacts but are coded to be confirmed.  Can you 
check and see if she does want them to be confirmed and if so, please add 
contacts.

We are still planning on confirming the daily deals in the west, but we have 
run into system problems so we have pushed the start date back a little.  
I'll let you know when we have a definite date.

Here are all of the deal numbers that correspond with today's tie point, Cal 
PX, and Cal Imbalance deals. I erased the EOL transaction numbers on the 
first four, but I believe they were going in a sequence beginning at 627.

I'm sending a copy of the error message I received when I tried to enter our 
futures deals today. The application saved one deal, but 
would not accept the other two. The only difference between the three deals 
is the delivery month. Is there any way we can get this fixed soon? 
The clearing broker has had a record of these deals since Jan. 31, and the 
trader is getting a little antsy to have them recorded in our 
system. Thanks so much for your help....

Kate:

As we've discussed, the switch from PX to DJ index still seems problematic 
for deal # 404980 (the original deal).  Please double check the deal entry in 
the new deals you've created (#512726.1 and #512743.1) to substitute the 
original one, and let us know how things are going asap so we can correct our 
distorted P&L report.

Thanks,
Fran

This deal was entered as New Counterparty which is fine for a short period of 
time.  However, within a few days someone needs to make sure to change the 
deal to the correct counterparty name.  Can you look into this and let me

Kate, Melissa gave me the spreadsheet with all trades that need to be changed 
from Cal PX to Dow Jones SP/NP. After looking up the trades in Enpower these 
are the ones that have not been changed to reflect Dow Jones SP/NP. Could you 
please let me know when these might me changed? The ones in bold have been 
killed in Enpower.


Thanks,

I think that there may be a slight misunderstanding here.

Here are the major differences between Cross-Desk and Cross-Portfolio deals...

Cross-Desk deals are:
? Flagged as desk-to-desk
? NOT scheduled

Cross-Portfolio deals are:
? Flagged as NON-desk-to-desk
? scheduled depending on the deal type (e.g. Forwards are scheduled, 
Emissions are not)

The new deals in question are entered into the system as Cross-Portfolio 
deals because of the WEST - ENAEXEC portfolio relationship.  Because these 
deals were scheduled, they were showing up in Real Time.  By the way, I think 
I was talking to Carla (not Cara) about Real Time.  I apologize about the 
error.  I cannot explain why the deals are not showing up in Forward 
Obligation.

As you said, perhaps Duong Luu can resolve the issue later this week.

Thanks,
Will

Will,

I talked to Cara, and she does not agree with what you have stated below.  
She said that cross-desk deals should never show up in real-time position 
manager.  Stacey is also correct,  we have always been able to see 
cross-desks in Forward Obligations - this is not a new development.   Duong 
Luu will be in the Portland office Thursday and Friday,  perhaps we can 
resolve this issue at that time.

Thanks,
Monica

I do not understand why they would not show up in forward obligation.  
Currently, forward obs reads from Deal Entry and if they choose the region / 
delivery point that these deals are entered under they should automatically 
show up.  Maybe the forward obs is not recognizing the new portfolio.

Since I am not sure we have resolved this issue yet...

If EnPower is not recognizing the change from WEST-EAST to WEST-WEST... 
EnPower needs to be fixed.  We can manually fix any deals that are still in 
error.

Recently there has been the addition of ENAEXEC.  And some WEST-ENAEXEC deals 
have been created.  
? Should these deals appear in scheduling (according to Cara, they should at 
least show up in Real Time)?  
? Should these deals show up in Forward Obligations?  This is something that 
Portland has hinted at wanting.

Please let me know how we should start handling these new deals.

Thanks,
Will

Stacey,

I think what happened was that originally this deal was entered into with 
ST-NW as the desk and LT-MGMT as the counterparty.  Since LT-MGMT is either 
in the East or Financial Portfolio (I'm not sure - is that Lavorato's book?), 
and ST-NW is in the West Portfolio, it originally showed up as an outside 
counterparty in scheduling.  When the desk got changed to LT-WMGMT (West 
Portfolio), it should have flipped to an interdesk, which does not show up in 
scheduling.  Evidently, it didn't.  

If Enpower won't automatically recognize the change in counterparty 
correctly, I guess we will have to kill the deals and rebook them, rather 
than change the desk.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Monica

Sent email to Stacey asking her to explain the difference between cross-desk 
and cross-portfolio deals.

Yes, this is coming up as a consistent problem, these cross-portfolio deals 
are throwing us off balance.  Why are they marked physical? There is no 
delivery.

I don't think these should be marked physical.

Cara,

I noticed that this deal was since changed from cross-portfolio to 
desk-to-desk.  Is there still an issue here?
FYI, all cross-portfolio deals are entered with the scheduled flag set to 
""yes"".

please Check that Deal_Schedule_yn flag to no on this.  

We need to fix the underlying bug when we get a chance.  I think it is more 
related to the cross desk deals done with EPMI LT WMGMT instead of EOL

To all:

I ran a minibook valuing the Merced correction (as of yesterday's curves), 
and confirmed that the LTNW book will lose approximately $6.8MM in value 
after the calc today.  This reverses the $7MM gain that was incorrectly shown 
in the LTNW book on yesterday's DPR.  Please let me know if there are any 
questions.

I just spoke with Holli, and she reported that the confirmation has been 
awaiting a signature at Grant County for the past week. She said she plans to 
send it to Kim Theriot as soon as she gets it back. Let me know if that 
sounds good; otherwise, I can ask her about sending you an unsigned copy.

Willie -
Per our conversation - the West Power desk needs three new settlement indices 
for entering swaps deals in EnPower. The indices are as follows:

Last day settle for MIDC NYMEX contract
Last 5-day average for PALO VERDE NYMEX contract
Last 5-day average for COB NYMEX contract

Please let me know if you have any questions. The first index is a little 
more pressing than the other two - one of our traders did a futures deal a 
week ago which we have yet to swap from his book to the one it belongs in. We 
can't execute the swap until we have a MIDC settlement index. 

Thank you so much for your help.

Kate, I have done extensive research to obtain the Nymex prices that you have 
requested, and I have concluded the following.
Nymex website does not show a code for Nymex MIDC contract
Nymex Palo Verde (KV), and Nymex COB (MW) do not show settlement prices for 
these power contracts.
Finally, are you sure these are Nymex contracts.
I have checked the Nymex website at: http://www.nymex.com, under Markets, 
Commodity Codes, Futures and Options Data, 
Nymex Divisions Futures Contracts, MIDC, PV, and COB Electricity, Settlement  
Data without results. Stacey White (Enpower Pub Posting), 
Kimat Singla (Risks), and Jeremy Wong (IT), have no idea on the locations of 
the prices  in Nymex.  Can you possibly get
with the trader that made the deal to fill us in on the location to these 
prices, or if he will supply us with the prices that he wants posted?

Thanks, wlh"

Nancy,

I have attached a draft Confidentiality Agreement for your review. If it is 
acceptable, please sign and fax a copy to me at 503-464-3740. We should be 
able to begin work with a faxed document in place.  

As we discussed, we need to analyze two sources of water for the project; 
city water and the port's well water. Please overnight the containers for 
collection of the water to me at: 

Enron North America
121 SW Salmon, 3WTC 0306
Portland, OR 97204
(Tel.: 503-464-3830)

Ed Clark and I will collect the water samples Friday morning and overnight 
them to you (Saturday delivery) to make sure that they are there first thing 
Monday morning. 

I was able to find a Well and Water Right Evaluation that was performed by 
Robinson and Noble, Inc. If you could send your fax number to me and to Kate 
Symes (ksymes@enron.com), we will fax you a copy for your review. I will also 
work on getting you a conceptual design of the project for analysis of the 
waste water flow.

Thank you in advance for your assistance and speedy response. I realize that 
we are targeting an aggressive date (the morning of October 23) for the work 
to be completed. 

Sincerely,
Laura Wente
503-464-3830
