Rich and Dave, attached are my suggested revisions to Mike McLeod's draft of 
an amendment to the original electric service agreement.  Dave, I'll bring 
you a copy of that agreement.  Rich, if Mike did not send you one, let me 
know and I will fax it to you.  

In my revisions, I've attempted to reflect the least cost billing you 
described to me, using terminology I read in the tariff.  Please let me know 
if it looks alright to you.  I'm available to discuss this whenever you are, 
then I will make sending this to Mike top priority.  My sincerest apologies 
for the delay; there has been more chaos around here than I am accustomed to 
handling, and I appreciate your patience.

P.S. -- Dave, on your wish list you had included an evergreen provision.  See 
Section 2 of the original contract, which gives TW the right to extend for 
another five-year term by giving notice to SPS.  If TW does not give such 
notice, SPS may cancel the contract, and if it doesn't, the contract 
automatically rolls over for another year.  If this is not acceptable please 
let me know.

What if we replace Section 2 with something like ""This Agreement shall 
continue in effect unless and until terminated pursuant to Section 3,""  and 
replace Section 3 with ""Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon 
written notice to the other Party not less than twelve (12) months prior to 
the intended date of termination.""

Sound OK?  if so I'll add it to my draft.

Rich - Dave and I were just discussing whether a period less than 12 months 
would be appropriate (see language below), given that dereg. may bring some 
changes we want to take advantage of.  It's basically your call:  if SPS were 
to terminate our contract, how much time would we need to negotiate a 
replacement?

Hi Brian!  How nice to hear from you.  Congrats on being an uncle.  Scott is 
a good-looking baby!  Yes, I'm pretty psyched about little Grayson; she is a 
sweetie!  Karin and Jim are anxious to give me a refresher course on 
babysitting skills.  I told them that when my niece is old enough to 
understand the command ""Go find your shoes and I'll help you put them on,"" 
I'll be happy to take her off their hands for a weekend!  I too am in no rush 
to have kids.  While my boyfriend is a great guy and loves children, somehow 
I just can't imagine him hanging around the house helping with diapers!

I am so glad you're enjoying Tampa.  Picking up and moving can be a great 
thing sometimes.  I will never regret leaving Austin for Houston.  There is 
just so much here I enjoy doing and my social life is a whole lot better.  
The job is absolutely crazy.  If you ever watch ""ER,"" that is usually what my 
day looks like, only without all the blood!  Here at Enron Gas Pipeline Group 
I work as the only lawyer for a very busy commercial team.  We sit in an open 
work area and it is chaotic every day.  But it's a good crash course in 
business for me, and my clients are wonderful.  

Do take some study breaks and keep in touch!  E-mail is a wonderful thing.

Time to hit the tennis courts.

Love,
Susan

Susan,

Hi, how are you doing? I got your e-mail address from Aunt Sheila. I had
earlier gotten her e-mail address from my Dad and sent her an e-mail after
hearing about Karin giving birth. So how about that! Are you excited about
being an Aunt? I can accept being an uncle much more than being a dad. I am
in no hurry to have kids. Actually, I am in no hurry to get married. I think
I would be  good dad, although I would have to settle down a bit. But that
won't happen anytime soon, as I am enjoying the Tampa area too much. I moved
down here last August and am loving it.

I just got done taking the CPA exam and am scheduled to take the FL Bar exam
in July. So I will not be enjoying FL too much for the next few months. I
just thought I would drop you a line and see how you are doing. How is
Houston? Are you still enjoying it there? How's the job? Have you made
partner yet? Have you seen much of Grayson since her birth? Well enough ?'s,
I have to go. Let me know how you are doing! Take care.

Your cousin,

Brian

Here are my standard rules for my witnesses on examination by opposing 
counsel.  They are worth learning well ahead of time because they can be very 
difficult to follow.  Memorize these and we'll do fine on cross (assuming we 
even get any questions).

1.  Listen carefully to the question.
2.  Answer only that question; do not volunteer more.
3.  If you don't know for sure what the answer is, just say so.
4.  If you cannot answer a ""yes"" or ""no"" question with ""yes"" or ""no,"" say so 
and explain why.

Hi Mum!  I'm up for birthday celebration this weekend.  Can you believe I 
actually have a gift for Jim already?  I'll try to get there as early as I 
can tomorrow.  Bill will not be coming with me because he has too much work 
piled up, including clients to visit in jail!  My first priority is sleep as 
I have not gotten much this week -- I keep waking up in the middle of the 
night; it's miserable.  To make things worse, I think a ghost has appeared to 
Goo.  She is really freaked out about something, pacing around and acting 
like she hears things.  Gabby is her usual self.

How's the pool?  I'll bring my suit just in case...

Love,
Sooz

Hi, Sooz!

Hope you haven't had to try to play catch-up since returning from your trip.

I was just thinking since we'll all be together this weekend, maybe I'll bake
a birthday cake for Jim.  His birthday is the 20th.  Don't worry about having
to have a gift ready.  I'm not going to give him his gift until next week.  I
haven't heard for sure, but they will probably leave Sat., maybe after
dinner, like before.

Did Karin tell you Grayson had used red paint with her feet in nursery the
other day?!  Karin is wondering what kind of ""craft"" she made.  It must be
something for Mother's Day!!

High Fidelity, the new John Cusak movie is very good.  Joan is in it as well.

See you soon!  love, mum   p.s. is Bill coming?

Wow, you struck a nerve with this one!  My grandmother (Mema) is an absolute 
nightmare when around family, but really sweet to everyone else!  Everyone 
tells me how wonderful and nice she is (she meets lots of people I know on 
her commute to her office downtown), and I just have to keep my mouth shut 
because no one would believe some of the things she says & does.  Example:  
over Christmas she kept trying to tell my 8-months pregnant sister all kinds 
of delivery-room horror stories!  I finally had to yell at her to get her to 
shut up.  Maybe you remember Mema; she calls every so often and bullies 
receptionists and secretaries into tracking me down instead of just leaving a 
message.  Of course, everyone but me thinks it is really cute.

Hope your holiday was really great!

I have been working with Ramona and Lorraine to make system adjustments to 
TW's LFT arising from conclusions made at a Northern LFT meeting a few weeks 
ago.  One change that has been called for is that if a Limited Day is called 
(for now let's say a total Limited Day, without notifying shippers of any 
percentages), no LFT can flow at any time during that day but the LFT shipper 
would have the option to flow IT to the extent space is available.  If a 
Limited Day were called notifying shippers that only a certain percentage 
would flow, LFT shippers would be able to flow that percentage, and the rest 
could be scheduled IT.  

Drew latched onto this when I mentioned it to him and wanted to debate this 
change with me.  As currently configured, TW's system would allow LFT 
shippers to put in nominations on a Limited Day, and if any LFT capacity were 
in fact available that LFT would be scheduled.  Similarly, if TW were to 
notify shippers of a partial Limited Day (say 50%), and 60% of the capacity 
in fact became available, TW's system (today) would allow LFT shippers to put 
their nominations in and flow 60%, not limit them to 50%.   TW's tariff 
language appears suitably vague to allow this --  a Limited Day is defined as 
a day on which TW may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part, and 
the billing section has a provision for Limited Days on which any quantity of 
gas is transported.  

Our question was whether, by changing TW's LFT system as described in the 
first paragraph, we wouldn't be leaving some firm transportation revenue on 
the table (because the IT rate is generally lower than our firm rate).  If 
so, is the change necessary for some other reason?   Please let me know what 
you think.

Hi Mum!  I had a fun time this weekend.  It was good to have everyone 
together.  Glad K&J are relaxing about Mema and the baby.  She gets such a 
kick out of seeing her.  Thanks for the new clothes; I still can't believe we 
let you shop for us on Mother's Day weekend!  

Got a message that Lois came by and got the dishes.  Earlier when I was in a 
meeting she left a voice mail saying she wasn't sure what exit to use off of 
610.  Wish they lived closer and I could have just stopped by.

Had another sleepless night Sun. and finally took some Unisom and had a good 
night's sleep last night.  What a relief.  I have really never had this 
problem before.  It's good to have a lot of energy, but you have to shut down 
sometime.

Am sending you my travel schedule for next week.  The following week (May 29 
- June 2) I'm planning to be in SF also, but I'm not sure I'll actually have 
to be there that long.

Have a good afternoon!

Love,
Sooz

Hi, Sooz!  Hope you had a good trip back home yesterday.  I really do wish
Houston were at least an hour closer.

Thank you for the beautiful pjs and robe and for the Sunday brunch.  I wish
Karin had been more help to you, but then, she never has been.  I really
appreciate all your work.

Good cartoon on the editorial page this a.m.:  Putin, the new Russian
president, was seated at his desk when an aide comes in and says, "" George W.
Bush wants to know if you're related to Ras Putin.""

Darrell and I went on an early morning walk and neither of us felt very well
and doubled back before reaching the bridge.  I think I was all tuckered out
from our Sun. walk.

The 3 of us were trying to get together for Darrell's birthday lunch, so I'm
going to make lunch here on Sat.  Cathy is coming into town for a haircut and
K&J&G will be here since Karin has an appt. as well.  We usually go out to
lunch, but I don't want to miss any baby time!

I'm cleaning up the house from the weekend today.  Hope you have a good week.
 love, mum

Edd, looks like the gas industry restructuring thing is going to bring me to 
SF next Tues. thru Thurs., then May 29 thru June 2.  I had thought about 
going for the whole Memorial Day weekend, but Bill's going to be in Boston 
the following weekend, so I now think that June 3 - 4 would be the better 
weekend for me to hang out in Cali.  It's all sort of loosey-goosey anyway 
because the judge has not announced the order in which witnesses will be 
presented.  I think she forgets some of us are from out of town!  Makes it 
really hard to plan.  I'll know for sure by the 25th.  Thank goodness for 
refundable airline tickets.  Anyway, are going to be around that 1st weekend 
of June?  And -- might you be available for dinner next Tuesday or 
Wednesday?  These guys like to talk business well into the evening hours, but 
my interest starts to wane near suppertime and I could probably make excuses 
and leave.

Bill and I took a whirlwind trip to Arizona a couple of weekends ago.  He was 
in Bullhead City, of all places, where his uncle has a vacation home.  I 
joined him a few days later in Vegas.  Luckily he had been to Laughlin 2 
nights in a row and had gotten blackjack out of his system.  We set out for 
Sedona but first had to stop at Hoover Dam, then a diner in Kingman (on Route 
66 of course).  Stayed a couple of nights in Sedona, where we climbed lots of 
rocks (which we later found out were protected nature preserve areas -- oops) 
and got real dusty and sunburned.  Then we drove up to the Grand Canyon and 
hung out at the South Rim.  Actually, we climbed down Bright Angel Trail & 
back up, then drove straight to the Las Vegas airport, from which we took the 
redeye so Bill could make it to his trial the next day.    I would really 
love to spend more time in the Grand Canyon -- maybe not this fall, but the 
next.  

Ciao fo' now, and lots of soul

On Friday the Commission issued an order suspending (until October 15, 2000) 
TW's tariff sheets for acquiring PNM capacity, and calling for a technical 
conference.  The Commission stated that while TW's proposal may be in the 
public interest, further investigation of the issues, including those raised 
by Dynegy in its protest, is necessary prior to authorization.  The order 
does not make clear what issues are to be investigated, but they seem to 
include:  whether TW will, in effect, become a marketer for PNM's services, 
whether the rates are just and reasonable and whether there is any expansion 
of monopoly power.  Additionally, the Commission noted that while PNM has 
certificate (i.e., public convenience & necessity) authority to transport gas 
in interstate commerce, PNM will ""have to either explain how it has 
appropriate rate authority for transportation of natural gas in interstate 
commerce, or seek appropriate rate authority from the Commission.""   Lorraine 
has forwarded a copy of the order to PNM so that they can begin taking the 
appropriate steps.

I will talk with regulatory about technical conference dates and will tell 
you when I have further information.  If you would like a copy of the order, 
let me know."

Here is the language you requested for our posting:

Since the 311 belt/suspenders approach didn't quite fit, I've had to try to 
convince Mr. Hertzberg that he ought to rely on the NGA Sec. 1 exemption for 
gatherers (Frank Kelly and Frazier concur with us on this, by the way).  He 
is not convinced yet, although he is unable to cite any authority for his 
proposition that being a shipper on TW would subject a gathering company to 
FERC jurisdiction.  I pointed out that Agave, the owner and operator of an 
extensive gathering system that interconnects with TW's system, has for many 
years been a shipper on TW.  Also, Lindy has found that Red Cedar already has 
a long-term transportation contract on another interstate system, 
Transcolorado, so if Hertzberg's theory is right they are going to jail 
anyway!

Red Cedar also seems to be hung up on our requirement that shippers have 
title to the gas they ship.  At this point Lorraine and I believe they might 
just be looking for any excuse to get out of the deal.  If anything 
interesting happens I'll let you know."

Subject: Re: TW LFT  

I agree with Glen's comments,  anything greater than the allowed MDQ can flow 
or be scheduled, but it would be at the IT rate.  Based on the contract, the 
overrun rate is usually the same as the firm rate so I don't believe there is 
a revenue issue.  Keep in mind, when a day is limited the mdq is ""reduced"" 
systemiatically  to that level so anything greater is overrun.  MK

Subject: Re: TW LFT  

Although I would like to collect the LFT revenue in the second example on 
60%, isn't the extra unanticipated  10% TI? The tariff is vague in regard to 
partial days.  It appears we could call a partial limited day  based on a 
percentage of the MDQ or a specific volume level however once we have 
announced the firm level haven't we made a commitment only to that level of 
MDQ on a firm basis and any other volumes that might flow would be regarded 
as overrun?

Subject: TW LFT

I have been working with Ramona and Lorraine to make system adjustments to 
TW's LFT arising from conclusions made at a Northern LFT meeting a few weeks 
ago.  One change that has been called for is that if a Limited Day is called 
(for now let's say a total Limited Day, without notifying shippers of any 
percentages), no LFT can flow at any time during that day but the LFT shipper 
would have the option to flow IT to the extent space is available.  If a 
Limited Day were called notifying shippers that only a certain percentage 
would flow, LFT shippers would be able to flow that percentage, and the rest 
could be scheduled IT.  

Drew latched onto this when I mentioned it to him and wanted to debate this 
change with me.  As currently configured, TW's system would allow LFT 
shippers to put in nominations on a Limited Day, and if any LFT capacity were 
in fact available that LFT would be scheduled.  Similarly, if TW were to 
notify shippers of a partial Limited Day (say 50%), and 60% of the capacity 
in fact became available, TW's system (today) would allow LFT shippers to put 
their nominations in and flow 60%, not limit them to 50%.   TW's tariff 
language appears suitably vague to allow this --  a Limited Day is defined as 
a day on which TW may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part, and 
the billing section has a provision for Limited Days on which any quantity of 
gas is transported.  

Our question was whether, by changing TW's LFT system as described in the 
first paragraph, we wouldn't be leaving some firm transportation revenue on 
the table (because the IT rate is generally lower than our firm rate).  If 
so, is the change necessary for some other reason?   Please let me know what 
you think.

Tony & Frazier -- several comments from TW Commercial.

Page 1:  Streamlined Credit -- what does ""interested parties"" mean? parties 
interested in bidding, or parties interested in us having a look at their 
credit ?  Probably need to make this clear; on first reading, looks like 
obtaining credit approval ahead of time is optional.  (Don't we want everyone 
to get approval ahead of bidding?).

Page 2:  you state that ""individual bid transactions are kept confidential.""  
What is confidential:  the identity of the shipper?  the bid itself?  In TW's 
IOS, we post the individual bids as they come in, but do not post the name of 
the shipper.  We feel that the posting of the dollar amount bids helps us get 
a higher rate as shippers bid against each other, and likewise recommend 
online bids be posted in real time.  I notice you call them ""sealed bids"" on 
page 4 -- not true if we're going to show them.

Page 3:  why not request a little more emphatically that shippers establish 
creditworthiness at least several days in advance of bidding?  Especially 
since we plan to attract brand-new shippers by offering this service.  Our 
credit dept. folks would probably appreciate not having to do it all between 
2 and 4 on bid day.

If we're asking that shippers submit bids to 3 decimal places, our example 
should be to 3 decimal places (e.g., $0.351).

Page 7:  ""an"" Capacity Trading Agreement should be ""a"" Capacity Trading 
Agreement.

Page 8:  So we don't appear low-tech, let's go ahead and tell shippers we 
plan to have the Request for Service and the service agreement available for 
online submittal at some point in the near future.

Also, we've never asked shippers to submit a Request for Service with each 
bid.  A shipper may bid and re-bid several times over the bidding process.  
They really only need to submit the Request for Service at the time of, or 
prior to, the first bid.  I recommend stating ""You must submit a Request for 
Service prior to making your initial bid"" so they don't think they have to 
submit a new one every time they revise their bid.

Page 9:  Under ""When TW will Respond"":  need to specify how notification will 
be sent.  

Page 14:  Column that says ""Price"" should say ""Rate"" (for a second there we 
thought you were talking about gas prices).  Also, please use example rates 
that are more realistic for TW (in the $0.240 to $0.299 would be great...)

Thanks for all your hard work on this.  I'll be here if you have any 
questions.

Subject: TW Webtext on EOL

Attached is a revised draft of the webtext. You will note that we have added 
the transportation service request form in the text. The bidder will have to 
print the form, fill it out and fax it to us because it is our understanding 
that we can't work it into the website for completion and execution online in 
the time frame for July 1 service. 

Also, please note that (1) we have changed the some of the information in the 
Account Manager grid and (2) the attached draft assumes that the Bid List, 
from the original text, is the same document as the Account Manager page .  

We are assuming that we would not be able to get the Transportation Service 
Agreement available for online execution by clicking for July 1. Thus, we 
will handle the service agreement manually. However, for subsequent months we 
contemplate establishing contracting procedures so that the service agreement 
can be executed online by a click. 


Frazier and Tony

 When the Commission granted Texas Eastern authority to hold capacity on 
another pipeline in Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation, 74 FERC P 61,074 
(1996), it stated that when a pipeline holds capacity on an upstream 
pipeline, the downstream pipeline's customers may hold title to the gas 
transported on the upstream pipeline.  The Commission recognized this as one 
of the limited exceptions to the shipper must have title rule.  Specifically, 
the Commission stated:  

The downstream pipeline will not hold title to gas shipped on capacity it has 
acquired on an upstream 
pipeline. Rather, shippers on the downstream pipeline will hold title to the 
gas on the upstream 
pipeline. We will allow a pipeline to hold the upstream capacity; we will 
not, however, allow the pipeline 
to hold title to the gas being shipped.  Thus, the downstream pipeline will 
be the shipper on the upstream 
pipeline, but will not hold title when the gas is being shipped. This results 
in a limited exception to the rule 
that a shipper must hold title to gas being shipped. 

I believe that if we can address the Commission's other concerns about this 
filing, they will grant a similar waiver for this transaction.  You can feel 
free to pass this along to your contact at PNM."

Dear Judge Biren:

 Transwestern Pipeline Company will be offering the following exhibits:

 1.  Prepared Direct Testimony of Jeffery C. Fawcett on Behalf of 
Transwestern Pipeline Company in Support of the Comprehensive Settlement 
Agreement (Exhibit 12, incorporating Exhibit JCF-1) and 

 2.  Prepared Rebuttal Testimony of Jeffery C. Fawcett on Behalf of 
Transwestern Pipeline Company in Support of the Comprehensive Settlement 
Agreement (Exhibit 17).  

 Transwestern estimates it will need less than 10 minutes for direct 
testimony.  Transwestern does not at this time intend to cross-examine any 
witnesses; however, it reserves the right to request a reasonable amount of 
time to examine witnesses on issues affecting Transwestern to the extent that 
any party's live testimony differs from or conflicts with its prepared 
testimony.

Dear Judge Biren:

 Transwestern Pipeline Company will be offering the following exhibits:

 1.  Prepared Direct Testimony of Jeffery C. Fawcett on Behalf of 
Transwestern Pipeline Company in Support of the Comprehensive Settlement 
Agreement (Exhibit 12, incorporating Exhibit JCF-1) and 

 2.  Prepared Rebuttal Testimony of Jeffery C. Fawcett on Behalf of 
Transwestern Pipeline Company in Support of the Comprehensive Settlement 
Agreement (Exhibit 17).  

 Transwestern estimates it will need less than 10 minutes for direct 
testimony.  Transwestern does not at this time intend to cross-examine any 
witnesses; however, it reserves the right to request a reasonable amount of 
time to examine witnesses on issues affecting Transwestern to the extent that 
any party's live testimony differs from or conflicts with its prepared 
testimony.

In response to your inquiries about whether TW's tariff allows the format 
posting, bidding and awarding of capacity in our EnronOnline proposal, here 
is my 2 cents' worth.

The criteria for awarding capacity is found in the Right of First Refusal 
section of TW's tariff (for some reason that's never been clear to me). See 
Section 13.A. (Sheet No. 18):  ""All available capacity shall be allocated 
under these procedures, and Transporter will not maintain a firm 
transportation queue.""  The ROFR section does specify the posting and bidding 
procedures (including a minimum one month period between posting and the bid 
deadline -- See Section 13.D.) but arguably these timelines only apply to the 
ROFR bidding process, not to an open season for other capacity.  Even if the 
one-month minimum bid period did apply outside the ROFR process, the 
EnronOnline proposal complies by giving shippers at least a month to submit 
bids (Tony -- am I right about this?).

The only other relevant part of our tariff is the EBB/Internet section of the 
General Terms and Conditions (beginning on Sheet No. 72).   TW will continue 
to comply with all provisions in this section.  The section even specifically 
provides that shippers may request service and contract electronically.

I've found nothing in else in TW's tariff that would appear to address an 
online open season one way or the other.  I believe our tariff gives us the 
flexibility to sell capacity online as we've proposed to do.

Hope this helps.  If you want to discuss this I'll be here most of the day, 
and I will be reachable by e-mail while I'm in San Francisco next week.  My 
hearing does not start 'til noon Houston time on Tuesday, so if we need to 
talk Tuesday morning you can reach me at my hotel (415.398.1234).

I was successful shopping for Jim on-line at B&N and Territory Ahead.  Mum, 
only the book will be shipped to your house; I was on autopilot and typed in 
my work address for the other.  (Really missed the boat on tennis clothes.  
You have to act early.  Today I saw one of the Met pros leaving with his 
catalog to order FALL 2000 Nike stuff!)  Karin, I am probably going to make a

Anyway, Ann isn't coming on Friday because she can't stand it that everyone 
is a couple, so she is going instead with her ex boyfriend  to a dinner party 
given by some people she doesn't even know.  Although I am trying very hard 
to be understanding, I'm not doing a very good job.  When I was in her 
situation, I seem to remember enjoying my best friends' company whether I had 
a date or not!  But that's just me.  

Hope you are still having tanning weather in Austin.  We certainly are here.  
If you feel you are not getting enough color for your trip to Cabo, I'll come 
before you leave and help you with the Clinique Tan-In-A-Tube!  (You will 
still have to wear sunscreen).  What are your trip dates again?

Have a good day!

Hi Susan,

Attached below is the draft discount letter to Lorraine's 10 year SWG deal.  
Please review and provide any revisions if necessary.  FYI,  the base FTS-1 
agreement will show that SWG will only have capacity November-March of each 
year.  Therefore do you agree that  my discount language does not need to 
incorporate the Nov-March term designation since the discount rate paragraph 
3 states that the rate shall be multiplied by the total contract quantity (0 
MMcf/d) contract quantity April-Oct)?

Thanks for your expedited review.

Since the market affiliate rule looks at business units rather than the 
function within the business unit (or any firewalls that are set up), since 
he works for ECT I have to say I would be uncomfortable putting him on the 
distribution list.  I know that he has access to the same info, but to give 
him access to our work product is probably a violation of the rule.  

I am out of town, but if you have any questions please e-mail or leave me a

Since the contract quantity goes to zero in Nov.-Mar., they pay no 
reservation charge in those months, so effectively the rate is zero for those 
months.  I suppose we could draft it either way and logistically it would 
work.  We used a similar structure in a deal we did earlier this year, if I 
recall correctly.

Also --  I agree that we would need to file this as a material deviation if 
SWG agrees to include the capacity release provision.  In case FERC does not 
like the provision for some reason, do we want to provide that disapproval by 
FERC will invalidate the whole contract (see language in the recent USGT 
contract), or do we want it to invalidate just that provision and let the 
rest of the deal stand?  It would depend on how much value the parties are 
attaching to that provision and whether we would want a chance to 
renegotiate...and I am assuming we would.  Christine, let me know which is 
preferable and I'll send you some language in the a.m.

It seems to me that if the capacity is only for the months of Nov-Mar, the 
reference to the discounted rate in section 2 should state that it is for the 
period Nov-Mar through 2010.  Also, the language in paragraph 6 should 
eliminate the reference to the tariff, since we don't have it, just start 
with the phrase ""Shipper agrees that if it utilizes -----

Susan, I promise this will be the last time we go through this.  Attached is 
the draft letter.  I have added the words for the discount paragraph ""for the 
term of the contract"" as you requested.  Please provide the additional 
language for the paragragh regarding our retaining  revenues of capacity 
release above the discount level being subject to FERC approval, otherwise if 
not accepted by the FERC then not applicable. Thanks!

Glen, at page 1020 of the transcript of yesterday's proceedings, the judge 
asked you and Norm Pedersen to work with various other parties to develop an 
exhibit reflecting capacity at the California border.  The judge mentioned 
she wanted to discuss the exhibit this morning, so I am surprised that you 
did not attempt to contact me to get Transwestern's input or at least to let 
us review the exhibit.  I would like to review the exhibit as soon as 
possible.  I am out of town but you can either e-mail it to me or fax it to

Subject: RE: Exhibit


At the ALJ's direction, this subject was discussed among the parties who
were present in the hearing room yesterday at the lunch break and again
after the conclusion of hearings for the day.  The parties present reached
agreement on a process for this exhibit.

I had to leave for home immediately after the discussions in the hearing
room at the end of yesterday due to a family emergency.

I am informed the results of these discussions were put on the record today.
I understand that SoCalGas will provide to all parties by June 16 a draft of
the exhibit.  Parties can then comment to SoCalGas and we will attempt to
get a consensus by June 21.  SoCalGas will file by June 21 either a version
that has concensus, or failing concensus, its own version of what it thinks
the exhibit should show.  Parties who do not agree with what SoCalGas files
on June 21 can file on June 23 either their own version or comments on
SoCalGas' version.

I cannot absolutely guarantee the accuracy of the above details since I was
not present today and there is no transcript yet for today.

If this arrangement is not acceptable to Transwestern, you should object to
the ALJ immediately.  Hearings are scheduled to conclude after the lunch
break today.

Also, I am informed that SCGC has distributed in the hearing room and will
attempt to introduce today a written exhibit that includes an extensive
discussion of its views on the subject of ""mismatches"" of delivery and
take-away capacity at the California border.

Luckily, we will have input re. the exhibit, and if SoCal does not cooperate 
to make it accurate, we will be able to file our own with an explanation.  
Lad is such a weasel.  Why don't we try to talk sometime this a.m.

Subject: Socal Receipt Point Exhibit


Well unfortunately, Ladd managed to confuse the judge as to the Upstream
capacity into the Socal system. In doing so he has potentially opened up a
""real"" danger for TW at Hector Rd. and again completely left out of his
testimony S.Needles aka Topock capacity of 200 mmcfd. Now Socal will try to
poll the parties so as to prepare a consensus Exhibit that will put ""fact""
to the upstream capacities into the Socal system. Well, I fear that the
other pipeline lines will shape the facts to their agendas and we will have
a distorted landscape into the Socal system. The downside I perceive is that
the judge will 1) want to Let the Market decide via increasing the maximum
receipt point capacity allowed  or 2) want further comments on the entire
Socal receipt point capacity structure. These two onerous outcomes can be
avoided if the judge receives a consensus Exhibit(at least from the
Settlement parties) that is explained in a consistent manner  and with
common terms. For example, if we look at just FERC capacities in lieu of
perfect design capacities we might calm down these issues.

We will likely lead this process for the CSA parties, Lets discuss Monday
morning. Hope everything went well in Florida, especially you Jeff . I hope
you just banged up your pride and not your body to badly.

Mark, IGS

I'm attaching an article that I just received about the CPUC's and Indicated 
Shippers' protests of the recent ENA deal on El Paso.   I have a call in to 
Drew Fossum to talk about formulating a formal response, and I will keep you 
in that loop in case you get any inquiries.  (My initial, unofficial reaction 
is that with the marketing affiliate rules and other safeguards in place, the 
fact that ENA and Transwestern have the same parent company should make no 
difference to the FERC.)  Until further notice, I would avoid any 
communication with ENA on these issues.  If you have any questions, please 
e-mail or call me (x30596).

Subject: The El Paso Controversy Continues

Enron-El Paso Deal Could Mute Competition to CA

     Fearing an end to pipeline competition in California, the state's 
regulators and Indicated
     Shippers have called on FERC to summarily reject the three 
transportation agreements by
     which Enron North America Corp. has contracted for 1.25 Bcf/d of 
unsubscribed firm
     capacity on El Paso Natural Gas. 

     Approval of these agreements would give Enron Corp., parent of 
Transwestern Pipeline
     and Enron North America, control over all the available transportation 
capacity to the
     southern California border, warned Harvey Morris, principal attorney for 
the California
     Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which plans to submit its protest 
today. Between
     the two pipelines, he estimated Enron will control 2.34 Bcf/d of firm 
capacity from the
     San Juan and Permian basins to California. 

     For Morris, Enron North America's contracting of the El Paso capacity 
represents a
     worse threat to the pipeline's other shippers than Dynegy Marketing and 
Trade, who has
     held the capacity for past two years and whose contract expires Dec. 31. 
""At least then
     there was some Transwestern competition to the Dynegy situation. Now 
it's Enron, the
     owner of Transwestern, who's stepping into Dynegy's shoes."" 

     But ""what's even worse,"" he told NGI, is the revenue-sharing provision 
in the contracts. It
     stipulates that ""after Enron makes $35 million off of these contracts, 
it has to share the
     proceeds with El Paso for 25% of anything beyond $35 million. So 
effectively, Enron and
     El Paso have become partners in how high they can jack up the 
transportation rate
     differential between the California border and the Southwest producing 
basins."" 

     The two pipeline companies ""that have for decades competed with each 
other in carrying
     Southwest supplies to California are now partners. We think that's 
anticompetitive, and
     there's no way FERC should approve it,"" Morris said. He recalled the 
basis differential
     between the San Juan Basin spot price and the California border shot up 
by 17% during
     1998, the first year during which Dynegy controlled the El Paso capacity 
into California.
     This situation could worsen under Enron, he believes. 

     ""At first blush the El Paso-Enron contracts [do] not appear to contain 
the same
     anticompetitive features of the El Paso-Dynegy contracts,"" Indicated 
Shippers noted, but
     a ""closer review and analysis"" reveals the anticompetitive effects of 
the revenue-sharing
     provision (RSP) in El Paso-Enron contracts ""are not only similar"" to 
those of the hotly
     contested reservation-reduction mechanism (RRM) in the El Paso-Dynegy 
case, ""but are
     increased......due to the fact that the contracts are with a marketing 
affiliate of El Paso's
     primary interstate pipeline competitor,"" Transwestern. 

     Both the RRM and RSP ""operate to provide a disincentive for El Paso and 
its competitors
     to compete against each other, or to take any other action that will act 
to drive down the
     basis differential that defines the market value of the capacity,"" 
Indicated Shippers told
     FERC in a protest filed on Wednesday [RP97-287-041]. The group includes 
producers
     Amoco Production, Burlington Resources Oil and Gas, Marathon Oil, and 
Phillips
     Petroleum, and two marketers - Amoco Energy Trading and Phillips Gas 
Marketing. 

     FERC ""should reject the tariff filing immediately. The Commission erred 
in allowing the
     El Paso-Dynegy contracts to remain intact for their two-year term after 
finding that the
     contracts were anticompetitive. This issue is pending in the [D.C. Court 
of Appeals].
     That same error should not be repeated here,"" the producers and 
marketers said. 

     The CPUC's attempt to block the Enron-El Paso contracts at the outset is 
a little bit
     unusual for the agency, Morris said, but it learned its lesson following 
Dynegy. ""When the
     Dynegy situation first hit, we asked for FERC to investigate the matter. 
We thought
     FERC did a very inadequate job then.....This time around we're asking 
for FERC to
     summarily reject it. It's hard for an agency like ours to take such a 
strong stand right at
     the beginning, but we've learned too much from two years of suffering 
under the Dynegy
     situation. And this is even worse."" 

     In the event the Commission should reject California's request, the CPUC 
has asked that
     an ""anti-hoarding condition"" be included in the contracts, which would 
require Enron to
     release unused capacity into the short-term market at a price higher 
than what it's paying
     El Paso for the capacity. ""They must make a little profit,"" Morris 
noted. ""We're confident
     Enron can't use the entire 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity.....so there's going to 
be unused
     capacity."" 

     The agency also wants FERC to clarify that the primary delivery point 
for the Block II
     portion of the capacity (579MMcf/d) is PG&E-Topock in keeping with the 
terms of the
     1996 settlement between El Paso and its customers. Morris said he agreed 
fully with
     Amoco, Burlington Resources and Southern California Gas (SoCalGas), 
which accused
     El Paso of violating the 1996 agreement by allowing Dynegy to use 
SoCalGas-Topock as
     a primary delivery point for the Block II capacity last summer. They 
contend the alleged
     violation is included in the Enron contracts. 

     He also noted the CPUC will challenge the ability of Enron to call back 
Block II capacity
     after it already had been recalled by El Paso shippers to serve Pacific 
Gas and Electric
     (PG&E) customers in northern California. Last July, FERC granted Dynegy 
the right to
     do this under its contracts with El Paso. But Morris contends the 
decision violates the
     1996 settlement under which PG&E paid $54 million to preserve the right 
of the pipeline's
     shippers to recall the Block II capacity to serve end-users in its 
service territory. 

     The CPUC also intends to challenge the Commission's decision that would 
enable Enron
     to ""just sit on the capacity,"" thereby withholding idle Block II 
capacity from the market.
     Indicated Shippers also contend the Enron contracts violate the Block II 
capacity
     provisions of the 1996 rate case, as well as ""exacerbate"" the primary 
firm delivery point
     capacity-allocation issues that are pending before FERC now. 

     The CPUC accused El Paso of ""deliberately"" filing the Enron contracts at 
FERC just
     before the holidays to avoid controversy. The pipeline ""is trying to 
sneak one of the most
     controversial things ever past FERC right before Christmas so that 
protests would be
     minimized,"" said Morris. ""They did this with the Dynegy contracts two 
years ago. They
     have a pattern of filing right at the last minute, making it harder for 
people to protest and
     harder for FERC to stop it from going into effect.""

Tony, I thought there would be a case that stated that if an interstate 
pipeline posts the criteria under which it will evaluate capacity bids, it 
must stick to those criteria and not award the capacity to a bidder on some 
other basis.  It seems a simple enough extension of the principle that 
capacity must be awarded on a nondiscriminatory basis.  However, I did not 
find any case that stands for that exact proposition.  As you may be aware, 
the Commission made Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) come up 
with a way to ensure that it awarded capacity one a nondiscriminatory 
basis...because NGPL was found to have been giving preferential treatment to 
its shippers.  NGPL's solution was to come up with an auction process, and 
there is a whole line of cases if you're interested.  The underlying 
presumption is that if you set up a system under which all capacity is 
awarded and stick with that system, there is no way you could be acting 
discriminatorily.  But of course the Commission never comes out and says this 
even though it should be obvious.

Probably the best we can do is extrapolate from 1) the tariff and 2) the NGA 
(doesn't it also say we have to provide service on a not unduly discrim. 
basis?).  Also, in your memo I'd give an example; i.e., if we notify shippers 
of our auction process and set a deadline for bidding, but then award the 
capacity to Sempra (assuming Sempra requested capacity after the posting), we 
will have unduly discriminated against all the other shippers who had to 
participate in the auction process.  

Maybe in future postings on Enrononline we should include a statement to the 
effect that the capacity posted will not be awarded except thru the 
Enrononline process.

Now for some trivia.  Remember we were discussing with Shelley whether we 
could post a different method (other than that prescribed in the tariff) for 
determining best bid?  In my Westlaw search I ran across the relevant case.  
In Northwest Pipeline, 85 FERC P 61,335, the Commission stated:  ""The 
Commission has previously given pipelines the leeway, in open season 
provisions, to either include in their tariff a single non-discriminatory bid 
evaluation methodology, or provide themselves the flexibility of choosing 
different non-discriminatory bid evaulation methods for different 
transactions, provided that the pipeline posts the bid evaluation methodology 
before the bidding process begins.""  The only problem is I am not sure we 
have that ""flexibility"" since the tariff does not expressly allow us to post 
a different method.  Maybe next time we do a tariff cleanup we could add some 
language allowing us to do so.

I have to move on to my next project but if you want me to comment on what 
you write I'd be happy to.

If I remember correctly, we'll need to paper the additional Sempra capacity, 
either with an amendment or a separate agreement.  I'll be in the office by 
about 9:30 and we can talk about it then. "

Phil Richardson and Sarah Tomalty of Dynegy say that they would probably 
(i.e. subject to management approval) withdraw their protest if we would 
amend our proposed tariff language to limit the quantity of capacity we can 
acquire from PNM to 20,000/day.  Their chief concern is to prevent TW from 
becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity (which has never 
been our intention).  Lorraine is discussing this with Steve to see whether 
this is something we could live with.  The Commission has expressed the same 
concern in the past, so this might make them more comfortable with our 
proposal too.  Comments?  let me know.  "

I know that you've already indicated that you will circulate a draft of the 
late-filed exhibit by Friday, but if you have a draft we could look at 
sooner, that would be great...TW's business people who need to look at it 
will be out at the beginning of next week.  Thanks."

Brian,
Transwestern has reviewed your draft exhibit responsive to Judge Biren's 
inquiry on June 7.  We appreciate your work on it and generally agree with 
the exhibit and the approach taken by SoCalGas.  However, we think it 
appropriate to balance simplicity with the need to be responsive to Judge 
Biren's questions.  

See the attached marked-up version of the exhibit.  We've attempted to 
streamline the data provided for ""non-Wheeler"" points, and to clarify the 
footnotes regarding Wheeler Ridge.  Also, we've modified the numbers 
regarding the TW Topock lateral to accurately reflect the lateral's 400 
MMcf/d physical capability.  We've also made some minor formatting changes.

Let us know what you think.

Jeff Fawcett

In response to your inquiry, Transwestern would first like to clear up the 
terminology being used here.  As you know, currently SoCalGas doesn't assign 
""primary rights"" to deliveries off of any interconnecting pipeline.  The 
establishment of tradeable rights for intrastate capacity is among the issues 
currently under consideration in the GIR proceeding.   However, if what you 
are asking about is what has been the historical or otherwise available 
receipt capacity for Transwestern deliveries at North Needles, then let me 
offer the following. 

Transwestern has always operated on the premise that SoCalGas could 
physically accept up to a maximum of 750 MMcf/d at its North Needles receipt 
point.  Consequently, Transwestern has sold firm transportation to its 
interstate customers for west flow deliveries to North Needles not to exceed 
the 750 MMcf/d limitation.  Our west flow mainline capacity is 1.09 Bcf/d.

Jeff,

From the pipeline group's perspective, this transaction is a commercial 
matter between El Paso and ENA.  Accordingly, the gas pipeline group does not 
believe that it is appropriate to participate in the development of ENA's 
response.  

I do understand that the referenced article and certain of the protests make 
factual allegations about Transwestern's available capacity to California.   
Susan Scott or I can certainly provide corrected information from 
Transwestern's available capacity postings.

please read be story from trade press below.  i have not included et&s folks 
on this note because i'm uncertain regarding the rules with respect to 
communication among business units in these sorts of matters.  if it's 
acceptable to include tw in the notes and in conversations, that would be my 
preference.  rick, is it your view that tw can or cannot be included?

i believe i passed along word of the ena/el paso deal when it hit the press 
week before last.  the press reported both the amount of capacity and the 
price for which ena bought it from el paso.  to summarize:  ena purchased 
1.25 bcf per day for one year starting jan 1, 2000.  ena paid $38 million, 
which gives an average price of $.0831 per mmbtu.  (by contrast, williams 
bought about 0.1 bcf/day at an average rate of $.207.)   el paso released 
this information via a a press release without any prior approval from ena.  
julie, please don't hesitate to fill any holes or (unintended) innaccuracies.

the situation is complicated by the fact that california is currently in the 
midst of intense negotiations over restructuring the state's gas industry.  
the negotiations have been going on for about 8 months and have been very 
contentious.  socal has teamed with indicated producers, california 
manufacturers association, and muni generators from southern california to 
push a very ""go slow"" approach that is (surprise) quite friendly to larger 
users.  enron is teamed with western hub storage, wild goose storage, 
calpine, southern california edison, green mountain power, the city of 
vernon, and spurr/remac (provides services to california's k-12 school 
system) under an alliance called ""california alliance for competition"" 
(snappy, i know).  the cac proposal is pushing, among other things, a single, 
state-wide market for transport, storage and balancing, including tradeable 
rights in a secondary market.

indicated producers has been aggressive and hostile toward marketers--as has 
cma--throughout the negotiations.  ip's bile has not been reserved solely for 
enron, however.  one outcome of the negotiations has been the suit ip 
launched against el paso at ferc regarding el paso's nom process.  (i believe 
ena filed in support of the suit.)  el paso is losing that one and will 
likely change its nom process sooner rather than later.

i think it's important to have a quick call to develop a clear and consistent 
message on the ena deal and coordinate what we're saying about that deal with 
the other gas issues on the table.  i'm assuming that if there's anything we 
can do to keep harvey morris (and california) from mucking up the deal, the 
better.  i know harvey well.  i'm not sure, given his quotes, there's much 
""educating"" to be done, but may make sense to meet with him, nonetheless.  
more important, indicated producers is the real--and biggest--problem.

let me know if you folks think there'd be value in briefly discussing the 
issue.

best,
jeff

Subject: The El Paso Controversy Continues

Enron-El Paso Deal Could Mute Competition to CA

     Fearing an end to pipeline competition in California, the state's 
regulators and Indicated
     Shippers have called on FERC to summarily reject the three 
transportation agreements by
     which Enron North America Corp. has contracted for 1.25 Bcf/d of 
unsubscribed firm
     capacity on El Paso Natural Gas. 

     Approval of these agreements would give Enron Corp., parent of 
Transwestern Pipeline
     and Enron North America, control over all the available transportation 
capacity to the
     southern California border, warned Harvey Morris, principal attorney for 
the California
     Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which plans to submit its protest 
today. Between
     the two pipelines, he estimated Enron will control 2.34 Bcf/d of firm 
capacity from the
     San Juan and Permian basins to California. 

     For Morris, Enron North America's contracting of the El Paso capacity 
represents a
     worse threat to the pipeline's other shippers than Dynegy Marketing and 
Trade, who has
     held the capacity for past two years and whose contract expires Dec. 31. 
""At least then
     there was some Transwestern competition to the Dynegy situation. Now 
it's Enron, the
     owner of Transwestern, who's stepping into Dynegy's shoes."" 

     But ""what's even worse,"" he told NGI, is the revenue-sharing provision 
in the contracts. It
     stipulates that ""after Enron makes $35 million off of these contracts, 
it has to share the
     proceeds with El Paso for 25% of anything beyond $35 million. So 
effectively, Enron and
     El Paso have become partners in how high they can jack up the 
transportation rate
     differential between the California border and the Southwest producing 
basins."" 

     The two pipeline companies ""that have for decades competed with each 
other in carrying
     Southwest supplies to California are now partners. We think that's 
anticompetitive, and
     there's no way FERC should approve it,"" Morris said. He recalled the 
basis differential
     between the San Juan Basin spot price and the California border shot up 
by 17% during
     1998, the first year during which Dynegy controlled the El Paso capacity 
into California.
     This situation could worsen under Enron, he believes. 

     ""At first blush the El Paso-Enron contracts [do] not appear to contain 
the same
     anticompetitive features of the El Paso-Dynegy contracts,"" Indicated 
Shippers noted, but
     a ""closer review and analysis"" reveals the anticompetitive effects of 
the revenue-sharing
     provision (RSP) in El Paso-Enron contracts ""are not only similar"" to 
those of the hotly
     contested reservation-reduction mechanism (RRM) in the El Paso-Dynegy 
case, ""but are
     increased......due to the fact that the contracts are with a marketing 
affiliate of El Paso's
     primary interstate pipeline competitor,"" Transwestern. 

     Both the RRM and RSP ""operate to provide a disincentive for El Paso and 
its competitors
     to compete against each other, or to take any other action that will act 
to drive down the
     basis differential that defines the market value of the capacity,"" 
Indicated Shippers told
     FERC in a protest filed on Wednesday [RP97-287-041]. The group includes 
producers
     Amoco Production, Burlington Resources Oil and Gas, Marathon Oil, and 
Phillips
     Petroleum, and two marketers - Amoco Energy Trading and Phillips Gas 
Marketing. 

     FERC ""should reject the tariff filing immediately. The Commission erred 
in allowing the
     El Paso-Dynegy contracts to remain intact for their two-year term after 
finding that the
     contracts were anticompetitive. This issue is pending in the [D.C. Court 
of Appeals].
     That same error should not be repeated here,"" the producers and 
marketers said. 

     The CPUC's attempt to block the Enron-El Paso contracts at the outset is 
a little bit
     unusual for the agency, Morris said, but it learned its lesson following 
Dynegy. ""When the
     Dynegy situation first hit, we asked for FERC to investigate the matter. 
We thought
     FERC did a very inadequate job then.....This time around we're asking 
for FERC to
     summarily reject it. It's hard for an agency like ours to take such a 
strong stand right at
     the beginning, but we've learned too much from two years of suffering 
under the Dynegy
     situation. And this is even worse."" 

     In the event the Commission should reject California's request, the CPUC 
has asked that
     an ""anti-hoarding condition"" be included in the contracts, which would 
require Enron to
     release unused capacity into the short-term market at a price higher 
than what it's paying
     El Paso for the capacity. ""They must make a little profit,"" Morris 
noted. ""We're confident
     Enron can't use the entire 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity.....so there's going to 
be unused
     capacity."" 

     The agency also wants FERC to clarify that the primary delivery point 
for the Block II
     portion of the capacity (579MMcf/d) is PG&E-Topock in keeping with the 
terms of the
     1996 settlement between El Paso and its customers. Morris said he agreed 
fully with
     Amoco, Burlington Resources and Southern California Gas (SoCalGas), 
which accused
     El Paso of violating the 1996 agreement by allowing Dynegy to use 
SoCalGas-Topock as
     a primary delivery point for the Block II capacity last summer. They 
contend the alleged
     violation is included in the Enron contracts. 

     He also noted the CPUC will challenge the ability of Enron to call back 
Block II capacity
     after it already had been recalled by El Paso shippers to serve Pacific 
Gas and Electric
     (PG&E) customers in northern California. Last July, FERC granted Dynegy 
the right to
     do this under its contracts with El Paso. But Morris contends the 
decision violates the
     1996 settlement under which PG&E paid $54 million to preserve the right 
of the pipeline's
     shippers to recall the Block II capacity to serve end-users in its 
service territory. 

     The CPUC also intends to challenge the Commission's decision that would 
enable Enron
     to ""just sit on the capacity,"" thereby withholding idle Block II 
capacity from the market.
     Indicated Shippers also contend the Enron contracts violate the Block II 
capacity
     provisions of the 1996 rate case, as well as ""exacerbate"" the primary 
firm delivery point
     capacity-allocation issues that are pending before FERC now. 

     The CPUC accused El Paso of ""deliberately"" filing the Enron contracts at 
FERC just
     before the holidays to avoid controversy. The pipeline ""is trying to 
sneak one of the most
     controversial things ever past FERC right before Christmas so that 
protests would be
     minimized,"" said Morris. ""They did this with the Dynegy contracts two 
years ago. They
     have a pattern of filing right at the last minute, making it harder for 
people to protest and
     harder for FERC to stop it from going into effect.""

Mike -- Thanks for the input...we stewed over this for a while but decided to 
respond (as briefly as possible) rather than give Norm a chance to whine to 
the judge that we were being uncooperative in this somewhat unusual exhibit 
drafting process.  Jeff's answer is consistent with what will appear in the 
exhibit (and from what one can find out about TW in numerous of our FERC 
filings, for that matter).  If Norm tries somehow to make Jeff's response 
part of the record you can bet I will object...if it's not on the record 
already, or on the face of this one late-filed exhibit, it should not be 
allowed into the record.  
Apparently Norm has also called Rich Hall with annoying questions.
I don't plan to respond if he contacts us with any follow-up, but will let 
you know if he does.

 Good response.  Be advised that Norm is a little out of order asking
discovery questions like this after the record is closed.  You are not
obligated to respond to him under these circumstances.  He is still trying
to buttress his apparent belief that the EPNG and TW capacity to the
California border is completely fungible and can be delivered to either
SoCal or PG&E without any limitations.  Please let me know if he tries this
again.  Thanks, Mike

Subject: Late-Filed Exhibit



In response to your inquiry, Transwestern would first like to clear up the
terminology being used here.  As you know, currently SoCalGas doesn't
assign ""primary rights"" to deliveries off of any interconnecting pipeline.
The establishment of tradeable rights for intrastate capacity is among the
issues currently under consideration in the GIR proceeding.   However, if
what you are asking about is what has been the historical or otherwise
available receipt capacity for Transwestern deliveries at North Needles,
then let me offer the following.

Transwestern has always operated on the premise that SoCalGas could
physically accept up to a maximum of 750 MMcf/d at its North Needles
receipt point.  Consequently, Transwestern has sold firm transportation to
its interstate customers for west flow deliveries to North Needles not to
exceed the 750 MMcf/d limitation.  Our west flow mainline capacity is 1.09
Bcf/d.

     Do Transwestern shippers to Transwestern's North Needles delivery
point have 1090 MMcfd of primary rights into ScCalGas, 750 of primary
rights. or some other number?

Mike, obviously this is unacceptable.  Norm's exhibit contains factual 
inaccuracies we cannot live with.  I'm assuming the rest of the group will 
react similarly and Norm will be stuck filing his own exhibit.  Your thoughts?

Brian, just so you know Transwestern's reaction, Pedersen's exhibit contains 
factual inaccuracies we cannot live with (e.g., footnote 4).  If he wants to 
file his own exhibit he is certainly free to do so.  We don't plan to offer 
any comments to Norm regarding his exhibit at this time.  

With regard to the exhibit you sent us yesterday, while Transwestern feels 
there are many different ways to characterize delivery capacity to the 
border, and we probably would have drafted the document differently, we would 
support SoCal's filing of the exhibit with the Commission as it is currently 
drafted for purposes of this proceeding.

Any questions or comments -- let me know.

_______________________________________________________________

     Your proposed draft exhibit goes substantially beyond the ALJ's order.
ALJ Biren specifically stated that the the late-filed exhibit ""should be
narrowly focused on the mismatch of capacity."" Tr. 1021.Thus, you need to
eliminate the column entitled ""Total Take-away Capacity.""  Furthermore, the
column is both suspect (e.g., the representation that EOR is 770 MMcfd) and
misleading (e.g., the inclusion of SWG or PG&E in ""S. Calif Take-away
Capacity"").  Also, you need to eliminate the ""Avg. Daily Market"" box.  The
following is what should be submitted to ALJ Biren:
(See attached file: #1070989 v1 - FIRM PIPELINE CAPACITY DELIVERY (EX. TO
I.99-07-003).doc)
 - #1070989 v1 - FIRM PIPELINE CAPACITY DELIVERY (EX. TO I.99-07-003).doc

Subject: I.99-07-003 - EPNG Revisions To SoCalGas Draft Exh 28 re Pipeline 
Capacity


Attached is an e-mail containing revisions and additions El Paso recommends be
made to SoCalGas' draft Exhibit 28 which was distributed for further comment 
to
parties on June 16, 2000.  This e-mail has two attachments.  The first 
attachment
is a revised copy of SoCalGas' table titled ""Firm Pipeline Capacity into 
Southern
California"" with changes to:  (a) correct the amount of firm interstate 
capacity on
El Paso at Topock, shown in the col. ""Incoming Interstate Capacity,"" by 
replacing
the incorrect figure, 2230 MMcfd (which includes capacity for delivery to SW 
Gas
which is not available to California on a firm basis) with the correct 
figure,  2080
MMcfd; (b) delete the reference to El Paso delivery capacity to SW Gas from 
the
col. ""Total Take-away Capacity"" since this capacity is not firm capacity 
available
to California; (c) adjust the totals at the bottom of both cols. affected by 
these
changes; (d) add a new footnote to reference to the fact that shippers on El 
Paso
have existing firm contract rights for delivery from El Paso at Topock to 
SoCalGas
totaling 1466 MMcfd which exceeds SoCalGas' take-away capacity at Topock
and clearly creates a ""mismatch""; and (c) add reference in footnote (2) to the
physical capacity of Kern/Mojave at the interconnection with SoCalGas at
Wheeler Ridge South, which is in excess of 680 MMcfd even though the metering
is currently set to 500 MMcfd.   The second attachment contains two schematics
intended to supplement SoCalGas' draft map of receipt points and
interconnections.  These schematics more accurately reflect the actual 
physical
interconnections at Topock and Hector Ridge and correct both the inaccurate
impression that the interconnect with  El Paso at Topock consists of several
separate pipelines with no cross over, and that inaccurate impression that 
several
interconnections may exist between pipelines at Hector Road .   El Paso
understands and acknowledges that there are a number of possible responses to
Administrative Law Judge Biren's request for a late filed exhibit concerning
""mismatches"" and pipeline capacity upstream and downstream from SoCalGas
receipt points.  In the spirit of compromise, El Paso  will not oppose 
SoCalGas
filing an exhibit as proposed 6/16/00 provided it is revised to reflect the 
changes
and additions El Paso has proposed in this e-mail.   Very truly yours, Edward 
W.

Glen,

Please see Kevin's note below.  I agree that we should keep separate 
distribution lists for Transwestern.  I have had other requests like 
Kevin's.  As a temporary and imperfect solution, I have marked the labels 
either All Holders or Filings.   Dennis Lee is currently working to put 
Northern and Transwestern mailing lists on the PLE system.  He indicated that 
the process should be ready by the middle of July.  Perhaps we need to 
consider separating the Transwestern list at that time as we do  Northern's.

Subject: Transwestern FERC tariff pages

Hi Naomi, 
my name is Kevin Hyatt.  I am the marketing director in Houston for 
Transwestern Pipeline.  I have a favor to ask of you: could you possibly send 
me only those tariff page copies slated for ""insertion"" into our tariff books 
and not the pages that are ""submitted for filing""?  

My reason is this: by the time the ""submitted for filing"" pages get to me, 
it's too late for me to make any changes to them (not that I would anyway) 
and they just get tossed out when the final pages are approved and printed.

If keeping up with a separate distribution list is not feasible I 
understand.  However, I wonder how many other folks feel the same way as I 
do?  If the number of people is significant, then there is the potential to 
save a lot of time, effort, and money by reducing the copying, printing, and 
distribution costs.

Let me know what you think.
thanks

Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on 
Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff 
language and a proposed form agreement.

Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am 
distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue 
about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want 
to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the 
option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC 
should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future 
capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any 
other issues.  

I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming 
changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have 
resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks.

With regard to capacity release I think we will have to give the replacement 
shipper the cash-for-fuel option, because what if we have sold capacity that 
was created by the releasing shipper's buying fuel from us?  If the 
replacement shipper suddenly starts shipping fuel, that capacity goes away.  
(It's sort of like the EFBH/resulting forward haul problem).  Probably we 
should require that the cash for fuel election automatically transfer to the 
replacement shipper.  This would probably have to go into our tariff 
someplace when we make our FERC filing; otherwise it might run contrary to 
our current tariff provisions and practice.  Another solution might be to 
just sell resulting capacity as LFT, daily FTS-1 or even FTS-3 capacity (with 
some modifications to the FTS-3 Rate Schedule, of course), which would allow 
us the flexibility not to schedule on certain days.  For longer-term deals 
this might not be practicable, though.  

Further questions...let me know.

Subject: TW Cash for Fuel Issues

Christine,

After our meeting last week, John, Elizabeth, Gerry, Richard, Dave & I 
discussed various options related to this cash for fuel process. We had 
several open issues that came up in our discussions and they are as follows:

Regulatory/Legal issue: Can we have contract specific language on our firm 
contracts that would prevent the firm shipper from releasing this fuel 
discount  cash option to an acquiring shipper?     If we must offer this 
special cash option to the acquiring shipper we will need to build a process 
to track this fuel option from the firm shipper to the releasing shipper. 
This will require more system modifications that we have not accounted for at 
this time.

Shipper nomination issue: How will we handle shipper nomination line items 
that are nominated as overrun paths on their firm contracts?  Could we 
default these ""02"" overrun transactions to calculate the fuel in kind using 
our existing tariff fuel %?  This would  make the process of trying to 
reconcile the contracted MDQ fuel volumes easier when we verify that the 
volumes the shipper elected to pay in cash tie back to the total volumes 
scheduled & paid for in cash..

Tariff Sheet issue:  When you state in the tariff provision that ""The shipper 
may use the cash for fuel option only if the posted point of sale is a 
receipt point on shipper's service agreement"" Does this only apply to the 
shipper's primary receipt points?

I would appreciate it if you could respond to these issues. If you feel like 
we should meet to discuss, I will be glad to set up another meeting. Please 
let me know.

Thanks Ramona

Ramona, ""total cost commitment"" in TW's tariff generally means total revenue 
to be received from a transaction, taking 
into account reservation rate, the term of the commitment, and the commodity 
revenues associated with any minimum 
throughput commitment the shipper may make.  Obviously some of these items 
aren't applicable in the PNR context; the 
language must have just been lifted from another part of the tariff.  For PNR 
we would just multiply rate times number 
of days the service will be used.  Practically speaking, I'm not sure how 
this is done if you have an interruptible service with 
no throughput commitment, but I think you should just be able to use the 
number of days in the contract term.  

If there's a tie (i.e. more than one shipper willing to pay at or above max 
rate), we just allocate the capacity pro-rata.  We 
do not have to offer a right to match.

Subject: TW Tariff

Susan,

I am working with TK on automating TW's PNR allocation process & I was 
reviewing the tariff rules for TW PNR allocation of service on sheet 37e. 
Section 8.

Can you interpret the meaning of ""total cost commitment""? We state that 
buyers willing to pay more than the maximum tariff rate will be considered to 
be paying the maximm rate and we will pro-rate amoung buyers willing to pay 
the same total cost commitment. Does this mean we must offer a right to 
match? What does the term ""total cost commitment mean?

Thanks Ramona

Hi Mum!  If you want to come to Houston for the July 8 art crawl, that would 
be fun.  I plan to meet more of the gallery owners and talk to them about 
what they do.  Who knows, having my own gallery might actually become part of 
my long-range plan.  If not, I will have met some interesting people.

If you want to come to Houston sooner, I do not have much going on after my 
Sat. a.m. class at Rice, although I do have to catch a plane to D.C. on 
Monday morning.

The week is going OK.  All the tennis and swimming has left me with sore 
muscles so this is my night off.  Am planning to do some more house chores so 
I do not end up with another weekend like the last.

I'm still planning on coming to Austin next weekend, I'm just not sure when, 
but I'll let you know.

Call if you get lonely! 

Love,
Sooz

Hi, Sooz,

Got home about 1 p.m. today and can already feel my mood sinking--not ready
to get back into my solo mode.

Enjoyed being with the little bugaroo--even with the diarrhea, she was in a
good mood with the exception of an occasional sore bottom.  She smiles all
the time.  It does wear me out considerably when I have her all day long
though, and, especially this time, when I was tired from our trip and Eric's
visit.

I must think about a trip to Houston.  Are you aware of the big Houston art
day in the galleries on July 8th?  Just caught a glimpse of it when thumbing
through the new SW Art Mag.  I'll track it down and give you the particulars.
 (You'll have to review your travel schedule with me again.)

Hope you're having a good week.  love, Mum

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMPANY


Please review the attached non-standard discount letter for Sempra Energy 
Trading Corporation.  Pursuant to Sempra's Gallup Expansion Agreement 
allowing Sempra the right to ""call"" upon SoCalNeedles capacity, subject to 
availability, at a $.30 rate,  Sempra has requested to obtain 23,000 Dth/d of 
East of Thoreau (EOT) to SoCalNeedles capacity for the July - October term.  
Sempra's blended rate of $.2928 represents 21,500 Dth/d of capacity at 
$.30/Dth (their ""call"" capacity) and 1,500 Dth/d of additional Needles 
capacity sold to them at $.19/Dth.

Non-standard provisions contained in Sempra's original Gallup expansion 
Agreement  are included in the discount letter and contained in Paragraphs 3 
and 4:

 Paragragh 3 grants Sempra the ability to have alternate delivery points in 
Transwestern's EOT Area at the discounted rate in situations where SoCalGas' 
""window""  can be shown to reduce Sempra's nominated deliveries to SoCalGas.  
Sempra must provide Transwestern a written confirmation from SoCalGas 
indicating a reduction in scheduled volumes in order to obtain such alternate 
delivery capacity at the discounted rate.  If written confirmation is either 
not provided or Sempra elects to transport on an alternate basis to the EOT 
Area due to favorable market conditions, then the rate for such transport 
shall be the discounted rate plus $.01.

Paragragh 4 grants Sempra the ability during the term of the July - October 
transportation agreement, to move their primary delivery point from 
SoCalNeedles to PG&E/Topock, Mojave /Topock, or to the potential SWG 
interconnect subject to capacity availability and a 5 day notification 
period.  Sempra may also have the ability to return to the SoCalNeedles 
delivery during this term subject to the described conditions as well.

Please indicate you approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.  If any questions arise, 
please contact me at x35702.

You know how much I loathe these meetings with the Hee-Haw gang.  This 
telecon/videocon will likely degrade into a raucous Omaha-led circle jerk 
with everyone else, mostly the Houston group, trying to get a word in

If we do this, and you want to include me, you'll have to put it together

Subject: Capacity Options on TW

Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on 
Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff 
language and a proposed form agreement.

Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am 
distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue 
about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want 
to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the 
option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC 
should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future 
capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any 
other issues.  

I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming 
changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have 
resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks.

I'm saving this message, by the way.  Your characterization of Omaha may be

You know how much I loathe these meetings with the Hee-Haw gang.  This 
telecon/videocon will likely degrade into a raucous Omaha-led circle jerk 
with everyone else, mostly the Houston group, trying to get a word in 
edgewise.  Is there any way to make this more fruitful?

If we do this, and you want to include me, you'll have to put it together 
before close of business Friday as I'm out all next week for surgery.

So far I have not received comments from anyone on the attached.  
If you think it would be productive to get everyone together (possibly as 
early as Friday?) for about an hour to discuss capacity options, I will set 
up a meeting.   Please let me know one way or the other.
Thank you.

Hey!  I think I'm planning to come to Austin sometime on Sat.  Bill won't be 
coming with me because he has 3 trial settings on July 3, what a drag.  I 
will probably go home on Mon. afternoon.  Our friends are having their lake 
house party on the 4th.  Tell Jim to bring his gear and we'll go hit some.   
Can't wait to see Gbug!  You know Mema is going to be really excited to see 
her eat carrots.  (I think she's coming in on Sunday.)

I was regressing yesterday and found this website, which I think you would 
appreciate also:

Hi! Fancy hearing from ME! Just checking in to see what your weekend plans
are like when will you be in Austin? Are you bringing Bill? Do you want to
play tennis w/ Jim, etc!  Jim has an appointment to get his fro -glo going
at 12 on Saturday, so we will be hitting Austin that morning and will
probably stay through Sun. evening or possibly Monday morning. They have
decided to give us Monday off, but we still need to get things done around
the house, so we can't loll around in Austin the WHOLE time! Do you know
when Mema will be there? You know, one of these days you are going to get
stuck driving her to Austin! Let me know what's going on! Gbug wants to show
you how she likes to eat her carrots! Mmmmm! And she wants to try out her
boat in the pool.

Bye!
Karin

Here is a quick summary of our meeting on capacity options on TW.  Bill 
Cordes, Steve Harris, Shelley Corman, John Buchanan, Tony Pryor, and members 
of the TW Commercial Group (including Jeff Fawcett) were present.

 1.  The group all agreed that while it is probably a good idea to mention 
that the options could be sold in an online format, we do not want to limit 
ourselves at this point and should probably just state that a notice will be 
posted on the TW website whenever we have options for sale.

 2.  Price:  the filing needs to include a discussion of how price will be 
determined, and how capacity will be awarded.  We might also need to include 
an estimate of how much revenue options will generate in the first year.

 3.  Need to add a short explanation of where TW will get the capacity if a 
shipper exercises its call option.

 4.  Should frame the service as requiring an exception to current Commission 
policy on reserving capacity...not asking Commission to abandon its policy 
altogether.

 5.  May need to address:  assignability of options; limitation on damages 
for nonperformance.

 6.  Timeline:
  - Turn around a new draft and get further comments (July 3 week)
  - Get Market Services started on its analysis of the new service 
  - Begin contacting customers to get their buy-in (Lorraine already has a 
producer/customer very interested in supporting our filing)
  - Start the process of getting Board approval (sales of options require 
Board approval at Enron)
  - Meet informally with FERC to discuss (Shelley is working on)
  - Make the filing at FERC (we did not try to specify a date yet)

If you have any further comments please let me know.  I am going to try to 
get a new draft out by next Friday a.m."

Hi Mum!  Ann and I saw ""Mr. Ripley"" and I lay awake last night wondering how 
else the main character could have dealt with his dilemma on the boat!  I 
think I need to go to the movies more often; perhaps it will help me avoid 
this blurring of film and reality.  My tendency is to really get involved 
when I see them on the big screen!

Might be going to San Francisco next week.  I'd really like to go.  We'll see.

Probably I will come to Austin on Saturday but I've not heard from the 
landscaper yet.  I doubt they will be working on the weekend though.

Hope you're having pretty weather as we have in Houston today.

Love,
Sooz"

Just back in from my front yard -- a military jet of some sort is circling my 
neighborhood and making a tremendous racket!  Several of my neighbors were 
also out, so I was not the only one staring at the sky.  I don't know whether 
we'll see fireworks later or if we've already missed them.  Jose and Gigi's 
party was attended by more kids than ever.  There were a lot of West U 
parents I did not recognize, but there were some lawyers from the Latin 
American section that I know, so we had at least a few people to talk to.  We 
did not stay long, just had some of the good Goode & Company BBQ, helped Gigi 
with the pinatas, and got home around 7.  The traffic on I-45 was really 
starting to pile up so I am glad we left when we did.

Enjoyed the weekend and I'm looking forward to your visit.

Love,
Sooz"

Subject: Southwest Gas Discount Amendment Changes

Recent negotiations with Southwest Gas Corporation have resulting in the 
deletion of two provisions  contained in the original Southwest Gas 
Corporation discount letter with was routed for Officer Approval.  Several  
minor ""sentence structure"" changes requested by Southwest Gas have also been 
included.  

Please review the revised Discount Letter and forward any comments 
immediately to either Lorraine Lindberg (x35403) or Susan Scott (x30596).  
The following summarizes the changes to the original discount letter:

1.  Deletion of paragraph which waives ROFR rights.    This paragraph is not 
necessary due to FERC Order 637 rule which states that the shipper's tariff 
right to ROFR for contracts of one year or longer does not apply to 
discounted transportation contracts, only max rate contracts.

2.  Deletion of Paragraph which states Transwestern will retain any capacity 
release revenues which Shipper may acquire from releasing capacity at rates 
above the Discount Rate provided by Transwestern to Shipper.


Please note that the revised discount letter does retain the original intent 
of providing Southwest Gas a 10 year discount rate for seasonal (November 
through March period) capacity from Transwestern's East of Thoreau (EOT) Area 
to the Southwest Gas Interconnect located in the East of California Area.  
The $.10/Dth/d transportation rate shall increase annually by $.005/Dth/d for 
the term of the agreement.  Alternate receipt points rights are in the EOT 
Area as with as within the primary path of the contract.  Southwest Gas may 
also utilize the Bloomfield Compressor on an alternate basis.

Lorraine, I have no problem with Larry's proposed change or his reasons for 
the change.  However, I would ask that we eliminate the word ""volumetric"" as 
that has other connotations in the FERC tariff world.  I.e., if we were truly 
to have ""volumetric"" rates (like Northern) we'd have to file a whole new rate 
schedule!  I just don't want to use this word.  I don't think it's necessary 
in order to convey Larry's meaning.  Why don't we insert:  ""on a daily basis  
only   to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized"".  
If Larry wants to talk about it I'm happy to.  If he comes up with any more 
issues I am sending him to law school as punishment.

Lorraine, 
I have your revised letter.? There is only one thing that seems subject to 
possible questions about the intent.? Paragraph 3, last sentence.? I suggest 
it be revised as follows: 

"".....and Transwestern's maximum rates shall apply on a daily, volumetric 
basis to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized."" 

This would reflect how I read the Tariff provisions to apply.? As written 
now, someone could infer that ALL volumes go to max rates whenever ANY 
volumes are moved from/to an unspecified alternate point.? I am visualizing a 
nomination day with part of the volumes from Primary or one of these 
specified points and part of the volumes from some other unspecified 
alternate point. 

Then, just a general question.? Are any of these named alternates also 
delivery points, as well as receipt points?? Are there any delivery points in 
these areas that should be recognized? 

I will talk to you first thing in the morning. 
Thanks. 
Larry

Steve, apparently I'm developing an overactive imagination when it comes to 
FERC decisions.

In Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, 74 FERC ? 61,102, reh'g denied, 75 
FERC ? 61,272 (1996), and Transwestern, 90 FERC P 61,044, in which FERC 
approved LFT services, the Commission accepted the pipelines' statements that 
they would not sell capacity that is not available (i.e., will not 
double-sell), rather than limit the service in some way or reject the filings.

In Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., 79 FERC ? 61,394 (1997), the 
Commission approved of the pipeline's selling of capacity that becomes 
operationally available for various reasons from time to time.

But I have not been able to locate the general statement along the lines of 
""pipelines can use their own discretion to determine whether capacity is 
available"" that I thought existed."

At PNM's request we are not going to say anything about long-term having a 
higher priority than short-term, because their tariff simply does not reflect 
this.  Unfortunately it would have made our argument stronger if we could 
have said it, but ...

Anyway, I like what Steve has done here.  If there is no objection I'm going 
to have him make the change described above and file it tomorrow.

Subject: Re: Reply Comments RP00-249  

Susan,  This looks fine to me but I want to confirm one statement.  In 
section 3 on page 3 we state that TW intends to contract for long-term 
capacity vs. short-term capacity and therefore we will have a higher priority 
and will not be the ""lowest priority on PNM"".  Please confirm that a contract 
for April to October is long term on PNM.  I initially understood we would 
contract for one month with an evergreen provision or rolling month to month 
type of contract therefore I just wanted to make sure this statement fits 
with our Marketing Depts intent.  Thanks.

Glen

expired 12/31/99 but can be continued by mutual agreement of the parties.  
Given the upcoming proceedings, I'd recommend that we act on this sooner

Paul, governing law in paragraph 9 needs to be Texas.  If this is a problem, 
give me a call because we'll need to discuss it with Drew.

Hi Mum.  Sept. 29 sounds great; I have always wanted to see Chorus Line.  So 
go ahead and order tickets if you like.  

I think I might be skiing in the Park City area in December.  Allie's wedding 
is Dec. 16.  at Sundance.  If you and Eric planned your trip then, you and I 
could hit the bunny slopes together.  I want to take lessons, and stick to 
the easy runs.  No way am I getting more injuries; I am creaky enough as it 
is.

Bill is still hoping to go to Sweden in September to buy his Volvo wagon.  I 
have really lost my enthusiasm for the trip and would rather go to Mexico, 
and have told him so.  So I'm not sure what will happen.  Are you interested 
in going to San Miguel for the running of the bulls?

Hope the Hip Abductors are not demanding too much as ransom.

Love,
Sooz

Hi, Sooz!  What are you doing Sat, Sept 29?  Was just checking over the
Broadway series at the Paramount, and ""Chorus Line"" is coming for a 2-wk
period.  I would love to see it.  I could probably find someone to go with on
a weeknight, but would prefer going with you if you're available.  Let me
know.  I'll be leaving for Calif a few days later, Oct 3.

Eric had a fatty tumor removed from just under his shoulder Mon.  Called him
when I returned from Houston to check on him and he surprised and shocked me
by saying he was not skiing with his L.A. group this year, and wants me to go
on some ski trips with him.  It's one of those things you wish for, and then
you get it?  Oh no.  I don't even know if I'll really progress past the
beginner slope, but am sure I'll be very good at apres.  I think he's
considering Park City for the first one.  He says the transportation there is
good, and it's a good place for me to learn.

Darrell went with me to The Hills Tues. and I discovered the Hip Abductors!
Wow.  Didn't feel the workout until after my walk last night.  Sure hope all
this is doing some good.  Checked their long list of reciprocal clubs, and
The Met isn't one of them, but that doesn't matter.  You can still go as a
guest.  (Neither is the Los Gatos Ath. Club.)  Must check out exercises for
skiing.

Went to the lab early this a.m. for pre-physical tests.  Had a late lunch
yesterday and no dinner, so I was starved when I woke up.  They opened at
7:00 and there wasn't much of a wait.

Fabion had disappeared for a few weeks, and Mike had lined up another guy to
mow for us, but Fabion showed up--he had been in Mexico.  Sure glad to see
him.  He's from some town near San Miguel.

K, J & G are coming for an overnight Sat.  Karin has a haircut appt.  Glad
for the company.

Mother's a/c went out in her car as she was leaving Austin on the 5th.  All
that way to Houston in the heat.  At least she left early.  She just spent
$800 for a new compressor for that old heap.  Couldn't believe it.  She had
just spent $200 for freon on her previous trip--it all leaked out.  Even with
her other gas guzzler, $1000 would have gone a long way paying for gas.

Hope you're having a good week.  Did Bill make it home?  love, mum

Subject: TW compliance filing

I know you do not want to think about this today, but I'm just thinking ahead 
to next week.  Let's come up with an action plan for drafting TW's Order 637 
compliance filing.  You two should be experts by now!  Give me a call Monday 
or Tuesday, and let's discuss getting started, and I will get to work on a 
draft.  I still have the marked up tariff sheets from when we talked about 
this in March or April.

Drew -- I've looked at this and it is fine; really does not deviate from what 
we have posted before.

One issue that arose Friday was whether our all-or-nothing approach (i.e., 
shipper must take all 49,000 dth of capacity or none at all -- or all 20,000 
or none at all) constitutes tying.  The 49,000 package includes 35,000 to 
North Needles and 14,000 to Topock.  So if a shipper wants the Needles space 
it has to take the Topock space too.  This looked like a clear case of tying 
to me until I remembered that this capacity is now, and has been, posted and 
available and any shipper can bid on any part of the Needles space right now 
if they wanted to and we'd sell it to them without making them take the 
Topock space.  That'll be true during the IOS too -- i.e., nothing can stop 
shippers from bidding on the Needles space outside of the IOS process.  This 
is just a situation in which we're putting a special package together with 
the expectation that the price will reflect the fact that the less desirable 
Topock space is part of that package.  

Does this make sense to you?  If not, give me a call.

I spoke with Steve Stojic about this and he had the same concern.  Even 
though I was trying to keep this out of the new rate schedule requirements by 
not making it a rate schedule, I believe I still managed to cover many 
checklist items.  One that is not covered is testimony similar to what might 
be filed in a rate case, in order to justify market based rates.  We are 
planning to include a revenue estimate.  I'll go over these and make sure 
everything is addressed before filing.

Are you OK with this filing from a general conceptual standpoint?  The 
marketers want to start giving a draft to customers for them to review 
beginning TODAY.

Subject: Re: TW Capacity Options  

Susan, 

 In reviewing the proposed filing I had some questions.  On page 2 in the 
discussion of ensuring sufficient capacity we offer to establish position 
guidelines, do we need to outline these and either include them as an exhibit 
or have them ready for reply to either protesters or a staff data request?  
Secondly, if we regard this as a new service does our filing comply with all 
aspects of 154.202 (a) (ii), (iii), (iv) (A) & (B), (v), (vi), (viii) and 
(ix)?  In recent filings the staff has challenged our filings in terms of 
addressing each of these requirements.  I believe many our covered but 
thought you might like to double check for compliance.  What about a revenue 
estimate? Seems like we need one, even if its still very speculative.

Glen

According to my research, this project (which involves construction by TW of 
a lateral consisting of about 40 miles of at least 16"" pipe to provide 
service to a power plant) would require a 7(c) certificate.  Do you concur?  
Any comments?

Subject: Caithness Big Sandy LLC

TW and Caithness met in Denver this week for the first face-to-face meeting 
between the parties.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of 
the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving 
the project forward.

Caithness Corporation
Caithness Corp. is a privately held company based in New York with a variety 
of business interests.  The company is essentially a financial vehicle for 
private investors.  Their energy segment currently owns 1,200 MW of 
generation through renewable assets in California (geothermal at Coso, wind 
in Tehachapi and Palm Springs) and a gas fired plant in South Carolina 
jointly-owned by Florida Power & Light.

Big Sandy Project
The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup, 
Arizona.  The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 550 
MW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another 
170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d.

The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of 
Transwestern's pipeline.  The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near 
valve station #1008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station 
#1.  The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state 
highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of 
Section 5, T15N, R12W, Mohave County, Arizona.  There is a 500 KV 
transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property.  This line is one 
of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends 
from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City, NV.  I've 
included a WAPA map below which indicates this line.  Also, on the site is a 
water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine.  Water for the plant 
will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.  They have 
currently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 500 cfm.  The power 
plant will require approximately 3,500 cfm of water.  In addition to the 
wells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface 
water from the Big Sandy River.  The project may also purchase water from the 
Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline.

The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and 
associated wash.  The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.  The area 
includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited 
agricultural and ranching interests.  Wickieup is a very small town with an 
estimated population of 200.

Project Schedule
Gas Turbine(s) ordered Westinghouse-Seimens  May 2000
Submit Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)  August 2000
Arrange financing     December 2000
EIS approval      March 2001
Construction begins     April 2001
Testing begins      July 2002
Commercial Operation     November 2002

There are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's EIS- the Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM Kingman office) and the Western Area Power 
Administration (WAPA).  There is only one endangered/threatened species known 
to be present in the area.

Lateral Pipeline Alignment
The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.  The 
alignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the EIS to be filed 
next month.  Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department 
of Transportation (ADOT) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement 
for the pipeline.  The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right 
of way available.  Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only 
a 70 ft. right of way available for construction.  Typically, pipelines 
require a 100 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent 
right of way.  Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this 
alignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed.

If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second 
alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section 
line.  The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the 
routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly 
necessitating deep burial and anchoring.  The other route would involve 
following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor.  The only issue 
there, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is 
whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high 
pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system.

Other Preliminary Project Issues
There are other fundamental issues to address.  The original concept was to 
interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern 
mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both 
of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.  Transwestern's original 
estimate to construct a 16"" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was 
based on the following specifications:

120 MMcf/d
450 psig delivery pressure,
900 psig inlet pressure

The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a 
higher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse 
turbines).  In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at 
a pressure 100-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.  In order to accommodate 
EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the 
design will likely change to a 20"" pipeline.

Next Steps (responsible party/department)
 Task      Date Due Party/Dept. 
Pipeline Alignment
1. Estimate to plot lateral pipeline route.     8/4  Matthews/Chanley
2. Engineering services agreement    8/4  Scott/Fawcett
3. Final alignment sheets.    8/25  Matthews/Chanley

Misc. Items
1.   Confidentiality Agreement   7/24  Scott/Fawcett
2. Data items to Caithness
 -  Form 567     7/26  Matthews
 -  Gallup FERC filing (flow diagram)  7/26  Scott
 -  Sta. 1 and Needles flow/pressure data  7/28  Matthews
 -  Outage reports/maintenance schedules 7/28  Matthews

Engineering/Design
1.   Original estimate (16"" line) to Caithness  7/24  Matthews
2.  Revised specifications to Transwestern  7/28  Caithness (T.P.)
3.   Revised estimate (20"" line) to Caithness    8/4  Matthews/Chanley 

Other Issues
Several key issues need to be addressed concurrently with the pipeline 
alignment and engineering activities:

 Task      Date Due Party/Dept. 
Deal Structuring
1. Financing/cost amortization     9/8  Fawcett/Hayslett
/Centilli/Goodrow
2. Research interconnect policy (EPNG)    8/4  Scott/Regulatory
3. Research 7(c) application requirements  8/11  Scott/Regulatory
4. Rates      9/22  Scott/Regulatory
/Centilli
5. Research open season requirements  8/18  Scott/Regulatory

The above list is certainly not meant to be all-inclusive and a kick-off 
meeting to discuss the project schedule will be put together shortly.  In the 
meantime, if you have any questions regarding this project, please let me 
know.  Also, please feel free to forward this memo to anyone I've 
inadvertently left off the distribution.  Thanks.

After our IOS adventure last week, I put together the following questions=
=20
that need to be resolved.  Some of them have needed to be resolved for quit=

some time.  Tony, let's talk since I think some of these have already been=

discussed and maybe resolved in the context of developing TW's EnronOnline=

site, and I just need to get up to speed.  To the extent there aren't answe=
rs=20
yet, I'll get busy researching.  Drew -- comments?  Shall we all get on the=
=20
phone & discuss this?

List of TW contracting issues

1.  Reevaluate the following in the context of current FERC negotiated rate=

policy:

 a.  Transwestern's current form discount letter states:  ""[t]he total char=
ge=20
shall include all applicable surcharges.""   Should this language be revised=

and if so, how?

 b.  Transwestern usually charges one-part rates, and includes language in=
=20
its discount letter stating that Transwestern shall allocate the combined=
=20
rate between the reservation and commodity components inclusive of=20
surcharges.  Are one-part rates really negotiated rates?  material deviatio=
ns=20
from the tariff?=20

 c.  Transwestern's discount letter includes a statement that in no event=
=20
shall the contract rate be greater than the maximum or lower than the minim=
um=20
rates provided in Transwestern=01,s tariff.  This was intended as assurance=
 that=20
the contract is not a negotiated rate.  Is this language still effective? =
=20
necessary?

2.  IOS/EnronOnline:

 a.  When should IOS be conducted, if at all?

 b.  Once notice of IOS or EnronOnline bidding has been posted, can the=20
subject capacity still be sold off-line (i.e., pursuant to traditional=20
bidding procedures)?

 c.  Is our system for IOS and EnronOnline set up to handle max rate biddin=
g=20
situations in a nondiscriminatory manner and in compliance with the bid=20
evaluation procedures in the tariff?  If not, what changes need to be made?"

Tony, the idea we had discussed at our meeting with Drew was somehow 
acquiring capacity on El Paso in order to access the South Needles 
interconnect with SoCal.  Currently SoCal lets El Paso deliver to S. Needles 
but does not extend the same privilege to TW.    

I'm unsure how it would work.  TW does have a couple of interconnects with El 
Paso's system.  I would simply say in the memo that one solution to the 
constraint at Topock might be to get some shippers to switch to South 
Needles, and deliver gas to South Needles after twisting SoCal's arm and 
letting us in, or somehow acquiring capacity on El Paso (or otherwise using 
their system) to access South Needles.  Obviously we will need to flesh this 
out from an economic, regulatory and legal standpoint.  I will discuss it 
with Jeff when he returns.  My apologies for the delay.  Call if you have any 
questions or comments to discuss!

No probola!  It will be good to have an excuse to go to NM.  Maybe I will go 
this weekend.

So glad you had rain over the weekend!  We did too, and we had had a dry 
spell for almost as long.  I hope it was not too late to save my back yard, 
which was starting to smell like cooked grass.

Bill and I are on the outs.  He just will not do what he needs to in order to 
make things work, so I have given up.  Of course now he is trying to be 
charming.  Anyway, I will have to tell you the whole story some other time.

The kiddies are going back to school already so now would be a good time to 
plan a trip to D.C. at last.  Maybe early Sept?
Also I'd be game for a girls' trip to Destin.

Time to work!
Love,
Sooz

Hi, Sooz,

Don't make a special trip, but the next time you're at the Galleria, would
you go by the Neiman's Clientele make-up counter (by the candy) and get
something for me?  Clientele Wrinkle Treatment.  It'll be pricy, but just let
me know and I'll get a check to you.
love, mum

Ken, here are the confidentiality agreements that should be signed prior to 
our providing information to our vendors.  Each agreement should be printed 
as duplicate originals on TW letterhead, and signed by an officer of TW.  I 
understand that Mike Nelson is out due to a death in the family; Steve Harris 
is out this week also.  Perhaps Julia White would be willing to sign in order 
to expedite things.

If you have any questions or need further assistance with any aspect of these 
agreements please do not hesitate to call (x30596) or come by.

Well, Larry just won't let go of these contract issues, will he??
I believe the answer is that SWGas will always be billed based on the 
one-part rate, regardless of how we choose to allocate the rate components.  
My understanding is that the reason we reserve the right to allocate the 
components is simply for internal accounting purposes, to keep any one 
component from exceeding the max or going below the min.
Hope this helps; let me know if you have further questions!

Lorraine,
Confirmation that I did receive your executed TSA and Letter Agreement.
I'm so glad you are excited.  We have so little in our lives to give us
true excitement.  At my age, I try to reserve all events of elevated
blood pressure for only the esoteric things.  (Just kidding.)  I'm very
pleased we finally got this done.  Now for the pipe wrench and welder
folks to get the physical jobs done, as well.

Unfortunately, the work is never over.  I will now try to concentrate on
the OBA, which has been sitting by the sideline for a long time.  Will
get back to you on that as soon as I can.

As for the TSA rate, I have a few questions.  We have agreed that TWPL
would allocate the rate between fixed and variable components.  I have
never been clear on just when and how that will be done.  I have assumed
you would make that call, let us know, and it would be over.  Is there
any idea that issue would be a changing thing, or is it ""once done,
always done""?  Further, what factors do you use to make that
determination and what, if any, rules and regulations apply?  From
different views, I'd like to have it all variable and you would like to
have it all fixed.  What is the process here?

I will get back to you soon on the OBA stuff.  Meanwhile, chill that
champagne!
Larry

The prior notice blanket was a possibility, but with the change in diameters 
it most likely won't work.  I agree with you a 7 (c) filing would be 
required.  I noticed they are discussing environmental information below, but 
what is the status of preparing the reports?  If we are to make the filing, 
we need a meeting to make sure that everyone is gathering the proper 
information.  In some of our other filings we conducted town hall meetings 
prior to survey work to gain support of the people.  This should be being.  

A question I have is ""will the mainline need to be expanded?""  How do they 
plan to serve the load from a fully subscribed pipe? (I believe it is fully 
subscribed)

Thanks

According to my research, this project (which involves construction by TW of 
a lateral consisting of about 40 miles of at least 16"" pipe to provide 
service to a power plant) would require a 7(c) certificate.  Do you concur?

Subject: Caithness Big Sandy LLC

TW and Caithness met in Denver this week for the first face-to-face meeting 
between the parties.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of 
the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving 
the project forward.

Caithness Corporation
Caithness Corp. is a privately held company based in New York with a variety 
of business interests.  The company is essentially a financial vehicle for 
private investors.  Their energy segment currently owns 1,200 MW of 
generation through renewable assets in California (geothermal at Coso, wind 
in Tehachapi and Palm Springs) and a gas fired plant in South Carolina 
jointly-owned by Florida Power & Light.

Big Sandy Project
The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup, 
Arizona.  The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 550 
MW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another 
170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d.

The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of 
Transwestern's pipeline.  The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near 
valve station #1008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station 
#1.  The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state 
highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of 
Section 5, T15N, R12W, Mohave County, Arizona.  There is a 500 KV 
transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property.  This line is one 
of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends 
from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City, NV.  I've 
included a WAPA map below which indicates this line.  Also, on the site is a 
water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine.  Water for the plant 
will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.  They have 
currently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 500 cfm.  The power 
plant will require approximately 3,500 cfm of water.  In addition to the 
wells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface 
water from the Big Sandy River.  The project may also purchase water from the 
Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline.

The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and 
associated wash.  The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.  The area 
includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited 
agricultural and ranching interests.  Wickieup is a very small town with an 
estimated population of 200.

Project Schedule
Gas Turbine(s) ordered Westinghouse-Seimens  May 2000
Submit Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)  August 2000
Arrange financing     December 2000
EIS approval      March 2001
Construction begins     April 2001
Testing begins      July 2002
Commercial Operation     November 2002

There are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's EIS- the Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM Kingman office) and the Western Area Power 
Administration (WAPA).  There is only one endangered/threatened species known 
to be present in the area.

Lateral Pipeline Alignment
The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.  The 
alignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the EIS to be filed 
next month.  Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department 
of Transportation (ADOT) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement 
for the pipeline.  The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right 
of way available.  Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only 
a 70 ft. right of way available for construction.  Typically, pipelines 
require a 100 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent 
right of way.  Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this 
alignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed.

If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second 
alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section 
line.  The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the 
routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly 
necessitating deep burial and anchoring.  The other route would involve 
following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor.  The only issue 
there, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is 
whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high 
pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system.

Other Preliminary Project Issues
There are other fundamental issues to address.  The original concept was to 
interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern 
mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both 
of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.  Transwestern's original 
estimate to construct a 16"" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was 
based on the following specifications:

120 MMcf/d
450 psig delivery pressure,
900 psig inlet pressure

The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a 
higher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse 
turbines).  In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at 
a pressure 100-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.  In order to accommodate 
EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the 
design will likely change to a 20"" pipeline.

Next Steps (responsible party/department)
 Task      Date Due Party/Dept. 
Pipeline Alignment
1. Estimate to plot lateral pipeline route.     8/4  Matthews/Chanley
2. Engineering services agreement    8/4  Scott/Fawcett
3. Final alignment sheets.    8/25  Matthews/Chanley

Misc. Items
1.   Confidentiality Agreement   7/24  Scott/Fawcett
2. Data items to Caithness
 -  Form 567     7/26  Matthews
 -  Gallup FERC filing (flow diagram)  7/26  Scott
 -  Sta. 1 and Needles flow/pressure data  7/28  Matthews
 -  Outage reports/maintenance schedules 7/28  Matthews

Engineering/Design
1.   Original estimate (16"" line) to Caithness  7/24  Matthews
2.  Revised specifications to Transwestern  7/28  Caithness (T.P.)
3.   Revised estimate (20"" line) to Caithness    8/4  Matthews/Chanley 

Other Issues
Several key issues need to be addressed concurrently with the pipeline 
alignment and engineering activities:

 Task      Date Due Party/Dept. 
Deal Structuring
1. Financing/cost amortization     9/8  Fawcett/Hayslett
/Centilli/Goodrow
2. Research interconnect policy (EPNG)    8/4  Scott/Regulatory
3. Research 7(c) application requirements  8/11  Scott/Regulatory
4. Rates      9/22  Scott/Regulatory
/Centilli
5. Research open season requirements  8/18  Scott/Regulatory

The above list is certainly not meant to be all-inclusive and a kick-off 
meeting to discuss the project schedule will be put together shortly.  In the 
meantime, if you have any questions regarding this project, please let me 
know.  Also, please feel free to forward this memo to anyone I've 
inadvertently left off the distribution.  Thanks.

This should be so much easier; Foti is not cooperating so I am having to 
spend time hunting down his Co. # and RC #, which hopefully Estalee will be 
able to provide.  I reiterate my position that lawyers are not the ones who 
should have to do this.  Rest assured I'll follow through on this one and Lia 
Hernandez, but I also feel we need to approach Dave Schafer and ask why this 
is something HR is not capable of taking care of.

Needs to be an officer or someone with power of attorney.  Ordinarily, you do 
not have power of attorney unless there is board of director approval 
authorizing you to sign contracts on behalf of the company.  
The point is to make sure someone signs it who is authorized to bind the 
company to the obligations of the agreement; otherwise they could argue later 
that the agreement is not valid.

Susan,
Does it have to be an officer of the company (West Penetone, NiGen 
International) that signs the agreement?
Or is it ok for the sales rep to sign it?

Thanks,
Ken

Hi Mum!  Sorry I have not called you back.  I have been out late every nite 
and trying just to keep myself in constant motion.  Am on the trading floor 
this week and can't really talk b/c too many ears.  But I'll give you a call 
this afternoon.
Our little bar examinee is alive and well.  They've changed the schedule so 
the exam was over yesterday instead of Fri.  She joined me and my work crowd 
last night at La Griglia and we ordered champagne.  So I've already 
celebrated appropriately!
What do you think of my Destin idea?
talk to you soon
Love,

Here is the latest draft of the filing for transport options.  Significant 
changes include:

- added definition of Counterparty
- added captions and reorganized the filing to more clearly reflect 
compliance with 154.202
- included an explanation of how the option fee will be part of a negotiated 
rate
- added an example of how options will work

I think we need to decide whether we are better off with the type of option 
fee explanation I have in this draft, or whether we should instead state the 
fee will be market based, and include an explanation that, pursuant to the 
Commission's discussion in Order 637, market based rates are appropriate 
because we are going to commit to an open season process that will be 
nondiscriminatory and that will ensure we aren't withholding capacity from 
the market.  

Can we have a conference call to discuss your comments this week?  I will 
have Janet call to determine your availability.

Christine, see the attached.  I've changed paragraph 8 to be like our last 
posting, and added in a sentence saying ties will be decided by lottery (but 
omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time).

My only other comment is that I think the group needs to discuss beforehand 
how a shipper's request for alternate points is going to be treated.  As 
currently drafted, this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on 
use of alternate points at the bid rate, which calls into question our 
granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount.  If we do 
intend to let the winning bidder shippers use alt. points at a discounted 
rate, we should take this statement out (end of paragraph 5).  

If we're still living in a max. rate world, though, this really is not much 
of a concern since use of the alternate points would also be at max. rate.

Any questions -- give me a call.

S.

Lorraine, here are a few notes from my review of the Val Verde contract, and 
my initial impressions.  Let's talk more about how to approach the issue 
after we meet with Ron tomorrow about MAOP.

12/31/92 Interconnect Agreement:

Sec. 1.3 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to 
provide firm compression service TW will accept up to 200,000 on an 
interruptible basis.

Sec. 2 states that the Blanco Hub MAOP shall not be exceeded.

Sec. 4.2 limits damages (no consequential damages).

The contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause.

2/18/93 letter amendment:

Sec. 3 obligates TW to provide firm compression service in order to accept 
200,000 into TW's system (provided MOGI has pressure of at least 650 and 
quantity of at least 140).  Acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide 
firm compression in accordance with Sec. 1.3 of 12/92 agreement.

9/25/95 letter amendment:

Increases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 250,000 once the San 
Juan expansion is effective.

My initial conclusions:  It is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept 
250,000 on a firm basis, provided that Burlington complies with the pressure 
requirements.  Probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if 
accepting 250,000 would cause us to exceed the hub MAOP.  In that case we can 
argue impossibility of performance.  Also, we could avoid the obligation 
because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force 
majeure.  This argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to 
have gotten hotter over the years.  

The fact that we entered into our most recent agreement with Burlington in 
January of this year weakens the credibility of our arguments (they will say 
we should have known by now).  Burlington might try to argue that we have an 
absolute obligation to comply with the agreement, even if it means expensive 
system modifications.  That argument is not a very strong one because the 
agreement contains no such affirmative obligation and in fact quite clearly 
describes the facilities that are the subject of the agreement."

 In Mark Baldwin's June 19 letter, he proposed the following fee schedule for 
project development:

Retainer:  $1000/month plus expenses
Accepted project (meets TW's predetermined financial hurdles):  Proposal $5000
Each month TW actively negotiating project:  $1500/month (each project)
Letter of Intent:  $5000
Signed Agreement:  $10,000
 Incentive Fee:  To be determined

 When I spoke with Mark, he explained that this schedule was based on 
reaching certain milestones in the development of individual projects.  In 
his letter he also proposed monthly fees for regulatory services ($5000/mo.) 
and market development services (including SoCal OIR related services -- 
$3000/mo.).  This e-mail addresses the project development fee structure 
only. 

 The recently expired Market Development agreement with IGS provided for a 
one-time retainer of $15,000 and a monthly retainer of $5000, plus expenses, 
and an incentive fee structure for any agreement between Transwestern and 
third party ""identified by IGS under this agreement.""  As you know, the 
""identified by"" language presented us with some ambiguity in the case of the 
Southern Energy Gallup Expansion contract, in which both IGS and the TW 
Commercial Group worked on the deal.  Fortunately, the ambiguity worked to 
Transwestern's advantage in that case, but my understanding is that in 
ongoing dealings with IGS both parties would prefer more specificity in any 
future consulting agreement.

 Mark's proposal represents a step in the right direction because it provides 
for payment on a per-project basis.  This immediately eliminates the 
""identified by"" problem because we won't be obligated to pay him unless and 
until he identifies a project we're interested in him working on.

 I propose that we define some general terms and conditions in an enabling 
agreement.  If Mark brings us a project we want to pursue, we will pay him 
according to these terms (and any other terms and conditions tailored to the 
specific project, as needed).  For each project, we would simply enter into a 
short letter agreement referencing the enabling agreement.  I've outlined the 
agreement below as a starting point for discussion.  The numbers are Mark's; 
we'll have to discuss whether they are appropriate.  I've omitted any payment 
for a letter of intent because since they are nonbinding, letters of intent 
are of little value to Transwestern.

  Call me after you've reviewed this and let's discuss how you want to 
proceed.



From time to time during the term of the enabling agreement, IGS may present 
brief, preliminary project proposals to Transwestern.  If Transwestern 
desires IGS's assistance in developing a particular project, it will so 
notify IGS in writing and shall execute an agreement with IGS adopting the 
following terms and conditions:

1.  Retainer for project development:  $1000/month plus expenses.  Project 
development shall include but not be limited to:  research, due diligence, 
market analysis, negotiation with counterparties (to the extent specifically 
authorized by Transwestern), reporting to marketing representatives of 
Transwestern as requested by Transwestern, and preparing a detailed written 
proposal.  Transwestern and IGS may agree in writing to other 
project-specific requirements.  Transwestern shall continue to pay the 
retainer each month until a definitive agreement is signed with the 
counterparty or Transwestern notifies IGS in writing that it has decided to 
terminate the project.  

2.  If Transwestern accepts the project described in IGS's written proposal 
(or with modifications after reviewing the written proposal), it shall pay 
IGS a fee of [the lesser of] $5000 [or ___% of the net present value of the 
project].  ""Accepting the project"" means that the project meets 
Transwestern's financial, regulatory and other criteria and the Transwestern 
Commercial Group has obtained the necessary officer approval to pursue the 
project to completion.  Accepting the project and paying IGS pursuant to this 
paragraph in no way obligates Transwestern to pursue the project to 
completion.

3.  If Transwestern signs a definitive agreement with a counterparty for the 
project, it shall pay IGS $10,000.  Additionally, the parties may negotiate 
an additional incentive fee (to be agreed upon and documented at the outset 
of the project).

(I will also include provisions on termination, confidentiality, etc.).

Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.

There are a couple of important changes from the last draft.

One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be 
""market-based.""  At FERC, the term ""market-based"" has connotations of having 
to prove to FERC that a non-cost-based rate is appropriate because we lack 
market power.  While we probably do lack market power, the consensus of the 
legal/regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a built-in 
feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a 
separate option fee.  If this theory is not clear to you after you read the 
filing letter, let's discuss how it should be improved.

The other significant change (also based on my meeting with legal/regulatory) 
is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every 
shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have 
to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.  In other 
words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply 
execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  This structure has two 
advantages:  1) it's consistent with our option-fee-as-part-of-transport-rate 
theory, and 2) it will help support that theory in our next rate case.

I'd like to meet next week, either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, to 
discuss the following topics:

1)  Your comments and questions on this draft,
2)  Some examples of options, to make sure the tariff provisions and contract 
work from a logistical standpoint,
3)  The bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and
4)  Comments received from shippers thus far.

I'll be working on 41 tomorrow; let's talk about what would be a good meeting 
time.

Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.  After 
our discussion last week I made a couple of significant changes from the last 
draft.

One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be 
""market-based.""   Instead I have tried to portray the option fee as a 
built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated 
into a separate option fee.  

The other significant change is that I've structured the tariff language and 
the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use 
transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they 
buy an option.  In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a 
service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  If 
you don't think I've explained this clearly enough, let me know.

I'm meeting informally with the Commercial Group next week to discuss 1) some 
examples of options to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from 
a logistical standpoint, 2) the bidding process, and how bids for options 
will be evaluated, and 3) further comments received from shippers.  I'll 
circulate our ideas on bidding and awarding options, and any other new ideas 
or questions.

As I've discussed with some of you, our shippers are asking to see the filing 
in its entirety before we file it, and would like to have a roundtable 
meeting prior to filing to discuss their concerns.  I realize there is some 
concern about showing them our filing.  What if we just show them our final 
tariff language and form agreement, and offer to host a meeting to discuss 
their questions?  Let me know what you think.

Our target filing date will depend on whether we have a customer meeting 
first, and when FERC staff is available to talk.

Yesterday Jeff Fawcett, Lee Ferrell and I met with Dynegy marketing and 
legal/regulatory representatives regarding TW Transport Options.  Overall the 
meeting was very positive.  We had nothing but encouraging remarks from the 
marketing representatives.  However, the regulatory people (Sarah Tomalty, Ed 
Ross) had a couple of issues.  The biggest issue is a marketing affiliate 
concern.  Apparently Dynegy is on a crusade at FERC to place further limits 
on deals pipelines can do with their marketing affiliates.  They have run 
into situations in which pipelines (examples:  Koch, El Paso) have blatantly 
favored their marketing affiliates to the extent that Dynegy cannot even do 
deals with them.  (In fact, one of the problems with Koch has been Koch's 
price option deals with its affiliate.)  The perception is that the 
affiliates, by using ""funny money,"" can always make themselves the highest 
bidder, with a net benefit to the entire organization (pipeline + 
affiliate).  The remedy Dynegy is proposing is to require a marketing 
affiliate, if it is the highest bidder, to credit back the difference between 
the price it pays and the price offered by the next highest bidder.  The 
presumption is that the affiliate has an unfair advantage because it is able 
to pay above market value in order to get the capacity.   Dynegy's proposal 
would encourage affiliates to pay ""real"" dollars.  

While it emphasized its belief that TW does not favor its marketing 
affiliates, Dynegy would like for us to include in our filing some limitation 
on options transactions with marketing affiliates.   It is likely that other 
pipelines will file for the ability to sell options once FERC approves our 
filing, and Dynegy would like for this type of protection to be part of the 
precedent set by our filing.  Ed hinted that FERC may be considering a 
divestiture requirement for marketing affiliates, and that pipelines can 
avoid this extreme result by voluntarily limiting their transactions with 
affiliates.  Shelley, I know you've discussed this issue with Ed already and 
our reactions were the same.  Basically we politely told Dynegy that we don't 
believe we're part of the problem and that we are therefore not inclined to 
unnecessarily disadvantage our company by further limiting ENA's ability to 
do business with TW.   We can probably expect an intervention with comments 
or a limited protest addressing the issue.

The other regulatory question was whether we intend to file each option deal 
as a negotiated rate.  My analysis of this issue is that since we're 
proposing the option fee as part of the transport rate, options would always 
be a type of negotiated rate and would need to be filed.  If you think this 
is not the right answer, please let me know because we need to decide it 
before we file the tariff sheets.  Sarah's question seemed to be more one of 
curiosity rather than a basis for protest.

Like the Indicated Shippers, Dynegy appeared interested in an all-customer 
meeting to discuss the service.  Jeff and the rest of the commercial group 
are looking further into whether and when we would have such a meeting. 

If you have any questions or concerns please let me know."

I've looked into whether we can terminate our Val Verde interconnect 
agreement with Burlington, and have determined we may do so only if we take 
the following steps:

1.  Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.  Paragraph 13 
of the 6/1/94 OBA with Burlington (as successor in interest to Meridian) 
provides that either party may terminate the OBA ""at the end of the primary 
term, or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice"" to 
Burlington.  (The one-month primary term ended June 30, 1994 and has since 
gone month-to-month.)

2.  On the effective termination date of the OBA, terminate the interconnect 
agreement by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.    The 12/31/92 
Interconnect Point Operating Agreement, Paragraph 6, provides that either 
party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary 
term.  This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire 
until 12/31/02.  However, the paragraph also provides that the agreement ""may 
be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in 
the event the OBA between the parties is terminated.""

As we've already discussed, termination of the agreement is an extreme 
measure from a customer relations standpoint and we probably need to weigh 
our other options first.  Let me know if you have further questions."

Drew -- here is Lorraine's update on the Val Verde situation that I mentioned 
in my previous e-mail.   Recall that we've been unable to accept quantities 
of gas from Burlington because of the high temperatures at the interconnect 
in recent years.  I've recommended that we seek amendment of the contract as 
soon as possible to reflect what we CAN do.  

The proposed amendment Lorraine is referring to, which Burlington rejected, 
modified our obligation to provide firm compression sufficient to accept 
250,000 MMBtu.  

//
Burlington Resources - Val Verde Plant - Michelle and I had a follow-up 
conversation with BR Thursday.  I faxed the proposed amendment to BR Monday 
and we hadn't heard from them yet.  They claim approximately $135,000/month 
in lost revenues because we are holding their production down.  Michele and 
Darrell will work to pull together the data on exactly which days we have not 
been able to take BR's gas.  I mentioned to BR that we were putting this info 
together, but they claim since they were told to back off to 180,000 - 
190,000 MMBtu from about mid-June through July, our data would not accurately 
reflect BR's inability to schedule in excess of 180/190.  They will not 
accept our wording in the interconnect amendment, specifically ""best efforts"" 
and ""subject to operating conditions on TW"", so we will need to revise this 
further.

We offered alternate receipt point flexibility at Ignacio and alternate 
delivery point flexibility at El Paso Blanco on their Jackrabbit contract but 
they do not think this is sufficient to agree to amend the interconnect 
agreement.  They have suggested we consider giving them a deeper discount on 
their San Juan - Waha contract (80,000/d, $0.14, term 11/30/06).  

The ball is in our court.  "

Subject: Transwestern org chart

I just met with Steve Harris to review the Transwestern Commercial Group job 
descriptions and proposed organization chart.  He agreed with the wording of 
the job descriptions but suggested that the TW employees currently working in 
NNG's Business Development and Marketing organization be shown on the 
Transwestern organization chart in a dotted line reporting relationship to 
him.  A footnote would identify them as 

""Transwestern employees located in the NNG Business Development & Marketing 
organization which serves as a resource to support the TW Commercial Group in 
the areas of Risk Management, Pricing & Structuring, Business Development, 
Market Analysis and Government Affairs""

Steve also indicated that a TW employee will also be hired in the next few 
days to fill a Regional Mgr Government Affairs job currently located in Mike 
McGowen's group and that this job should also be placed in a dotted line 
relationship reporting to him.  The existing footnote could be revised to 
recognize this job as well. 

After talking to Steve I feel that the above would be the best and least 
confusing way to portray Transwestern employees in an on-line organization 
chart.  In this regard I have again revised the Transwestern Commercial 
organization chart and will deliver/fax it this afternoon to you both for 
your review and comments.

The Mark Morris group performance is the last weekend of this month, the 27th 
- 29th.  See the website www.spahouston.org and click on ""Program Notes"" for 
a detailed description.  

Bill and I will leave for Austin tomorrow a.m. as early as we can manage.  
I'm not picky about where we go for dinner, but was thinking Bill might enjoy 
going to the Bitter End brew pub -- I'm sure they don't take reservations but 
it should not be a problem if we go early enough.  

The landscaper removed all the bushes in the front beds and it looks weird!  
Can't wait for her to get the new gravel in my driveway.

We'll call tomorrow a.m. if not sooner!  Have a good day!  "

First of all, I'm delighted you want to stay and would not have a problem 
with Deron moving in.  However, in return I would ask for increased rent of 
$650, to take into account the improvements you want and additional water use 
and wear & tear.  After you read this let me know whether you think this is 
reasonable.

I'll try to answer all your questions:

Q. I believe you had mentioned some termite issues and I wanted to
make sure that we would not be doing anything to cause the floor to collapse 
as
we would be removing light items for heavier items. 

A.  I really do not think it is a problem.  In addition to the oak floor, 
there is a subfloor, so heavier items should be fine.  I'd draw the line at a 
waterbed, though!

Q.  The stove is a bit problematic... 

A.  No problem to look into this.  I'm sure it can be repaired.  I will give 
the appliance folks a call.  

Q.  Do you know if the garage apt. would support a 2nd line being installed? 

A.  I'm sure it will...go ahead and do it; if the phone company runs into any 
internal wiring problems let me know and I'll call my phone wiring dude.

Q.  Do you know if the washer/dryer connections in the garage part work for 
sure?

A.  I have a bad feeling about those connections!  I'll get them up and 
running, and can get someone to haul the old washer off.

Q.  I am guessing that they would need to be gas, not electric? 

A.  I would strongly recommend a gas dryer because it is so much more 
economical.  Plus you would not believe how much faster you can get jeans and 
towels dry than with electric!
If I have to get a new connection installed it will be gas if possible.

Q.  At one point, you had mentioned doing something with the kitchen floor as 
the linoleum has seen better days... Would it be possible to look into this?

A.  I have always thought linoleum in a black & white checkerboard pattern 
would look really cute in there.  It's cheap to install and fairly easy 
except I'm leary of taking on the project myself because pulling up the old 
stuff is going to be a you-know-what.  I will call & ask my handyman, unless 
you and Deron are just dying to do it yourselves.

Q.  Do you know if any paint is leftover?

A.  The color I used on the trim was Antique White semigloss; there should be 
some left in the garage.  I'll check and if not I can pick up some for you at 
the paint store as I'll be going there this week or this weekend.

The only additional issue I have is parking -- Dianna is staying with me and 
helping w/rent for the next several months and I'd like her to be able to use 
that middle space.  I know it's a pain but either you or Deron would have to 
park on the street.  The other option is to get one of the back garage doors 
working so there is access to the garage from the alley.  If I did this do 
you think y'all would use it, or is that too impractical?

As for timing with the oven, W/D connections and kitchen floor, I'm taking 
the first full week of Sept. off and it would be easiest for me to get 
everything done then if that's okay with y'all.

Call if you have further questions!

I agree that the proposed facilities could be constructed under the prior 
notice provisions of TW's blanket certificate if the cost and environmental 
requirements are met.  The facilities appear to meet the criteria for an 
""eligible facility"" under section 157.202(b)(2)(i):  they are necessary to 
provide service to Big Sandy within existing mainline certificate levels, and 
according to my research the facilities are similar to those that the 
Commission routinely has found to be eligible under a blanket certificate.  
The prior notice project cost limit for year 2000 is $20,200,000.  (Sec. 
157.208).  If the project is not within this cost limit we will need to seek 
a 7(c) certificate.  

I've researched the incremental rate question and here's what I've been able 
to find out:

In the context of a 7(c) application, FERC generally requires use of existing 
Part 284 rates.  This was the case when TW applied for a certificate to 
construct the San Juan lateral.  TW requested a separate zone rate for the 
lateral in that proceeding but FERC stated that a section 7 proceeding was 
not the appropriate forum.  The Commission stated, however, that it would be 
willing to entertain an abbreviated Section 4 filing by TW to revise its Part 
284 rates to inclue zone rates for the lateral.  So TW made a Section 4 
filing and got zone rates approved based on the cost of service for the 
lateral. 

Whether we construct the Big Sandy lateral under the blanket certificate or 
not, it appears that we would have to file a limited section 4 if we want to 
implement rates for the lateral that are different from the West of Thoreau 
rates.

As for whether an open season would be required, I assume it would not be if 
Caithness is going to fully subscribe the capacity on the lateral.  However, 
if other shippers are interested and we want to get the best rate we'll 
probably want to have an open season.  In any event, in the context of a 7(c) 
application FERC is going to put us at risk for recovery of costs, so it 
would be to our advantage to sell 100% of the new capacity.

At this point I am uncertain whether we even want or need different rates for 
the Big Sandy lateral...ultimately it will depend on the cost of the project 
and what rates would make it economic for TW to proceed.

I hope this helps...if there are further questions or if any of this does not 
sound right to you let me know.

Subject: Re: Caithness Big Sandy, LLC. Project  

As you are aware, Transwestern is working with a shipper to potentially 
provide service to a new power plant located approximately 40 miles off the 
mainline in Arizona.  Although, the final negotiation are not complete 
certain options are being evaluated, I need some assistance in interpreting 
the regulations regarding the authority we should use for approval of this 
project.  

The facilities that would be constructed include a delivery point and 
approximately 40 miles of pipe.  As these facilities are non-mainline, it may 
be possible to construct the proposed facilities under the prior notice 
provisions of TW's blanket certificate, provided the project satisfies the 
blanket criteria (generally costs and environmental).

With this in mind, I have the following issues and questions:

Preliminarily, marketing is thinking that we may want to develop an 
incremental rate  to recover the cost of the project.

Would a new incremental rate for this service impact our ability to file for 
approval under the prior notice provisions?  Note: Generally, Subpart F of 
Part 157 (blanket regulations) does not address service issues as 
transportation service is provided under Part 284 of the Commission's 
regulations.  However, the regulations (o157.204)  set forth Who may apply 
for a blanket certificate.   The criteria includes, among other things, any 
interstate pipeline that has rates accepted by the Commission.  Therefore, 
would an incremental rate have to be approved by the Commission before the 
proposed facilities would be blanket eligible?

Can a new incremental rate be established through a limit-section 4 rate 
filing or is a case-specific certificate required?

As the facilities will not include any mainline expansion - Is an open season 
required for the project?  My opinion is ""NO"".  Do you agree?

Your thoughts and assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.  
Thanks MW

Subject: Re: Caithness Big Sandy, LLC. Project  

As you are aware, Transwestern is working with a shipper to potentially 
provide service to a new power plant located approximately 40 miles off the 
mainline in Arizona.  Although, the final negotiation are not complete 
certain options are being evaluated, I need some assistance in interpreting 
the regulations regarding the authority we should use for approval of this 
project.  

The facilities that would be constructed include a delivery point and 
approximately 40 miles of pipe.  As these facilities are non-mainline, it may 
be possible to construct the proposed facilities under the prior notice 
provisions of TW's blanket certificate, provided the project satisfies the 
blanket criteria (generally costs and environmental).

With this in mind, I have the following issues and questions:

Preliminarily, marketing is thinking that we may want to develop an 
incremental rate  to recover the cost of the project.

Would a new incremental rate for this service impact our ability to file for 
approval under the prior notice provisions?  Note: Generally, Subpart F of 
Part 157 (blanket regulations) does not address service issues as 
transportation service is provided under Part 284 of the Commission's 
regulations.  However, the regulations (o157.204)  set forth Who may apply 
for a blanket certificate.   The criteria includes, among other things, any 
interstate pipeline that has rates accepted by the Commission.  Therefore, 
would an incremental rate have to be approved by the Commission before the 
proposed facilities would be blanket eligible?

Can a new incremental rate be established through a limit-section 4 rate 
filing or is a case-specific certificate required?

As the facilities will not include any mainline expansion - Is an open season 
required for the project?  My opinion is ""NO"".  Do you agree?

Your thoughts and assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.  
Thanks MW

Janet, please meet with Denise (tomorrow if possible) to:

- explain filing system
- hand off filing projects you are working on (anytime between tomorrow and 
next week is fine)
- explain how you do service lists for FERC filings.

Also, one of you will need to contact the appropriate person to get Denise 
access to my Lotus Organizer.
Don't know how to notify the mailroom people to deliver my mail to Denise's 
station but see if you can do this also.

I spoke with Mike, and Emily is going to handle moving the phones.

Merci beaucoup!"

Denise, here are a few things off the top of my head.

1.  I mostly work for the Transwestern Commercial Group, which is the 
following cast of characters:

Steve Harris
Kevin Hyatt
Lindy Donoho
Jeff Fawcett
TK Lohman
Christine Stokes
Michelle Lokay
Lorraine Lindberg

When I am not on 47, I sit near their work area on 41 (and forward my phone 
to x34516).  These are the people I'm most likely to have you organize 
meetings with, distribute things to, etc.  Their assistant is Audrey 
Robertson.  I lost our most recent phone list but please get one from her 
(x35849).

2.  Usually I get in around 8:30 and leave around 6.  I'm not picky about 
when you're in the office; it is very rare that I will need you to come in 
early or stay late.  I think I asked Janet only twice.

3.  Major projects I'm working on right now that you'll hear me mention a lot:

- TW Options (a tariff filing)
- Order 637 compliance
- Caithness/Big Sandy (potential pipeline interconnect)

4.  Standing meetings:

- TW Commercial Group staff meeting:  Monday at 9:30
- Omaha regulatory staff meeting:  Tues. at 8:15.
- Therapist:  every few weeks Thurs. 9:00 (if anyone asks, I'm in a meeting; 
but if they knew where I really was I'm sure they would understand!)

5.  Faxes:  I get faxes from Regulatory a lot and they generally don't call 
first.  Please check the fax machine once a day (and my chair, if I'm not on 
47 that day, in case someone got a fax for me and put it there).

6.  Mail:  Please open my mail, and I'll try to come pick it up every day.

7.  Filing:  I generally avoid keeping files of useless information.  
However, since I'm a regulatory lawyer it is inevitable that I will have a 
ton of paper to stash away where I can find it later.  Filing is pretty 
important to me.  I promise to try to let you know what files are more 
important than others so you can prioritize.  The good news:  I rarely ever 
go to the extent where I would have you index a file.  Just putting things in 
the right folder is enough.

8.  Computer files:  At the beginning of each quarter, please create a new 
Word file folder (if you look under sscott you'll see I have 2ndqtr00, 
3rdqtr00, etc.)

9.  Calendar:  Please obtain access to my Lotus Organizer, and if you get 
e-mails of meetings I'm supposed to attend go ahead and put them in the 
calendar. 

10.  Friends you're likely to hear from a lot:  Ann, Bill, my grandmother 
(""Ms. Savoy""), Dianna

11.  The Other Susan Scott:  There is a Susan M Scott who works for ENA.  I 
get her mail and phone calls all the time!  Her extension is 31445.  Not sure 
of her location as it seems to change a lot.

I look forward very much to working with you!!"

Here is the draft for distribution.  In addition to the customer-friendly 
""looking forward to meeting with our business partners"" language I know 
you'll include, I'd suggest including something like the following:

Attached are drafts of the proposed tariff provisions (including the form of 
Transport Option Amendment) and a filing letter.  We are providing these 
draft documents to you in advance of filing them with FERC as part of a 
good-faith effort to resolve any remaining issues with our shippers prior to 
filing.  The drafts are for purposes of discussion by workshop attendees 
only, and we ask that you not distribute them to persons outside your 
company.  Additionally, while we hope that these drafts are close to being in 
final form, they are of course subject to revision and final management 
approval prior to filing with the Commission.

to compare the other language in the agreement to that of the existing one to

Jeff -- since most of Teddy's comments were over my head yesterday, I could 
use your help on that part of the discussion.

***
Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial 
and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, 
Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the 
proposed TW Options filing, we opened the floor for questions and comments.  
Here is a summary of the comments.

Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed 
concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game 
the system.  For example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, if ENA 
buys a call option it is essentially a free option.  ENA could buy a call out 
of the money and we could buy it back from them, with the proceeds going to 
Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested that TW's marketing affiliates be banned 
from purchasing options, or that the marketing affiliate be required to 
credit the call money to other shippers.  BP's concern is that TW's filing 
will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service, so they 
want TW's options program to be as restricted as possible.  Dynegy reiterated 
its suggestion that the marketing affiliate be required to credit back the 
difference between the option fee paid by the affiliate and the next highest 
bidder's bid, if the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest bid by a 
certain percentage.  

Our response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing 
affiliate would be a concern, we feel that TW is entitled to a presumption 
that it has complied and will continue to comply with the rules on sale of 
capacity to marketing affiliates.  At this point we are not inclined to 
voluntarily include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others 
have issues regarding Commission marketing affiliate policy in general, those 
issues should be addressed in a different proceeding that pertain to all 
interstate pipelines.

Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the 
right of first refusal.  Our response was that ROFR will still be available 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.

Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that options will constitute a 
negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such.  We did not 
respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's position at this point 
is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate, the deals 
will only be negotiated rate deals if the total rate exceeds the maximum 
rate.  

Hoarding capacity.  Several customers expressed concern that the options 
program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not 
clear why they thought that options would create more opportunity for 
hoarding than already exists.  Their perception was that options would simply 
make hoarding cheaper and easier.  We acknowledged that the potential for 
withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy 
against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although we did not commit to 
placing any limits on the quantity of capacity for which a shipper may 
purchase an option, it is possible that FERC may require us to do so.

Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California to elicit their 
comments, and finalize the FERC filing by mid-September.

Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the 
proposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a 
summary of the comments.

Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed 
concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game 
the system.  In BP's example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA 
could purchase an ""out of the money"" call option essentially cost free, since 
its affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back.  Proceeds 
from ENA's ability to then ""move the market"" through the establishment of the 
long basis position would go directly to Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested 
that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the 
marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to 
other shippers.  Although BP admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with 
ENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW's filing will set a precedent for 
other pipelines to offer a similar service.  Since TW will be the first 
pipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW's program to be as restricted as 
possible.  Dynegy echoed BP's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but 
rather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier 
suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference 
between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if 
the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage.  

TW's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a 
marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable 
record in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has 
complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale 
of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily 
include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have 
serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing 
affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that 
applies to all interstate pipelines.

Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the 
right of first refusal.  TW's  response was that ROFR will still be available 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.

Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that option contracts will 
constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as 
such.  TW did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's 
position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the 
transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment 
will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the 
option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate.  

Hoarding capacity.  Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso 
as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program 
would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why 
some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would 
create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.  Perhaps 
because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the 
underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make 
hoarding cheaper and easier.  TW acknowledged that the potential for 
withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy 
against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although TW did not commit to 
placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for 
capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require 
TW to do so in a final order.

Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California the week of 
September 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC 
filing by mid-September.

Christine, the ""actual fuel usage"" provision is probably a material deviation 
from the tariff, unless we cap the fuel rate at the maximum percentage stated 
in our tariff.  I have added language to this effect.

If we're using the ""actual fuel"" language because we anticipate that the fuel 
usage will exceed the maximum, and therefore we do not wish to cap the 
percentage at the maximum, we can certainly leave my additional language out 
and file a summary of the contract.  I do not think such a filing would 
generate too much unwanted attention from FERC or our shippers.  Let me know.

Let me know if you have any revisions to the provided discount letter.

Note that this contract will only charge ACTUAL FUEL utilized if the Shipper 
transports along the primary path (Paragraph 2).  Also, Kevin - is $.09 a 
sufficient TOTAL RATE for alternate deliveries to the California Border?  I 
think by fixing the rate like this we are leaving a lot of money behind.  We 
could put wording in the contact that each month the alternate rate to 
California will be set by Transwestern.  We have, a long time ago, used this 
language and it forces the shipper to call TK for the appropriate montly rate 
quote.  If fact, Richardson Products has this arrangement.   Let me know your 
thoughts.

Elizabeth, Jeff forwarded me your questions about capacity options.  I've 
answered them to the extent they involve legal/regulatory issues.  If you 
need anything further please don't hesitate to call.

?  Can a new shipper who enters into an FTS-1 contract with zero MDQ in order 
to purchase a shipper call option or sell a transporter put option be 
allowed, prior to the exercise date, to transfer the underlying option rights 
by permanently releasing this contract?    YES.

?   Will we be required to report these contracts with zero MDQ on the Index 
of Customers and/or the Transactional Report?  YES.

? Can the releasing shipper permanently release a portion of his existing MDQ 
and choose to keep or transfer the option rights?   YES.  The shipper could 
even release all of its MDQ (reducing it to zero) and keep its option rights.

? How is it determined whether a contract with an option amendment is within 
the min/max tariff rate or needs to be filed as a negotiated rate?  The 
option fee is converted to a per-Dth, per day rate and added to the transport 
rate.  If the total exceeds the maximum tariff rate, it's ""negotiated"".  
Otherwise, our position is that it's not negotiated.  We are not 100% 
positive that FERC will agree with us on this issue."

Gerald:

Jere Bates asked that I comment on your redline of the confidentiality
agreement that I helped draft.  My comments are as follows:

1. Regarding the strikeout in Section 2 of the language concerning the
obligations of Enron surviving termination, Tri-State is opposed to striking
this.  The information is not to be used at any time other than for the
purpose set forth in the agreement, and the fact that Enron may cease to
acquire new information should not relieve it of its obligation not to use
information it has previously received for unintended purposes. We believe
that language protects against that occurrence-and is consistent with the
language in the last sentence of Section 5 as well.

2. Regarding Section 6, Tri-State is opposed to waiving consequential,
punitive or exemplary damages because in our view, it is likely that many
damages Tri-State would suffer as a result of a breach would not be direct
or ordinary, but rather consequential.  In addition, the right to recover
punitive or exemplary damages is needed in our view to protect against
blatant disregard for the terms of the agreement.  We also believe that we
should have three years to commence an action after termination.

3.  Regarding Section 7(b), we believe Colorado law is appropriate since
Tri-State is the party that would be bringing an action for breach and
should have the benefit of doing so in accordance with the laws it is
familiar with.

Please feel free to call or e-mail me or Jere with a response.  We are open
to discussing these points, but do feel very strongly that our position is
reasonable and appropriate.

Thanks,

Dave Nocera

I've discussed the ""actual fuel"" provision with Christine and Bob and made 
them aware that this is a nonconforming provision that would need to be 
filed, since the FTS-1 rate schedule provides that fuel payments are to be 
made according to the percentages set forth in the rate sheets.  

According to Bob's calculations, the actual fuel used by Duke under this 
contract is likely to exceed the applicable percentages in our tariff.

I don't think FERC or any of our shippers would have any immediate objection 
to our charging actual fuel.  However, I know that fuel is a sensitive issue 
on TW so I wanted to be sure to draw your attention to this provision.  Let 
me know what you think.

Thanks Robert, this is a big help.
Just wondering -- you make the statement that ""El Paso is not directing TW to 
build the interconnect facilities...""  Do you think that our having an 
interconnect agreement outlining the specifications for the facilities and 
setting forth certain indemnities weaken our position at all in terms of 
saying this is not a CIAC?

Subject: Re: CIAC  

I can only address this from the tax position.  Books may differ from the 
noted treatment depending on the true facts.  I have a call to James Centilli 
for his thoughts.  I also have not reviewed any written language, so this is 
based on our conversations; therefore the facts may change depending on the 
final arrangement.

Based on my understanding, the meter fee will be structured as a fee paid to 
TW for services and not to build the interconnect facilities.  Because El 
Paso is not directing TW to build the interconnect facilities TW will not 
record these fees as a CIAC for tax.  In short, the management fee is just 
normal operational type revenue.  The benefit to El Paso is that they avoid 
the gross-up because this payment does not fall under the guidelines of IRS 
Code Section 118 (b).  However, please note that the management fee is still 
taxable to TW in the year actually received or deemed received.   It is just 
not classified as a CIAC for tax purposes.  

The potential book benefit to TW is that the interconnect facilities built 
should be allowed as part of rate base because the assets were built by TW 
and not contributed from El Paso -- I have a call to James Centilli to 
confirm.

Clarification on CIAC ( IRC 118(b)).  This is a code section that governs for 
tax only how payments received from customers or potential customers for 
services that benefit the customer are treated for tax purposes.  For tax,  
the money received is recognized in the year received or deemed received, and 
the asset is depreciated, normally 15 years, MACRS.  The Gross-up paid is the 
time value of money over the life of the asset and is paid by the customer 
requesting the service.  

The Management fee structure will generate the same result as the CIAC for 
tax.  For tax, the money is received and taxed.  The money is then used 
indirectly to build the interconnect facilities that are deprecated over 15 
years, MACRS for tax.  The piece missing is that El Paso avoids the gross-up 
of approximately $50,000.  The $50,000 becomes a lost cost to TW for doing 
the deal with El Paso.  The lost cost should be off-set in part from rate 
recovery.  I don't know how this piece will work -- James Centilli should be 
able to confirm.

Let me know if we need to discuss further.  I am out of the office after 
12:30 today to return on Monday.  I will check my voice mail.  However, If 
you need to move on this or need additional help,  please call me on my

Robert, here is the beginning of a note I need to send to Drew Fossum 
explaining what we're doing with El Paso.  Can you elaborate on the ""meter 
fee"" approach?  

I'm not sure I really understand what keeps it from being a CIAC, and why we 
get to include it in the rate base.  

If you can add to this I would appreciate it, or just give me a call and we 
can discuss it further.  Thanks so much for your help.

***

El Paso Field Services wants TW to build interconnect facilities.  Estimated 
cost:  $280,000.  EPFS will contribute $165,000 pursuant to an interconnect 
agreement.  The Commercial Group would like to avoid the tax gross-up 
associated with a contribution in aid of construction.  The Internal Revenue 
Code expressly provides that contributions in aid of construction and other 
contributions made by a customer or potential customer (collectively, 
""CIACs"") are not contributions to capital and thus are not excluded from 
gross income.  Accordingly, such amounts are required to be included in gross 
income.  

EPFS has proposed, instead of the $165,000 being paid in a lump sum, that the 
contribution instead be paid in equal monthly installments as a ""meter fee.""  
Our tax department has advised me that while this approach does not absolve 
TW from tax liability on that revenue, it does have a couple of advantages.  
It would remove the contribution from the CIAC category (why is it not a 
CIAC?)and TW would be allowed to include it in its rate base.  Additionally, 
TW would be allowed to treat the interconnect facilities as a depreciable 
asset.

Hi Mum!  What an eventful few days it has been.  Sorry I didn't call over the 
weekend.  I had my hands full painting my bedroom!  It took forever!  Luckily 
I got the color right on the first try:  the Happy Yellow looks pretty good.  
Saturday I hauled my paint-covered self to the Met for a pro-am tennis 
tournament, which was fun.  It was a benefit for DiverseWorks, the 
theater/art group I've been interested in joining.  In fact, yesterday I got 
a call from their executive director asking if I was still interested in 
board membership, and that they would be voting on me tonight!  I'm really 
excited and am expecting good news.  This could be an auspicious start to 
life after law for me!
Sure enjoyed my visit to Austin.  It went by too quickly!  I hope you're 
having a good week; let me hear from you!
Love,
Sooz."

Ashley, all that is fine, and I certainly understand, though I would very 
much hate to lose you because you are a fabulous renter.  Keep your freedom!  
Stay in my apartment!!  If you do not want to renew for 6 months and want to 
go month to month after Nov., that is fine.  All I ask is 30 days notice 
before you move out.  In any event, I'll probably get the floors done just 
because I think it would be a good improvement to make regardless...I'll 
check with you before I get the work done to make sure the timing is OK with 
you.

Susan,

Before you spend too much making improvements (though the oven does need to be
fixed!)

Right now, it looks like Deron is not going to be moving in with me as he has
some concerns about the wiring for all of his computer gadgets.

I love my (your!) garage apartment and really do not want to give it up, 
however
I am not sure if it makes sense for us to keep paying 2 rents, so I am not 
100%
sure whether I will be renewing my lease after November.  If I did, it would
probably be for another six months (ie, I would delay moving in together, 
which
I am considering as there is no real reason to rush).

If I do not, I would be happy to post an ad for it here at Hewitt as I have
nothing but nice things to say about it and you!  Plus, one would be very
hard-pressed to find an irresponsible person here- there are lots of wonderful
people here.   I will try to make a decision by the end of Sept. as to give 
you
notice and enough time to try to help you find a nice tenant!

I am sorry to seem to fickle-  life is suddenly getting very complicated!

Hi Misty!  How's everything?  Are we on for this weekend?  Let me know.  
Since I have plans to see Lyle Lovett on Fri. night, I was thinking of flying 
in rather than driving Sat. a.m. to save on time & energy, especially since 
you live so close to the airport!

Painted my bedroom Happy Yellow while listening to the U.S. Open weekend 
before last...drank a lot of beer also.  Am amazed it turned out as well as 
it did.

You said you work with someone named Hamlet, right?  Apparently he used to 
live across the street from Karin and Jim, on Evans!  I didn't think there 
could possibly be 2 Hamlets.  Small world.

Lindy, FERC has consistently held that pipelines may make ""operational"" sales 
of gas.  Specifically this has included occasional sales of gas resulting 
from cashout requirements and the buying and selling of gas to maintain 
linepack levels.  TW's sale of excess linepack gas would probably be fine.  
By contrast, buying gas then turning around and reselling it would be suspect 
as it would look too much like our unbundled merchant function.

Let me know if you have further questions.

Subject: TW Buy/Sell Gas For Operations

In our Plan meeting, we were discussing UAF and Operation's objective to 
reduce it.  Operation's objective is a volumetric goal, but we are at risk 
for the gas price.  It started me thinking about our whole fuel expense.  
TW's fuel expense is valued on our books at the TW systemwide index.  Should 
TW be hedging the fuel that we burn?  Jan-Aug, 2000 (acctg months) Y-T-D fuel 
expense is at $21MM ($2.6MM/month) at a total volume of 6.7 Bcf.  This 
summer, with high gas prices and Gallup in service, our fuel has been ranging 
$3.4-3.8MM a month.  Operations has objectives to minimize the fuel use, but 
not the price.
  
How could we hedge our fuel used?  Would we sell all the fuel retained (hedge 
it as high as possible) and manage our fuel expense separately through its 
own purchasing and hedging (as low as possible) effort?  Could we have hedged 
some portion of our fuel usage last year for this year at $2.36 (like we 
hedged our excess fuel) and not be subject to the high prices we're seeing 
this summer?

Do you think there is an opportunity here to manage our fuel expense more 
effectively?

Susan,
I think you had looked at TW's ability to buy/sell gas a few months back 
(when we were looking at fuel monetization).  What did the FERC Order say 
about under what circumstances TW could buy/sell gas?

You had a question about the meaning of Section 4.3.  Here's a brief 
explanation.

Section 4.2 covers indemnification in case one party gets sued by a third 
party for damage caused by negligence of the other party.  I'm OK with 
eliminating ""stockholders"" and the ""...judgments of any nature..."" clause you 
two spoke about on the phone as long as they come out of both subparagraphs 
a. and b.

Section 4.3 needs to stay in because it covers any potential action by EPFS 
against TW for damage to EPFS's facilities during the term of the agreement.  
TW is already obligated elsewhere in the agreement to construct and operate 
the facilities in accordance with industry practice, tariff and DOT 
standards.  Our policy in interconnect agreements is that if TW complies with 
these standards we should not then somehow be liable for damage to EPFS in 
case of explosion, etc.  In other words, both parties bear the risk attached 
to something unforeseeable going wrong notwithstanding use of industry and 
DOT standards.
(By the way, I believe the ""notwithstanding anything in this Article 4 to the 
contrary"" language should come out; I'm not sure why it's in the draft.)

Any questions -- please e-mail or call (713-853-0596)."

reading while we're trying to talk to them.  It should be enough information 
to raise a lot of questions.

Please wait until Shelley or I give you the go-ahead to pass this along to 
the relevant Commission people; I'd like to give the other addressees the 
opportunity to comment on this to the extent possible.  

Everyone else:  please give me your comments ASAP as Nancy has been asked to 
provide something to them tomorrow.

Hi Mum -- not going to DC until next week.
Any ideas for Karin's birthday?  Maybe we could look for something this 
weekend.
I plan to get out into the nice weather today as soon as I can!
Going to Brennan's tonight w/Craig.
Dianna isn't coming with me to Austin so I guess I will just come first thing 
Sat. a.m.  I'll give you a call tomorrow!
S.

Hi, Sooz!

Guess you didn't have to make your trip.

Had thought that seeing Carmen in Houston even though it's being presented
here in May would be interesting, but think I'll pass on it.  I return Oct 18
and don't know if Karin wants me to spend the weekend with her and the Bug or
not since Jim will be gone.  But, I might come the end of Oct to do some
shopping.  Eric will be coming sometime the first 2 wks of Nov to use his
free ticket by the 15th.  We're going to get his reservation made when he
picks me up at the San Jose airport.  I'll be coming at some point for Ann
Kelly's birthday which is in Nov.  It's always difficult to find a date with
everyone's busy schedule--especially Ann's.  She never stops.

Went to the outlet this morning and bought some shoes but couldn't find
anything else.  That's always a lost cause for me and it will be a long time
before I go again.

Gorgeous day here, but it's warming up again.  So pleasant sleeping with the
bedroom door open to the porch.

Looking forward to seeing you.  Love, mum

Drew, here's my first stab at a rehearing argument.  I did not go as far as I 
could have because I really think we should argue that there should be no 
limitation at all and that TW should be able to decide for itself what 
capacity it can sell as firm.  Instead, I've proposed a solution that will be 
less controversial, as we discussed earlier this week.  If you think this 
passes the laugh test I can do some rewriting and circulate it.  

My biggest concern is portraying PNM's capacity as ""firm"" or ""interruptible"" 
since PNM does not use that terminology, in its tariff or otherwise, except 
to assure us over the phone that it is firm!  I'd like to check to see if PNM 
is comfortable with all this before we file anything.  

Call when you can; this is not due 'til Oct. 15.

Ted, I made a slight change on the first page.  Also, the blanks of course 
need to be filled in for $$ amount and term.
Do we have other guaranties in favor of both TW and NNG?  I know we probably 
do, and I may have even approved them.  But if possible I'd prefer to have 
two separate guaranties since TW and NNG are separate legal entities.  It is 
not a huge concern, since we are not jointly obligating the two companies to 
do anything.  If it would cause an administrative hassle to have two 
agreements, let me know.

Jim, if we delete current Section 4.3, then we would like to reinsert the 
""negligence"" clauses in Section 4.2 (I don't remember how they got negotiated 
out in the first place).  So it would read:

4.2  a.  TW shall release, protect, indemnify, defend and hold harmless EPFS, 
its affiliated companies and officers, directors, employees, and agents and 
servants, contractors and subcontractors (""Indemnified Party"" or ""Indemnified 
Parties"") from and against that portion of the liabilities, losses, claims, 
damages, penalties, causes of action, suits (including suits for personal 
injuries or death or property damage and including reasonable attorneys' fees 
and expenses) caused or contributed to by the negligence of TW or its 
agent(s) arising out of or in connection with its obligations under the terms 
of this Agreement.

b.  EPFS shall release, protect, indemnify, defend and hold harmless TW and 
its Indemnified Parties from and against that portion of the liabilities, 
losses, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, suits (including suits 
for personal injuries or death or property damage and including reasonable 
attorneys' fees and expenses) caused or contributed to by the negligence of 
EPFS or its agent(s) arising out of or in connection with its obligations 
under the terms of this Agreement.

Susan-
See what you think of using the following in Section 4.2 and deleting
Section 4.3 in its entirety and replacing it with the below:

Section 4.2
  a.  TW shall release, protect, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless EPFS,
its affiliated companies and officers, directors, employees, agents and
servants, contractors and subcontractors (""Indemnified Party"" or
""Indemnified Parties"") from and against any and all liabilities, claims,
damages, penalties, causes of action, suits (including suits for personal
injuries or death or property damage and including reasonable attorney's
fees and expenses) in any way directly or indirectly arising out of or in
connection with TW's performance of its obligations under the terms of this
Agreement.
  b.   EPFS shall release, protect, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless TW
and its Indemnified from and against any and all liabilities, claims,
damages, penalties, causes of action, suits (including suits for personal
injuries or death or property damage and including reasonable attorney's
fees and expenses) in any way directly or indirectly arising out of or in
connection with TW's performance of its obligations under the terms of this
Agreement.

Section 4.3
In no event shall either party be responsible for the gross negligence or
wilfull misconduct of the other party or their Indemnified Parties.

I've changed Section 4.2 in accordance with our e-mail discussion.  
Additionally, I've filled in the blanks for POI# and date of commencement of 
construction, and added an Exhibit A (and a reference to Exhibit A in the 
definition of ""Facilities"") listing what will be installed.

Darin, kindly fill in the appropriate contact information on page 11, have 
the agreement executed by EPFS in duplicate originals, and return both 
originals to me.  I will return a fully executed original to you.  Lorraine 
Lindberg will be forwarding you wire transfer information for the payments 
that are due from EPFS upon execution.

Subject: UAF Presentation

For the past two months I have been visiting the GPG Operations Regional 
offices giving a presentation on physical ""UAF Fundamentals and Issues"" .

The presentation has been very well received.  Interest is high, and numerous 
questions have been raised at each meeting.  The presentation can be given in 
50 minutes if questions are limited.  It has taken up to 3 hours due to the 
amount of questions from the attendees. 

One  focus of these meetings is to give the field staff a better 
understanding of the impact  UAF has on our bottom line (TW) and  the impact 
it has on our shipper costs (NNG). 

Yesterday, 10/4/00 I had the opportunity to meet with several members of the 
financial group in Houston to discuss UAF.  Coming out of that meeting was a 
request to schedule a Houston presentation on ""UAF Fundamentals"".  This has 
been done, and will be at 1 PM on Oct. 18, 2000. (Place yet to be determined.)

Two Questions:

Is there any interest in having me give the presentation in Omaha?????
Do you have any staff in Houston that you would like  to invite to the 10/18 
presentation????


Copy of the presentation if you are interested:     

Thanks  Steve  37885

Susan,

I would like to request 1 final change to the interconnect agreement before
execution.  It is a simple change to better clarify the intent of paragraph
3.4

This is how I would like to see it read,

3.4 For a period of two (2) years from the date of the Facilities are
completed and placed in-service, EPFS shall be obligated to
 deliver an average of  12,500 MMBtu/d to TW at the Interconnect
Point.  At the completion of the second year from the date
 the facilities are completed and placed in service, If EPFS has not
met the 9.1 Bcf volume  commitment, EPFS will refund
 $100,000 to TW within thirty (30) days.  At any time during the two
(2) year period should EPFS's cumulative delivery to TW
 at the Inteconnect Point meet or exceed the 9.1 Bcf commitment, EPFS
is relieved  of its volumetric and monetary obligation
 to TW as described in this paragragh 3.4.  .......  rest as
originally writen...


Please let me know what you think.

Darin

Barbara, here is my draft of a rehearing request.  As I mentioned, our 
outside counsel is going to try to add a few sentences; I haven't heard back 
from them, but will send you the revised draft when I do.  I'd be happy to 
copy Jay Golub too; please send me his e-mail address.  In the meantime, let 
me know if you have any comments.  We plan to file on Monday, Oct. 16.

Thanks,

Susan

The attached draft reflects revisions made pursuant to our discussions with 
FERC staff.  You will be receiving a hard copy of the tariff sheets 
separately.

Please make sure you read the ""Waivers"" section towards the end of the 
document as it contains some additional requests for waivers.

Also, there seems to be some confusion over whether we are going to post all 
options, not just Shipper call options.  My previous drafts have provided for 
posting of Shipper call options only.  All other types of options will be 
generally available, on a nondiscriminatory basis, through our tariff.  My 
thinking was that it is commercially impracticable to post the specifics of 
all types of options, and it's not necessary since options will be noted on 
our transaction reports required by Order 637.  Let me know what you think.

Let me know your comments as soon as possible.  I understand that the 
Commercial Group told Stan Horton this would be filed this week and Shelley 
reported at staff meeting on Monday that it would be filed this week or next 
week.  As soon as I get everyone's comments we can get this finalized.

Thank you.

Mark, Jeff Fawcett asked me to forward the attached documents to you.  One is 
an interconnect agreement and one is an operating agreement.  I would 
describe both as ""examples"" rather than ""forms,"" since every deal is 
different and we don't really have a standard form we use.  I hope that these 
are helpful; if you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to

Jay and Dan:

This is the first draft of a filing Transwestern is considering filing with
FERC on Monday, October 16, 2000.  Susan Scott will be finalizing this
document on Friday, October 13, 2000.  I will be out of town and unavailable
to review it so she asked if you would look it over here (and as revised on
Friday) to be sure they do not say anything in the filing that is not true
or mischaracterized.  If you have any other suggestions, Susan's phone
number is below.  Again, they are still considering whether or not they will
make this filing.


Susan:

I understand that Jay Golub, too, is traveling this week but is able to view
and respond to his email.  His email address is jgolub@bakerbotts.com
<mailto:jgolub@bakerbotts.com> .  I am also forwarding this to Dan McFearin,
Manager of Transportation Services.  Dan's email address is dmcfear@pnm.com
<mailto:dmcfear@pnm.com>  and Dan's phone number is (505) 241-2496.  If you
do not hear from Jay, you can check with Dan.

I have made changes to the document.  I think the document refers to ""peak""
period when it means to refer to ""non-peak"" period in the first paragraph of
the Argument and vice versa in the second paragraph.  You may have caught
these by now.  I will be in on Monday after all so if you need to talk to
me, you can call me on Monday.

Thanks,
Barbara Whittaker

That is correct, I returned comments to Accounting, not AA directly.

Susan,

That is pretty much all we needed for now Susan.  I appreciate your offer of 
the comments, but I will get back to you later if it looks like we need to 
see those.  

You mentioned you sent comments to someone at AA.  I assume you mean the 
comments were returned to the NNG and TW accounting folks instead (where 
Allen is).  Also, do you send your comments to Drew as well.  

Thanks for the quick response.

Allen Joe).
If you need to see my comments, I believe I kept a hard copy in my file.

Subject: 1999 Form No. 2 Review - Legal

Maria/Susan,

My name is Tony Jackson with Arthur Andersen, and I am the experienced staff 
on the Enron Transportation Services (with a focus on NNG and TW) audit 
team.  Right now, we are in the midst of several internal control reviews 
related to various risk areas. 

We are currently testing the risk that NNG and TW reserves (regulatory, legal 
contingencies, etc.) are inappropriately valued and/or established.  One of 
the controls that Accounting cited to mitigate this risk was that both Legal 
and Rates reviewed the NNG and TW FERC Form No. 2s prior to issuance.  Harry 
Walters and Allen Joe mentioned to us that there is no formal ""sign-off"" or 
approval process by Legal and Rates of the Form 2s, but instead, drafts were 
sent to the groups and any comments were then reviewed with Accounting.  Your 
names were mentioned as those they sent the 1999 Form 2 drafts to for Legal 
to review (Maria-NNG and Susan-TW).   

In order for us to test this control, we need to confirm with your group that 
this type of review was performed for the 1999 NNG and TW Form No. 2s.  What 
role did you and your group play in this review?

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks for your time.

Tony - AA

Southern Trails proposed, at an estimated cost of $155,000,000, a pipeline 
project consisting mostly of 693 miles of crude oil pipeline acquired from 
ARCO.  Ten percent of the project would be new construction and the remainder 
would be conversion of the crude oil line to gas service.  The pipeline 
system would be divided into an East Zone and a West Zone.  The East Zone, 
which will begin in the San Juan Basin and end at the California border, will 
have 87,500 Dth/d of available capacity.  The West Zone, wholly within 
California, will have 120,000 Dth/d.  

Southern Trails received certificate authority for the project on July 
28,2000.  An optional certificate application does not require any showing of 
market need; however, Southern Trails did hold an open season from Sept. to 
Oct. 1998 during which it received 22 bids totalling 810,000 Dth/d of 
demand.  The order issuing the certificate did not say how much of the 
capacity had been subscribed, only that Southern Trails had contracted with 
its affiliate, Questar Energy, for 30,000 Dth/d of firm capacity in theh East 
Zone for 5 years and one month, and taht firm transportation service 
agreements of 5 and 10 year terms are ""being negotiated"" with prospective 
shippers which, if executed, would subscribe the balance of the capacity in 
both the East and West zones.  

TW is an intervenor in this docket so I have received everything that has 
been filed.  I have no further information about any further subscription of

Chad -- Good to see you the other day.  Please give me a call when you return 
to your office.  I am embarrassed to say that I am not sure I have the right 
version of the Operating Agreement we sent you in March...if we can compare 
notes, I can make sure I get the correct one to you without further delay.

Thank you!

Colleen, thank you so much for your very prompt attention to this.  I 
definitely had the wrong version of the agreement.
Jeff confirmed by voice mail this morning that even though we already 
included the 5.4 language in the draft we sent him back in March, he does 
find it objectionable and will want to modify it, so he will be very 
interested in seeing your suggested language too.

Please send your attachment ""CalpineO&M 10-18-00 edits to draft03-20-00"".

Again, thank you so much for your help with this.  (Calpine has finally woken 
up and realized they want this in place Nov. 1...)
I will let you know how negotiations are shaping up.

Subject: Draft- Operating Agreement

Attached below is Jeff Fawsett's  3/22/00 note to Calpine with TW's 3/20/00 
draft of the Operating Agreement .  What changes if any did Calpine require 
to this draft?  Please note that Section 5.4 of the attached 3/20/00 draft is 
substantively identical to my further-revised Section 5.4 (with subsections A 
and B) that I forwarded to you a few days after Jeff's note to Calpine.

 From our meeting this morning I understand that Jeff appears adverse to 
Transwestern's claiming zero financial responsibility for damages to 
Calpine's Measurement and Control Facilities that result from TW's O&M 
Services.  Consequently, I made some modifications to Articles 4 and 5 of the 
3/20/00 draft for TW management's consideration.  These changes are noted in 
the attached document marked ""CalpineO&M 10-18-00 edits to draft03-20-00"".  
With my 10-18-00 revisions, TW places a limit on its liability to Calpine for 
loss or damage incurred by Calpine due to TW's Services, including loss or 
damage to the existing M&C Facilities,  if and to the extent damage is caused 
by TW's negligent acts or omissions.  To complete my modification to Section 
5.3, TW is to insert the maximum aggregate amount of financial liability it 
is willing to assume in any contract year.  This amount could be the amount 
of Calpine's deductible on its property insurance coverage or a lesser 
amount.  Whatever the amount chosen, please remember that TW is self-insured 
for the first $2M, each occurrence.  Therefore, what is the amount of risk 
that TW is willing to pay out of its earnings if Calpine claims damage to its 
existing Facility due to TW's negligent operations?  That is the amount to 
insert in the blank space in Section 5.3.  

FYI, the changes in Sections 3.1 and 4.1 (b) and (c), and the striking of 
Section 4.1 (d) do not create any substantive changes to the 3/20/00 draft.  
I  made the latter changes for stylistic reasons and to correct typos and 
redundancies.  Please call me if you have any questions and to let me know 
the status of this document.  I have lost track of my notes on the status of 
TW Operations' review and approval of the list of Services included in 
Exhibit B; this needs to be determined by Jeff (or his designee) before the 
final definitive agreement is prepared for signing.

Subject: Draft- Operating Agreement

Chad,
Sorry it took so long to get back with you, but we've had some folks out 
(including me) on Spring Break with their kids.  Attached is a draft of the 
Operating Agreement covering TW's operation of the metering station.  It's 
pretty much a standard form agreement for TW, with the possible exception of 
the exhibit defining the operating parameters of the South Point plant.  As I 
mentioned to you in our meeting in Pleasanton, the operating parameters 
exhibit is a useful tool for both companies to assist in identifing some of 
the operating conditions the plant might encounter and the ability of TW to 
load follow those conditions.  I made a number of assumptions regarding the 
burn rates for your facilities, especially the base rate and minimum rates.  
You'll likely have to fine tune those numbers.   Also, I've yet to ask our 
engineers to secure the documentation necessary to complete Exhibit ""A"" from 
your 3rd party engineers.  We'll include it in the final version.  Please 
give me a call after you and your team has had a chance to review.  Thanks.

Sandra...)are expecting a baby in December so it will kind of be a ""last

never before experienced.  Pls keep that in mind.

It has been quite some time since you said you were going to return those 
items I brought you from Hong Kong.  I previously told you that I felt it was 
the right thing to do under the circumstances.  Given what has happened and 
what those items represent, I do not see how you could now feel it is 
appropriate to keep them or how you could possibly derive any enjoyment from 
them.  Pls let me know what you intend to do, and we can make appropriate 
arrangements.  Thanks.

Lorraine -- answers to some of your questions.

Questar Line 90 Company purchased the facilities from ARCO for a total of $38 
million.  At the time it made its FERC application, Questar Southern Trails' 
estimated cost of 1) purchasing the facilities from Line 90 Company and 2) 
converting the line to gas service via the construction of compressor 
stations and various pipeline replacements, realignments and extension:  155 
million.  I assume you want more detail so I'll have Mike Vannorden get the 
relevant exhibits.  

Southern Trails proposed to install 7 new compressor stations.  These are 
detailed on Table 1 in their application cover letter (on my desk if you want 
to take a look).  The various pipeline modifications they proposed to make 
are described in some detail on pages 12 - 16.

Available capacity:  120,000 Dth/day in West Zone; 87,500 in East Zone.

I will have Mike send you exhibits I believe might be of interest."

Denise -- can you order this for me?
Let me know if you need any info.

And a normal monitor & keyboard.

Susan,

I've spoke to our purchasing person, Karon O'gorman, about an order status in 
Omaha.  According to Karon, all purchasing from Omaha and Houston goes 
through her.  Therefore, if you need to order a new laptop, Karon can handle 
all of the arrangements for you.

Thanks,
Jeff Nguyen

Sugarbooger,

Looks like Continental is our best bet at $620 per ticket, which I'm assuming 
reflects the beginning of the official high season in C.R.  American is 
slightly lower but you have to go THRU MIAMI!  Ick!
There is a 9:30 a.m. out of Houston on 12/9 and the return trip from San Jose 
is at 8:10 a.m. (a 3 p.m. was also available).
They're holding the tickets for us; if we want them, we have to decide before 
COB tomorrow.

Muchos besos!
S."

Here's what I've added to my answer to address Ni's question.  Let me know if 
you have comments.
I'll have a final draft out shortly.

 Prior to the deadline for filing interventions, Transwestern received a 
request from Commission staff for clarification of the criteria for awarding 
of Shipper call options.  The procedure will be as follows:  an advance 
posting will specify the term of the available option, term of transportation 
service, transportation volume, and instructions for bidding.  Shipper call 
options will be awarded based upon the highest rate payable for the option 
component.  "

last part...if you really wanted to go somewhere by yourself, I know you 
would come back.  And I would miss you while you were gone!  I cannot imagine

Here is a very rough draft -- an outline, really -- of an answer to Indicated 
Shippers' protest.

Please provide comments as you see fit.  I will probably not have time to 
look at them until later in the afternoon tomorrow, at which time I will also 
do a lot more writing (i.e., making complete sentences, transitions, heading, 
conclusion, etc.).  In other words, of greatest interest to me right now are 
your ideas on the best way to rebut the Shippers' arguments (including 
identifying those that might be safe to ignore). 

Thank you!

Hello Dave.
 
My understanding is that FERC does not yet require electronic contracting, 
but that many pipelines do offer it voluntarily.  

Best regards,

Hi,...did I guess correctly as to your e-mail addresses?  If so, I have a
question....

Do you happen to know if there are FERC rules requiring interstate pipelines
(are you familiar with any?) to offer e-contracting (including e-signature)
to customers/shippers, or is it a discretionary service...... or not a
service at all?

Of course, I need to do my own legal research, but maybe you two know off
the top of your head.

Thanks, and cheers...

I regret to report that I just ended a very unproductive phone conversation 
with Mr. Hertzberg.  He thanked us for all our cooperation but politely 
declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to 
conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.  However, it sounded to me 
like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best.  He also sounded 
interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at 
FERC (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.  Obviously they are very 
leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their 
identity.  He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders.  Also, he mentioned 
that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney 
will be taking over in his absence.  That could be good, or it could be bad.  
Maybe Lorraine can sweet talk Meaders into at least citing us some cases from 
Hertzberg's memo.  At the very least, I hope he will show it to the Kinder 
Morgan lawyers."

Today the Commission issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in 
the PNM capacity docket.  As you recall, we asked for rehearing of the 
Commission's requirement that TW's acquisition of capacity be limited to the 
summer months.  The tolling order is simply FERC's way of buying time to 
consider our request.  In the absence of Commission action within 30 days of 
our rehearing request, our request would have been deemed denied...so we're 
doing well so far.   There is no deadline for the Commission to act on our 
request.  I'll watch to see whether it appears on the Commission's agenda."

Ted, here are a few suggested changes.
Also, regarding the language you crossed out at the bottom of paragraph 1 
(about notice of default, payment within 15 days, etc.), I do not think that 
language was objectionable from a legal standpoint, and might actually be 
helpful as far as giving them a payment deadline.  However, if it's 
inconsistent with your procedures, or you just don't like having to give them 
notice, I see no problem at all with crossing it out.

Susan,

 Please review the following guaranty sent to us by Peoples Energy Corp 
(PEC).  PEC and ENA will each guaranty 50% of the obligations of Enovate ( I

 Please review and let me know if it is acceptable or make necessary changes.

Glen, as we discussed, here is the negotiated rate TW deal which TK did today 
under Rate Schedule ITS-1.
The term is ONE DAY, Nov. 15. 
Quantity:  30,000 Dth/day

I know this is a bit unusual.  We are just going to have to ask the FERC for 
a waiver of their ""before gas flows"" filing requirement.
Given the price spreads and the shippers' willingness to pay more than max. 
rates for short-term deals, we might have more deals like this.  We probably 
need to put our heads together to come up with a better procedure for when 
this happens.  It would be so much better if we were able to send tariff 
sheets via e-mail to our D.C. office.

Call if you have questions or need anything.

Mary, I finally was able to locate my copy of the Alternative Rates Policy 
Statement and found the following language:

""A pipeline may file the numbered tariff sheet implementing the negotiated 
rate at the time it intends the rate to
   go into effect. The Commission does not intend to suspend the 
effectiveness of negotiated rate filings or
   impose a refund obligation for those rates. For these reasons, the 
Commission will readily grant requests to
   waive the 30 day notice requirement.""

I think it might be fair to interpret the first sentence such that it's OK to 
file on the same day.  This reinforces my belief that 
our waiver language is fine as is."

On November 2, 2000, the California PUC issued an Order Instituting 
Investigation into the adequacy of Sempra's, SoCal's and SDG&E's planning of 
SoCal's and SDG&E's gas transmission system and what measures should be taken 
to correct any deficiencies.  The parties have been ordered to appear and 
show cause at a hearing (to be scheduled by the assigned ALJ) demonstrating 
that:

 - SDG&E has adequate gas and transmission supply for the 2000/2001 winter 
heating season, as well as the longer term throughout the year.  If such 
supply is not adequate, SDG&E shall submit plans for obtaining an adequate 
supply.

 - SDG&E's gas and transmission supply is adequate to meet anticipated need 
for gas-fired electric generation.  If not, SDG&E shall submit plans for 
obtaining adequate supply.

 - SDG&E's  gas transmission service is not being adversely affected by 
interests of its corporate affiliates.

 - Recently added demands on SDG&E's capacity are not negatively impacting 
supply for SDG&E's customers, and are otherwise consistent with 
representations to the Commission.

 - SDG&E's current gas curtailment rules are just and reasonable; if not, 
SDG&E shall propose changes.

 A written response from the three parties on these issues is due on November 
22.  Other parties may file comments on the response within 10 days after the 
response is filed.

 The Commission also ordered SDG&E to evaluate whether an interim, 
interruptible program, which will provide cost incentives to those customers 
voluntarily electing interruptible service, is needed this winter.  If so, 
SDG&E must submit a proposal for expedited Commission consideration.

 The OII represents the Commission's response to an Advice Letter filed by 
SDG&E requesting emergency review and approval of its proposal to temporarily 
revise the gas transportation service level elections of its large electric 
generation customers.  The Advice Letter was heavily protested and was 
withdrawn by SDG&E.

 In my conversation with Mark Baldwin regarding our pending consulting 
agreement for monitoring California regulatory matters for Transwestern, I 
asked him to watch for Sempra's Nov. 22 filing and to advise whether he 
believes Transwestern should file comments or appear at the hearing that is 
to be scheduled.  I will follow up with Mark, and provide you with a copy of 
the filing.

From astrology.com (must I beware of overindulgence in such websites?)
I like the part about charm and charisma and think it is very true.

Sagittarius and Sagittarius
When two Sagittarians join together in a love match, the truth-loving natures 
makes theirs a near perfect relationship. This couple views the world around 
them with an educated eye and both share an intense hunger for more 
knowledge. They will engage one another in pleasant conversation and 
banter that challenges and tickles the mind.  An occasional hotheaded dispute 
can erupt in the Sagittarius-Sagittarius relationship, when one fact-fanatic 
Sag 
partner carries things a little too far. Easygoing and independent, these two 
are 
compatible when it comes to balancing personal interests. They've never known 
jealousy, and each partner keeps busy with personal projects when not with 
their 
lover. When they are together, however, they do all they can toward pleasing 
their partner and satiating common interests.  Although they are adaptable 
and 
modern, they can, at times, fly off the handle. However, it is not in the 
Archer's 
nature to hold a grudge or let disagreements fester very long. 

Sagittarius is ruled by the Planet Jupiter (Luck). Expansion is the key word 
here; 
as both partners enjoy the acquisition of knowledge, they will carry over 
exciting 
ideas into their relationship. They must be mindful of over-indulgences, as 
such 
gluttony will only distract them. Their charm and charisma make them a very 
pleasant couple not only to one another, but the entire crowd. "

First of all, this is a brand-new contract, not a modification of one that 
used to be IT.
It's for LFT space that we have posted according to our usual procedure.  A 
receipt point has now been specified:  Bloomfield Compressor.  Our tariff 
allows us to cancel LFT up to 10 days a month, but it also provides that the 
parties can agree that the number of days can be fewer, so Sempra negotiated 
us down to only one day.  TK worked with Darrell Schoolcraft on this and they 
determined this would be acceptable from an operational standpoint.  
Scheduling will happen pursuant to the LFT priority set forth in our tariff.
I left a message for you just now; call when you have a minute.

Susan, MKM's got some good questions about this.  I'm still nervous as a cat 
about the deals, so please give me a call Mon. AM and let me know what you 
know about the scheduling priority and how it has changed now that this is an 
LFT deal.  DF

We really do need to understand the scheduling of this,  if alternates 
haven't been scheduled, IT are and now an LFT---  seems a little 
questionable, so we need to understand the answer.  Also without knowing the 
receipt point how do we know the deal can be done as LFT??  MK

 Susan:
 What a nice surprise seeing you the other evening in Houston. You look 
wonderful and it appears that life is agreeing with you. As we briefly 
discussed, I'm in the Firm's Houston office almost weekly working on client 
matters and client development. It would be great to catch-up with you and 
take you to lunch or to have a cocktail sometime soon. I'm in Houston on 
Monday and Tuesday of this week (11/ 20 &21). Are you around/available? Let 
me know.

         Best regards,
         Demetrius

Bryan, 

Are you still having a great time?  So what is Bali like?  The only images I 
can summon are Gauguin's paintings, but weren't those of Tahiti?  

Things are pretty good here.  Lots of Christmas parties, lots of Christmas 
cheer, etc.  Not a whole lot going on at the office, for a change.  Really, 
though, I think I would much rather be in Bali.  

Take care.

About three weeks ago, I inquired about EBA's  interest in organizing a 
concurrent session at the upcoming IAEE (International  Association for 
Energy Economics) conference in Houston (April  2001).
?
Since I did not hear back from you, I assume that  EBA was not 
interested.??It would help us a lot in our future planning  if you could 
perhaps help me with your reasoning.??Did we approach you  too late?(given 
the Dec 4 deadline)??  We required all participants to pay registration fees, 
was that an issue??  We couldn't guarantee you a slot even if you proposed a 
session, was that an  issue?
?
Thanks in advance for your response.

Subject: Proposal to Caithness Big Sandy

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.

This would be analogous to every time you send me an e-mail, I forward it 
directly to Drew and Maria.  How do you tactfully advise your coworkers about 
corporate etiquette?  I wonder.
On a substantive note, I sincerely believe the analysis MKM wants is beyond 
the scope of this letter, and would have no qualms about sending it.

Now do you see why I didn't want to send this to Keith Petersen???  Anytime 
you send anything to Omaha, the MKM cult goes into their Satan worship 
chamber, they sing a few chants, and then sacrifice the good commercial 
effort to the demon regulatory god.  

Jeez, next time I'm gonna just send it out to the customer and ask for 
forgiveness later.

Subject: Order on TW Options

I just received a call from Nancy Bagot informing me that FERC has issued a 
draft order suspending our proposed Transport Options tariff sheets until May 
1, 2001 and accepting them subject to the outcome of a technical conference.  
The technical conference is to take place within 120 days of the order and 
will address issues raised in protests.
I should be receiving a copy of the draft order soon.  Please call or e-mail 
me if you have questions.

As to your question about what's going on in California, I've done some 
reading and here are my thoughts.

The Nov. 1 FERC order in Docket No. EL00-95-000, in which the Commission 
ordered a $150/MWh price cap (among other things), was predicated on the 
Commission's authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.  
Specifically, the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that ""any rate, 
charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule, 
regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge or 
classification"" is unjust or unreasonable, the Commission shall determine the 
just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, 
or contract that should be in effect.  The Commission recognized that certain 
areas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction, but 
""fixed"" the areas within its jurisdiction.   Apparently the California 
governor agrees with me that the Commission's jurisdiction in the area of 
wholesale electricity prices is questionable...

In any event, if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate 
the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, its 
authority to do so would be much clearer.  The Natural Gas Act expressly 
authorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just 
and reasonable.  ""Just and reasonable"" has been interpreted in many different 
contexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means.  
As we all know too well, the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably.  
However, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3 
above-max-rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiated 
rate deal, struck within a pipeline's tariff authority, to be unjust and 
unreasonable.  The California proceeding was initiated after entire 
communities of individual consumers suffered 200-300% increases in their 
electricity bills.  The prices for electricity in California were outrageous 
across the board and affected everyone in the state.  By contrast, TW's 
transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices 
and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not 
widespread enough for anyone to notice.  It is far from being a consumer 
issue, and besides, the elections are over.  However, as you and I have 
already discussed, we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice just 
about everything and who might try to draw it to FERC's attention.  We do 
need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing the 
same types of deals.  Kathy, why don't you and I discuss a system of 
monitoring the contract information postings of El Paso, Kern, PGT/NW.  Drew, 
obviously I've only scratched the surface here so let's talk if you want a 
more in-depth report.

That is by far the best line of the day!!  Unconscionability may be the thing 
I'm remembering , but I think there is some more specific law related to 
market dislocations--i.e., the Hurricane example.  Its sort of a twist on 
market power law--i.e., if the fates hand you short term market power, you 
better not use it.  DF

I know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided because 
they are ""unconscionable.""  There are several examples in consumer law and 
employment law, in which one contracting party is a corporation and the other 
is a West Palm Beach voter.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, none 
of them involve contracts between 2 sophisticated business entities such as 
TW and Sempra or PG&E.  Absent evidence of fraud, courts uphold bargains 
struck at arms length.  
Kathy, I'd be happy to take the oars on this but if you've already done some 
looking, please let me know if you've found anything.

Subject: gouging

Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.  Stan has asked Mike Moran if 
TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under ""anti 
gouging"" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df

For your information.  The outcome was great for TW because the Cal. PUC 
adopted our receipt point proposal, eliminating the danger of mandated 
restriction of TW's deliveries to the California border.  The outcome is not 
so great for Enron overall because they rejected our proposed settlement.  
The receipt point proposal was able to survive since it was part of both of 
the competing settlements.  
I'm still trying to get thru the whole order; let me know if you have 
questions.

Subject: Bad Proposed Decision

Well, this shows the direction in which the ""new"" Commission is heading.  The 
very good news, though, is that  TW's proposal was included in both 
settlements (now that's hedging!).  Thus,  the benefits to TW were preserved 
under both proposals.  Congratulations.  That's fantastic--hard work that 
paid off.

We will of course express out extreme dissappointment with the PD, and point 
out that this decision condemns California to a 20th century infrastructure, 
when the state's 21st century economy demands much, much better.  

We should discuss.  Since the PD empowers the likes of Norm and Florio, it 
will be important to play very close attention to implementation of Hector.

Sorry to have to be the one to deliver the news.   But we have a knack of 
making lemonade out of lemons and we'll do out best to do the same here, 
whatever turns up at the end.

Best,
Jeff

The PD in the Gas Restructuring is out.   I have yet to read the whole
thing, but the title ""Approval With Modifications Of The Interim

have Steve's statement second hand), the decision reflects a fear that the
timing is wrong in light of the current volatile gas price market.

Remember we need to make a filing for our BP Energy deal, which becomes 
effective Dec. 1.  (Mary, I think you and I talked about this several weeks 
ago).  The contract simply includes a right of first refusal for BP Energy.  
The contract is such that the shipper would not have been entitled to a ROFR 
under our tariff, which is why it's a material deviation.
The filing will simply need to reference a tariff sheet on which the contract 
provision is described.
Let me know if you need anything (a copy of the contract, for instance).
I have a conf. call from 2 to 3 but otherwise should be available if you want 
to give me a call."

Maria and Drew, this is a long-winded e-mail but please bear with me...

The problem:

As you probably remember, several months ago several of us met to discuss the 
following language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern's tariff: ""if the rate 
bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be 
the maximum tariff rate,"" and the additional frustrating language ""[a]ll 
available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures . . ..""  At our 
last meeting, we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could 
capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate 
to index prices.  However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount 
of risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven't done any 
index-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals.  I 
have been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of 
other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum 
rate.   Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I've quoted above.  
However, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical 
change in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that TW 
lacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language.

Why the problem exists (you may already know):

Steve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in 
the first place.  In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement (RM95-6-000), the 
Commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for 
negotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a 
cost-of-service based tariff rates.  ""[T]he availability of a recourse 
service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that 
the customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline 
unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service.  Thus, the 
recourse rate mitigates market power.""  

The Commission went on to confirmed that under ROFR provisions the highest 
rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its 
transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate. This policy is clearly 
not limited to ROFR situations:  when capacity is constrained, a shipper 
willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely 
because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate.  ""When there are 
more requests for capacity than there is capacity available, then the 
pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either 
the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate, for example on a pro rata 
basis if required by its tariff.""  The example cited by the Commission:  If a 
pipeline has 100 Dth/d available and two shippers request that capacity, one 
who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of $5 and another a 
negotiated rate of $6, then each would be allocated 50 Dth/d on a pro rata 
basis (assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some 
other allocation method such as lottery).  

When TW filed for authority to charge negotiated rates, it voluntarily added 
the statement that ""if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the 
rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate.""  Presumably we had 
concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order 
to receive negotiated rate authority.  

Solutions??

I would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language 
outright is probably out of the question.  I feel as if I've really been 
chasing my tail here.  I have owed Lindy an answer for some time now.  But I 
keep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power (which, Drew, is 
where I believe you were headed when we talked about this in mid-October).  
Steve Harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the 
recourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system.  I think we would still 
have to show lack of market power in order to do this.  Do you agree?  Stojic 
warns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive 
proposition.  Might be worth it to us, though.

Another idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more 
than max rate.  After all, we do have authority to charge negotiated rates.  
We've seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more 
than max rates for IT space based on good customer relations alone.  However, 
despite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers, it's unlikely 
we can pull this off with any consistency.  We wondered whether we might be 
able to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure.  But 
I just am not convinced we could get around the Commission's requirement that 
recourse rates be available.  That requirement has not changed.  Have either 
of you seen anything to the contrary?  

I would like to meet with you two, plus several others I have in mind, to 
discuss this, preferably early this week (Tues. or Wed.), but would like to 
discuss briefly with you first.  Please call me so we can talk for a few 
minutes.  Thanks.

Subject:  24th IAEE International Conference




About three weeks ago, I inquired about EBA's  interest in organizing a
concurrent session at the upcoming IAEE (International  Association for
Energy Economics) conference in Houston (April  2001).

Since I did not hear back from you, I assume that  EBA was not interested.
It would help us a lot in our future planning  if you could perhaps help me
with your reasoning.  Did we approach you  too late (given the Dec 4
deadline)?   We required all participants to pay registration fees, was
that an issue?   We couldn't guarantee you a slot even if you proposed a
session, was that an  issue?

Thanks in advance for your response.

Hi Ashley!  A couple of things.  First of all, my new renter, Doug, wonders 
whether he can just call the utilities & phone and transfer from his name to 
yours (rather than you cancelling and him having to pay any re-hookup fees 
that may apply).   I don't know how it would work; maybe he could conference 
you in when he makes the calls.  For what it is worth, he is a very nice guy 
to deal with, but it is totally up to you and I really don't care one way or 
the other. 

Also, I'm having someone come clean the place so you needn't worry about it, 
in case you were wondering.  I will take care of it (it looks pretty clean 
anyway!).  

Please let me know your new address and I will send you your deposit refund 
next week.

Merci!

Susan"

Doug, Ashley's e-mail address is in the cc line if you want to get in touch 
with her.  I hadn't thought that she might have had to put down a refundable 
deposit (rather than a hookup fee) for some of the utilities so logistically 
switching to your name might not be worthwhile, but it may be worth asking.  
Remember I have water covered.  Call or e-mail if you have questions!"

Date, time, and either of those places are fine with me, subject to
Frazier's availability.  This would be a good opportunity to discuss topics

I also need to share with you some conversations I've been having with folks

really look at it.  As for future matters, what will be our involvement for
EBA-Houston events?  Would the two of you like to get together for lunch
sometime, maybe with Frazier and the other current EBA officers so we can

Let's plan on Friday before Christmas!  And Craig will join us, I'm sure.  
Please stay over at my place that night.  That way you would not have to 
worry about driving all the way back to Tomball after partying downtown -- 
and we'd get to visit longer! 
Right now I'm home with some nasty bug that's been going around the office.  
It is a big drag.  Sheila came down with pneumonia right after Thanksgiving, 
and had to be hospitalized!  I think I should count myself lucky I only have 
the office bug.  She is back home now, and begging me not to make the trip to 
Austin.  Sounds like she is feeling a lot better.
We're having a surprise party for Craig's 40th on Friday!  I don't know 
whether he suspects anything...
Time for more cough medicine!

Yeah! I am really looking forward to our trip to Houston this year! Got you 
message over Thanksgiving, hope you had a great (long) weekend! We stayed in 
town and helped out at the Santa Monica Civic Center then tried to find a 
turkey dinner to eat... nothin' like eatin' at a restaurant for 
Thanksgiving... :(

We are planning to arrive in Houston on Thursday the 21st and return back to 
LA on Tuesday the 26th. We'd love to get together with you (and your beau?) 
on Friday if you're still in town and are available! Mark and I love to trek 
downtown and see how the rest of the city lives outside of North Houston. Let 
me know if that works for you.

Hope you're having a good week. Talk to you soon, Sue

Subject: Proposed Decision

The GD article today regarding the proposed decision is a pretty good Reade=
rs=20
Digest version of the order.  Susan and I spoke with Jeff Dasovich and Mark=
=20
Baldwin yesterday, and the consensus of those conversations was that=20
Transwestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of=
=20
implementation/documentation.  Jeff offered that he might send a letter to=
=20
Governor Gray's office expressing both dismay and indignation that the CPUC=
=20
didn't complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to California=
=20
ratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved.  He may ask the other=
=20
Comprehensive Settlement parties to join in signing the letter.  Susan, Mar=
k=20
and I spoke about this idea later, and we've got some reservations about TW=
's=20
role in admonishing the CPUC.   We should probably wait to see this letter=
=20
first before committing to anything.

Bilas draft cautious toward SoCal competition
Mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state, California=
=20
Public Utilities
Commissioner Richard Bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more=20
moderate
approach to promoting competition on Southern California Gas=01, (SoCal) sy=
stem.
In his draft decision, Bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundlin=
g=20
of intrastate
transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case, th=
e=20
less far-reaching
Interim Settlement (IS), submitted in December 1999. SoCal, San Diego Gas a=
nd=20
Electric and
other parties filed two more settlements after the IS, reaching a=20
comprehensive agreement in
April this year.

But since then, gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state, prompting a=
=20
consumer
backlash and giving competition a bad name.  The draft language notes that=
=20
the first interim
settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements.
Recent events =01&lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this=20
investigation, the unbundling
of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm,=20
tradable intrastate transmission rights, should be delayed,=018 according t=
o the=20
draft order.  =01&This unbundling is the basis of the [comprehensive settle=
ment]=20
and we cannot approve it. We do not, however, wish to commit to paralysis=
=20
until 2006, as the [post-interim settlement] would have us do. Accordingly,=
=20
we believe Californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption,=
=20
with modifications, of the IS.=018

The biggest change to the IS in the draft is the rejection of an automatic=
=20
capacity expansion
by SoCal at Wheeler Ridge, Calif., with rolled-in rates if certain criteria=
=20
are met.  El Paso
Energy had objected to the provision in the IS that would have allowed SoCa=
l=20
to automatically
expand capacity at Wheeler Ridge by 100 million cfd if a certain number of=
=20
curtailments oc-curred. =20
El Paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at Wheele=
r=20
when only certain customers would benefit. =20
The draft says SoCal can file a separate application for the Wheeler Ridge=
=20
expansion, but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing proce=
ss.

The draft decision would also:
=01=07 End SoCal=01,s current =01&windowing=018 process, which limits shipp=
ers=01, ability to=20
change nominations
for deliveries between receipt points on the system. It is replaced with an=
=20
announced
daily calculation of capacity available at each receipt point;
=01=07 Establish Hector Road as a formal receipt point for nominations;
=01=07 Institute an operational flow order (OFO) procedure. Provides a foru=
m for=20
more changes
in OFO procedures if excessive OFOs are made;
=01=07 Set up =01&pools=018 of gas on the SoCal transmission system that ar=
e intended to=20
increase the
liquidity of gas trading;
=01=07 Make changes to balancing rules, while retaining the current 10% mon=
thly=20
imbalance
tolerance;
=01=07 Make SoCal=01,s own gas acquisition unit subject to the same balanci=
ng rules=20
and penalties
as all other shippers;
=01=07 Allow some limited imbalances trading, as well as the right to assig=
n and=20
reassign unbundled
storage contract in a secondary market, with a SoCal electronic bulletin=20
board set up
for it;
=01=07 Unbundle from core transportation rates the storage capacity cost ex=
ceeding=20
that required
for core minimum reliability; and
=01=07 Provide for rate recovery of up to $3.5 million in implementation co=
sts.

In addition, the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from=
=20
rates, eliminate
core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges, elimina=
te=20
the core subscription
option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs.  The threshold fo=
r=20
participating in
core aggregation is reduced, and billing options are offered to core=20
aggregators.

Bilas=01, draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years =
to=20
open another
investigation into gas competition, taking into account any changes in mark=
et=20
conditions.
Bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft=
.
=01&The cost of gas as a commodity has vastly increased at the border, show=
ing a=20
differential
between the basin and border prices that is more than the cost of transport=
=20
and related services;
we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by markete=
rs=20
if more competition is allowed,=018=20
Bilas wrote in the draft decision.  =01&With half the state already committ=
ed to=20
a
restructured competitive natural gas industry, it suddenly seems as if the=
=20
benefits of such re-
structuring to enhance competition are speculative, particularly at this=20
time.  With one leg in the
water, the current has switched direction and it will be difficult, if not=
=20
foolhardy, to reach our
goals by forging ahead.

=01&We choose to take a cautious approach again,=018 the draft continues. =
=01&Rather=20
than proceeding
to unbundle transmission in Southern California now, we approve, with=20
modifications, the settle-
ment suggesting smaller steps towards a competitive market. Additionally, w=
e=20
unbundle core
interstate transmission and once again urge the Legislature to pass consume=
r=20
protection legisla-
tion aimed at unregulated marketers while we facilitate growth in core=20
aggregation programs.=018
The CPUC would not rule out the unbundling of intrastate transmission and=
=20
other restruc-
turing in the future =01&but believe that at this point in time the certain=
=20
benefits do not outweigh
the costs to most ratepayers.=018

All drafts must be filed 30 days before the meetings at which they will be=
=20
discussed. The
draft decision is currently on the agenda for the CPUC=01,s Dec. 21 meeting=

Steve and Lindy, as I mentioned in our staff meeting, it is probably not=20
going to be possible to solve our max rate cap dilemma by making a tariff=
=20
filing unless we can 1) get FERC to change its mind about its policy that=
=20
recourse rates always be available as an alternative to negotiated rates or=
=20
2) prove that Transwestern lacks market power and should therefore be allow=
ed=20
to charge market based rates.

The following is a very brief outline of what would be required to prove la=
ck=20
of market power.  A warning:  lack of market power is very difficult to=20
prove.  Koch, a pipeline that most in the industry would agree does lack=20
market power, tried and failed.  The deck is already stacked against us in=
=20
TW's case given the withholding of capacity by El Paso's affiliate and the=
=20
price conditions in California.  However, we do need to analyze the=20
possibilities for TW, if not to the Cal. border, then on other parts of our=
=20
system.  Additionally, we need to discuss acceptable incentives for shipper=
s=20
to pay negotiated rates if we do not end up changing our tariff.

Would you be availabile on Tuesday to discuss this?  Please let me know.  I=
n=20
the meantime, here is a summary of FERC's policy on market based rates.

***

To obtain authority to charge market based rates, TW would first have to=20
request a declaratory order, and in its application provide information=20
showing it meets the requirements outlined below.  If the Commission finds=
=20
all requirements have been met, it will issue an order and TW would then ma=
ke=20
the appropriate tariff filing to put market based rates into effect.
=20
Application for declaratory order must include:

1.  Detailed description of the services proposed for market-based rate=20
treatment.  I assume in our case it would be firm transportation service.

2.  A statement defining the relevant product and geographic markets=20
necessary for establishing the applicant lacks market power with respect to=
=20
the services at issue.  The Commission requires a narrow definition of the=
=20
market=01(""firm transportation"" is probably narrow enough, but for our purp=
oses=20
we might want to narrow it down more (i.e., firm transportation East of=20
Thoreau).  We have to define substitute services available to shippers=01(o=
ther=20
pipelines are a ""good substitute"" only if shippers can obtain the same=20
quality of service on a timely basis, and if the other pipelines offer such=
=20
service at a price that would deter TW from raising its prices more than=20
10%.  All relevant ""origin markets"" must be defined (Panhandle; West Texas)=
=20
as well as ""destination markets,"" and alternatives for shippers in those=20
markets identified.  Transportation alternatives are only good alternatives=
=20
if they provide a netback to shippers that is roughly the same as if they=
=20
used TW.  Note that the Commission has rejected capacity release as a good=
=20
alternative since it does not guarantee a shipper its desired contract=20
quantity.

3.  Market share and HHI calculations; discussion of other relevant=20
competitive factors.  Commission looks at size of market share, mitigating=
=20
factors such as ease of entry, and market concentration as measured by HHI.=
 =20
Market concentration has to be calculated for each relevant receipt point a=
nd=20
delivery point.  HHI is calculated by adding up the total market share and=
=20
squaring it.  There is a presumption of no ease of entry for transportation=
=20
services  because of the expense involved in constructing facilities.

4.  Proposal for accounting for costs and revenues."

Well, I have definitely taken a turn for the worse -- lots of drainage and 
coughing up green/yellow stuff.  No fever at all, though.  I go to the doctor 
tomorrow and hopefully will be on the road to recovery before Saturday.  

Received Jim's capilene shirts; they are nice.  But I wanted to double check 
with you to make sure I got the right ones -- he wanted the medium-weight 
ones that are sort of like long-sleeved t-shirts, right?  The reason I am 
asking is that Patagonia also makes a capilene that is more like a fleece 
fabric and comes in a v-neck style...

I will hold off on the bathtub spa for Mema.  The last thing I want to do is 
buy her something she does not need!  Will stick to my pedicure gift 
certificate idea.  

So glad you are doing better.  Too bad there was a delay in the flu vaccine 
this year or we both could have avoided a lot of trouble!

We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.

The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge 
a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I 
agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What 
exactly do we mean by ""no additional cost...unless through the allocation 
process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel""??   Can 
someone help me with this?

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would 
say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  
However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our 
language.  Or they could tell us to remove the ""subject to transportation and 
fuel"" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and 
fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  
However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the 
language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  
Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

Should we respond to PNM's protest of the dollar valuation of imbalances 
prior to netting and trading?  Did we already respond to this issue when they 
filed their protest of the 637 filing?  DF

Shelley, I can take a stab at pulling together TW-related information today 
and will run it by Jeff to see whether he has anything to add.  I am leaving 
on vacation Saturday and have a lot of other work to finish up here before I 
go.  Therefore it might be best to bring in someone else from 
legal/regulatory to pull up the info for El Paso, Kern, etc.

Subject: Calif. Performance Issues

With concerns about curtailments and force majuere events in California, 
Steve Kean has asked for the preparation of study of all possible types of 
disruptions (e.g. curtailment, diversion, penalties, etc,) in the gas chain 
flowing to Calif and who bears the legal/financial liability for each event.  
Specifically, he has asked if ETS can assemble a description of such 
provisions for the pipes delivering to Calif.

In particular, he wants a summary of following:

Curtailment - When do pipelines curtail? 
Curtailment compensation
Imbalance Provisions
Penalties/OFOs
Allocations (For El Paso Only)

Help!  Do you guys have any materials explaining these provisions?  Steve 
wants this all pulled together by Friday.

Subject: Behavioral Profile of Risk Management Personnel

I want to recap our understanding of the key cultural/behavioral attributes 
that you said were important to interview for.      If you want to add to 
this please don't hesitate to do so.   We will form a questionnaire tailored 
to your group's needs. 

The right candidate will desire an environment that will challenge them with 
new situations on a constant day to day basis.   This person would become 
bored and restless with routine.   This person would also enjoy learning at a 
relatively fast and voluminous rate. 
The candidate will rarely lose a train of thought despite interruptions and 
can return to the point at which a discussion or idea was disrupted.   There 
are techniques as well as questions that can address this. 
The person must indicate a high degree of dependability, endurance, 
follow-through, and persistence.   They must be equipped with an ability to 
cope with adversity and be willing to do what it takes to get it done.    
They must not be adverse to working beyond the 45hr week.    It is difficult 
for the candidate to create a story that combines examples of all of these 
traits unless it truly happened.   If they have these traits, they have used 
them in the past. 
Relatively thick skinned.   How do they accept criticism and/or reprimands?   
A desire to be in control of situations is also a desirable trait.  These 
applicants must want to make decisions and control outcomes almost all of the 
time.   Not to be confused with micro-managers or control freaks 
(yeah-buts).   
Lastly, they must have an entrepreneurial focus.    They need to be the 
people that make it happen, with possibilities but without guarantees  of 
personal gain, a desire to take ultimate responsibility, and influence others 
to get it done and make them feel good about it.   The how, what, when, 
where, and why of being in a leadership role. 

We will start formulating the questions and the order in which they should be 
asked today.   Do you have any candidates in the near future?   We would be 
glad to help you with interviewing tips.

Lillian, please see the attached authorization memo.  It is still in draft 
form, but since time is of the essence, Geneva advised me to forward it to 
you now so that you could start working on it.  We would like to have the new 
company formed today if possible.  I will let you know if I make any changes

OK, here's my 2 cents' worth:

Avale Corp.
I also like Enable.
I think either one would look fine on an EBB list of customers...

Also -- any name we choose could include the words Capacity Management.  But 
I'm not sure we want to or need to be that descriptive.

Just so you can see how this is evolving...
I think we should steer clear of anything involving Energy Services because 
it sounds like we are buying/selling gas.
I've instructed the commercial group to get back to you with a name.  When 
they do, let Lillian Bailey know (x33577).  That is really the only 
information she still needs from us, I think.  
I'm reachable at 713-494-5002 for the rest of today.

Contrary to popular belief I am alive...The 22nd works for me too (although 
given my current work situation I'm sure I'd be late - better late than 
never, right?)  Anyway, both of the current suggestions sound good ( I've 
been to Benji's - great food and heard really good things about Ousie's table 
as well).  

But Laura was right, Lisa is currently my social planner - how scarey is 
that? - so she'll make sure I know what's going on.

Can't wait to see you guys,
Susan

Girls-
Thank you for the responses.  So far it has been overwhelmingly
positive!  I really can't wait to get us all together.  Emily had
suggested Ousies's Table-as well as a coworker of mine.  Yesterday
during our lunch break we went and looked at Ousies's and it seems
pretty cute.  Unfortunately they were not open, but I heard they light
it up at night and it is supposed to be really pretty.  The other
suggestion is Benji's.  Lis-you made a good point.  It would be nice to
try somewhere new.
I have not heard from Sarah or Kelly-so if you talk to them-please pass
them the message.  I know Kelly usually checks her email, but I am not
sure about Sarah.  If anyone has a number for her-let me know.  I also
haven't heard from Susan Scott-so Lisa- you are in charge of that.
Ashley-I know you've gotten this message-so reply!  : )
Corinne-Sorry that you will not be able to make it. : (  If anything
changes-let us know.
Jen's flight comes in around 7 that night-so I thought we would make the
reservations for 8-830 so she has time to make it.
Let me know what ya'll think.
-Laura

As it appears I will be living and breathing the 32nd floor of the Enron 
building well through the first of the year, I've decided to break down and 
try to maintain my friendships via email.  You all know me well enough to 
know that this a huge step on my part ( I am not the world's best emailer).  
Anyway, I feel like I'm out of touch with what's going on in your collective 
lives and am thus missing out on some pretty wonderful, exciting and special 
things.  So when and if any of you get a chance shoot me back a quick note 
and let me know what's new in your life.

Love you guys,
Susan

Jennifer - Hope work is going well.  I know this time of year has got to be 
crazy for anyone in your line of work, but I'm sure you're handling it well.  
We really need to go grab coffee, dinner, a movie or something soon.  I'm in 
need of a good chat.

Jessica - I know you're in the midst of finals right now and probably about 
to pull your hair out.  Just focus on the fact that they'll be over soon and 
you'll be off to London to see Ashley and Lee ( I am so jealous).  Please 
tell Clay I say hello and wish him good luck as well on y'alls exams.

Lisa - Hey sweetie!  I am so sorry I couldn't make it to your shower in SA, 
but Jen said it went really well.  We need to get together soon I've missed 
seeing you and especially hearing about the wedding and all the fun goings 
ons in your life.  Tell Brad I say ""Hi"" and I'll be glued to the TV set just 
like him on the on the 29th rooting on the Horns.

Emily - I really want to hear how your Thanksgiving went with Thomas and the 
""Fam"".  Knowing Thomas it went great and your entire family (especially your 
Mom) is absolutely in love with him.  Keep me posted on your plans for the 
future ( I'm curious where you're going to end up geographically).  Also, I 
thought you'd find it interesting that I may have an opportunity to work in 
your old hometown - Chicago.  Any thoughts?

Elizabeth - I have really been out of touch with you and I am very mad at 
myself for letting that happen.  Please write back soon and let me know how 
school, your family and this new man in your life ( okay, I'm not completely 
out of touch) are all doing.  My guess is you're going through exams as well 
right now so I'll wish you the best of luck and infinite success."

The book code is ALWAYS - XZ.  As for trade dates, that is not one of the 
fields I fill in for the exotics spreadsheet and I don't think that's 
something we'd really want to add as the file already takes up an extremely 
large amout of memory.

Hey Bronwyn,

I just realized I never emailed you back ( I am a bad, bad person).  Glad to 
hear things are going well with you.  It was so neat to run into you in 
Houston, I see your brother around the building quite a bit but I don't think 
he recognizes me.  I'll have to make a point to reintroduce myself the next 
time I see him.  

So what's new with you?  Have you moved?  I know you were thinking about LA a 
while back...I've got a couple of friends from high school who are living out 
there and are really having a good time.  Anyway, I completely understand the 
urge to try something new.  I too am thinking of making a move before next 
summer ( I don't know exactly where, but somewhere outside of Texas...I 
really need to experience something different).  Speaking of which, Emily is 
in London going to graduate school right now.  I've already been to visit her 
once there and she's trying to talk me into moving over there.  I would 
actually love to go, if there was a job with Enron there that interested me.  

As for my dating life, it is relatively unchanged.  I was seeing one guy for 
a while, really liked him, things were going great ( I thought )...then he 
seemed to loose interest and decided 2 mos. into things to tell me he has 
issues and that he'd been married before.  Needless to say, that was pretty 
much the end of things.  It's made me a little hesitant when it comes to 
meeting new guys, but at the same time I had so much fun in the beginning 
that I'm still optimistic about my dating future.  How about you?

Concerning Kappa...I'll give you a run down on everyone I still keep in touch 
with.  Corey's in Law School at Texas ( doing great of course) and has 
already secured a clerkship with a federal judge in Galveston when she 
graduates.  Jessica Bateman is now Jessica Pulliam - and she too is in Law 
School at Texas and has secured a federal clerkship with a judge in Dallas 
when she graduates.  Elizabeth's is in Med School in San Antonio and dating a 
fellow med student there.  Stephanie Spence is now Stephanie Williams and is 
living and working in Dallas.  Lisa Meador is getting married next April to a 
guy from Texas ( he was a KA, there Brad Thealman (sp?) ) who is absolutely 
perfect for her.  That about sums it up, but if there's anyone else you're 
wondering about just ask...I can probably find out some scoop.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Hi Susan!  How are you?  It was so good seeing you when I was in Houston!  I 
really had tried to find out your e-mail address b/c I've often wondered what 
your were up to.  I'm glad to hear your enjoying work.  Are you happy to be 
back in Houston?  (I guess you've been back for awhile now...)  How's your 
family?  Do you still talk to Emily?

I've visited Houston every so often to see Ryan...I still always have the 
greatest time when I visit.  I'm trying to decide right now where I want to 
live.  I have the flexibility with my job to live wherever I choose, so I've 
been thinking about LA.  I'm torn though b/c I like Houston, too.  I'm 
thinking about just playing in LA for about a year and then probably settling 
down in Houston.  We'll see...

What else is going on with you?  Are you dating any one?  Do you still keep 
in touch with any Kappas?

Well, sorry for all the questions, but I can't wait to hear from 
you...hopefully, we can stay in touch!

Take care, Bronwyn

Hey K!  Thanks for the note.  Everyone is asking how you're doing.  Sorry to 
hear about your back; I know what it is like.  As much as you are inclined to 
run around and get things done, the thing that worked best for me with my 
back problem was just to recline as much as possible!  My house truly became 
a mess, but guess what, the world did not end.  

I really like your monosyllabic choices for names:  Kyle and Quinn.  For some 
reason I really like the name Elizabeth with both of those.  Perhaps because 
it balances out the unisex quality of the first name.  I think you really 
have to meet the baby before you decide for sure.  Who knows, she might turn 
out to be more of a Gladys!  heh, heh!

The landscapers are almost finished with my yard.  It looks really good.  I 
even have a little palm tree -- required for the Heights.  The last thing is 
to finish the driveway -- right now there are 20 tons of black star gravel 
sitting in the back yard!

Time to work.
Try to take it easy!  
S

Hey Susan! Sorry no e-mail lately. Things have been busy at work. I am also
tardy on my xmas thankyou notes so I'm hoping a computer one will suffice
for you! What would Miss Manners say? Needless to say we love all the stuff
you gave us. I am enjoying the knives - what a difference they make. No more
sawing!  Jim has worn his new shirt many times and loves the book. I too
thought it was a good Christmas, despite the pre-Christmas funk many of us
went through! It all turned out ok - even our time with Yvette wasn't so
bad!

Things are moving along in baby world. P-nut is moving downwards,
alleviating the pain in my ribs, but now causing sciatica (sp?)  in my right
hip and leg. I feel creaky and it hurts to walk. Not cool - I have too many
things left to do around the house to have to stay off my feet. Oh well. i
suppose it will all get done. We are still searching for the right name and
now need some input since we can't seem to make a decision between us. Here
are our latest choices in no particular order - Grayson, Kyle, Quinn,
Kendall, Lindsey, and Hayley (may be too popular). My favorite combination
is Grayson Scott Shelton. Jim likes Kyle Elizabeth Shelton or Kyle Alison.
Yes, we know Kyle is usually a boy's name, but we had a female intern at JRA
one summer named Kyle and I thought it was cool. One of my baby name books
has both Kyle and Quinn on the ""truly unisex names"" list. Any comments or
new suggestions are appreciated!

Must get going on work. Hope to hear from you soon.

Karin

I re-compiled Exotica.xll, so that the xcol function is a put on collar.

De-add in your Exotica. Add this special one. And use xcol for put.

Then delete the Exotica_xcol_putoncollar.xll

We will build in this functionality in near future.

Hey guys,

Just wanted to let you know that Kori Loibl has offered up her apartment as a 
Pre-party spot.  The financial desk will be there as well as Purvi & her 
boyfriend and  Mo ""the bomb"" Sanchez and her fianc,e John.  Don't know if you 
guys have any interest, but the offer's open.  Either way, we'll have to find 
someplace extend the festivities after the X-mas party shuts down...(the 
Black Swan, Eu-grope-a, etc).

Dan,

I am currently sitting in the Coal group's old area on 32.  While dealing 
with some computer issues Friday, I came across an expandable file full of 
Coal related documents buried beneath my desk.  The documents and contracts 
seem pretty old, which is why I assume no one has missed them.  Still, I 
wanted to contact you to see if you would like me to run them down rather 
than simply discard them.  If you could email or call me at x31455 and let me 
know what I should do with them I would appreciate it (as you know space is 
limited up here).

Thanks,

On January 13, 2000, FERC issued a Section 7(c) certificate for 
Transwestern's Gallup Expansion.  The Commission's order contained two 
conditions:  1) that Transwestern file its discounted rates within 15 days of 
the order, and 2) that Transwestern restructure its relationship with Enron 
Compression Services so that Transwestern will have sufficient operation 
control over the motor at the Gallup compressor station to assume regulatory 
responsibility for the motor's operation, and that Transwestern file a report 
with the Commission stating how it complied with this condition.  
Transwestern accepted the  certificate January 14, 2000 but reserved the 
right to seek rehearing or clarification of the order.  On January 18, 2000, 
Transwestern filed a motion for extension of time to comply with the 
condition that Transwestern file its discounted rates.  Transwestern has 
already filed with the Commission the discounted rates it will charge its 
expansion shippers, subject to a request for confidentiality.   Transwestern 
intends to file a request for rehearing of the January 13 order explaining 
why the Commission erred in ordering Transwestern to publicly disclose its 
discounted rates in advance of the normal time for making such disclosure 
through a discount report.  "

Larry, 

For some reason the mail router keeps rejecting the files I'm trying to send 
you (GDOpt&Swap and PipePos).  If you have access to the rest of the system 
here you should be able to get into the PipOpt folder with out any problems.  
If you don't end up coming in tomorrow I'll get with IT and try and figure 
out a way to email you these files.  Give me a call at 713-853-1455 if you 
need anything.

I went ahead and attached a copy of your P&L from Friday if you want to take 
a look at that.  I tried calling you with the number, but I never got an 
answer.  Also, there was a confirm that came in for you Friday with Amerex:  
They show you Buying a 1/day  BOM (12/2-12/31) HeHub Gas Daily $7.00 Call 
Option at $0.26.  The counterparty was Cinergy...Let me know if this is a 
good trade and we'll get it loaded into the system.

Susan,

Attached in the file are the testing results.

 Also you can run a script file to test more PID/deals if you'd like . This 
script file uses my modified version of PORTCALC, and  is on  UNIX,:
  ~stang/port_calc_test.csh you can go to my home  directory  ~stang, then 
type port_calc_test.csh PID and run it.

Let me know if you have any questions.

don't here from you via email/msngr  by the end of tonight I'm going to forge 
one and fax it to them.  Actually, I can do that regardless if you don't 
mind.  Just drop me a line and let me know what works for you.

Hope things are going well.  I actually worked 21 straight hours the other 
day/night (7:45 am Tuesday until 4:45 am Wednesday)...I think this 
constitutes cruel and unusual punishment."

If you could run the same valuation for Deal #'s QC1431.1 and QC1431.2 using 
Post-id 956785, we could verify that they changes you've made correctly value 
the basis offset whether a deal index flat or index +/- .  Call me if you

The deals included below are strictly index flat gas daily options.  I'm 
going to send Shouan an Index +/- deal as well so that he can verify that the

Hi Susan,

I changed the code so that it feeds the Ostrip model as Larry requested by 
using the formula to derive BasisOffset. In the attached file is the 
comparison between the old valuation and the one after the modification. 
Please note the changes on the premiums. Please let me know if you or Larry 
have any questions/comments on this.

Actually, if you don't expect me to keep up with you the whole 8K's, I could 
probably muster up the energy.  Besides, I'm planning on sleeping the entire 
way out there so I'll end up getting more sleep that night than normal.  Do I 
need to do anything to sign up for the run?

Okay, so here's the debate...There's a flight out Friday night leaving 
Houston at 11:00 pm and getting into SD around 2:20 in the morning.  The next 
earlier flight leaves Houston around 5:30 pm but unfortunately there's no way 
I could make that one because of  work.  The other option is to fly in 
Saturday morning like I did last time.  I'm leaning towards leaving Friday 
night and just taking a cab to your place as long as you don't mind waking up 
to let me in.  That way we'd have all day Saturday to do things and I 
wouldn't leave on Sunday until around 3:30 (or I could even leave around 
6:00).  Anyway, I was just wondering what you think about the various 
options?  Let me know and I'll try and book this thing today.

Susan

   I'd told my theory to my friend Linda, who wanted to be a social scientist 
and was always coming up with theories herself.  I'd concluded that breasts 
were to sex what pillows were to sleep.  ""Guys might think they want a 
pillow, but they'll sleep just as well without one.""
     She'd said, ""Guys will sleep anywhere if they're really tired."""

if I recall correctly (and I always do) someone once said they had a little

an enabler.  And, a true fan (longhorn or not) is there through the good

Well, given the impressive results of Friday's game, I suppose I should've 
taken the bet...I mean I knew we were good, but I didn't realize we were THAT 
good.  Watching the game I couldn't help but remember some comments made not 
too long ago about this being a building season and that the Horns would be a 
force to be reckoned with come the next two seasons - - I love it when I'm 
right.  With an increasingly more confident sophomore quarterback leading the 
charge and three (count them three) very mature freshman receivers all eager 
to make big plays, not to mention last year's top quarterback recruit Chance 
Mock serving as a back-up, next season promises to be something to watch.  My 
condolences on your prospects not looking quite as bright .

Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving and good luck helping all of your Aggie 
co-workers through this trying time.

Susan

so if you want to avoid any post-game ridicule...in a round about way you are 
an ""Ag"" man now.)

Hi Mum!  Well, I mustered the courage to start my bathroom painting project 
yesterday.  I chose a medium blue that looks very nice.  Guess who helped 
me?  Bill!  He got pretty enthusiastic with that roller.  So we were able to 
knock it out in about 3 hours.  There was a lot of woodwork to tape off.  
Tonight I will finish the tub area, which needed some 
repair/caulking/spackling.  Now I am anxious to do the bedroom, but probably 
will not get to it until next month.  Maybe you will be able to help me 
decide on a color when you are here this weekend.  I'm torn between ""Happy 
Yellow"" and a lighter version of the blue I used in the bathroom.  If I 
decide to paint any of the downstairs, I believe I will entrust that work to 
the professionals.

Got 4 tickets to the dance performance.  Since Bill seems to genuinely enjoy 
dance, I invited him.  So that leaves us with one ticket.  If you would like 
to invite someone, just let me know; otherwise maybe one of my friends around 
here will join us.

Hope your weekend project was a success.  

Talk to you soon!

Love,
S."

Hey Chris,

I was wondering if there was a fax number at the base so that my apartment 
complex can send you some info.  regarding getting your name taken off of our 
lease.  If there is, just shoot me off an email with the number and I'll pass 
it along to them.

Hope things are going well and that you're not too homesick with Thanksgiving 
and all.  I have a feeling I will be talking to you guys tomorrow along with 
both of our parents and extended family members.  Have a great holiday and 
root on the Horns ( I think this is going to be a tough one).

Love,

Sorry it took me so long to get back to you.  Unfortunately, I'm not a 
betting woman (I'm afraid any team I bet on is automatically jinxed and I 
can't vote against my alma mater)...so I will kindly refrain from any 
wagers.  

Have a great Thanksgiving Holiday,

The options book is still the options book and I think I will have put in at 
least 36 of my 40 hours this week.  I know, I know...I'm not working hard

So are you up for any friendly or unfriendly bets on this weeks big show
down?  I don't think the lines are out yet but I'm sure you guys will be
favored by at least a touchdown.  So I'll take the Aggies +7.  How about the
loser either picks up the first round or the whole night the next time we
hit the town, although the later might be pretty steep.  Don't know if your
a gambling gal but I thought I would at least present this opportunity to
you.

Anyway, how's the old option book?  Are you getting a handle on the whole
macro thing?  Look on the bright side it is only a three day week and I'm
sure you'll get the whole 40 in.

Take it easy.

Kyle

Okay, there's a flight out of Houston on the 15th that gets into SD at 10:45 
pm and the return flight is on Sunday around 3:30.  If that works for you I'm 
going to go ahead and book the ticket now.  

I'm so glad to hear that you're move was such a rousing success.  As for 
myself and all of the guy juggling, I'm trying to get that under control.  
Truth be told, none of them are worth a dime.  I think it was more of an ego 
thing on my part.  Anyway, I still can't see the point in wasting time on 
guys I'm not interested in so (like I said) I've ceased the rampage.  I'm not 
taking any time off for Christmas so this trip would be a very welcomed 
respite.

Let me know about the times.

Hey Julie,

Congratulations on the promotion, that's so exciting (I'm sure you've more 
than earned it).  

I just wanted to drop a line and see how work,  your new apartment/roommate 
and Brendan are all doing.  All are wonderful I hope.  I realize this is 
somewhat random, but I just found some great airfares from Houston to San 
Diego ($99 each way!!!) and was wondering what you were doing the weekend of 
Dec. 15?  I know this time of year is kind of crazy so I will totally 
understand if you have holiday parties, etc. to attend.  Regardless, this 
deal is good for travel through the end of February 2001, so....if it doesn't 
look like it's going to work before the end of the year, maybe I could make a 
visit mid-January or February.  

Have a great holiday weekend and I'll talk to you soon.

John Buchanan and I discussed TW's transfer of gas from the PG&E/Topock 
receipt/delivery point to the PG&E/Topock Park N' Ride point to implement 
TW's use of PG&E's Market Center service.  My understanding is that 
physically the points are one and the same, and that the transaction will 
simply be a paper transfer.  Since a contract is required in our system as a 
formality to implement the transfer, the rate TW will ""charge"" itself for the 
transfer is $0.  

This message is to confirm that I see no legal or regulatory problems with 
the above scenario.

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to e-mail or call 
me (x30596).

The only problem I can see with this is that paragraph 4 could be construed 
to encourage NMNG to request amendment not only to increase the MAXDTQ but 
also to decrease it (if the MAXDTQ has been increased by a previous 
amendment).  I worry that this might mislead NMNG that the parties can 
decrease the MAXDTQ by agreement rather than NMNG using capacity release 
procedures.   However, the paragraph does not obligate TW to do anything & 
doesn't give NMNG any rights, since any change in the MAXDTQ must be by 
mutual agreement (and it's subject to available capacity).  Since it does not 
seem to give either party anything they do not already get under the tariff, 
I think I would recommend we omit it.  However, NMNG might insist on this or 
similar language to reflect the ""deal"" --- or at least the conversations of 
the parties.  If that's the case, I suppose I would advise the marketing 
folks to limit the language of paragraph 4 to an increase in MAXDTQ and 
explain that any decrease would have to be thru capacity release.  Comments?

Hey Darren,

It's funny you mentioned Wilson because I just got an email from him this 
morning.  He seems to think he'll be in Houston in the near future as well.  
Hopefully, we can all get together and go out or hit steak night for some 
cold ones.  So H-town for six weeks hugh?  Why the mixed feelings?  Are they 
work related or were you just starting to get settled in London?  Anyway, 
I'll have to give Nick a call about the big news...I may have an idea what 
it's all about but then again maybe not.  So what's with this Kiwi girl?  
Because, I actually have made some progress regarding London.  Turns out 
there may be some structuring and originating opportunities for me over there 
which would be much more in line with where I'd like my ""career"" to be going 
versus the other opportunities I was being offered.  Either way, I won't be 
going over until March or April of next year so it's still a ways off.

As for the guy scene...yes, there has been some courting but nothing really 
to speak of.  I've gone out on a couple of dates but I can't say I really see 
them going anywhere.  Most of the guys around my age are still pretty 
insecure and I'm never going to be the kind of girl that wants to ""shape and 
mold them"" into men...I just don't have the patience or the inclination.  And 
the other end of the spectrum (single guys in their late 30's/early 40's) who 
seem to hover around like gnats just give me the creeps.  Oh well, as I've 
said before ""hope springs eternal"".

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Sue,
How are you?  What's new in H-town?  Any new guys on the scene--doing
their 'courting'?  I will be coming back to Houston for 6 weeks in a week!
Actually kind of excited--mixed feelings though.  So, Nick has some big 
news that I think would only be right for you to hear from him.  An aside,
if you come to London, I know a fun Kiwi girl that wants to move closer to
work--just looking out for you Susan.  Made any progress on getting over
here?  

Hopre you are well.  I'll call you when I get into town.
--Darren

Hey Wilson,

Yep, I'm still in Houston for the time being...I'll probably be here through 
March of next year when my current rotation ends.  Everything's going pretty 
well, work is still consisting of long hours but I think ultimately the hard 
work is going to pay off.  In fact, the whole London thing is looking pretty 
good right now.  There might be an opportunity for me to get into some 
structuring and originating roles over there which is much more along the 
lines of where I'd like to go (versus this whole trader support thing - great 
experience for the time being, but definitely not a permanent role).  Glad to 
hear things are still well with you.  Sounds like you're still the same old 
Wilson...working deals and hooking-up.  You'll have to let me know when 
you're going to be in town so we can get the gang together to go out.  It 
looks like Darren's going to be back in town for about 6 weeks or so coming 
up so hopefully we could all make a steak night reunion.  

I've been going out quite a bit as well and have had a couple dates, but 
nothing really to speak of.  I was kind of on a rampage over the last month 
just messing with guys heads (flirting, getting them to buy me drinks, giving 
them my number and then completely ignoring them).  I think it was some need 
I had to treat your entire gender like shit.  I'm pretty much over it 
though.  It's not really in my nature to be like that, just a reactionary 
thing for having been treated like crap myself.  

Keep in touch and let me know when you're going to be in town.

Susan

to London.

All is well here...well work is very stressful, but it's cool and i do love 
my job despite all the bitching i do.
It's just a lot of strss.
I've made some big move and actually won a big project over a VP.
You will be seing me soon in Houston. (can't tell you more)

Anyway
Partying like crazy..that's all I do..girls..girls...and more girls...i can't 
even remember all their names OUPS>
Still in love with Shannon, and no she is still not in my life and yes she is 
still in Houston...I hope life helps a little on this one.
Partying..like 4-5 times a week..
But above all, working out like an animal. It's been really good and i'm 
starting to look like i did at Enron...a machine.
Running a lot and working out...

So what is up with you?

be in touch

Hey, I'll try and give you a call tonight at your flat.  As far as ""free 
nights"" over Thanksgiving go...I'm pretty much open Tues, Wed, Fri and Sat.  
Katy and I are very excited about taking you out to get some REAL 
margaritas.  I can't remember where your favorite ones are, but where ever 
they may be the drinks are on me.  (Although given your increased tolerance 
these days, you may break me).  The reason I was asking about when you were 
coming home is...Jeffy Jeff is playing Gruene Hall the 15th and 16th of 
December and If you were up to it, I thought it'd be a good weekend trip for 
you, Katy, myself and whomever else may want to tag along (especially since 
it doesn't look like we'll be making it to Gruene over New Years).  Plus, if 
we did go I think I could swing leaving Friday night and not coming back 
until Monday morning...The outlet mall is calling your name.  

Talk to you soon,
Susan

PS - I have encouraging news regarding London, I'll tell you more about it 
when I talk to you.

Strangely enough a Tuesday night would probably be better for me too.  I 
think an all girls gift exchange would be really fun but, as you guys well 
know, I'm up for anything.  As for restaurants, I just tried this new place 
called Bossa's and it was really good.  It's right across from the Rice Hotel 
downtown and has a neat atmosphere.  Of course there are also all kinds of 
places around our ""area of town"" that would be great as well...PF Chang's, Mi 
Luna, Americas, La Griglia (sp?), etc. etc.  Just let me know the time and 
place.

Thanks again Lisa for organizing all of this, you're the greatest.

Susan

PS- If any one has an urge to grab a bite to eat or coffee either tonight or 
tomorrow night let me know.  I feel like I haven't seen you guys in forever."

I definitely want to renew, but as you know I never get home before the 
leasing office closes.  I've got paintball Saturday morning but I know that 
won't take all day so maybe I can go by in the afternoon to sign any 
necessary papers.  My guess is you'll need to sign some papers as well.

Sue,

We had a message from the apt. office about renewing our lease. If we renew 
we can get our carpet cleaned for free, I THINK?  Let me know if you need me 
to do anything.  They have been sending you the renewal notices and leaving 
you the messages, so I am not sure if you need to instigate it.

let me know

Still need to add a few things, but most of it's already there.  The only 
things missing are the GD files we created and the GD FOM valuation problem 
that I've been working on with Shouan and Jeremy (there was a bug in the 
code).

FYI. In general everything went ok today Nov 10.

Susan Scott had some problems with some of the excel spreadsheets she's been 
running on her machine. The issue here is that the CopyFromRecordset method 
of a range object is failing. The simple
fix is to use a user defined function named rsOutput instead of the method. 
She also mentioned that a process that outputs a text file to the E: drive 
seems to be failing on her machine but is working fine on Dutch Quigley's 
machine. She'll provide more detail to support on Monday.

Cheers.

Agustin,

I am trying to confirm the counterparty on one of your deals so that it can 
be properly assigned in TAGG.  The ticket for the deal in question reads 
Barcel Mexico.  However, I spoke recently with Beatrice Reyna who informed me 
that you believed the counterparty to be one of the Bimbo companies.  If you 
wouldn't mind looking into this and getting back to me with the correct 
counterparty name it would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
Susan

sold out.  any interest or poss. that you could leave work around 3-4 and
go?  just emailed katy about going up earlier and shopping which i know you
prob couldn't do, but could be a fun girls' nite out in NB.  kind of have to
jump on this asap b/c tix are going to sell out soon!  if you can email me
back in next 5 mins, do so, if not try to give me a quick call later- am
jogging home from the internet store, so should be home in about 45 mins!
hope all is well- and hope SINCERELY that the f*%o'n morons in florida get
swallowed up by a giant tidal wave.  IF YOU CAN'T READ A DAMN BALLOT, DON'T
VOTE!  and you DEFINITELY shouldn't be able to vote if you're shameless
enough to speak out PUBLICALLY and admit you CAN'T read a ballot....!
aughhhhhhh!  just one more bit of evidence that supports my theory that all
voters should take an IQ test, and then have their vote weighed
appropriately......

Secondly it would be cool to meet earlier in the week but I'm in San Antonio
and will be until Friday.  I will be driving to Houston on Friday morning to
do some packing and then the parents will be coming up on Saturday morning
to help with the final move.  I will pretty much leave it in your ball park
about Friday night.  I know you have been working long hours and Friday is
just a bad day.  Even though I would like to see you, if you have a repeat
of last week then I understand if you want to call it off.  In that case
maybe we can meet up some other time.  Although I do remember a girl telling
me once that weekends are her time and she was going to go out no matter
what.

Let me know what you think and I'll probably give you a call Friday
afternoon to see how things are going.

Thanks for the attached deal information, Shouan.  Looking at the data I feel 
confident that, once we are past the first day of the month, the gas daily 
options curveshift is valuing correctly.  However, I am still concerned with 
the valuation from 10/31.  Is there anyway to see same breakdown on 11/2 and 
11/3 for 10/31's position.  If you could send me that information in the same 
format I think we may have an answer for the changed deal value we saw fall 
out of my trader's book on 11/1.

The attached document shows my proposed changes to Universal's agreement in 
redlining.  I tried not to over-lawyer or make this overly complicated, but 
in my view this needed a lot of basic cleanup.  Many of my changes are simply 
to make the language more accurate (for example, in the use of defined 
terms).  

In a couple of places, I have questions:  1) In the second opening paragraph, 
I don't know whether it is possible to attach the Proposal as an exhibit; if 
not, ignore my change.  2) Section 4.a.  -- their provision for an adjustment 
seemed a little unusual to me but it could work in favor of either party, so 
I left it in.  If you don't like it, let me know.  3)  In Section 5, I just 
tried to simplify the billing procedure in case of termination.  Let me know 
if this does not agree with your intent.

Please call me with your comments, and let me know how you would like to 
proceed.

I've been missing out on of late.  Last week was extremely trying at work, I 
think I probably put in a good 70-75 hrs. between Monday and Friday, and thus 
resulted in me being a complete and total vegetable this weekend.  Anyway, 
I'm assuming you've been trying to relax as well and have some fun before 
embarking on your new career with Valero.  I'm sure your decision to leave 
Enron and move back to San Antonio will prove to be the right one.    

In regards to dinner this Friday...I would definitely like to get together 
before you leave.  Given how I've been feeling on Friday evenings as of late 
(monumentally exhausted), sometime earlier in the week might be better.  
However, if Friday's the only time you can do it then Friday it is.  Just let 
me know what works for you.  Of course, regardless of what night it is, it's 
probably going to have to be on the later side to accommodate Larry's lackey 
(i.e. me).

Susan

Marcelo,

Thanks for the update.  I have been given a green light as well to go ahead 
and start testing my traders deals.  Let me know if you just need TAGG deal 
numbers for testing purposes, or if I need to rebook deals myself in your 
test version in order to compare it valuation with the valuation in my excel 
models.  

Thanks,
Susan

Susan, Matt,

I was told by Zhiyong last week that he had a green light for the Gas X Gas 
spreads in Enpower. Have any of you hear anything about it? At this point I 
have sent some needed changes in the ""front end"" to Duong Luu, and I'll be 
ready to test when these changes are done. If any of you still have a ""hold"" 
on this project please let me know so we can get all cleared up.

BTW, I've been moved to the 25th floor, desk EB2519a.

Regards, Marcelo

Thanks Carrie.  

I went ahead and made the counterparty name change so that it will be 
properly reflected next month.

Susan,
I believe deal NK7690 is a Duke deal, and not EL Paso.  At least that is what 
TAGG shows.  Would you please update your sheet to reflect the change for 
next month.  
Thanks so much,
Carrie

Jessica,

I'm sorry I never got in touch with you last weekend, but I had the wrong 
phone number with me and didn't have enough brain power to think of using 
Information.  I don't think I would have been much fun anyway since I pretty 
much just ended up sleeping the whole weekend.  In fact, I fell asleep in the 
car on the ride back to my sister's house after the game and my parents 
decided to just leave me in the car.  I think I was probably out there for an 
hour before I woke up (needless to say I was very confused).  Anyway, hope 
things are going well for you and Clay.  I know everything must be kind of 
crazy for both of you right now with finals coming up and all of the 
interviewing you've both no doubt been doing. 

I really want to get a chance to see you and chat...I don't feel like we've 
had a good one in forever.  I will be in Austin over Thanksgiving for the 
game, so we could try to touch base then if you're going to be in town.  If 
not, I'm sure I can manage at least one weekend trip during December if 
there's a good weekend for you.  Just drop me  a line when you get a chance 
and let me know what's new with you.  

Susan

Susie-just wanted to say hello and see how your trip went!!  Hope you had a
ball.  Also, I wanted to let you know that Clay and I are having family and
friends over for food and beer after the game this weekend and would love to
see you.  We are at 1810 Palma Plaza--if you take Enfield towards Mopac, take
a left at the light at Hartford, take a right on Palma Plaza, we are the last
(blue) duplex on the right before Mopac; our half faces Palma Plaza and the
other half faces Mopac.  If you forget these directions--my number is

That is weird.  I received your first message.  

Dave, Exhibit A of the O&M agreement is a description of the Compressor Motor 
Facilities.  Do you have this?
Exhibit C is insurance coverages; I assume I need to get that from Nemec.

Martha, please send me by interoffice mail copies of the executed documents 
Drew has; mine seem to have vaporized.

Thank you!

Subject: Transwestern Contracts

You guys probably don't remember this (I didn't until I checked the file) but 
there were a couple of exhibits to the Transwestern Gallup contracts that we 
left to be attached to the final contracts after execution.  My recollection 
is that we were in such a hurry to get the Compression Service Agreement 
signed and sent to FERC that we left a couple of these things to do later.  
Now that we have the FERC order, I want to get these contracts off my desk 
and off to Corporate Records or whereever original contracts go to die.   On 
my originals, I'm missing Exhibit B to the CSA (which is the CDEC Rate 
Schedule No. 21),  and Exhibits A and C to the O&M Agreement.  

Susan, please coordinate with Gerald to get these exhibits in our respective 
files and we can send these contracts off to the central rathole and be done 
with it.  Thanks to you all.  DF

Well you have either had a week from hell so far or its just taking you time
to come up with some good bs.  Without being too forward I will be in town
next Friday and wanted to know if you would like to go to dinner or
something.  At least that will give us a chance to talk face to face.  If
your busy don't worry about it I thought I would just throw it out there.

I'll keep this one short and sweet since the last one was rather lengthy.
Hope this Thursday is a little better then last week.

Kyle

Thanks.  As for getting talked into buying all the extras, I'm not as easily 
convinced of things as some people I know ( Cow fingers?).  Halloween at the 
Big E wasn't nearly as fun as I'd hoped...I mean, they keep the candy in 
machines and you have to actually pay for it...that just borders on cruel.

Susan

By the way,  you'll have to question  the college coaches and sports writers 
out there if you have any issues with the rankings.  I am merely the 
messenger.

Christine and I seem to have gotten Phillips interested in a right to 
terminate if TW's minimum tariff rate ever exceeds the contract rate.  They 
said they would mull it over, at least.

But what they really would prefer to have is a provision in which they would 
get the contract rate no matter what.  Since this would make it a negotiated 
rate deal from day 1, I feel like I need to get your buy-in before we agree 
to it.  Steve has already told me it is OK with him.  Please advise."

Hey,

Quick question, I was hoping to go get my car detailed this weekend and I 
remembered that you had your truck detailed a while back...I was wondering 
where you had it done and if you thought they did a good job ( I'm assuming 
the place is pretty close to our area of town).  I finally got into the 
parking garage and have decided I now have real incentive to keep my car 
looking nice.

Hope things are well with you.  I talked to Darren last week and it sounds as 
though he is extremely busy these days.  I'm guessing the story's much the 
same with you - a far cry from the listless days you two spent in Net Works.  
Anyway, if you could let me know about the detailing I would appreciate it.

Susan

By the way, since there's no telling if I'll have the opportunity to gloat 
two weeks from now (Tech in Lubbock is never a safe bet) - and while neither 
season has been one for the record books (except of course for our loss to OU 
- one of the worst in history) - I noticed that unlike the Longhorns, your 
beloved Bruins are conspicuously absent from the top 25.  Oh well, c'est la 
vie."

Don't know when you'll get a chance to read this, but I must confess it made 
me a bit teary eyed.  I didn't think he had it in him to be so eloquent.

As for New Year's Eve, I have to say I'm kind of with Kasey.  As much as I'd 
love to see Gary P., I don't really want to risk the drive and I'm guessing 
no one else does either. 

Hope you had a good weekend and I'll talk to you soon.

Hey, how was the weekend?  Did you at least catch up a little on your rest?
You had one heck of a week but then again I guess that is just old hat for
you.  We had a good time on Saturday.  It is always fun to be on sixth
street close to halloween, even more freaks come out.

OK enough stalling.  I just thought something needed to be said about
wednesday.  We could just go on and act like nothing happened and probably
never see or talk to one another ever again.  I don't like that solution.
My personality is to go with the flow but by doing this you sometimes miss
out on opportunities.  So the traditional me would say it was just one night
and didn't really mean anything, which could possibly be true.  One thing
that I learned from you is that you have to take chances and don't be
intimidated.  You have a very strong personality and I can see where
somebody could easily be intimidated.  Along with that comes someone who is
smart, attractive, outgoing, and somebody who can fit in anywhere, whether
your at the local honky-tonk or at some gala.  The one thing I know about
you is that your going to be successful and I don't mean in the monetary way
because I know that isn't high on the priority list.  I also know that if I
would have never left the company then I probably wouldn't be sitting here
writing this email.

When I was thinking about leaving I didn't think it was going to be that
hard.  I really didn't like the way my life was going and I knew I needed a
change.  Then I sit back and think of all the things I'm going to miss.
People bad talk risk all the time, with the long hours and little respect
you sometimes get it is understandable.  The thing I'm going to miss the
most are all the friendships I have built working in that group.  Sometimes
the toughest times are when you really get to know someone.  But the hardest
thing now is that I will not be around you.  I know that sounds really bad
but the honest truth is I have liked you ever since we started sitting next
to each other.  We had this chemistry and it made the job a little easier
knowing you were there.  I really think the best times I had in Houston were
those couple of weeks we went out after work to have a few drinks.  I also
knew that since we worked together that it probably wasn't the best thing to
get involved.  I really regret that decision right about now.

Alright I guess I have said a lot of sappy stuff and you should know that
I'm not usually like this, which is probably why I didn't call you to share
this info.  I do think some things need to be said or else the other person
will never know.  You are a great person and even though the chips are
stacked against me I needed to let you know this.  I understand that your
under a lot of stress right now and by no means do I want to add on.  The
one thing I wish you would take away from this is that if your 35 and still
looking then you need not look any further.

So I apologize for using this forum to express this I really wanted to talk
to you in person on Friday but I just didn't get a chance much less know
where to start. I hope we stay in touch and if you ever want to go to Gruene
Hall then let me know.  I also don't want to be put in one of your stalker
categories so take this for whatever you want, please don't think of me as
the next SP.

Take care and have a good week.

Kyle

By the way I think that good-bye would have to rank in top of all times, at
least it is number one in my book.

No need to apologize for keeping me out Wednesday night, it was probably more 
a case of me keeping myself out (I have been known to do that on occasion).  
I'm sorry I didn't return your call yesterday, but I had a pretty crazy day 
here and that mixed with me only running on about two cylinders effectively 
cut me off from the outside world.  As for being upset about anything, don't 
worry I'm not.  You know me well enough to know that my actions are my own.  
I'm not sure if I'm going to stay in Austin Saturday night or not, but in 
case I do my cell # is 281-844-0866.

I'll see you at Purvi's happy hour if you end up going.

Since you may or may not return my call I thought I would shoot you an
email.  I'm sorry for keeping you out soo late on Wednesday and anything
else that you may be upset about.  Anyway I will be in Austin on Saturday
night and was hoping we could meet up.  The only thing is I have no way of
getting a hold of you.  So, here is my cell number and I should at least
have this until the end of November:  281-216-5005.  I already got Vic's and
Trey's number so maybe we can all hook up on sixth street.  You can always
respond to this or give me a call with your number.  I may swing by Purvi's
happy hour tonight so maybe I'll see you there.

Kyle

By the way I have never been married and I'm not 28 yet.

It's muster - to pass inspection...(how does mustard make sense?  It's not 
like the Grey Poupon commercials.)

I really miss football--I'm jealous for that.  Is is pass mustard or muster?  
You're right--tough cookie, who deserves a good man.  I'll screen for you.  
20 questions on short call as needed (provided that the info from friends 
thing didn't apply to me....).  Actually I was just developing a social 
circle there and whammo....I'm here.  I figure I'm here to kick some tail and 
worry about the social element later.  Don't get me wrong, I am drinking on 
the w/e's.  Unfortunately I am not meeting the TX & CA women type.  I got no 
Euro-rap....

Been talking to Wilson?  I have been AOL-IMing him.  He seems okay as 
usual--women the same, work on the up with a new boss.  That's all for now.  
Getting sick.  Think I will go home early tonight (relative).  Talk to you 
soon!

Your welcome.  

As for myself, I'm doing pretty good these days.  I've been up in Austin 
practically every weekend for the games and have actually been managing to go 
out a bit more here in Houston during the week in an effort to become social 
again.  There isn't too much new in Tejas...the weather's still warm and a 
bit on the muggy side, but what can you expect it's only almost November.  
Today is Wednesday, so of course Steak Night is on the agenda for this 
evening.  Actually, the guy who trained me for my current job is leaving 
Enron and his happy hour just happens to be at Little Woodrow's tonight - how 
convenient.  On the man front, I've put myself back out on the ""market"" so to 
speak and have a couple of pursuant suitors right now (although, I don't know 
that in the end any of them will pass muster).  Unfortunately for them I am 
somewhat sceptical of guys in general these days (especially ones that I 
can't get background information on through friends), but I'm trying not to 
let that color my opinion too much.  Not to worry about your former neighbor 
either, I haven't seen or talked to him in a couple of weeks and that's okay 
with me.

Drop me a line when you get the chance,
Susan

Thanks for the update.  I worked for Jay but wrote the whole thing myself 
(50pgs on Grains).  
How are you?  What's new in Tejas?  What's up on the man front?(--no not my 
old neighbor)
I'll write a bit more soon.  I've been jammed lately and unfortunately it is 
not getting any better.
:)  Thanks for the note.  Looking forward to coming back and having a cold 
one in TX.  I'll buy 
you one!  Silk of the warm ones here.....

Hey Darren,

Just thought I'd let you know that Billy Lemmons mentioned you by name in one 
of the Analyst/Associate brown bag lunches.  He was talking about the Ag 
Trading initiative and who spear-headed the effort (I think the other guy he 
mentioned was Jay Fitzgerald).  Anyway, thought you'd like to now you're 
definitely making a name for yourself around here.  Hope things are going 
well with you.

Talk to you soon,

Yes, the deal would have been for today.  I'm not sure who the trader was and 
Larry has already left for the day.  I will probably just leave a note for 
him with his packet and resolve the issue tomorrow.  

Thanks,

For today?  Also, do you know roughly what the of the deal is because I only 
see Chris Lambie's and John Mckay's deals
.
Today's deals do not contain any deals at Sumas with Larry May, again, I am 
speaking of John  Mckay and Chris Lambie.

Mary Kay and Drew, please see Christine's message below.  This language is 
very similar to language that NNG has used to address the change-in-rates 
issue.  I do not believe it creates a negotiated rates issue.  Please let me 
know as soon as possible if you have any concerns.  It is important that we 
work something out with Phillips today.

By the way, I asked Christine if she had asked Phillips to 1) give up their 
right of first refusal and 2) agree to our new capacity release language 
(i.e. TW gets the upside if capacity is released at a higher rate) in 
exchange for us making this compromise.  She feels that it would be 
inappropriate to ask them because the language below does not quite give 
Phillips what they had requested originally (that is, a negotiated rate).

Susan - Here is the language that Phillips has requested.  They liked and had 
requested the exact wording inserted into their agreement, so if there any 
any changes that you feel needs to be made, please try to keep the changes as 
simple as possible.  Thanks!

In the event that Transwestern's minimum tariff rate is increased to a level 
above Shipper's discount rate provided herein, the parties agree to 
renegotiate the discount to achieve the same economic value to both parties.

Evidently, there has been some discussion regarding the use of Enpower for 
Natural Gas basis options.  As a result I've been advised to hold off on any 
meetings until further notice.  Thanks again for all of your help and I will 
be in touch with you as soon as I know how we are going to progress.

    For October 19: Put the obsession and dedication back into your job,
                     health, and daily life. Stressful matters beyond your 
control have leached away
                     much of the excitement that makes life enjoyable. Use 
this Mercury retro
                     period to reinvent your work philosophy and improve your 
health and lifestyle.
                     The resources and relief you seek are available, but you 
may be expected to
                     kowtow and kiss butt to get what you need. Are you 
willing -- or not? I can't
                     blame you if your high standards won't allow anything to 
compromise your
                     vision. But if you're feeling pragmatic, use the next 3 
weeks to cook up an
                     agreement you can live with. "

-----------------
Good afternoon.  I'm Al Gore, and I'd like to tell you about myself.
I know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a poor
black child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee.  I was born in
a log cabin that I built with my own hands.  I taught myself to read by
candlelight and helped support my 16 brothers and sisters by working
summers as a deck hand on a Mississippi River steamboat.

My mother taught me the value of education, so every day I would walk 5
miles to a one-room schoolhouse.  I was a mischievous, fun-loving scamp,
thought I never dreamed that one-day, my youthful escapades would serve
as the inspiration for ""Huckleberry Finn.""

Back then, black folks in the south were second-class citizens.
One day, a traveling minister came through town, and I asked him if
anyone was ever going to do something to guarantee civil rights for all
Americans.  Well, I guess I made an impression.  You see, the minister's
name was Martin Luther King, Jr.

My father was a United States Senator.  He once perched me on his knee
and said, ""Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama, someday you
can live in a hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to an exclusive prep
school.""

But life of privilege was not for me.  After getting my high school
diploma, I took a job in a hot, dirty textile mill.  I was so appalled
at the treatment of the workers there that I organized a union.
Later, that experience inspired a movie - which is why, to this day, my
close friends at the AFL-CIO call me ""Norma Rae.""

When word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done, Harvard
called and offered me a scholarship.  I captained the hockey team to
four consecutive national championships, but I also played football and
was good enough to win the Heisman Trophy.  During my college years, I
lived in a housing project and moonlighted playing lead guitar for a
little rock band.  You may have heard of it -- the Rolling Stones.

But there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my country.  So
I enlisted in the U.  S.  Army and went to Vietnam.  I was deeply
opposed to the war, but I did my duty as a soldier and came back home
with the Medal of Honor and the Croix de Guerre.

When I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of ours.
I've crossed the deserts bare, man, I've breathed the mountain air, man,
I've traveled, I've done my share, man, I've been everywhere.
And the people I met at truckstops and campgrounds and homeless shelters
on that journey all said the same thing: ""Al, we need you in
Washington.""

I knew they were right, but first I had to take care of some other
business---building the World Trade Center, founding the Audubon
Society, doing the clinical research that proved smoking caused cancer,
and coming up with the recipe for Mrs.  Field's chocolate chip cookies.

Finally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee and
allowed them to elect me to the House of Representatives and the Senate,
where I established the US Strategic Oil Reserve.  And then one winter
day nearly nine years ago, for no particular reason, I answered the call
of the people once again and took the oath of office as Vice President
of the United States.

Since then, I've been part of the most successful administration in
American history.  And, in my spare time, I invented the Internet.
Many times Bill Clinton has been pondering some grave decision and has
asked me what to do.  And when I would give him my thoughts, he would
invariable say, ""Of course.  That's brilliant.  Why didn't I think of
that?"" During the darkest days of the impeachment battle, the president
told me he only wished he had listened when I told him to stay away form
that dark-haired intern.

So after I decided to run for president, I sat down with him and asked
if he had any suggestions about how to conduct my campaign.
And Bill Clinton gave me a few simple words of advice -- words I'll
never forget.  He looked me in the eye and he said, ""Al, just tell the
truth, it's always worked for me.""

Dear Citizens' Assistance Division:

I live in the Houston Heights on the 800 block of Cortlandt.  For the 3 years 
I've lived 
there, the drainage ditch in front of my house, and several other houses on 
my street, 
have been blocked.  Any time it rains, we have standing water for several 
days 
afterwards.  I know that other streets in the Heights have the same problem.  
I have 
heard that because of the mild winter we're having, we can expect a bumper 
crop of 
mosquitos this summer.  Standing water therefore poses a health concern for 
residents 
of the Heights this summer. 

Does the City have any current plans to fix the drainage problem in the 
Heights?  Last 
year I called and requested that the ditch in front of my house be cleared, 
but got no 
response.  I hope that this was merely an oversight rather than an indication 
that the City 
of Houston has no regard for the health and comfort of its citizens. 

Any information you can provide would be appreciated. 

Sincerely, 

Susan Scott 
815 Cortlandt St.

Those were great Chris.  Sorry no emails sooner to tell you all of my trip to 
London, which was incredible, but alas I am back at work and therefore 
swamped.  Mom said you guys had a great time in China.  I hope you took lots 
of pictures.  I'm not sure if she already passed along the bad news, but it 
doesn't look like I'm going to be able to visit next month...Work strikes 
again.  I am very frustrated (considering I asked for this time off 4 mos. 
ago) but there isn't really anything I can do.  So, I'm going to see if 
there's a way I could come over next spring.  Regardless, I very excited 
about you and Chuck coming back to Houston in December and we'll just have to 
make up some quality time then.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

PS - Isn't it ironic...Now Ben keeps calling wanting to go out.  I mean 
honestly what goes through these guys heads.  They don't realize a ""good 
thing"" the first time around and the second time around is too late - the 
""good thing"" is no longer interested."

Hey Em,

Well it's 8:30 Friday night and surprise I'm still at the office.  I love 
this place!!!  To answer your question, yes I am definitely suffering 
withdrawal.  I will be working very hard over the next few months to cure 
that though.  Nothing really exciting to report here except A) Nick called me 
my first day back in the office to make sure I arrived home safely ( I really 
don't know what to do about all of that)  B) Ben keeps calling me to see if I 
want to go out - 2 nights in a row in addition to our Steak Night beer (I 
haven't gone either night).  How ironic is all of this?  I've got one guy 
worrying and thinking of me that I care nothing for...I've got another guy 
who I at one time cared for but no longer do trying to take advantage of my 
vulnerable state (which in truth isn't really vulnerable at all) and another 
guy, who I until fairly recently cared for, who I think could go the rest of 
his life without ever seeing/speaking to me again (Or course I guess the 
reverse of that is true as well).

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Positive notes:  I think Ted is getting greying and losing hair with the 
added stress of corn trading.  He looks old and pitiful.

oh, the wonders of technology.  here i am, 1000's of kilometers away,
communicating via email with you fabulous folks.  have just stumbled in from
a pub featuring an irish 'jig' band- i picked up the rhythem instantly, i
must admit.....and after only 12 pints!  needless to say, it was a brilliant
cultural experience, and the only thing that would've been better would've
been if all of you could have been there to a., mock and harass me, and b.,
make yourselves as hated as this american made herself....why is that cider
makes you want to sing show tunes and bitch about shitty english  washing
machines....?  anyways- just wanted you to know i was thinking of you- even
if it WAS  after i thought for 15 minutes where the closest burger king was
( *jen- this is as close as you're going to get to those ridiculous
miniature books w/ PMS quotes you're so fond of......how id boulder by the
way...?)  sue- glad you got home okay- going thru withdrawl yet?  matt- got
your emails- twice.  double thanks.  hope my biting response hasn't sent you
into therapy- yet.  kk, llkj,etc- hope all is well in lala land- just fyi- i
think red bull is cheaper here- imagine the possibilities!  and for the reat
of the gang- enjoy yourselves at the infamous cougar 5 yr- i will- OF
COURSE- be there in spirit.....and i'm not being cynical, really......
call/write soon, s'il vous plait......

Glad to hear things are going so well.  No, I haven't spoken with Ted since 
my return...but, I did go out a few of the nights I was in London with an 
undergrad/grad school friend of his (among other people of course).  
Surprise, surprise he didn't have many supportive words for Ted as dating 
material either.  In summary he found Ted to lack attentiveness to his 
partners and maybe even fidelity.  He said the break up of Ted's marriage 
wasn't ""ALL his fault"", which is a decidedly different slant than the one Ted 
gave me the night of our chat.  I also heard that he has worked his way 
around Enron a bit.  All in all very disheartening information.  Regardless, 
I'm still glad I dated him and think I learned a lot from the whole 
situation.  Tell Brendan I said, ""Hello"" and good luck with the new role at 
work.

You guys are going to kill me, but I just got a ticket on the floor for the 
Rockets game tonight.  I was hoping I could get cell phone numbers from a few 
of you so that I could maybe meet up with y'all after the game.  I definitely 
want to see everyone and could ""go out"" later if anyone's interested.

Hey Julie,

I just got back from London Tuesday and am now almost fully recovered from 
the jet lag.  I had an absolutely incredible time while I was over there and 
was even able to go into the Enron office for a while.  One of the guys I 
knew here in Houston even set up an impromptu interview for me while I was 
there so I think my working over there may be a very real possibility.  Since 
I'd already done a lot of the touristy things the last time I was in London 
Emily and I pretty much just hung out.  We went out to eat Friday night and 
then to a club ( I think we got home around 4 am after indulging in some fish 
and chips).  Saturday and Sunday we mostly just wondered around the city to 
various shops and markets and went out to various lunch and dinner venues.  
Finally, on Monday I went in to the office while Em was at school and then 
had a fairly big last night in town with some friends of Emily's.  Hope 
everything's been going well with you and that the move into your new place 
was a success.  I'll keep checking for great fares out to SD...I'd love to 
meet your roommate and all of your other friends I feel as though I know now.

Susan

PS - I think you're right about the California men.  I am currently in 
contact with about three of them and they all have issues.  Although, I still 
think Ted takes the cake. "

Em, you know I'm in on this one.  It's been far too long since we've had a 
true NB weekend.  Unfortunately (although not surprisingly) it appears our 
erstwhile friend Alan will claim any excuse, no matter how unappealing, to 
avoid singing show tunes around the camp fire - your voice will be missed.  
For the rest of you guys, I hope we can muster a good turn-out as I am in 
desperate need of over analysis in regards to the problems of the world as 
well as ourselves whilst in a drunken stupor.  Nobody does it better...

Susan

ok- i'm going to remain skeptical and cautious about this til i get more
feedback (yes, kk, i know where you stand!)  who is interested in spending
this new years in NB @ the river and going to gruene hall?  need to commit
fairly soon, as there have been 'bites' from other interested parties, and
we'll just rent it out if interest is low.....those who haven't responded,
pls drop me a line, make suggestions.....can't have TOO many people due to
size restrictions, but obviously significant others/spouses are welcome.  am
sure i'm forgetting a key person or 2 from this email- let me know who!
don't want to hurt feelings (you KNOW how sensitive I am....)but want to
make sure we have a 'cohesive' group.  keep me posted.....au revoir from the
land of bangers and mash....

Hey guys,

Well I'm back home in Houston looking out at our lovely skyline (okay, maybe 
it's not that lovely but it is sunny here).  Anyway, I'm so glad I got the 
chance to see all of you while I was in London.  It seemed as though all of 
you are really enjoying your time in the UK - which is good to hear given the 
fact I'm hoping to make it over there myself.  Hope the approaching close to 
2000 finds everyone in good spirits.

Cheers,
Susan "

Ashley,

I am so sorry we never managed to meet up while I was in London.  Emily and I 
spent all day Sunday gallivanting around the city to the markets, etc. and 
Monday I ended-up spending a lot longer than I planned at the office.  On the 
bright side, I was able to have an impromptu interview and meet quite a few 
people while I was there.  I'm hoping to be over there and gainfully employed 
by early next spring.  Hope things are well with you and the next trip I make 
over there we will definitely get together.

Trip was excellent.  I took pictures, but most of them where taken inside 
pubs so who knows how they'll turn out.  I definitely thought about you and 
how much you would love the area Emily's living in (very upscale, English and 
proper).  I also had an impromptu interview thanks to Dave Oliver so we'll 
see.  I will talk to you more later as I am in the thick of calcing and am 
suffering a bit of jet lag.

Hello my friend. Hope you are well. First, how was your trip? Secondly, did 
you get many pictures? Thirdly, did you think about me the whole time you 
were there...saying in your mind ""Tobin would have liked this?""
Drop a note and give me the dirt.

Here you go Cynthia.  I feel pretty confident that everything is correct this

Lexi,

I completely forgot to turn in my expense report from last months recruiting 
trip.  Things around here have been absolutely crazy, as I'm sure they have 
been for you.  In addition to the attached file below I am forwarding the 
hard copy to your office.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to

Agustin, 

I haven't booked the origination we talked about yet because I wanted to get 
an exact number from you first.  If you could send me an email with the 
correct origination amount I can book it tonight.  The deal was with General 
de Cermica for 11,000/month 10/1/00 - 03/31/0.

Hey,

Thanks for the well wishes.  I don't actually leave until Thursday, but I am 
VERY ready and equally excited.  I ended up meeting Ted for dinner Thursday 
to ""chat"".  He definitely doesn't deserve the title of Wonder Boy.  Anyway, 
I'll forward you the email I sent Emily regarding the evening in question.  
Hope everything's good with you.

Well, we met and had dinner last night.  NOTHING of importance was discussed 
during our entire meal and it was only when I brought things up as we were 
leaving that any actual talking occurred.  Here are the basics...

- There is definitely no ""us"" anymore...and I quote ""sometimes these things 
just fade out""
- There is much I didn't know about him and I am sure even more that I still 
don't
- Case in point...He was MARRIED before (yes, you read correctly married)
- Turns out he's been divorced about three years, it didn't end well and he 
hasn't had a relationship that has lasted beyond       2 mos. in those three 
years (even though, by his own admission, he has dated a lot) - Can you say 
issues?
- He told me ""I know this sounds so trite, but this really has nothing to do 
with you, it's all me.""  Of course I agreed with him saying ""I know it's you 
Ted, I don't have any problems."" (He got a chuckle out of that one)
- I told him about my frustrations and disappointment with how he had handled 
things and he apologised (evidently Kevin told him about our exchange at 
Steak Night) and I also let him know how much I appreciated his handling of 
things in the beginning
- I said I really hated animosity and hard feelings and that as long as he 
hadn't done anything truly horrible to me (i.e. murder a family member, etc.) 
I would really like to leave things on a good note...He agreed.
- He said I was a fantastic girl and that he still enjoyed hanging out and 
talking with me (although I don't see us doing a lot of that)

So all in all I walked away with three very important things 1. A lightened 
load (I got everything of my chest that I wanted to and needed to) 2. My 
dignity (I handled it just as I'd hoped...with composure and wit) 3. A 
clearer since of Ted as a person (He definitely has a lot of issues in his 
life he has not completely dealt with yet, and who knows if he ever will?)

Anyway, I'm okay with everything and surprisingly feel pretty good.  I'll 
talk to you soon.

Susan

By the way, I told him about the shirt idea (he thought it was funny, and 
maybe just a little harsh)"

I am very excited about my trip to London.  For one thing I get to visit 
Emily, but at this point more importantly I don't have to think about work 
for 6 days straight.  You guys are going to have a great trip to China and I 
say if you find a rug that you really like (i.e. you're not just getting one 
because you think you should) you should definitely get it.  Just think what 
a great conversation piece it would make over the years.  

And don't worry about my appetite for travel getting spoiled...that is 
impossible.  I can't wait to see you guys.  I think that you being in Korea 
and Emily being in London has made this whole Ted situation that much harder 
to deal with.  I've realized how much I appreciate y'alls insights now that 
they aren't as easy to get.

Love ya,
Susan"

I always forget what the time difference is so I thought I might be able to 
catch you ""real time.""  

I went to the game Saturday with Travis, Corey, Mike and a friend of his.  
Kathy was getting her certification for spinning classes and thus I was given 
the responsibility of baby-sitting Corey and Travis.  Anyway, Trav's pledge 
class had a reunion at the house after the game and I think it may have 
single-handedly cured me of wanting men in their early thirties.  The single 
guys from their class are definitely still single for a reason.  Also, you've 
gotta tell Chuck that Kinzer's date for the game was a year younger than me 
(although I will say, after meeting her, you would've thought she was much 
younger).  I think 27-28 may be a better range.  Old enough to know who they 
are and what they want, but still young enough to explain their unattached 
status on career focus.

Talk to you soon,
Susan"

Hey girl!  Thanks for the book and the CD.  I lazed around the house enjoying 
both yesterday morning.  After we played tennis, Bill took me to Berryhill 
for fish tacos (al fresco) and later that evening we went to yet another 
Christmas party, where I drank champagne (but luckily not too much).  So it 
was a good birthday.  
Have a good day!

Hi Susan! I meant to call you yesterday but somehow I never did. Hope you
will accept a late Happy Birthday from me! I am assuming that mum passed
along our gift to you whilst we were in Houston last. I hope so! Anyway, I
hope that you had a good day and that Bill took you out for a nice dinner.

Except for maybe a lipstick for the mem's,(was totally confused by the
selection at the HEB - need help) this elf is finished with Christmas
shopping. Good to have it done. Picked up some sox at Tar-zhay for her to
wear w/ the clogs.

More later!

Spoke with Steve about the swap question.  He wants to talk with you about 
this before circling back to Knippa.  If you don't hear from him, and want to 
call him, his # is 281-350-8441.

Re. TW's exposure if we authorize ECS to lock in too early:

If TW defaults under the CSA, it must hold ECS harmless with regard to 
expenses incurred by ECS in the assignment of the electric supply agreement 
and pay ECS whatever is owed under the agreement.  No other specific damages 
are addressed, and the agreement specifically prohibits the recovery of 
consequential, incidental or indirect losses or damages.  (Section 9.2 
provides for reimbursement for ECS's reasonable costs in providing 
Compression Services, but only in the event TW uses its FERC out.)  The Gas 
Conversion Agreement provides for termination of the agreement in the event 
of default by TW under the CSA, and obligates TW to reimburse ECS for ECS's 
costs and expenses incurred in unwinding the forward sale of natural gas 
volumes to be delivered to ECS under the agreement.  

Other questions -- let  me know."

Sorry I never called yesterday...I had turned my phone off and didn't realize 
you'd called until last night.  I'm still at work right now and therefore am 
extremely tired.  Hope you got everything you needed to accomplished this 
weekend.  I had a good time at the game and, thanks to Travis's pledge class 
reunion, have come to the conclusion that 27-28 is a better age range for 
me.  There young enough to excuse being single due to career focus and still 
old enough to know who they are and what they want.  Some critical things 
happen in those 3-5 years from a man's late twenties to early thirties that 
can expose so many ""issues"" (examples of which I got to see several of on 
Saturday).

Talk to you soon,

Hey,

It's 8:30 and I'm still at work.  Did I mention I really need this vacation?  
Anyway, I have a couple of questions for you.  Is there anything special 
you'd like me to bring over (that your Mom isn't getting for you).  I talked 
to your Mom yesterday and she mentioned a craving for Turkey Jerky.  If you 
want me to bring some over just let me know where to buy it.  Also, do you 
have any predictions for the weather.  I'm planning on bringing the following 
- jeans, sweatshirt, black pants & skirt, black cardigan, ""rain coat"" (I put 
it in quotes b/c I know mine won't be official), some ""go out"" close, running 
shoes, heels, and boots, 2 sweaters, varying tops, and a pair of shorts.  I 
always end up over-packing, but I'm really going to try to pare down.  I'm 
assuming you have a blow-dryer so I can leave mine at home. 

I talked to Darren today and he said Friday sounded good...and, I sent an 
email to Nick so hopefully it will work for him as well.  I also emailed 
Jessica's friend Ashley who's living over there and she wanted to get 
together maybe for lunch or something over the weekend. 

I've been checking out the Tube Maps on the Web and don't think I should have 
much of a problem getting to your place.  I assume I'm going to want to get 
off at the Holland Park tube stop.  Should be a piece of cake, right?

Any bright ideas of how to get your extra set of keys to me Friday morning?  
I guess there isn't really anywhere for you to hide them around your flat 
(i.e. under the doormat or over the door frame?).  

See you soon,
Susan

- I may have to pump Darren for a little bit of info Friday night (subtly of 
course)...Like did he know that I didn't know about Ted's ""past"" - maybe you 
can find out why the marriage ended."

this Friday through next Tuesday.  I'm visiting a friend of mine who is 
attending Sotheby's graduate program.  I know it's short notice, but I would

Everything goes O.K.  I met with Ted last week for dinner Thursday night...it 
was VERY enlightening.  I'll forward you the email I sent to my sister-in-law 
(it sums everything up pretty well).  Let me know if you want to grab coffee, 
a drink, etc. tonight or tomorrow night - although I think you've got NCL 
tomorrow.  

Well, we met and had dinner last night.  NOTHING of importance was discussed 
during our entire meal and it was only when I brought things up as we were 
leaving that any actual ""talking"" occurred.  Here are the basics...

- There is definitely no ""us"" anymore...and I quote ""sometimes these things 
just fade out""
- There is much I didn't know about him and I am sure even more that I still 
don't
- Case in point...He was MARRIED before (yes, you read correctly married)
- Turns out he's been divorced about three years, it didn't end well and he 
hasn't had a relationship that has lasted beyond       2 mos. in those three 
years (even though, by his own admission, he has dated quite a bit) - Can you 
say issues?
- He told me ""I know this sounds so trite, but this really has nothing to do 
with you, it's all me.""  Of course I agreed with him saying ""I know it's you 
Ted, I don't have any problems."" (He got a chuckle out of that one)
- I told him about my frustrations and disappointment with how he had handled 
things and he apologised (evidently Kevin told him about our exchange at 
Steak Night) and I also let him know how much I appreciated his handling of 
things in the beginning
- I said I really hated animosity and hard feelings and that as long as he 
hadn't done anything truly horrible to me (i.e. murder a family member, etc.) 
I would really like to leave things on a good note...He agreed.
- He said I was a fantastic girl and that he still really enjoyed hanging out 
and talking with me (although I don't see us doing a lot of that...not very 
healthy for me) 

So all in all I walked away with three very important things 1. A lightened 
load (I got everything of my chest that I wanted to and needed to) 2. My 
dignity (I handled just it as I'd hoped...with composure and wit) 3. A

completely)

So I met him for dinner Thursday night.  Nothing was discussed until we were 
about to leave and I couldn't hold my tongue any longer.  Turns out he was 
married before and may have some issues (pretty big ones in my opinion - case 
in point, he's been divorced three years and, by his own admission, has dated 
quite a bit in the interim but nothing that has lasted longer than 2 mos. - 
sounds like a pattern to me). 

 We'll talk more later,

Hey Darren,

I wanted to try and touch and base with you before my arrival in London.  I 
talked to Emily late last week and she seemed to think Friday night was a 
good night to try and get together.  I know you have a bunch of people that 
are going to be in London this weekend, but maybe we could just make it one 
big group outing.  Get back to me when you get a chance and we'll try and set 
something up.

No one has ever mistaken me for being a shy or timid person...least of all
Ted.  Therefore, telling him about the shirt was right in character for me.
I think a part of him probably felt a little ashamed that a 23 yr. old girl
with almost no dating experience could handle the situation with more class
than him.  Anyway, there were a few other things established and solidified
last night by Ted - 1. By his own admission, I am definitely smarted than
him (while in the past I have challenged that I had to agree last night) 2.
I am a confident, probably too much so, and well-adjusted individual.
Merely taking into account those two points, Ted in his present ""condition""
could never be a match for me.  I would either always feel like I was
carrying him or rolling over him.  I'm still absolutely floored by the fact
I have now dated a divorcee.  Does Chuck think less of me for being duped?
I hope not...he really seemed like a good (to everyone that met him).

I think Mom, Dad and I are all going to fly over on the same flight

Here's my request for rehearing so far.  The marketing folks are helping me 
with our competitive harm argument and will, I hope, come up with something 
plausible.  In the meantime, I would appreciate your comments.

No one has ever mistaken me for being a shy or timid person...least of all 
Ted.  Therefore, telling him about the shirt was right in character for me.  
I think a part of him probably felt a little ashamed that a 23 yr. old girl 
with almost no dating experience could handle the situation with more class 
than him.  Anyway, there were a few other things established and solidified 
last night by Ted - 1. By his own admission, I am definitely smarted than him 
(while in the past I have challenged that I had to agree last night) 2. I am 
a confident, probably too much so, and well-adjusted individual.  Merely 
taking into account those two points, Ted in his present ""condition"" could 
never be a match for me.  I would either always feel like I was carrying him 
or rolling over him.  I'm still absolutely floored by the fact I have now 
dated a divorcee.  Does Chuck think less of me for being duped?  I hope 
not...he really seemed like a good (to everyone that met him).

I think Mom, Dad and I are all going to fly over on the same flight

Subject: the weirdo has shown his true colors finally, and not just by e mail


First of all sorry about the ""overjealous"" not
""overzealous"" in my last e mail--it was late.

Anyway, to the important stuff...I think that's the
problem with dating 30 something guys who aren't
married.  Either a divorce in the past or too many
other hang ups (and this guy looks like he fits into
both categories).  I know that everyone says that, but
in my observation it has been true.  So you're stuck
between a rock and a hard place.  You want the
maturity level of someone like him, but sometimes
those older men are too much of a headache.  I'm glad
you at least got to say your toughts.  I can't believe
you told him about the t-shirt!  Oh well, what did you
have to lose by getting it all out there.  I'm glad
your questions are answered now.  I guess there really
wasn't anything he could say to fix things between you
guys!  I guess you'll just have to keep going to Steak
Night.

Chris

Well, we met and had dinner last night.  NOTHING of importance was discussed 
during our entire meal and it was only when I brought things up as we were 
leaving that any actual talking occurred.  Here are the basics...

- There is definitely no ""us"" anymore...and I quote ""sometimes these things 
just fade out""
- There is much I didn't know about him and I am sure even more that I still 
don't
- Case in point...He was MARRIED before (yes, you read correctly married)
- Turns out he's been divorced about three years, it didn't end well and he 
hasn't had a relationship that has lasted beyond       2 mos. in those three 
years (even though, by his own admission, he has dated a lot) - Can you say 
issues?
- He told me ""I know this sounds so trite, but this really has nothing to do 
with you, it's all me.""  Of course I agreed with him saying ""I know it's you 
Ted, I don't have any problems."" (He got a chuckle out of that one)
- I told him about my frustrations and disappointment with how he had handled 
things and he apologised (evidently Kevin told him about our exchange at 
Steak Night) and I also let him know how much I appreciated his handling of 
things in the beginning
- I said I really hated animosity and hard feelings and that as long as he 
hadn't done anything truly horrible to me (i.e. murder a family member, etc.) 
I would really like to leave things on a good note...He agreed.
- He said I was a fantastic girl and that he still enjoyed hanging out and 
talking with me (although I don't see us doing a lot of that)

So all in all I walked away with three very important things 1. A lightened 
load (I got everything of my chest that I wanted to and needed to) 2. My 
dignity (I handled it just as I'd hoped...with composure and wit) 3. A 
clearer since of Ted as a person (He definitely has a lot of issues in his 
life he has not completely dealt with yet, and who knows if he ever will?)

Anyway, I'm okay with everything and surprisingly feel pretty good.  I'll 
talk to you soon.

Susan

By the way, I told him about the shirt idea (he thought it was funny, and 
maybe just a little harsh)"

Just talked to him around 6:15 (don't know exactly how to take that)...he was 
pretty ""jokey""...we'll probably get together tomorrow night...found out he 
has bought himself a pair of boots (ostrich - I don't think he's earned 
ostrich)...I think his job is REALLY stressing him out.

Alas, there is no point to steak night without Kori or myself.  There is good 
cause for your lack of enthusiasm.  

Tomorrow morning sounds good to me for a coffee/steamed almond milk break.  
How 'bout we shoot for around 9:30 (although I can do earlier or later if 
need be).  Let me know.

As for the week after next, anything from Wednesday night on will work for 
me.  I am in full agreement with you regarding a ""solid dinner"" (of limited 
attendance of course).

See you tomorrow,

Susan

situation?  Well, he's wrong.)

Let me know how your morning is looking tomorrow for coffee---or in my case 
steamed almond milk? Let me know. I will be here through Friday morning--must 
get back to P-Town for a little reprieve. By-the-way, not next week but the

Subject: Revised Contract Approval Request - Phillips Petroleum Company

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST

Phillips Petroleum Company's discount letter was recently approved by 
Transwestern's Officer group.   However, Phillips has now requested that 
Transwestern include language in the discount letter which guarantees the 
applicable discount rate in the event that Transwestern's minimum Tariff rate 
were to be higher than the discount rate.  I have underlined the additional 
language  in the attached revised discount letter (language will not be 
underlined when provided to Phillips).  The inclusion of this language would 
require Transwestern to file the discount as a negotiated rate prior to gas 
flow under the term of the amendment.  Transwestern would file this discount 
on January 31, 2001.

Please review the attached document and indicate approval via REPLY WITH 
HISTORY.
All Officer approvals will be sent to Bill Cordes for final President Level 
approval.

Aquarius:
      The conjunction between the Sun and Moon is a wonderful symbol of
                      togetherness and unity. You may have been feeling 
distinctly out of sorts
                      lately with your partner, and are sorely in need of 
some tender loving care.
                      Perhaps you both need to make the effort to be nice to 
each other. I mean
                      really nice, not just pretending. See now, isn't that a 
lot better! There's
                      mileage in this one yet."

Hey Susan.

I just got a call from Patricia Ritter which made me realize that we only 
have 1 month to play all of our games... and with my travel schedule getting 
booked I thought I should get a start on playing some games.  Are you 
available anytime soon?

Thursday nights are always out for me as I have school from 6-10.  Next week 
I will be out of the office Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  

Let me know.

Part of me is tempted to do the ""taste of your own medicine"" thing, but I was 
really disappointed that he took that approach (in this case I think email is 
very cowardly) and don't believe two wrongs make a right.  I insist on taking 
the high road in this situation no matter how tempting it might be to teach 
him a lesson.

I haven't done anything as of yet.  I just really didn't feel like responding 
to him on Friday (I was still pretty floored by the whole thing) and since 
he's out of town till tonight I spent yesterday and today figuring out what I 
want to do.  

I've decided the following...I'm going to give him a call tonight and agree 
to meet for a drink/chat.  I completely agree with you about regretting the 
things you don't do more than the things you do - besides I'm dying of 
curiosity about what he could possibly have to say.  Anyway, I want to try 
and do it tomorrow night so that I can quite turning it over and over in my 
head (I am absolutely sick of thinking about it).  I think it will be hard 
for me to be anything but distant talking to him because, regardless of his 
reasons, he definitely wasn't very considerate over the last few weeks.  Wish 
me luck! (Problem is I'm not sure what I really want the outcome to be).

FYI - Gary P. Nunn is going to be playing New Year's Eve at Gruene Hall.

On the Ted front...It's Tuesday afternoon and I haven't contacted him yet.  
I'm planning on calling him at home early this evening and telling him that 
""a beer and a chat sound like a good idea, how about tomorrow night?"".  I 
will be requesting that he either call me at home tonight if he gets in early 
enough or tomorrow at work.  This should all prove very interesting.

Lindy -- I'm working on a checklist.
There were just a couple of issues arising from the discussions with market 
services, weren't there?
One having to do with whether we want to change our 68 A to reflect FTS-1 and 
FTS-3 in same bucket -- I'm leaning towards not changing since the language 
is already general enough to cover us there.
The other issue had to do with issuing the OFO if EFBH does not show up in 
the last cycle.  I do not believe any changes are necessary there either.  
The tariff language as it's currently written says we ""shall"" issue an OFO, 
and we would, but an OFO issued in the last cycle would simply be a formality 
and the EFBH shipper would have no choice but to pay the penalty.
If you see any roadblocks on these 2 tariff sheets (27A and 68A), or if there 
are any other issues we need to address, let me know.  Also, if you want to 
sit down and go thru my checklist together sometime tomorrow, or even later 
this afternoon, I'm available.
Thanks!
S.

The effective date will be 2/23/2000.  Marketing does not anticipate offering 
the service until March 1, 2000.

Susan is working on the compliance tariff sheets right now to be filed 15 
days after the Order is issued (the Draft Order was issued last Thursday, so 
the final Order should be issued within a couple days after that).  The 
change I think you're referring to is the way we had anticipated prorating 
FTS-1 & FTS-3 together when FBH is showing-up and now, we actually will match 
FTS-3 with the FBH space and FTS-1 will be allocated ""existing"" space as 
usual.  Susan is looking at the tariff language now and is thinking a 
language change may not be necessary.  She will be discussing with Mary Kay.  
Regardless of which decision, it's being addressed.

Were there any other tariff language changes? (I know FTS-3 should be added 
to 22.2, D, 1.  Susan and Mary Darveaux are reviewing all the GT&C's to check 
for where FTS-3 &/or FBH should be referenced, etc.)

Please let me know.  Thanks!
Lindy

Lindy,  
Does this mean that the effective date will still be 2/23/2000?

Also did all of our changes that we discussed in our system requirement 
meetings get included in the revised tariff sheets?

What date will marketing start offering the service? I know we are still 
pushing to have the nominations, contracts, scheduling & confirmation system 
changes ready for 3/1/2000  production migration move.

Thanks Ramona

                   HOROSCOPE:     Weekly   -    His

                   For September 25-October 1: Instead of wishing
                   things were different, or woefully mourning the
                   past, build a new beginning. It's pointless to
                   bemoan recent changes or languish over
                   disappointments. You cannot change the past.
                   You cannot change people's minds, either. Face
                   your situation and create something wonderful.
                   The longer you fuss about what 'should have
                   been', the more likely it is that important
                   opportunities will drift by unnoticed. Cancer, it is
                   time for change. Release frustrations and
                   troubling memories. Move on, Crab. . . move
                   on. 


Mine for today

   Quickly get past a troubling misunderstanding
   Once you've released toxic feelings,
                   the atmosphere visibly improves, much to your
                   pleasure. You're able to replace fear and
                   resentment with compassion and
                   understanding. Once you know the score, you
                   no longer feel threatened or disrespected. Keep
                   revenge out of this entire episode. 'Teaching
                   someone a lesson' is not appropriate.

Subject: We have closure! (well, sort-of)

I'm soooo good.  The chosen path was cool, indifference.  

So, last night was Steak Night and with Nick and Wilson both in town we had a 
really good showing.  I got there about 7:30 with Nick, and the group's size 
swelled to about 12+ by 8:30 - 9:00.  About 8:00 I saw Kevin (Ted's pal - the 
one you meet a steak night) wandering around LW's obviously in search of 
someone.  Can you believe it?  He (Ted) knew I had organized this gathering - 
I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and 
overheard Darren encouraging Ted's attendance (mind you Ted was not in the 
email distribution) - and he had the nerve to come.  Anyway, Kevin saw me and 
came over to chat.  He informed me that ""our friend Ted should be there 
shortly"" to which I responded, ""You would know better than me at this 
point"".  The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again.  
He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms/ bad terms, etc.  I said there 
really weren't any terms, I just hadn't heard a peep out of him for about 2 
weeks.  Kevin wanted to know if I was going to break a bottle over Ted's head 
and cause a big scene.  When I said no, I think he was genuinely 
disappointed.  I said in order for me to do something like that I would have 
to care about the ""loss"" and that, while a week or two earlier I might have 
cared a bit more, with each passing day the ""loss"" seems less and less like 
much of a loss.  Kevin told me I was better-off without Ted.  To go even 
further, he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of 
his date Ted nor any of his ""girl-friends"".  He said that while he thought 
Ted was a great guy (i.e. fun to be around, good stories, etc.) he wasn't 
good dating material.  I agreed with Kevin saying ""Ted is a great guy, he 
just makes a lousy man"" (don't you like that one?).  I then went on to say 
""Anyway, I'm destined for bigger and better things, right?"".  Kevin: ""Much 
bigger and much better.""  About this time my parents showed up...the plot 
thickens.  I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin 
were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about.  The two 
of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when 
""dum-da-dum-dum"" Ted shows up.  He approaches our group because he sees Kevin 
and is forced to make eye-contact with me.  I give him a ""hey"" and he gives 
me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant ""how's it going?"".  He asked what 
Kevin and my Dad were talking about, I told him the Navy, he said don't get 
Kevin started or you'll never shut him up...Then he walked away.  He never 
acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the 
evening.  The beautiful thing is Kevin stays and talks with my Dad for 
another half hour and when Darren shows up he hangs out with ""my group"" for 
quite a while before going to join Ted.  My parents and I ate our steaks 
right behind Ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table 
when we were finished.  It really was a great night.  I would almost say I 
was glowing (I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it 
wasn't a show for Ted's benefit...I really was having a great time).  So, 
when my parents decide to head out they walked over to Ted/Kevin's table to 
say good-bye to Kevin.  It was awesome.  Ted's sitting right next to Kevin 
while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in 
his chair.  Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents - he couldn't even 
make eye-contact.  I ended up staying there for at least another hour and 
then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House.  Needless to say I was 
very hung over today.  Anyway, there's the story...He's a complete and utter 
ass-hole.  So I'm done.  And no, there is no way he could weasel his way back 
in to my good graces.  

Now on to a fun subject, my trip to London.  I bought my ticket today ( I 
think I got hosed a little bit, but it was the cheapest ticket I could find - 
$450 before taxes).  I will arrive at Heathrow airport around 7:00 a.m. 
Friday the 6th and depart about 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday the 10th.  I'm very 
excited about the trip, I really need to get out of Houston.  I leave the 
activities in your capable hands.  ( bear in mind I will have to see Darren 
and Nick at some point).

""Single again"" Sue


Bear in mind this next email wasn't sent until Friday afternoon (a full day 
and a half after the Steak Night debacle).

I tell ya Mo, it's weird.

                   HOROSCOPE:      Weekly  



                   For September 25-October 1: Better
                   communication is indicated this week. Issues
                   that have bogged you down are effectively
                   addressed. Don't get up and leave until you get
                   every answer you need. Be direct and honest,
                   without losing your temper. Even if others
                   misbehave, continue pursuing what you believe
                   is right. An agreement is either out of balance or
                   no longer desirable. You CAN make
                   improvements to existing paperwork, contracts,
                   and agreements -- as long as you remain
                   friendly, respectful, and well-prepared. There
                   can be no hostility on your end, or negotiations
                   will break down.

Em,

So, of course, I spent this whole past weekend trying to figure out how I 
want to handle this ""situation"".  Basically I've decided the following:
 1.  I will agree to meet him for a beer and a chat (I'm going to suggest 
Molina's - I think it's a good location, public enough & private enough)
 2.  I will be calling and leaving a message with him to let him know I will 
meet with him, NO email... and will request that he do me the same courtesy.
 3.  I will let him do the talking (I mean he's the one that wants to have a 
chat so he must have something to say)...at least to begin with
 4.  I will NOT be a push-over 

Well, what do you think?  Any suggestions/recommendations?  I am very new to 
this whole relationship discussion thing.  More importantly, do you think 
there is ANYTHING he could say/do that would or should allow him a second 
chance?  Right now I don't know if there is, but unlike you (and you know 
this about me) I do believe in second chances.  That does not mean that a 
second chance is a given in this situation.  Get back to me when you get a 
chance.  

Susan

- - I just know I would always regret not meeting with him Em.  This is a 
chance for me to prove that I can handle myself with maturity and dignity 
even with my emotions on the line.  I think ultimately, regardless of the 
outcome, it will make me a stronger person.  By the way,  we will definitely 
cover the past relationships during this chat, that is a given.

are right not jumping to return his e mail.  What a
coward, that he had to e mail you and didn't even have
the decency to call you.  What a weirdo!

It's kind of funny, everybody has the same feeling about the ""Ted situation"" 
- utter disappointment.  But yes, it is definitely his loss.  And, I loved 
the fact that Kevin (his friend) spent so much time talking to my Dad because 
that had to make Ted feel like a complete jerk (which he is).

I'm am very excited about my trip to London.  The other guy I mentioned in 
the email, Darren, is going to be working over there for a few months so I'll 
get to see him there as well.  Plus, in November I'm going to visit my 
brother and his wife in South Korea which should be interesting.  The globe 
trotting continues.

Your weekend sounds like it's going to be pretty fun.  I wish I could be 
there as well, but it is football season so I will be in Austin this 
weekend.  I've signed up for all these internet airfare specials though, so 
if some great fares come up for Houston to San Diego I can take advantage of 
them.  Talk to you soon.

Susan

- - Deep down I think I knew there was something wrong with him.  I think 
that's why I never pressed about the past relationships thing (you know, 
afraid of what I might find out)."

My several hours of on-line research on this last Sept. turned up nothing on 
point.  The only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of 
contracts in a certificate context was one I'll excerpt here:

**
 In Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C., 80 FERC P 61,346 (1997), 
Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it 
submitted. Commission staff denied the blanket request, but indicated that 
Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential. 
Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off 
dates [FN29] in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such 
information was commercially sensitive. On the other hand, Maritimes 
requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept 
confidential, but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years 
public. Generally, the Commission will deny blanket requests for 
confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market 
support for new facilities. [FN30] However, in the instance case, the 
contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and, thus, evidence of 
longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and 
support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed 
services. Therefore, we find no compelling reason to require the length of 
the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut-off dates to be made 
public. 

FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could 
terminate contingent on the
occurrence of certain events.

FN30 See, e.g., Colorado Interstate Gas Company, 76 FERC P 61,291 (1996).
**

In Amoco Production Company and Amoco Energy Trading Company V. Natural Gas 
Pipeline Company of America, 82 FERC P 61,037 (1998), which involved a 
request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement, the Commission 
explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment 
but transportation contracts should not:  

the Commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a 
different
footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are 
subject to similar disclosure
requirements. In ANR Pipeline Co., the Commission explained that unlike gas 
sales in a
competitive market, transportation of natural gas is still regulated under 
the assumption that the pipeline
exercises market power. Even where transportation competition exists, that 
competition is from other
pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting 
requirements. 

There were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the 
context of Section 4 cases.  

Just to make sure I found everything, I'll do some follow up sometime in the 
next few days and let you know if I find anything.

I'm soooo good.  The chosen path was cool, indifference.  

So, last night was Steak Night and with Nick and Wilson both in town we had a 
really good showing.  I got there about 7:30 with Nick, and the group's size 
swelled to about 12+ by 8:30 - 9:00.  About 8:00 I saw Kevin (Ted's pal - the 
one you meet a steak night) wandering around LW's obviously in search of 
someone.  Can you believe it?  He (Ted) knew I had organized this gathering - 
I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and 
overheard Darren encouraging Ted's attendance (mind you Ted was not in the 
email distribution) - and he had the nerve to come.  Anyway, Kevin saw me and 
came over to chat.  He informed me that ""our friend Ted should be there 
shortly"" to which I responded, ""You would know better than me at this 
point"".  The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again.  
He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms/ bad terms, etc.  I said there 
really weren't any terms, I just hadn't heard a peep out of him for about 2 
weeks.  Kevin wanted to know if I was going to break a bottle over Ted's head 
and cause a big scene.  When I said no, I think he was genuinely 
disappointed.  I said in order for me to do something like that I would have 
to care about the ""loss"" and that, while a week or two earlier I might have 
cared a bit more, with each passing day the ""loss"" seems less and less like 
much of a loss.  Kevin told me I was better-off without Ted.  To go even 
further, he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of 
his date Ted nor any of his ""girl-friends"".  He said that while he thought 
Ted was a great guy (i.e. fun to be around, good stories, etc.) he wasn't 
good dating material.  I agreed with Kevin saying ""Ted is a great guy, he 
just makes a lousy man"" (don't you like that one?).  I then went on to say 
""Anyway, I'm destined for bigger and better things, right?"".  Kevin: ""Much 
bigger and much better.""  About this time my parents showed up...the plot 
thickens.  I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin 
were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about.  The two 
of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when 
""dum-da-dum-dum"" Ted shows up.  He approaches our group because he sees Kevin 
and is forced to make eye-contact with me.  I give him a ""hey"" and he gives 
me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant ""how's it going?"".  He asked what 
Kevin and my Dad were talking about, I told him the Navy, he said don't get 
Kevin started or you'll never shut him up...Then he walked away.  He never 
acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the 
evening.  The beautiful thing is Kevin stays and talks with my Dad for 
another half hour and when Darren shows up he hangs out with ""my group"" for 
quite a while before going to join Ted.  My parents and I ate our steaks 
right behind Ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table 
when we were finished.  It really was a great night.  I would almost say I 
was glowing (I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it 
wasn't a show for Ted's benefit...I really was having a great time).  So, 
when my parents decide to head out they walked over to Ted/Kevin's table to 
say good-bye to Kevin.  It was awesome.  Ted's sitting right next to Kevin 
while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in 
his chair.  Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents - he couldn't even 
make eye-contact.  I ended up staying there for at least another hour and 
then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House.  Needless to say I was 
very hung over today.  Anyway, there's the story...He's a complete and utter 
ass-hole.  So I'm done.  And no, there is no way he could weasel his way back 
in to my good graces.  

Now on to a fun subject, my trip to London.  I bought my ticket today ( I 
think I got hosed a little bit, but it was the cheapest ticket I could find - 
$450 before taxes).  I will arrive at Heathrow airport around 7:00 a.m. 
Friday the 6th and depart about 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday the 10th.  I'm very 
excited about the trip, I really need to get out of Houston.  I leave the 
activities in your capable hands.  ( bear in mind I will have to see Darren 
and Nick at some point).

In an effort to save a little time I'm forwarding you the email I just sent 
my friend Emily in London.  Get back to me if you would like me to expound on 
anything.  Turns out he's a real jerk.

I'm soooo good.  The chosen path was cool, indifference.  

So, last night was Steak Night and with Nick and Wilson both in town we had a 
really good showing.  I got there about 7:30 with Nick, and the group's size 
swelled to about 12+ by 8:30 - 9:00.  About 8:00 I saw Kevin (Ted's pal - the 
one you meet a steak night) wandering around LW's obviously in search of 
someone.  Can you believe it?  He (Ted) knew I had organized this gathering - 
I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and 
overheard Darren encouraging Ted's attendance (mind you Ted was not in the 
email distribution) - and he had the nerve to come.  Anyway, Kevin saw me and 
came over to chat.  He informed me that ""our friend Ted should be there 
shortly"" to which I responded, ""You would know better than me at this 
point"".  The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again.  
He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms/ bad terms, etc.  I said there 
really weren't any terms, I just hadn't heard a peep out of him for about 2 
weeks.  Kevin wanted to know if I was going to break a bottle over Ted's head 
and cause a big scene.  When I said no, I think he was genuinely 
disappointed.  I said in order for me to do something like that I would have 
to care about the ""loss"" and that, while a week or two earlier I might have 
cared a bit more, with each passing day the ""loss"" seems less and less like 
much of a loss.  Kevin told me I was better-off without Ted.  To go even 
further, he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of 
his date Ted nor any of his ""girl-friends"".  He said that while he thought 
Ted was a great guy (i.e. fun to be around, good stories, etc.) he wasn't 
good dating material.  I agreed with Kevin saying ""Ted is a great guy, he 
just makes a lousy man"" (don't you like that one?).  I then went on to say 
""Anyway, I'm destined for bigger and better things, right?"".  Kevin: ""Much 
bigger and much better.""  About this time my parents showed up...the plot 
thickens.  I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin 
were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about.  The two 
of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when 
""dum-da-dum-dum"" Ted shows up.  He approaches our group because he sees Kevin 
and is forced to make eye-contact with me.  I give him a ""hey"" and he gives

Hey Wilson,

Steak night is on...And, yes Darren really did give me your keys and I've 
already handed them off to Ben.  Also, you'll be interested to know that my 
parents might make it tonight for a little while so you may get to meet 
them.  See you tonight.

Thanks for the advice/humor.  I'm feeling much better today.  I knew 
yesterday was going to be pretty rough and not much fun as his communication 
or lack thereof would speak volumes.  (And his silence definitely said a lot)

Everyone's pretty much on the same page as far as their disappointment in 
said individual goes.  I think we all expected a little bit more out of him.  
Oh well, so I'm single again.  Just think how incredible it'll be when I find 
someone I feel even more for than Ted (at least that's what I'm focusing 
on).  So do we know if Pat Fitzgerald is single?

Anyway, I've found I'm not that attracted to cowards (which is exactly the 
catagory I'd put Ted in right now).

Hope everything's good with you (especially the firm recruiting).  I'm coming 
up this weekend for the game - hopefully Friday night - and wanted to see if 
you and Doug wanted to go out either Friday night or after the game 
Saturday.  I hope you guys are planning on going to the game because I'd love 
to sit with you.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

PS - Check out the list of individuals for our girls night out the Thurs...I 
don't think I'm going to go (I don't have enough time to waste on people I'm 
not that fond of)

Hi Susan.

Sorry I didn't respond to your email yesterday.  I opened it in between
classes, but never got back to my comouter and was out eating with a firm
until 11:00.  I will be glad when all of this is over.

The jury is split on what you should do.  Knowing myself, I would want to
know what happened...  i.e. what's the matter with him?  I think I would ask
him-- in a non-confrontational-- almost joking way-- like I didn't really
care either way but was just wondering-- why he stopped calling, etc.  I say
that, but I have never done that before, so I don't really know if that is
what I wish I would do, or if that really is what I would do-- and this has
happened to me lots of times.  Usually, I just write the guy off as gay or
stupid...

Leslie (and though I haven't talked to my mom, I know she would agree) says
not to give him any satisfaction of knowing you care.  Just act pleasant and
normal as if nothing has happened and is if you were actually the one who
stopped the contact-- maybe he thinks you were, you never know.  I think
this is a good tactic if you are sure your curiosity and need to tell him
off won't eat at you.

Actually, in practice, I usually combine these tactics.  Remember when
Michael Stockton was so rude to me freshman year?  First I called him and
told him off (Laura made me), then I ignored him (pleasantly, though)for
about four months until he couldn't stand it and started asking Laura about
me.

In other words, both tactics are good.  I really think you ought to do what
makes you feel the best.  If you confront him, he might say something you
don't want to hear, but then again, you will get some resolution.  If you
don't confront him, you can always chalk it up to his homosexuality and you
can feel better knowing he thinks you don't care...

If I ever see him again, I will ignore him (blatantly).

Don't worry about it too much-- we should feel sorry for people who are
still confused about their sexuality at 31.  Isn't he a little old to be
living in the closet?

Let me know what happens.

-Corey

Here is a draft of the compliance filing regarding our operational control 
agreement with ECS.  Please let me know your comments by C.O.B. tomorrow.  At 
this point I'm not planning to file the agreement, just a report as requested 
by the Commission.

I'm still working with ECS to finalize the agreement.  Their attorney is 
checking with his resident experts to make sure ECS, by expressly giving TW 
Operational Control, does not somehow cross the line into retail wheeling.  I 
do not expect the agreement to change significantly.

Hey Corey,

So he's back in town now...The question is what do I do about that?  Should 
I:  A) Completey ignore him and pretend like there was never anything between 
us or B) Call him out and confront him with his own cowardess.  I am 
completely torn on the issue and have actually felt physically ill over the 
situation the last two days.  Help!!!

Okay gang, it's time to rally the troops.  Evidently last week wasn't good 
for any of us to get together at our local watering hole (a.k.a Little 
Woodrow's)...but, I'm hoping the story is a little different this week.  Our 
own Nick Stephan is back in H-town for the week and has made a special 
request for a full-fledged ""Steak Night"" (that means good attendance).  Not 
that I ever need an excuse to enjoy good company, steak, beer, etc. at LW's, 
but if I did I could think of few better reasons than a visiting ex-pat.  
Besides, given the absolutely beautiful weather we are currently enjoying, 
the picnic tables and deck are beckoning.  I'm going to set a tentative 
meeting time of 7:30 p.m. this Wednesday...get back to me at your convenience 
and let me know if we should stick with that time or not.  Hope everyone had 
a relaxing weekend and is having a good Monday (isn't that an oxymoron?).

Susan

Hey,

Try lgillet@enron.com for Lisa's email address.  Glad to hear you're in the 
new pad...in the interest of saving $$$ I will probably take you up on the 
futon offer.  

Well, it's Monday and I'm assuming Ted's back in town (not that I've heard a 
peep out of him).  I'm very much at a cross-roads with the situation.  On the 
one hand, I want to be unaffected and aloof and on the other hand I don't 
want to make this that easy for him.  I think I deserve more that just being 
swept under the rug.  So, my debate becomes - Do I just let this thing go all 
together OR do I try and get some resolution?  

I would love to get a call from you hear at work.  The best time for me is 
probably before 11:30 or after 12:30 Houston time.  

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Just to forewarn you two, it looks like Darren (Ted's buddy) is going to be 
in London for a few months working on a project.  When I mentioned you two 
were both over there right now he asked me for your email addresses.  No 
pressure for you guys to do anything with him, but I do like the guy and 
think when I come over we will definitely have to do something with him (and 
Nick too of course...maybe the same night, that whole ""kill two birds with 
one stone concept"").  

Sue

Side-note:  I'm am dying of curiosity as to why Darren is going to London for 
a project and Ted is trading corn here.  Maybe I'll find out before Darren 
leaves.  
       Who knows, maybe if you all see Darren over there you can find out 
what the heck happened with our once so promising Mr. Noble."

Do tell, Do tell.

Darren,

What's the word?  So when do you head over to London and what pray-tell will 
you be doing over there.  I'm planning on going to visit Em and Katy around 
the first weekend of October (sometime between the 4th and 10th), if you're 
going to be over there we need to all go out.  I don't remember if we ever 
talked about it or not, but I may try to do my third rotation there...the 
horror, Em and me set loose upon the unsuspecting citizens of London.  
Anyway, I'm assuming congratulations are in order, so congrats on the new 
assignment.

Here are Katy and Emily's email addresses.  I don't have phone #'s, etc. as 
of yet but I could get them for you if you'd like.  I'll be sure to shoot off 
an email to both of them to let them know you're going to be over there.

   katyhester@hotmail.com
   ehillegeist@hotmail.com

Susan

PS - We will definitely be doing Steak Night next week if you have any 
interest...a guy who used to work in Ben's old group (and is now trading 
credit derivatives in London...see how I'm hooking you up with all these 
connections) will be in town and is dying to go have steak and beer.  
Besides, it would be wrong for you to leave the country without a proper 
send-off from Little Woodrow's (Now I going to owe you a Bon Voyage beer as 
well as a birthday beer).

So who's up for doing something that Friday night?  I'll probably be in 
Austin Saturday for the football game, but am definitely interested in 
getting together with everyone.  Obviously this is planning WAY in advance 
for this group so we can revisit the topic when Wilson's arrival is a little 
bit closer.  Talk to y'all then.

Hey, evidently I'm not the only one slacking on the emails - That means you 
Em.

Quick update:  I may try to come over Oct 5 - 10 instead of the 4 - 9 so that 
I can at least spend a little time with Katy.  How will that work for y'all?

Sue

P.S. - Thought you'd like to know that I am doing well in regards to the Ted 
situation.  I'm actually kind of glad he took this week long vacation...that 
whole out-of-sight, out-of-mind theory really works.

Subject: Enron Presentation

Dear Recruiting Team Members:

I am forwarding a copy of the Enron presentation to each of you for review.  
Some of you will be asked to do presentations, many will not.  I just wanted 
to send it out to various team members in order to give you an idea of our 
marketing strategy and information on campus.  This is simply for your 
information.  When this presentation is given, it will include  dates 
tailored specifically for each campus based on the dates I have set up 
through career services.

Have a great day!

These horoscopes can not possibly be speaking to every Aquarian out there.  
I'm convinced the author is someone I know...I would suggest it was my Mom, 
but 
her insight and advice would never be this good. 

Aquarius 
      For September 14: You have a knack for bringing people together and
                     creating peace. Part of your success in waging peace is 
derived from a desire
                     to let go of resentment and a bulging catalog of woe. 
You're sick and tired of
                     feeling sick and tired, and look forward to a refreshing 
sensation of starting
                     anew. Seriously consider hatching deferred dreams today. 
What's stopping
                     you?

boys suck!  i think we may have a comittment-phobe on our hands- ie, when
things actually progress, panick and back out- graceful or not- too intense!

angry and disappointed- but please bear in mind- this is the result of HIS
character flaws, not yours.  AND, as we've droned on and on about, we
shouldn't have to settle.  ever.  sue, you've just met mr. 90%- and isn't it
funny how that last 10% seems to mean EVERYTHING?!!!?  w/o being too abrupt,
as outside council i'd advise a serious fracturing of this 'relationship'.
he's given you no definition, very little respect, and enough mixed and
incomplete messages to keep you wondering and holding out for that perfect
sign, or comment that will make everything fall into place- NOT FAIR.
you're simply too good to tolerate that bullshit, and you'd be doing
yourself a disservice to stand for it.  i guess you kind of dictate how
people can treat you by what you're willing to put up with.  you're worth
alot more, and you're not desperate...lonely, maybe, but it's not the same.
ok- i'm getting angry just writing about this!  anyways- love my classes,

nice to be reminded of how much more there is than texas, no matter how
great it is.  am looking forward to my new place (should be in this weekend)
and starting to travel.....can't wait for your visit- you'll like claudia-
she'll be a great partner in crime for going out, til you arrive, and the
circle widens, j'espere!  double check w/ kates about when she gets back
from egypt- i know she's gone over my b-day, so i hope she'll be back by the
time you get here.  plus, would be good for you to be here for her 'party'
at the texas embassy....must go to class, but hang in there, and start

You crack me up...I absolutely loved the trading analogy (at times your 
insight is frighteningly dead on).  

Don't worry about me though.  I will be patient and remain optimistic, 
despite let downs.  And, in no way, shape or form will I settle and end up 
with some dush.  You would have been proud of me though, for the first time I 
was really able to let down a lot of those walls and be a little more 
vulnerable.  

I'm thrilled things are going so well with Shannon.  I think your attitude 
about the whole situation is extremely healthy and mature (it amazing what 
happens when you care more about the other person than yourself). 

Talk to you soon,

Susan

Thanks for the email.  Your candid comments make me wish I was over there 
right now sitting in a pub with you and Katy drinking a pint.  I am in full 
agreement that guys suck and have discovered through this situation an area 
in which 23 does not differ from 31...cowardess (As my Dad so eloquently put 
it, ""He's just chicken-shit"").  So, the plan of attack for the time being is 
none.  I am not going to do anything (that means no emails, no phone calls, 
no nothing).  Of course it's a lot easier to say that knowing he's in an 
entirely different state vs. two floors down from me, so next week will be 
the true test.  You will be happy to know, however, that I do have a good 
support system in Monique.  She is a firm advocate of the ""drop him and make 
him work should he happen to come crawling back"" school.  You know what 
really kills me though is the thought that, yet again, I will ultimately be 
disappointed by someone I truly expected more out of (I keep thinking about 
all the times I said ""I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop."" - well, 
it dropped) .  Anyway, I've have decided to throw myself into work, books, 
exercise, etc. in a effort to distract my mind from other things - it's kind 
of working.  

I'm really glad you are in enjoying things so much right now.  You have to 
email me back with more details regarding the new pad, like will there be 
enough room for me to crash there when I come to visit (if not, I'm sure Nick 
would put me up - scarey).  Also, I sent Katy an email about coming to visit 
so hopefully we can get everything squared away soon.  FYI:  The Longhorns 
beat Louisiana Lafayette 52-10 last Saturday (the game was fun, but extremely 
HOT!!!), it was a real nail biter.  
Talk to you soon,

Sue

*** Don't worry about me thinking any of this is in any way due to a 
shortcoming on my part.  I don't.  Rather, I am convinced he wasn't expecting 
the full package when we first went out and as soon as he realized that I 
was, he freaked.  I'm beginning to think it's more than just a coincidence 
that the last time we went out I let down one of the last walls I was holding 
up as far as trusting him and it was right after that that he started acting 
aloof. (Things that make you go hmmm.)"

Here's what I propose to send to the parties on the 14th.  Take a look, and 
think about whether it would be wise to do more selling in the first 
paragraph.  I propose that we get on the agenda for the March 1 meeting so 
that we have some time to approach individual parties first.  

With your permission, I will forward this to Mr. Dasovich also.

Hey Katy,

Sorry no correspondence in a while.  I wish it was a case of no news is good 
news, but if you've spoken with Em recently you know that is not so.  Anyway, 
I wanted to touch base with you regarding my visit to London.  I of course 
want to try and time it when both you and Em are in town.  So...I was 
thinking of flying out on Oct 4 and returning Oct 9, that way I would have a 
weekend over there with y'all.  I know you're planning a trip to Egypt around 
then so just get back to me and let me know if you'll actually be in London 
any of those days.  Hope all is well with you.

Talk to you soon,

Thanks for the prompt response.  Sorry you won't be able to make it, but I 
will definitely keep you posted regarding any future group outings

...okay, maybe it's not THAT good but it's cooked and the beer is plentiful.

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to test the waters and see what kind of interest there was in 
doing Steak Night tomorrow night at Little Woodrows.  I feel like it's been a 
while since we really rallied the troops and I know I have personally missed 
the interaction.  It's also been a while since we've attempted to solve the 
worlds problems over cold Shiner and I think the world may be the worse for 
it.  So, get back to me and let me know if anyone's up for an evening of 
eating, drinking and most definitely being merry.  If it looks like 'a go', 
I'll shoot everyone a follow-up email complete with ETA.

The one and only,

Well, I'm sure you've already heard through Mom...but I think things may be 
kaput with Ted.  I say ""think"" because he hasn't said anything one way or the 
other, it's just a vibe I have.  So I don't think you guys are going to have 
a chance to meet him while your in Houston.  Oh well, it was definitely fun 
while things were going well so I suppose I should focus on that.  I just 
want to know why guys can be such, as dad would say, chicken shits (excuse my 
language but the description fits).

But enough about me...So how are things with you guys.  I hope all is well 
and that you're taking full advantage of all the 'culture' surrounding you.  
We went to the first football game of the season Saturday (against Louisiana 
Lafayette).  Texas won 52-10, and you wouldn't know if from the score but the 
1st quarter was a little bit scarey (0-10).  Simms started the game but only 
played about 2 series before they yanked him and put Applewhite in to put 
some points on the board.  Simms did come back in the second half and through 
a touch-down pass.  The family's good and we're all excited to see you guys 
in the near future.

Write back soon,
Susan

I was wondering if you had fallen off the face of the earth...

It is definitely good to hear from you, I was just thinking about you today 
and wondering what you're up to.  Things in Houston are pretty good.  I went 
to San Diego over Labor Day weekend to visit a friend of mine there and just 
went to Austin this past weekend for the first UT football game (I know 
you're not a big fan but they are very fun).  As for work, all is well.  I'm 
actually going to meet with the development manager for the analyst program 
to discuss what my options are after this second rotation is up.  Of course 
my goal is to do a rotation in London for a year and then get promoted to the 
Associate program (so basically I'm going to ask this lady tomorrow what I 
need to do to ensure that outcome).  Honestly, I think my odds are pretty 
good.  

Glad to hear everything with you is going so well, not that I'm surprised.  
Congrats on the new responsibilites they must be keeping you pretty busy up 
there (any trips scheduled to Houston in the near future?).

As for my social life...if you would of asked me a week or two ago I would 
have said fantastic, incredible, etc.  Now, I just don't know.  For the life 
of me I am never going to be able to figure out your gender.  But as they 
say, ""Hope springs eternal"" and I intend to remain an optimist despite many 
road blocks.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Hope your move into the new apartment went well.  I'm sure you are going  to 
have so much fun living there, especially since you really will have a 
roommate now.

Thought I'd give you a little bit of an update regarding Ted...

So I didn't get back to the office until Wednesday last week because I was in 
Austin Tuesday for that recruiting trip.  When I got in I of course 
immediately checked my email...nothing.  I also didn't have any messages at 
any of the 3 phones I can be reached through.  Come Thursday afternoon, still 
no interaction...I am pissed.  About 2:00 p.m. he calls.  He asks me about 
San Diego and I ask him about Austin...both trips were great.  We discuss 
UCLA and UT football for  a while...I of course get riled up.  He informs me 
that he is going to be trading corn (yes, you heard me corn) for Enron.  
While he is very excited about trading I get the impression he feels a little 
overwhelmed and he is a very concerned about how much trading will limit his 
vacation time.  He said that he and Darren (the guy he works with) had been 
meeting with consultants all week to get up to speed and therefore the week 
had pretty much just been one long meeting.  It is around this time that he 
brings up the vacation thing and how, to his dismay, as a trader you work 
when the markets are open and you're only off when they're closed.  As a 
result, he's decided to get in his long visit home ASAP, i.e. ""I'm leaving 
tomorrow (Friday) to go to California for a week.""  I make sure I heard him 
correctly and yes he said leaving, tomorrow and  1 whole week (7 days) AND at 
no point does he ask to get together before he leaves.  So, that was 
Thursday.  I'm down on his floor again on Friday to talk to my old group and, 
to my dismay, run in to him.  We exchange pleasantries, I ask him when he's 
leaving (5:00 p.m.), he informs me he is going to sleep for the entire week 
in an attempt to catch-up, I tell him to have fun and that's that.

Anyway, I was not able to get him out for a drink to find out what's going on 
and now I just have to wait.  Any thoughts?

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Cynthia,

All of the deals below have been rebooked except for the one in red.  For 
some reason I can't find the counterparty in the system.  You may want to 
check and see if it has been set up yet, if it has let me know the proper 
name (I may be looking for the wrong counterparty) and I will rebook it as 
well.

Thanks,
Susan

Hi Susan:
Can you set up the counterparties for the 
following missing deals?  

NW8878 legs 5-8
NW8903 legs 5-6
NW9742 legs 3-4
NW9790 legs 1-2, 4
NX1037 legs 1-2
NX3659 legs 1-4
NX3790 legs 1-4

I don't know what you're schedule is and I
know that you're probably really busy.  But,
let me know when you would be able to 
set these up.  These are the leftover deals
from that original list that I submitted to you.
Thanks for all your help!  I am pulling across
all the new ones that you set up for me last week.
I really appreciate it!

Hey Em,

First things first, I got the personality test...very interesting.  I took it 
twice.  The first time I was a Mastermind (like Katy) and the second I was a 
Mentor (like Matt)  I think I only changed two answers between the first and 
second test.  Anyway, definitely a fun little intro to a rather boring Monday 
morning.

I was trying to remember where we left on in the saga of Ted Noble.  I guess 
the last time I had emailed you Ted had to spend the night at Darren's 
apartment because he'd left his keys in his locker at the Met.  Well, if 
you'll remember at the end of the email he said he'd talk to me later, which 
is extremely relevant considering he was supposed to tell me whether we could 
go get a drink that night or not.  I knew he had his presentation that day so 
I figured he'd call later that afternoon to tell me yeah or neah...I received 
no call, no email, no nothing.  Of course, always wanting to give others the 
benefit of the doubt I figured the presentation must have taken longer than 
expected and afterward he'd decided to just go to Austin and pick up his 
friend from the airport.  If that were the case, knowing Ted, I thought he 
must have just forgotten that he'd told me he'd call.  WRONG!!!!  Friday at 
work I had to go down to his floor (for legitimate reasons I swear) and he 
was there, the jerk.  He didn't see me though nor did he try communicate with 
me at all that day.  

Flash forward to the next week.  I didn't get back to the office until 
Wednesday because I was in Austin Tuesday for a recruiting trip.  When I got 
in I of course immediately checked my email...nothing.  I also didn't have 
any messages at any of the 3 phones I can be reached through.  So it's now 
Thursday afternoon, still no interaction...I am pissed.  About 2:00 p.m. he 
calls.  He asks me about San Diego and I ask him about Austin...both trips 
were great.  We discuss UCLA and UT football for  a while...I of course get 
riled up.  He informs me that he is going to be trading corn (yes, you heard 
me corn) for Enron.  While he is very excited about trading I get the 
impression he feels a little overwhelmed and he is a very concerned about how 
much trading will limit his vacation time.  He said that he and Darren had 
been meeting with consultants all week to get up to speed and therefore the 
week had pretty much just been one long string of meetings.  It is around 
this point that he brings up the vacation thing and how, to his dismay, as a 
trader you work when the markets are open and you're only off when they're 
closed.  As a result, he's decided to get in his long visit home ASAP, i.e. 
""I'm leaving tomorrow (Friday) to go to California for a week.""  I make sure 
I heard him correctly and yes he said leaving, tomorrow and  1 whole week (7 
days) AND at no point did he ask to get together before he left.  So, that 
was Thursday.  I'm down on his floor again on Friday to talk to my old group 
and, to my dismay, run in to him.  We exchange pleasantries, I ask him when 
he's leaving, he informs me he is going to sleep for the entire week in an 
attempt to catch-up, I tell him to have fun and that's that.

So here we are, or rather here I am in Houston...alone.  Any thoughts?

On a brighter note, tell Katy I think I'm going to try and come Oct 4 - Oct 9 
so that I can see both of you.  Also, I understand your dilemma regarding 
Claudia, but I definitely don't think you should look a gift horse in the 
mouth (if you know what I mean).  That first month after Katy leaves is going 
to be awkward so it's best to have someone there even if only to act as a 
crutch until you find your footing.  I'm sure Monique can testify to a little 
extra weight dealing with me since you and Matt both took off.  And speaking 
of Matt, no I haven't heard a thing from the turn-coat.  I need to shoot him 
an email and see how things are shaping up for him.  I'm willing to bet 
though that moving to Austin hasn't solved all of his problems...just 
transplanted to a prettier location.

Get back to me with anything...I'm desperate for positive energy.  Oh, and 
I'm going to try to meet with that Director friend of mine this week to talk 
about swinging a rotation in London (he has 75 employees over there that work 
for him right now), and I'm going to set up a meeting with the lady in charge 
of my rotations within the analyst program to make sure I'm doing everything 
I can to get over there and still get promoted.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

The reservation charge reduction applicable to TW's failure to deliver gas 
under certain circumstances does NOT apply to either force majeure events or 
periods of unscheduled maintenance less than 10 days in any calendar 
quarter.  Unscheduled maintenance is defined as unanticipated or unplanned 
maintenance on the pipeline system required to be performed to ensure that 
gas continues to flow in months other than Dec., Jan., Feb., July and Aug.  

Assuming we could even classify the proposed activity as ""maintenance,"" I'm 
not sure we could get away with saying it was unanticipated or unplanned, as 
the Gallup expansion has been in the works for some time.  I am also not 
completely comfortable calling this ""force majeure"" because part of the 
tariff definition is that the event was not within the control of either 
party; however, since the definition does include ""binding order of any court 
or governmental authority,"" we could possibly say this is force majeure if 
we're reducing the pressure in order to comply with a DOT pipeline safety 
rule.  (In that event, our notice on the EBB would be a force majeure 
notice.)  If not, we can argue that since this is not ""maintenance,"" but 
simply being done to construct the expansion in a safe and prudent manner, 
the shippers' rights are not triggered under the reservation charge reduction 
provisions.  In that case, damages (if any) would have to be pursued under 
ordinary contract law.  

I realize that this is not a very satisfactory answer; however, the outage is 
going to be relatively short, and no shipper in recent memory has availed 
itself of the reservation charge reduction.  I recommend we give shippers 
reasonable notice of the pressure reduction so that they can make alternate 
plans -- this will reduce the likelihood that they will feel revengeful.

Please call (x30596) or e-mail if you have further questions."

Cheryl,

The deal was done with one of the California Power Books.  We use the 
ECC/RISKMANTRA to book any deal with an Enron subsidiary...not just Canadian 
deals.  So, I don't think this deal has anything to do with the Canada 
office.  Let me know if you need more information.

Hi Susan

I am trying to verify the liquidations for financial close and noted that 
TAGG deal NK4420.1 entered by yourself
shows ECC (Enron Canada Corp) as the counterparty.

Here in Canada, we do not to deals at NGI-PGE/CG and I do not believe that 
the book PWR-NG-LTCA is a Canadian
book.  A review of the audit trial indicates that the counterparty used to be 
EPMI.  Is it possible it was changed by
mistake to ECC.

Can you please look into this deal first thing Monday morning as we need to 
book the liquidations Monday am for
financial close and let me know what you think about this deal.

Thanks for your help.

Cheryl

Gwen,

Dolores Muzzy gave me your name as a contact for information regarding the 
redesigned Analyst/Associate programs.  I am currently half-way through my 
second rotation with the Analyst program and was hoping to get a better idea 
of the different opportunities available to me upon completion of my current 
rotation.  Although six months seems like a fair amount of time to plan my 
next move, I know how quickly it will pass and do not want to find myself 
uncertain as to what action to take to insure that I am heading in the right 
direction to meet my current goals.  I would appreciate the opportunity to 
meet with you and discuss the aforementioned topics at your earliest 
convenience.  If there is another individual you feel would be a better 
contact for me at this point I would be happy to meet with them as well. 

Thank you,

Dolores,

I was wondering who my best resource would be to talk to about the changes to 
the analyst program and how they affect me.  Specifically, I wanted to get 
some more information on the Third-Year Analyst Rotation and its requirements 
(as I am currently half-way through my second rotation), as well as the 
different tracks available within the program.  If you could direct to the

Scott,

Thanks for offering up your extra tickets to the game this weekend.  As it 
turns out, I don't think I'll be needing them - My sister has extra tickets 
next to she and my brother-in-law.  Hope you have a great time and maybe I'll 
see you at the game (although given the crowd I'm not going to count on it).

Susan

- - Looks like Saturday's going to be a balmy 90...better bring a sweater."

 Parties represented at an informal meeting after the February 7, 2000 
prehearing conference discussed circulating redlined versions of the CAC 
settlement proposal as a point of departure for further settlement 
conferences.  Transwestern Pipeline Company submits the following comments in 
lieu of a redlined document.

 Transwestern fully supports the CAC's proposal of a path-defined receipt 
point structure that would define primary and secondary rights at receipt 
points on the SoCalGas system. Not only does the proposal satisfy the 
Commission's requirement that Hector Road be established as a formal receipt 
point, it is also consistent with open and non-discriminatory access and use 
of the SoCalGas system, and will help provide a reasonable degree of 
certainty so that all market participants can more effectively plan gas 
transportation.  CAC's proposed receipt point principles ensure that no 
upstream transportation provider will unduly be denied access to SoCal's 
system.

 Transwestern believes that the parties may still need to address certain 
details regarding implementation of the receipt point proposal that have not 
been fully described in the CAC document.  To this end, Transwestern proposes 
that implementation of the receipt point proposal be included on the agenda 
for the upcoming all-party settlement discussions.  Transwestern looks 
forward to a constructive discussion of the proposal and is confident that 
the parties will be able to agree on a plan for implementation.

Em,

I cannot believe you ran into Ben Affleck!!!  I'm sure it's just the first of 
many celebrity sightings you will have in Jolly Old England.  I had an 
absolutely incredible time in San Diego with Julie.  We went to the beach 
(where I was able to lay-out and not sweat!), shopped a ton, attended the 
symphony and got messages.  All in all it was an extremely relaxing weekend.  
Yesterday, I was in Austin for a recruiting trip and got to see Corey's new 
house in Hyde Park - very cute.  

So I got back to work today, Wednesday, and still no word from Mr. Noble.  
Just to refresh, the last time I heard from him (email) was Thursday 
morning.  You'd be proud of me though as I have refrained from any form of 
contact and plan to continue that route only deviating if/when it becomes 
necessary for me to have a formal close to things.  I'm still hoping that 
will not be the case but am fully prepared for the possibility that my brief 
encounter with dating may be over for a while.

First things first...

Yes, I am still alive...Things with Wonder Boy suck (and for the time being I 
think we should refrain from calling him Wonder Boy)...I'll be leaving for 
Austin Friday night (1st football game of the season), but will be back 
Sunday and definitely want to get together while you're in town.

Hope all is well with you and that you had a fantastic holiday weekend.  Mine 
was incredible!!! I visited a friend of mine in San Diego and had the best 
time just hanging out, shopping, hitting the beach and attending the symphony 
(on the water no less).  It was definitely a good trip for my psyche as Ted 
has been less than impressive going on almost two weeks now.  I'm certainly 
not pleased about the situation, but at no point have I lost site of what a 
catch I am (and if he's not bright enough to see or appreciate that fact then 
I don't think he's bright enough for me).

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Hey there. Are you still alive? What is up? How are things with you and 
Wonder Boy?
I think I will be in Houston Friday through Tuesday (maybe more days 
depending on how matters turn around). Will you be around?
Drop a note when you get a chance.

Subject: sorry!


ok, i'm still forgetting people, so assure 'the others' i'm not snubbing
them intentionally, i'm just brain dead.  haven't gotten a chance to email
often b/c little access to the library, but will as soon as my computer
arrives, and you'll get more 'intimate' (pg-13!) messages when time permits,
until then.....hope all went well over the holiday weekend- no holiday here!
  school has started, and so far so good- very interntional class- but
strangely enough, one girl from san antonio who also wants to study art law-
and she wanted to escape "" a bunch of incestual girls and guys who will
never leave home and never make new friends- just want to shop, get married,
and have babies"" (not you ardie, don't be offended!)  i liked her instantly.
  still no permanent home.....will keep you posted.....but- bit of adventure
sunday- this stuff NEVER happens to me, so it made my month.
anyways....wandering by myself in chelsea on sunday and stopped to look in a
store window....wasn't paying attention when i turned around and brushed
against someone's shoulder- well- not just someone- BEN AFFLECK!  and with
gweneth paltrow (she looked like shit w/ long orange stringy hair and a kind
of whiney, hungry look on her face- he of course looked precious, but was a
little shorter than i'd expected- about 6'2)  i can't speak. and the road is
totally empty except us, so i just say excuse me, he says no problem, and
then just wander off, then turn to stare after them.  thought about chasing
them down, but realized how lame i already looked, plus, was in gym shorts
and pony tail and ratty sweatshirt, and knew ben COULDN'T realize i was ""the
one"" in that state....so, i ran to the nearest phone and called my mom.
well, that's about it- again. will write/call when get a spare sec.  miss
ya'll- write soon!

Sometimes I really worry about you...

I know it's not kind to laugh at the misfortune of others, but I must say I 
was rolling when I read your email.  It's a good thing I didn't send the 
other card I was debating over last night which alluded to the possibility of 
you and Darren spending too much time together (not as funny in light of your 
shack last night).  So how did you explain your attire this morning to your 
MD? 

Hope the presentation was a rousing success.

Hey,

Thanks for the card.  I got a good chuckle out of it.  You will appreciate 
this story.  I go to leave last night around 12:00 but somehow I don't have 
my keys.  Well, they were in my locker at the Met, which of course is closed 
at this point.  So, I stay at Darren and sleep on his couch.  Well, I try to 
sleep but his fire alarm keeps beeping ever 1-2 minutes and is really 
annoying.  So, being a guy, I take the alarm completely out of the wall with 
my leatherman tool.  Finally go to sleep and arrive in my same clothes and 
baseball hat at work around 7:30 to pick up my keys and head home and 
shower/change.  Of course this cannot go perfectly, so I run into my MD on 
the way to the Met parking lot. Smooth.  I finally arrive back at work around 
9:00 and miss the group's morning weather briefing.  I find this whole thing 
pretty funny and it is all due to my keen organizational skills.  I'll talk 
to you later.

Ted

Jeff, this morning I spoke with Reliant's regulatory counsel, who called me 
after talking with Lee Hart, and who seemed eager to look into drafting a 
filing.  I would be happy to talk with Leonard Foster or June Suwara at 
Sempra about doing the same, but somehow think Sempra might be a tougher 
customer (don't know why I would think that...).  My suggestion is that we 
work through Ms. Katz initially.  Anticipating that we might encounter some 
inertia at Sempra's regulatory dept. -- and to give you an outline to work 
from when talking to Stefanie -- I put together the attached rough draft of a 
motion to intervene and motion to expedite to be filed by Sempra.  

Feel free to send the attached to Stefanie.  However, please do so with the 
caveat that you are sending it for discussion purposes only, not as legal 
advice to Sempra from ET&S's legal department, and the content of this 
pleading should ultimately be up to Sempra's legal/regulatory staff.

Reliant's counsel said he'd be sending me a draft of his pleading...if I 
don't hear from him within a reasonable time I'll call to follow up.

i admit to being a little put-off by his 'tone'- if that's the correct word.
  you write a long, jovial, bantering note, and his response is cold and
blunt....it sounds like mr noble's project has zapped out all of his
personality......and we thought one of his better features was his
well-roundedness.....!  again , i think this is one of those subtle and
shaky things you can't really 'call' someone on, and it's best to leave the
ball in his court.  of course, if he comes around when he's less
'distracted', i would tread carefully, and w/ some aloofness- no reason you
should have to 'jump' when he says to! gauge how he acts post-holiday- there
will be no project excuse, and then you can see how much validity this
theory holds.  am completely disoriented right now- sleeping pattern is off,
have raging PMS, and am a little homesick, as i knew i'd be at first.  both
mom and dad  succeeded in slipping horribly weepy cards into my purse before
take-off (which was a weepy mess in itself).  of course, i found them on the
plane and made an absolute scene sniveling and crying big fat baby tears.
verrry attractive!  am going to be really glad actually when school starts
so that i can begin to get acclaimated and don't feel like such a fish out
of water.  need to finalize when you're thinking about coming over.....i
know it's sometimein oct- and kates said she has to leave on the 12th for a
wedding thing.  as i said, jeremy's wedding is the weekend of the 14th, and
i know that was a week you discussed coming.  i don't have tickets, but if
it's physically poss for me to find a good ticket home, i prob. will have
to- gogo started crying when i said i prob. couldn't come, and i promised
i'd try.  but then again, i don't want to mess up the vacation plans you've
been setting up for a long time.  hopefully we can find a 'mutually
beneficial' time for the visit- let me know what you're thinking, and we'll
work from there!  am writing from the computers at katy's school, and don't
know how long i am allowed to, so will try to check back asap!  hope all is
well- miss ya'll!

Em,

Glad to hear that you arrived safely in your new home.  I'm sure you'll be 
adjusting to the time change for a few days, but hopefully this time you 
won't get sick.  Say, ""Hi"" to Katy for me and tell her I will email her soon 
to try and figure when is the best time to come visit.  

Now on to the business at hand.  Thought I'd let you see the last email 
exchange between Mr. Noble and myself.  Start from the bottom with my email 
and then read his response.  I would love to hear your insight on it all.

Here's my thought at this point.  I think Ted is an EXTREMELY linear person, 
in that his focus can not be split between too many different things at 
once.  To that end, I believe this project, to which he has dedicated many 
hours, has literally harnessed all of his attention.  Realizing this, I'm not 
sure exactly how I feel about it - - - Any thoughts?

Hey Shorty,

I am glad to hear that today is going a little better.  We are getting a tad 
busy.  I hope the beers were good last night, and I thought about a couple of 
cold ones as Darren and I were getting finished around 1:30 this morning.  A 
drink sounds good but I may be leaving for Austin tomorrow night after work 
to pick up my friend Mark at the Austin airport (I'll find out later tonight) 
and if that is the case then we'll get one next week.  I think the story

Hey Pavarotti,

Hope you day is going well and that everything is coming together for the big 
presentation tomorrow.  My day is going significantly better than yesterday 
so I am pleased.  Plus, my friend just emailed me from San Diego to inform me 
that she can get us a great table to see the Symphony's last performance of 
the season on Navy Pier...so I've got that going for me, which is nice.  By 
the way, what did you end up deciding to do about this weekend - or haven't 
you decided yet (the latter would not surprise me in the least...you're a fly 
by the seat of your pants kind of guy or a slight procrastinator - - I always 
get the two confused).

Now for the rule-breaking.  I realize it's already Wednesday but I wanted to 
see if you had any interest in going to grab a bite to eat or just a drink 
after work tomorrow or Friday night (in light of our heavy work loads, etc. I 
hope you can forgive my rudeness).  Both you and Darren looked pretty whipped 
last night and I'm sure tonight will be more of the same...You better be 
careful, I think this project is starting to give you gray hair.

Shorty

- - I forgot to tell you last night that my 5 yr. old niece got in trouble on 
the way to school yesterday because she punched a little boy in the eye.  
Evidently, he was bothering she and her friend Reagan...I think my sister's 
biggest fears have now been confirmed, little Sally may have taken after her 
Aunt Sue Sue a little too much.

Hey Shorty,

I am glad to hear that today is going a little better.  We are getting a tad 
busy.  I hope the beers were good last night, and I thought about a couple of 
cold ones as Darren and I were getting finished around 1:30 this morning.  A 
drink sounds good but I may be leaving for Austin tomorrow night after work 
to pick up my friend Mark at the Austin airport (I'll find out later tonight) 
and if that is the case then we'll get one next week.  I think the story 
below is funny.  I'll talk to you later when I get a better sense of what is 
going on.

Julie,

Sorry for the delayed response.  I can't express to you how excited I am to 
be coming out there this weekend.  After the last week and a half of work I 
am in desperate need of rest and relaxation (that of course means lots of 
shopping).  As far as activities go, I'm pretty much up for anything.  My 
guess is I'm probably going to want to take a quick nap when I get in 
Saturday morning before starting the weekend's activities, but after that I 
say we just get going.  The symphony sounds incredible as do the races or the 
polo match so I'll just leave the final choices to your discretion.  I would 
definitely be up for a trip to the zoo if you want to go, but considering I 
go there every time I'm in San Diego I could miss it in order to do/see some 
other things.  The only things I insist upon are ample time outdoors and good 
seafood.  Anyway,  I arrive in San Diego on America West flight 2180 at about 
9:00 a.m. and leave Monday at 6:10 p.m. so we've almost got three full days 
to work with. 

Love,
Susan

-- Also, if you could give me an idea of what kind of items I need to pack 
depending on our activities it might prevent me from committing gross 
overpacking...Thanks.

Can we keep the upside -- I believe the answer is clearly ""no"" unless/until 
we get a favorable ruling on our share-the-upside filing.  Til then we're 
bound by the billing provisions on Sheet 95H.
Sometimes the answers clarify themselves after you leave the question sitting 
out there a while...

As for the contract rights of replacement shippers, I would say the tariff 
language gives us some leeway on whether to automatically give replacement 
shipper the releasing shipper's discount at alt. points.  If we don't, and 
the replacement shipper uses an alt. point and has to pay max rate, releasing 
shipper gets a refund under our billing provision.  I know Lindy has some 
clear ideas on what we want here... we can discuss more if you like.  "

Julie,

Everything you have mentioned up to this point sounds incredible.  I would 
love to see the symphony, got to a polo match or the races, etc. etc.  I've 
made everybody here at work green with envy talking about my trip.  I'm going 
to email you back tomorrow with a much more detailed response to your emails 
because I'm trying like mad to get out of work before 7:00 tonight.  Anyway, 
like I said it all sounds great and I am very excited about the trip (believe 
me it's much needed).  

Susan

I'll give you the exact times tomorrow, but my flight gets in around 9:00 
a.m. on Saturday and doesn't leave until around 6:00 p.m. on Monday.  Talk to 
you tomorrow."

Read it and weep...Just let me know if you want me to bring some sand back

live like we're evidently going to this weekend.

me know your arrival time on Saturday and departure on Monday so I can plan
around them both....

I've been brainstorming some fun things for us to do, and thought we could
spend some time lounging at the beach, shopping at the outlet center near
me, go out for a champagne bunch on Sunday, grill out on the beach, and
possibly go to a polo match or the Del Mar races.  Which of these interests
you?  Are there any tourist sites that you would like to see while in
town?  The zoo, Balboa Park (where all the museums are), or anything
else?  Oh- I've arranged for us to have a massage on Monday- the woman is
coming to my house!  We'll each get a 30 minute massage....I think this
will be great quality, girl time!  I've missed our shopping binges!

Please bring any current pictures of friends and family- I can't wait to
hear how everyone in your life is doing.  Weather has been beautiful as
usual- about 75 degrees and perfect.  In the evenings it gets cool enough
to wear you need a light sweater or jacket, but you can always borrow
something from me, too.

The condo I'm living in now is tiny, but cute.  I've been living there for
a year and am moving out in 2 weeks.  I could have moved out this Labor Day
weekend, but obviously didn't want to be doing that while you were in
town.  So you'll have to excuse a bit of the mess and come back another
time when I move into the cuter place- I love the new place I'm moving
into- it's 2 stories with vaulted ceilings and lots of skylights.

See you soon!
Julie

Subject:  New Enron Deal

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
-----------------------
Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement said
to be worth an estimated $666 Trillion.
In the deal, Enron will provide both gas and electric commodities to Hades'
facilities throughout and under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former
CEO of energy monopolist Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy
management division.  Said Rockefeller, ""Obviously Hell has significant
heating demands.  While eternal flames are a great idea in concept, they
require vast and reliable fuel resources.  Enron was the only supplier
willing to make a deal with my boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just
like the way they do business.""
A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
together during negotiations.  According to the company, ""The deal fits both
companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and retain new
customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for millennia to
come.""  According to several energy industry insiders, Hades' high heating
demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make it a very
attractive energy portfolio addition.
Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained high
growth rates over the last two thousand years.
Enron is one of the world's leading energy and communications companies.
The company owns approximately $37 billion in energy and communications
assets.  Enron ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's ""Best 100 Companies to
Work For if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A
Week,"" and is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked by
customers with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply
contracts.

Cinderella in Her Later Years.......

Cinderella was now 75 years old. After a fulfilling life with the now
dead
Prince, she happily sat upon her rocking chair, watching the world go by
from her front porch, with a cat named Bob for companionship.

One sunny afternoon, out of nowhere, appeared the Fairy Godmother.

Cinderella said ""Fairy Godmother, what are you doing here after all
these
years??""

The Fairy godmother replied ""Well Cinderella, since you have lived a
good,
wholesome life since we last met, I have decided to grant you 3 wishes.

Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?""

Cinderella was taken aback, overjoyed and after some thoughtful
consideration, and almost under her breath she uttered her first wish:

""I wish I was wealthy beyond comprehension."" Instantly, her rocking
chair
was turned into solid gold. Cinderella was stunned.

Bob, her old faithful cat, jumped off her lap and scampered to the edge
of
the porch, quivering with fear. Cinderella said ""Oh thank you, Fairy
Godmother"".

The Fairy Godmother replied, ""It is the least I can do. What does your
heart
want for your second wish?"" Cinderella looked down at her frail body,
and
said: ""I wish I was young and full of the beauty of youth again.""

At once, her wish having been desired became reality, and her beautiful
youthful visage had returned. Cinderella felt stirrings inside her that
had
been dormant for years and a long forgotten vigor and vitality began to
course through her.

Then the Fairy Godmother again spoke ""You have one more wish, what shall
you
have?"" Cinderella looks over to the frightened cat in the corner and
says"";
""I wish for you to transform Bob, my old cat, into a beautiful, and
handsome
young man"".

Magically, Bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his
biological
make-up, that when complete he stood before her, a man, so beautiful the
like of which she nor the world had ever seen, so fair indeed that birds
began to fall from the sky at his feet.

The Fairy Godmother again spoke: ""Congratulations, Cinderella.

Enjoy your new life."" And, with a blazing shock of bright blue
electricity,
she was gone. For a few eerie moments, Bob and Cinderella looked into
each
other's eyes, Cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most stunningly
perfect man she had ever seen. Then Bob walked over to Cinderella, who
sat
transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his young
muscular
arms.

He leaned in close blowing her golden hair with his warm breath as he
whispered:

""I bet you regret having me neutered now, don't you?""

I've reviewed Order 637 on voluntary auctions and agree with you, Mary Kay, 
that the TW IOS procedure is consistent with the Commission's checklist.  
However, I do have a couple of questions/concerns.  First, does ""voluntary"" 
mean filing a proposal with FERC is also voluntary?  Or is the Commission 
here requiring that pipelines make filings before they can proceed with 
auctions?  Also, I'm not sure we comply with the Commission's policy on 
establishment of a reserve price, since it's difficult to tell what that is 
from the order.  A couple of times TW has stated a minimum bid in its IOS.

Agustin,

You are right, the correct deal number for Industrias del Etileno is just 
NW9742 (legs 1 & 2).

Lexi,

I will be able to attend and am going to try to get to Austin in time for the 
faculty lunch.  I will let you know if I can make the lunch for sure after 
I've worked out my travel arrangements. 

Thanks,
Susan"

Okay, I have to admit it is somewhat of a pansy schedule and it is going to 
be like that for about the next three years.  However, this season will give 
us the perfect opportunity to get all of our freshman and sophomores the 
necessary experience needed to win the National title two to three years from 
now.  Mack Brown is a master at pacing a teams rise to the top.  With the #1 
recruiting class in the country last year and a top 5 class this year the 
future looks bright for the Longhorns.  Besides, our stadium's on campus and 
we've sold over 40,000 season tickets...the games are bound to be fun 
regardless of how weak the opponents may be.

Counter?

Hey Shorty,

Sorry your week has been going poorly (I guess you feel like I did Wednesday 
night).  But on the bright side, college football starts this weekend which 
is always a plus and today is Friday which makes this bad week over.  I am in 
middle of packing once again for another move but the good news is that I get 
kicked out by 5:00 today.  I was checking out UT schedule and it looks like 
they have a pansy schedule (unlike UCLA that has to play Alabama #3 and 
Michigan #4 early in the season).  Any comments on that?

Ted

I am indeed the right person and will be happy to rebook the deals below.  
Just so you know, there are going to be several more deals that will need to 
be rebooked as soon as the CP's are set up.  If you could just let me know 
when the new CP's are set-up I will rebook the other deals as well.

Same dude...and he is good.  We're going to Steak Night tonight at Little 
Woodrows which of course makes me happy.  Also, I just sent him a list of all 
the UT games so he can start planning to attend.  As soon as he decides on a 
first game I'm going to have to start preparing him to meet the family and 
others.  That's a lot of prep work.

I've gotten a bit more educated about IT revenue crediting since you asked 
your question yesterday.  ""IT revenue crediting"" is an industry term used to 
describe a requirement (brought about either by a FERC order or a rate case 
settlement) that IT revenues in excess of a certain dollar amount will be 
credited back to all firm shippers in the next rate proceeding or thru some 
refund mechanism.  Transwestern is currently not under any IT revenue 
crediting obligation, and I would be very hesitant to negotiate any such 
obligation with any individual shipper because then we would have to do the 
same for all firm shippers on a nondiscriminatory basis. 

If you need more info, let's talk.

Hey there yourself,

Sorry I haven't written you guys in a while to keep you properly updated.  I 
am indeed checking on flights to Seoul and don't think I'm going to go at 
exactly the same time as my parents.  As much fun as they are, I figured we 
would probably do some different things than what you have planned for them.

As for Ted, things are still going well although I haven't see him at all 
this week (we are two very busy people).  But, we had a great laid back day 
last Saturday and I think have hit that comfortable stage...you know, not 
quite so formal about dates etc.  In one sense it's great, but it also makes 
things a lot harder to read.  Anyway, I'm sure my Mom told you guys but 
Travis and Kathy got to meet him and I think it went well.  Hopefully, if 
we're still dating come December, you and Chuck can meet him when you come 
back to visit.  I'm planning on dragging him to at least one of the U.T. 
games, I just have to find out when he wants to go (as well as properly 
prepare him for the Scott/Kelley/Parks/Wild Card gang and the full-day affair 
that is a U.T. game).

Things in Houston are good and definitely warm.  I went with Emily and her 
Mom last night to see the musical ""Rent"" and it was wonderful.  Also, I'm 
going out to San Diego for the Labor Day weekend to visit Hoot's daughter 
Julie.  Needless to say I am very excited.

Talk to you  guys soon,
Susan

Hey girlie,

How are you doing?  Haven't heard from you in a while.
 A little birdie told me that you were checking into
tickets for Seoul.  Are you really?  Would you come
with your parents or separately?  In any case, we have
had some more time to do some exploring (and
shopping), so we have some good ideas about what to do
if you come.  I think that we will stay in Korea when
your parents come and do the whole base thing (which
will take only a few minutes, actually), but are
considering going to China or somewhere during part of
Thanksgiving.  We'll do whatever you want want if you
still are coming!

Let us know the latest with Ted and also with what's
going on in Houston.

Take care,
Chris

Hey Tonto (a.k.a - the trusty, but silent, side-kick to the Lone Ranger or in 
this case the Big D)

The play was very good and I think well received.  I'd forgotten how blown 
away I was by some of the songs the first time I saw it in NY.  The cast 
members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of 
the most poignant numbers ( I think this could be your true calling).  I 
caught the third day of Corey's Jeopardy run last night here at the office 
(yes, I had to come back after the play...I love my job!).  Anyway, I'm sure 
I'd mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl.  As a result of 
that, she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my 
enjoyment of playing Trivial Pursuit or watching Jeopardy by absolutely 
obliterating me (The girl actually did her senior thesis on Trivia).  

Kori told me she saw you last night at Steak Night and introduced herself 
since I failed to do so the last time we went.  I should let you know though 
that she was very offended this morning that you didn't spell her name right 
in the email - I mean it's such a common spelling.  So was Darren there last 
night to meet her or do you just think they'd make a good match?  She's a 
very fun girl.  

Hope you day is going well and that the move to 30 went off without a hitch.  
Good luck with all of the ""fun"" meetings.

Shorty

-- Due to the lack of response yesterday, I'm beginning to worry about your 
success with the road test...I'm going to assume that you didn't get around 
to it.

Maybe you should ignore the sentiment of the quote I sent earlier...I think 
you may be adhering to it too faithfully.  At this rate we may have to start 
pinning notes to your shirt to remind you to do things.  However, having 
driven with you on several occasions I feel confident you will be able to 
pass the test with flying colors.  Keep in mind though that if you end up 
failing I will not let you forget it (and, as we have established, I have the 
memory of an elephant).  

I'll keep discussion of me to a minimum and just say that things are well on 
32.  Now back to what's really important...you.  Thought you'd like to know 
that the Dixie Chicks are coming back to Houston Dec. 12 and will performing 
just down the street from you at the Compaq Center...it's all about you and 
your needs.

Hey,

My week is actually going very well so far (my trader left around noon so 
today should be a piece of cake).  I know you
guys have been working really hard the last couple of days, but I hope it 
paid off and the presentation went well 
yesterday.  However, given your comment about y'alls idea getting the axe in 
the short term, I'm not sure that was 
necessarily the case.  Anyway, I'm sure at least your steak dinner was a hit 
(so were you able to resist the red wine 
this time, you lush?).  

In keeping with my very serious nature (yes, you heard me serious), I've 
attached little story for you...I got a pretty
good chuckle out of this one.

PS. - Thanks again for carting me around and feeding me Saturday...I, as 
usual, had a great time.  Oh, and by the way, kudos to both of us for 
actually making it through a home movie

Shorty,

What's going on young lady.  Hopefully, your week is starting off well.  
Things were busy Sunday night through yesterday and don't appear to let up 
very much (although our idea most likely will get the axe in the short 
term).  Well, have to run (Darren is calling) but I'll give you a call later 
today.

Ted

I know how much you're looking forward to ""Ted's Weekend of Rest and 
Relaxation"" and I also realize that carting me back and forth to the car 
dealership wasn't exactly on your list of things to do (bear in mind the 
dealership is roughly 5 minutes from your apartment)...So, I'm offering you 
an out.  I can find someone else to help me if you want to bail (I know how 
important your pool-side time is - Remember it's all about you and your 
needs.""  Just let me know.

(You know you haven't sent me any funnies in a while either.  I'll let it go 
for now since you're working so hard...but you're going to have to deliver at 
some point.)


 1. Question: If you could live forever, would you and why?
    Answer:  ""I would not live forever, because we should not live forever, 
because if we were supposed to live     forever, then we would live forever, 
but we cannot live forever,  which is why I would not live
  forever.""                  ---Miss Alabama in the 1994 Miss USA contest

                  ---Mariah Carey

  3. ""Researchers have discovered that chocolate produces some of the
 same reactions in the brain as marijuana.  The researchers also discovered
 other similarities between the two, but can't remember what they are.""
                ---Matt Lauer on NBC's Today Show, August 22

  4.  ""I haven't committed a crime. What I did was fail to comply with the 
law.""
               ---David Dinkins, New York City Mayor, answering accusations 
that he failed to pay his taxes.

  5. ""Smoking kills. If you're killed, you've lost a very important part of 
your life.""          
   ---Brooke Shields, during an interview to become spokesperson for a 
federal anti-smoking campaign.

  6.  ""I've never had major knee surgery on any other part of my body.""
           ---Winston Bennett, Univ. of KY basketball forward

  7.  ""Outside of the killings, Washington has one of the lowest crime rates 
in the country.""           
   ---Mayor Marion Barry, Washington, DC

the president.""
              ---Hillary Clinton commenting on the release of subpoenaed 
documents.

              ---Former French President Charles De Gaulle

  11. ""That lowdown scoundrel deserves to be kicked to death by a jackass, 
and I'm just the one to do it.""
              ---A Congressional Candidate in Texas

  12.  ""It isn't pollution that's harming the environment. It's the

  13. ""Without censorship, things can get terribly confused in the public 
mind.""

 Dan Quayle:

  14. ""I love California.  I practically grew up in Phoenix.""

Our contract with IGS provides that for any agreement identified by IGS and 
executed, TW will pay a one-time incentive fee of 3% of the first $15 million 
of net present value, 2% of the next $10 million of net present value, etc.

The Southern contract associated with the Gallup Expansion is at a rate of 
$0.205 for 25,000 Dth/d for 5 years.  Using a discount factor of 15%, the net 
present value of the contract is $6,270,625, so IGS's commission would be 
$188,118.75.  Since the contract does not specify how NPV will be calculated 
(I believe we purposely omitted this for whatever reason), we will need to 
agree on a rate that is fair given the nature of and risk associated with the 
project.  We should probably use whatever is standard in the industry for 
this type of project, if that's possible to determine.  I have a call in to 
James Centilli for his recommendation in this regard, and will let you know 
what he says."

Thanks for the info...you are a wealth of knowledge.  As for the jokes, I am

I just don't know where to start with the last couple of sentences so I will 
let any jokes pass for now but be afraid.  As for the people on the list, I 
know them as follows:

John Massey: SMU, UT b-school, emissions trader and a funny guy - spent a few 
drunken nights with him and he lives in your complex
Milind Pasad: India, UT b-school, really nice guy but no drinking or meat 
eating (he drove me to get my car on Monday)
Kevin Ruscitti: UCLA mba and trades gas, nice guy
Claudio Riberto: works in my old group with Milind, very smart MIT mba nice 
but quiet

I hope this helps and if you have any other questions, just let me know you 
little hottie.

Along those same lines, did you get them to bring the car to you here or do 
you have to go get it.  (Don't forget I need to get your parking pass to you.)

As for the home vs. theater viewing...I seem to be more of a home-body these

Hey Handsome,

I am taking every step to ensure that I leave this building at a reasonable 
hour today.  Unfortunately, it is ""bid-week"" (Nat Gas trading thing which 
translates to beaucoup deals/trading) so the odds are somewhat stacked 
against me.  Anyway, I'm going to say that as it stands right now 8:00 p.m. 
is definitely do-able.  However, I do reserve the right to alter my estimate 
when we get closer to 4:30 p.m. and I have a better idea where I stand.  
Don't let them work you too hard down there...remember, your body's not used 
to it.

Susan

A good wit is a terrible thing to waste...

As for the pick up, the Sissy Crawford taxi is at your service.  Just name 
the time and place.  Also, there is no need to forego the nice fun restaurant 
for tomorrow night just because I have to be a smart-ass every once in a 
while.

Hey Bo,

I was checking on some flights for myself and happened to look at one-way 
tickets from New Orleans.  It looks like the refundable, no-advance purchase 
ticket is going to run you about $100 on Southwest...Lucky for you they do 
offer a senior citizen fare for $55 (age does have its advantages).

Sissy

By the way,  I didn't  even realise John Cleese and Denise Richards were in 
the movie...and evidently at some point Bond hijacks a submarine.  Roger 
Ebert actually thought so much of the film he gave it 3 and 1/2 stars.  We 
may have to watch this one at some point.

              ""The World Is Not Enough"" is a splendid comic thriller, 
exciting and graceful,
               endlessly inventive. Because it is also the 19th James Bond 
movie, it comes with so
               much history that one reviews it like wine, comparing it to 
earlier famous vintages; I
               guess that's part of the fun. This is a good one.

Ted,

I think you had, at one point, asked me if the first U.T. football game was 
Labor Day weekend.  It is actually the weekend after Labor Day (Sept. 9) 
against Louisiana-Lafayette at 11:30 a.m.  So basically it should be a very 
challenging game and relatively cool (Ha!).  Hope your day's going well.

Shorty

FYI - U.T. plays Stanford at Stanford Sept. 16 (7:15 p.m. kick-off)"

Ted,

My day is going quite well, actually.  I managed to sleep in past 6:30 a.m. 
this morning and did not work-out so I'm feeling pretty good.  I'm not sure 
if I'll be able to respect you in the light of your ""rule-breaking"", but I'm 
going to try to look past that.  I'm heading to lunch right now - yes, I am 
actually leaving the building - so the day just keeps getting better and 
better.  As for last night, I had a really good time too and am glad you were 
able to look past my bad manners and agree to go out Friday.  Talk to you 
soon.

Susan

Shorty,

I hope your day is going well and your trader and thus you are having a good 
day.  I just realized that I broke the ""rules"" last night.  I should say no 
to a Friday night out when asked out on Wednesday night but I'll let it go 
this time because we are going country and you are breaking out the t-shirt 
and jeans.  When I think about it, that exception applies to every 
situation.  I had fun last night and I think you will be relieved to know 
that I can't get my huge belt buckle on order and shipped in time for 
tomorrow so you are in the clear.

Let's plan on heading over there around 8:00-8:30 so there is absolutely no 
hurrying after work.  Steak night is a time of leisure so take all the time 
you need to get home, change and relax before heading out.  I live at the 
Park at River Oaks (West Alabama & Buffalo Speedway on Buffalo Speedway--from 
your place just take a right on Buffalo Speedway and its the first place on 
your left) and the only entrance has a guard and he will call up to my place 
to let you in.  Park at any labelled guest spot (left side of the up ramps 4 
floors) and my place is #3309 - closest building to the corner of Buffalo 
Speedway and West Alabama.  Now I am really tired from all this typing.

Ted

By the way, a maid service is coming to clean my place tomorrow afternoon.  
Quite a coincidence ... hmmm

Hey Math-Wiz,

I completely understand your plight.  I too am suffering a two o'clock, 
post-lunch slump (the coffee is simply not working at this point).  Anyway, I 
think a change of clothes prior to Steak Night is probably a good idea.  
Also, driving tomorrow is not a problem... just let me know the gate code, 
apt. #, etc.  Along those same lines, what time did you want to head over 
there?  (For better-safe-than-sorry reasons, due to my job, I think no 
earlier than 7:30 p.m. is our best bet.)

Hope you're having a lovely day and don't work too hard (Ha!!).

Fifth grade assignment

The teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment: 
Get their parents to tell them a story with a moral at 
the end of it. The next day the kids came back and one 
by one began to tell their stories.  

Kathy said, ""My father's a farmer and we have a lot of 
egg-laying hens.  One time we were taking our eggs to 
market in a basket on the front seat of the pickup when 
we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying 
and broke and made a mess.""  ""And what's the moral of 
the story?"" Asked the teacher.  ""Don't put all your eggs 
in one basket!""  ""Very good,"" said the teacher.  

""Now, Lucy?""  

""Our family are farmers too.  But we raise chickens for 
the meat market.  We had a dozen eggs one time, but when 
they hatched we only got ten live chicks. And the moral 
to this story is, don't count your chickens until they're 
hatched.""  ""That was a fine story Lucy.""

""Johnny do you have a story to share?""  

""Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story about my uncle Bob.  
Uncle Bob was a pilot in Vietnam and his plane got hit.  He 
had to bail out over enemy territory and all he had was a 
bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a machete. He drank the 
whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break and then he 
landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops.  He killed 
seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of 
bullets, then he killed twenty more with the machete till the 
blade broke and then he killed the last ten with his bare hands.""
""Good heavens,"" said the horrified teacher, ""What kind of moral 
did your daddy tell you from that horrible story?""

""Don't fuck with Uncle Bob when he's been drinking.""

There is nothing wrong with simple and understated when it comes to a 
non-native Texan acquiring western wear.  Remember slow and steady wins the 
race.  One needs items they could wear at any given time (Red Wings a simple 
classic hat)...not just to the Vail Rodeo.

Ted, 

I tried to send this page a little while ago and I think it failed.  So, you 
may have to actually drop this address into the netscape location section to 
bring up the site.

Anyway, there seemed to be a pretty good selection on the web.  Still, I 
think the one on this page best captures the kind of image you're looking to 
project.

Number 8 made me think of you...

Top Ten Signs Your Amish Teen is in Trouble 

10. Sometimes stays in bed till after 6am. 

9. In his sock drawer, you find pictures of women without bonnets. 
  
8. Shows up at barn raisings in full ""Kiss"" makeup. 
  
7. When you criticize him, he yells, ""Thou sucketh!"" 
  
6. His name is Jebediah, but he goes by ""Jeb Daddy."" 
  
5. Defiantly says, ""If I had a radio, I'd listen to rap."" 
  
4. You come upon his secret stash of colorful socks. 
  
3. Uses slang expression: ""Talk to the hand, cause the beard ain't 
listening."" 
  
2. Was recently pulled over for ""driving under the influence of cottage

Lorraine, I've been studying the El Paso/Dynegy reservation reduction 
mechanism (RRM).  Basically the deal was that Dynegy's minimum-pay obligation 
would be reduced by the amount of the fixed cost component of IT revenues 
generated by El Paso's transportation of IT volumes above a historical 
threshold.  (The parties based the threshold on El Paso's monthly IT volumes 
for the 12 months ended 9/30/97.)  The volumes in excess of the threshold 
were calculated and a ratio of the volumes in excess of the threshold to the 
total volumes was determined; the ratio would then be applied to the fixed 
cost component of all IT revenues and the resulting dollar value applied to 
Dynegy's monthly reservation charge, to the extent Dynegy had not met its 
minimum pay obligation for a particular month.

This provision of course met with heavy opposition; however, FERC allowed 
it.  FERC stated that while the RRM had anticompetitive effects because it 
created a disincentive for El Paso to discount IT, it was not unduly 
discriminatory.  The ""unduly discriminatory"" conclusion was based on an 
analysis on the potential effect on the Cal. gas transportation market -- the 
Commission found that due to relatively weak market demand, neither Dynegy 
nor El Paso appeared to have been able to influence prices because so much 
firm capacity was available.

I assume Russ may be after something similar to the RRM.  We would have to 
file it as a negotiated rate but I feel fairly confident that we could get 
FERC to accept it.  

That's my 2 cents worth on this particular issue...I'll come down around 3:30 
to chat with you more about the Duke (I have a conference call with MKM from 
1:30 to 3:30, which is why I'm camped out on 47)."

Hey yourself, 

Actually, my day is going very well.  It just so happens that my trader is 
out of town all week so, except for a few stressful phone calls this morning 
to assess the market, the day has been relatively uneventful.  All I want to 
know is how do I get your hours (or should I say lack thereof).  Anyway, my 
roommate and I had already made plans for tonight, but a movie tomorrow night 
sounds good.  Just fill me in on the details.  

Susan

PS - I'll be purchasing my neon, leopard-print cowboy hat shortly.

Ted,

Getting back to work has been a bit of a challenge after a weekend of 
indulgence and excess.  It took everything I had to get in the car and start 
the drive back to Houston Tuesday night (especially since I stopped by my 
sister's and tooled around on Lake Austin in the boat for a while before 
heading out).  As for the birthday shot, you are quite welcome - it was the 
least I could do.  

After my expenditures over the holiday, I will definitely be in town this 
weekend.  So, dinner Saturday sounds good.  As it stands right now, I am 
having a very pleasant day and I hope you are as well.

Susan

Hi yourself,

Glad to hear you all had a good time in Thailand, although I get the 
impression you could have done without some of the sights.  Mom thinks it 
must be fate that this guy and I keep bumping into each other.

Along those lines, I had an absolutely incredible weekend.  I drove to 
Harlingen Saturday morning/afternoon (5 hr. drive) for a friend's wedding and 
then drove to Austin to meet up with Emily on Sunday.  We ate at Guerro's and 
then hit Cedar door for a little while.  There wasn't anything going on there 
so I suggested we try Cedar Street.  Funny thing is Ted, that's his name, 
walks by our table at the bar.  He stopped to say hello and ended up sitting 
down with us the rest of the evening.  His friends joined us as soon as they 
had been shot down by the girls they had been trying to woo.  We ended up 
going to Polly Esters for a little while to do some dancing.  Before we 
parted ways he asked if we had any plans for Monday night and got my cell 
phone number.  Needless to say I was feeling pretty good.  He called us 
Monday and we made plans to meet up after dinner -- we ate at Sullivan's, it 
was very good.  His birthday is July 4 (how great is that?) so I brought him 
one of those travel size bottles of Crown from the honor bar as a birthday 
gift...Big Hit.  Anyway, spent the whole night talking and getting to know 
each other and all I can say is he seems like a really good guy.  (One of the 
best signs was his reproach of denim shorts on guys, especially cut-offs...be 
sure and tell Chuck about that one because I know it's something he feels 
pretty strongly about as well.)  So at this point I'll pretty much just run 
through the stats:

Height :   6'2"" - 6'3""
Weight : about 225 lbs.
Education: UCLA (undergraduate and MBA) AND Law School ( I'm not sure where)
Birthday: 7/4/69 -- YES, he was born in a different decade than me...think it 
may be more of an issue for him than me.
Hometown: Santa Barbara, CA

ETC:  Youngest of three children.  Appears to like/be close to his family.
  Irish Catholic (we actually discussed religion)
  His dad was in the Navy
  Favorite Movies -- Fletch, Caddy Shack...he definitely has a good sense of 
humor and likes to laugh
  He really likes Texas...would like to have a ranch/lakehouse somewhere in 
the hill country

Best Quotes:    ""Every California guys idea of a dream girl is a girl in 
jeans a t-shirt and cowboy boots."" 
  ""Every Texas girls idea of a dream guy is a guy who lives on a ranch, has 
an good education, is comfortable financially and is also a great    
businessman.  Only problem is there are only four of those guys out there and 
three of them are married.""
  ""Texas girls have the ability to wrap a man around their finger quicker 
than any group of women I've ever met.""
  ""I really want to learn how to two step.""
  
So, as I'm sure you can tell there are definitely some attractive 
characteristics to this guy (to boot he was a complete gentleman in every 
capacity).  There are no plans as of yet, but I will be sure to keep you 
informed of any progress.  Write back soon and let me know how the apartment, 
the job hunt and everything else is going.

Susan

Hey Susan,

What's with this new man who keeps popping up
everywhere?  I heard you have seen a lot of him
lately!  You'll have to e mail me back and fill me in
on the scoop.

We had a great time in Thailand.  They are right when
they say it is exotic.  We saw some pretty ronchy
things there, too.  I'm not sure it if were the old
men with the young boys and a million of those clubs
or if the clubs ""featuring"" women were worse.  Anyway,
we got to see and do some pretty interesting things
and ate some really good food.  Chuck is expanding his
palate (sp?).  Hope all is well in Houston!

Chris

Yes...I am a true Longhorn.  I think that's why I like Steak Night so much.  
I mean how can you beat sitting on a deck, drinking a beer and solving the 
words problems (OK., 2 out of 3 ain't bad).  Anyway, Wednesday night sounds 
good to me, although, given how work has been going lately I doubt I'll be 
able to get there before 7:30.  Just do me a favour and forewarn Pat that 
Emily may be attending so he can prepare properly (I don't want any 
bloodshed).  I think a couple co-workers are also planning on coming so it 
should a good group.

Thursday night was indeed a blast.  I think my cohorts were ruing my 
existence by the end of the evening because I didn't have to go to work 
Friday (wedding in Dallas...very fun).  I'm sure you managed to have an all 
right time in SF as well.  I am definitely up for a bucket of beer this 
week.  It's supposed to be sunny and warm all week long and I can think of 
nothing that goes better with that than cold beer.  As for Austin, I have a 
wealth of information on the subject that I would be more than happy to

Recently we approved a ""based on utilization"" rate in another contract -- the 
rationale was that our minimum reservation charge is zero -- so on those days 
they don't use the point, the amount allocated to reservation component 
(using our discretion to allocate between reservation and commodity) is $0 
and it's still within our minimum so it is not a negotiated rate.  Does that 
make sense to you?

Subject:  New Enron Deal

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
-----------------------
Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement said
to be worth an estimated $666 Trillion.
In the deal, Enron will provide both gas and electric commodities to Hades'
facilities throughout and under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former
CEO of energy monopolist Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy
management division.  Said Rockefeller, ""Obviously Hell has significant
heating demands.  While eternal flames are a great idea in concept, they
require vast and reliable fuel resources.  Enron was the only supplier
willing to make a deal with my boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just
like the way they do business.""
A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
together during negotiations.  According to the company, ""The deal fits both
companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and retain new
customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for millennia to
come.""  According to several energy industry insiders, Hades' high heating
demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make it a very
attractive energy portfolio addition.
Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained high
growth rates over the last two thousand years.
Enron is one of the world's leading energy and communications companies.
The company owns approximately $37 billion in energy and communications
assets.  Enron ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's ""Best 100 Companies to
Work For if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A
Week,"" and is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked by
customers with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply
contracts.

ARIES

                   HOROSCOPE:   Weekly   



                   For May 2000: Reassess your goals and
                   friendships. Things have changed. Are you
                   satisfied with your job, relationships, and
                   immediate future? May brings things to light
                   that have been buried or disguised. Take a
                   cool calm steady look at what surfaces. . . and
                   decide if a change in direction is warranted.
                   It's clear that your work scenario needs
                   refurbishing and your daily schedule cries out
                   for major rehab. But first and foremost, you'll
                   get your second wind by dropping tension
                   and frustration mid month, increasing the
                   probability for better relations with friends,
                   coworkers, and relatives. Try to establish
                   healthy, positive change no later than the Full
                   Moon. Take steps to insure your financial and
                   business future on or before May 28."

AQUARIUS

                   HOROSCOPE:    Weekly 



                   For May 15-21: You're moving away from one
                   base of operations into another. Your
                   priorities and basic requirements are also
                   shifting. You find yourself relying less on
                   something you've clung to in the past -- and
                   moving closer to something newer, fresher,
                   and more invigorating. You've got a rage to
                   live and a burning desire for peak
                   experiences. Middle of the road choices
                   won't do it for you. Your hankering to push the
                   envelope could get you into hot water with the
                   old guard and certain close associates or
                   relatives -- possibly because they're afraid of
                   being replaced. But the genie is already out
                   of the bottle, Aquarius. You can't unlearn what
                   you've already tasted. Change is rolling in on
                   its own power now. Go with it. . . and try to
                   enjoy the ride. . ."

You are the best.  I sit on 32 now, 2376c to be exact.  When you hit the top 
of the stairs hang a left then turn left at the next possible opening.  I'll 
flag you down.  However, I would be more than happy to come down and pick up 
the check.  Just let me know what works best for you.

I'm a little uncomfortable with saying ""TW defers to the consensus position 
of the non-SoCal settlement parties"" so often.  Could we just not say 
anything on those items?  Or say TW has no comment at this time.  Would the 
other parties be put off if we were silent on these issues?

Subject: TW position in All-Party Settlement Proposal

Attached see my marked-up version of your work product.  Mark, I think you 
did an excellent job of identifying TW's position in all of the issue in the 
GIR.  However, on editing, you'll see that I truncated some of the TW 
comments in favor of a slightly shorter document -- particularly in those 
areas in which it was questionable whether we have a direct interest or not.  
Look over and give me your feedback.  Thanks.

I understand we're supposed to offer these comments to Craig as soon as 
possible for possible inclusion in a 2nd generation ""issue matrix?""

Just wanted to thank you all for showing my parents such a good time last 
night.  They really enjoyed meeting you and finally being able to put some 
faces with the names.  At one point I believe my Dad even stated, ""I love 
this place...now we'll have to come here every Wednesday."" (An idle threat 
though don't worry).  They, as well as myself, are definitely fans of the 
topical conversational range ever present at ""Steak Night"".  Our own, though 
at times juvenile and base, version of the Algonquian Table.

Now on to the ""food for thought""...I had a hard time narrowing down my 
selections today so please bear with the number of quotes and their seemingly 
unrelated themes (I just couldn't cut any more).

""Courage, it would seem, is nothing less than the power to overcome danger, 
misfortune, fear, injustice, while continuing to affirm inwardly that life 
with all its sorrows is good; that everything is meaningful even if in a 
sense beyond our understanding; and that there is always tomorrow."" -- 
Dorothy Thompson

""One should guard against preaching to young people success in the customary 
form as the main aim in life. The most important motive for work in school 
and in life is pleasure in work, pleasure in its result, and the knowledge of 
the value of the result to the community."" -- Albert Einstein 

""Among those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator, but 
among those whom I love, I can: all of them make me laugh."" --W.H. Auden

""Learn to give yourself what you wish you could get from somebody else."" -- 
Steven Ouellette

""The game of life is a game of boomerangs. Our thoughts, deeds and words 
return to us sooner or later with astounding accuracy."" -- Florence Scovel 
Shinn

""We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of 
regret or disappointment."" -- Jim Rohn"

Turns out my boss is going to get to Teala's at @ 5:00.  So if you want to 
show up earlier, say 6:00/6:30, I'm sure that would be cool.  I know Ben, 
Nick and possibly Sunil are planning on going so you may want to see when

I too enjoyed our talk last night ( I'm always interested in other 
viewpoints, it is only by examining them that we challenge our own).   

  The Happy Hour tonight is at Teala's on West Dallas.  My recommendation is 
that you plan on arriving at 7:00 or later.  Hopefully by that time my old 
manager will have had enough to drink he won't mind all these other people on 
his tab.

I must admit, the job just keeps sounding better and better.

P.S. Thanks for the compliment...that's a quality I like being associated 
with.

While I don't truly fear you becoming a bitter individual as a result of 
these negative experiences, I do feel the highlighted section below is now 
more appropriate than ever.

One must keep their eyes open and use all of the wisdom they possess when 
they trust.  Just as I suggested that positive experiences can cause one's 
level of trust to grow exponentially, negative experiences can cause 
irreparable harm.  If you trust blindly or too willingly and that trust is 
violated it colours every aspect of your life.  There are too many people in 
this world that have become bitter and cynical, not because they were born 
that way but, because they handed out trust haphazardly and too many times 
that trust was thrown back in their face.  I don't mean to suggest from the 
above that one should live in a day-to-day mind-set of distrust but rather 
that they must really look at people and all the aspects which they posses.  
I have come to the conclusion that if you spend most of your time observing 
and listening to people rather than always taking the lead you will learn a 
great deal more about them and their character.  The smallest acts and 
statements can in fact say the most, so always be observant. (This includes 
listening to what others have to say and paying attention to the opinions of 
people whom you respect.)

To that end I have one last comment...I am constantly amazed and periodically 
reminded what fragile creatures we humans are.  That beyond the hype and 
self-grandizing the basic components of ourselves (our experiences, fears, 
cares, concerns, needs etc.) cannot be completely disregarded and will always 
be a part of us.  I think that only by recognizing those components and 
trying to understand their origin can we truly become stronger."

Attached is November's Monthly Report.  I know I'm asking for your revisions 
to it earlier than usual, but with everyone being out during the holidays 
(myself included) we decided it would be easier to incorporate changes you 
make to this report into the Weekly so you only have to update one report.

Denise Lagesse is going to do the updates next week for me while I'm on 
vacation so send your changes and new items to her by Friday, December 
17th.....Thanks....and Merry Christmas everybody......!!!!!

As you know, current firm contracts on Transwestern provide for delivery of 
250 MMcf/d of gas to Topock.  In the context of the Gallup Expansion, 
Transwestern has entered into firm contracts for an additional 40 MMcf/d to 
Topock.  Once the Gallup expansion is built, Transwestern will have a total 
of 290 MMcf/d of firm capacity under contract to the Topock delivery point:  
40 MMcf/d more than PG&E has agreed to accept while PCBs continue to be 
present.

Bill Cordes has asked what Transwestern's potential liability to shippers 
would be if PG&E's refusal to accept deliveries due to the continued presence 
of contaminants causes Transwestern to have to curtail firm service at 
PG&E/Topock.  The legal answer is that Transwestern's tariff provides for a 
reservation charge refund but does not limit the damages that could be sought 
by a shipper.  

More specifically, Rate Schedule FTS-1 specifically provides for a 
reservation charge refund if Transwestern fails to deliver gas for a firm 
shipper.  In December, January, February, July and August, the shipper is 
entitled to a reservation charge refund for all nominated and confirmed 
quantities not delivered.  In all other months, the shipper is entitled to a 
refund only if deliveries fall below 75% of nominated/confirmed quantities 
for a period of 75 consecutive days. The tariff does not preclude a shipper 
from seeking other damages resulting from Transwestern's failure to provide 
service under an FTS-1 contract.  A shipper whose firm service is curtailed 
would likely incur damages in addition to the reservation charge, including, 
for example, the cost of buying spot gas or damages resulting from the 
shipper's inability to fulfill contractual obligations. Such damages could be 
recovered in a breach of contract action.  Not all shippers would incur such 
damages because some might be willing to take delivery of gas at alternate 
points if capacity is available at such points.

Bill has asked Steve to work with me in quantifying our potential exposure.  
I could really use your help in putting a dollar amount on potential 
damages.  Can we meet briefly to discuss this?  I'm available after the 
Gallup meeting tomorrow a.m., or after lunch on Friday...or we can discuss a 
meeting time for next week.  Thank you."

In honour of your departure I think it is only right that we do ""Red Meat"" 
one more time.  I feel as though I've said this a lot lately 
but...Congratulations.  I don't want to devalue the statement by repeating it 
over and over again so just know that I am completely sincere when I say it.  
The money sounds fantastic, although I hope that aside from the money you 
enjoy and are challenged by your new role.  I may not know you inside and out 
but I do know that you need to be in an exciting and fast-paced environment 
to hold your interest and sustain motivation and this sounds like it will 
provide that for you.  Also, the step up position-wise is great and I think 
deserved.  As far as being scared goes, that'll be our little secret.  You do 
know though that fear is a great motivator and often provides us with that 
extra push to do and try the things we may not have otherwise done.  

I guess this means I'll have a good excuse to visit NY.

I guess we should do  red meat one last time before i leave.
I got the official offer on Paper, and well...i'm blown away.Couldn't sleep 
last night
I'm now a manager..yeah you heard me right.
I'm Manager of Internet Marketing...WOW...and well the money..Well you can 
ask around you what Manager make, i blew past the 100K, like a crazy "".com"" 
myself....I'm excited and scared, yes scared...i'll admit, but don't tell

SO i'm a little confuse on some things such as when i'm actually moving to 
NY, but Im in NY for Work next week.
So it will happen fast and i'm out of Enron this week.
That's the news...

Christine -- Here's a brief answer to your questions.

With regard to segmentation, Order 637 is completely silent with regard to 
rates to be charged for segmented capacity, so we would have considerable 
leeway here.  The order is also silent with respect to the effective 
restriction of segmented capacity by making discounts inapplicable to certain 
alternate (or primary) points.  Hopefully TW will be able to avoid the 
segmentation issue altogether by invoking the Global Settlement, as we plan 
to do in our rehearing request and compliance filing.  (Our Global Settlement 
argument is that we should be able to rely on tariff provisions, including 
our current restriction on changing primary points, that were implemented to 
mitigate the effects of turnback on TW).

On hourly service, I believe that we could put an hourly service into place 
on TW without  running afoul of the Peak and Off-Peak Rates (i.e., seasonal 
rates) provisions of the order.  In other words, I think the Commission would 
see them as two separate kinds of service.

As for how to communicate with our customers, I believe Regulatory has 
offered to have a meeting with TW customers in early April to make a 
presentation on Order 637 and provide a forum for discussion.  I realize the 
order becomes effective March 27; however, compliance filings are not due 
until May 1, and some requirements do not even become effective until 
September 1.  Before the beginning of April, the GPG pipelines will simply 
not have their positions fully formed enough to make a very well-organized 
presentation to persons outside the company.  The meeting is still in the 
planning stages and I will fill you in on details as they are available.  In 
the meantime, if your customers have questions, I'll be happy to help answer 
them.

Subject: 637 Summary Items

Thanks Susan for the 637 summary.  Here are a couple of items that I need 
additional clarification on:

1)  Segmentation -  You summarized "" Pipelines must allow segmentation to the 
extend operationally feasible and cannot hide behind current tariff 
provisions ...  ""    Does this mean, for example, an Ignacio to California 
contract (i.e. 40,000 Dth/d at a $.20 total path rate) could be segmented by 
the shipper such that on any single day they could nom 40 MM/d from Ignacio 
to El Paso Blanco as well as 40 MM/d from Blanco to California?  If they 
could, would the $.20 apply to each segment such that we could bill them 80 
MM/d ($.20) for the time period that they flowed on a segmented basis or 
would they only pay the $.20 applied to the contract's 40 MM/d MDQ?      
Another scenario would be if the shipper is allowed to flow based on this 
segmented basis, but unless the discount letter providing the $.20 
specifically provides for a negotiated segmented transport rate the shipper 
will be billed MAX rate for some or both of the segmentated paths (?) if 
these paths are not already provided as ""alternate"" receipt or delivery 
paths?  

2)  Peak & OFF-Peak Rates. - You summarized "" The policy does not apply to 
long-term shippers with contracts for 12 or more consective months of 
service.""   

 TW will eventually file for hourly rates, however, the parties most 
interested in this service will be marketers serving a generation station, or 
the generation station's own gas supply manager/purchaser.  Most likely these 
contracts WILL BE of a longer term nature than month to month or even 
seasonal.  I need to reconcile your summarized comment to what we will expect 
from the marketplace.

Thanks for your feedback.  Since 637 is effective March 27th, I am eager to 
be able to speak intelligently to my customers regarding some of these more 
critical issues.  Thanks.

O.K.  Just wanted to see if we're still on for Saturday night.  Let me know 
if anyone else wants to come because I think I'm just going to order the 
tickets today over the phone or on the internet.  Also, I was trying to 
remember how much I covered of your meal the other night at Sabroso's.  I 
think it was around $15, so if it's okay with you I'll just pay for your 
ticket and then take the difference from the amount you sent in that email 
and cut you a check for that amount (I know I'm very delinquent).  I promise 
I'm good for the money.  Also, was wondering if you're still interested in 
the Bruce Cockburn concert on the 11th.  Just let me know.  Hope your having

I just finished having lunch with Tobin and he filled me in a bit about this 
morning's meeting.  I don't know how you reacted, if you were upset, etc.  
but I wanted to offer this up if you were struggling with the situation.  
Whatever happens and whatever is said about your move don't ever lose sight 
of the fact that in every aspect of this situation you conducted yourself in 
the best and most open manner possible.  In no way can or should your conduct 
be called into question.  Bearing that in mind any criticism that was 
expressed within the meeting this morning was beyond inappropriate.  I am 
sure it reflected much more poorly on the accuser than it did any of those 
being criticized.  Furthermore, just keep focused on what an incredible 
opportunity this move is going to be for you and all of the doors it will 
inevitably open.  There isn't a doubt in my mind that you are bound for great 
things, you just have to seize the opportunities that will lead to that when 
they come along (which is exactly what you've done).  

Keep your chin up and whatever you do don't doubt yourself or your actions."

Ben was actually already planning on going.  In fact he informed me he would 
be bringing a friend from Canada.  

FYI - I didn't know there was a ""friend"" in Canada until very recently 
(although I had my suspicions) and further more had never heard a name until 
today.  Regardless, any friend of y'alls is a friend of mine.  Also, Nick is

True i have not often lost...losing is a frame of mind and a way of thinking,

well....Yeah i rarely lose...i don't see why one would want to.
But i have been beaten by people even when i gave my best in sports mainly

it's relative...
Ture i am the most looked at guy at memorial park, and i can't figure out if 
i actually enjoy it or not, because i know my true self, and the reality..i 
have no friends, and i go to bed by myself everynight...i'm a very lonely 
person at heart and in my head, and well beside Shannon
most girls i have dated, though pretty, are not hotties, but rather have a

oh more more honest coment, i don't actually have an opinion on my looks...i 
don't really care....(but i do know about my body! and yeah few come close)

Is it really so you can look at girls or so people can look at you?
  
  I think your right about everyone being able to beat anyone with one 
important caveat.  The individuals in question must be in the same strata.  I 
would not anticipate that an olympic medal winning long-distance runner could 
be beat by Joe Shmoe who runs every day at Memorial Park.  Of course if one 
is patient and bides their time they could probably stand a shot when the guy 
gets really old and slow.

Also, are you so bold as to suggest you've never lost?  Or do you not 
identify them as losses but rather the results of your own choosing?

No I'm not close b/c I can't take off 2hrs from work to go run in the park.  
However, I am getting up every morning at 6 to go run so that ought to count

impending move with anyone save those you have already informed.  I am well 
aware of the sensitivity of the subject.  Believe it or not, sometimes I am

Ginger,  I would very much like to participate in the meeting this Thursday.  
However, given that it is bid-week, I cannot absolutely guarantee my 
attendance.  If it is at all possible for me to include myself with the 
caveat that I may have to pull-out last minute I would really appreciate the 
opportunity.  Please let me know if this is all right and I will do 
everything I can to attend.

Donna Fulton is planning on attending the technical conference in the 
Amoco/Burlington complaint proceeding on El Paso's allocation procedures.  
She has asked that we let her know, if possible, what particular issues we 
are interested in, as this will help her prepare for the conference.  Please 
let me know if you have any comments in this regard.

One caveat:  the technical conference is for ""interested parties"" only, and 
since TW is not an intervenor Donna is subject to being kicked out of the 
conf. if El Paso does not want TW represented there.  ENA will probably be 
sending a representative so at the very least we can probably get some 
intelligence from them."

    For April 2000: Your mind is so active, inventive,
                   and unlimited this month that you're capable of
                   almost anything! (You've privately believed that
                   the rules don't necessarily apply to you.) This
                   month, your incredible adaptability and powers of
                   persuasion help you shed the status quo and
                   break out of the corral. Unless you catch your
                   foot in a bear trap, nothing can stop you. People
                   are fascinated by your mind, wit, ideas, and
                   conversation. (Don't forget: Oprah Winfrey is an
                   Aquarius!) Your views are welcomed and
                   provoke others to investigate things they may
                   have taken for granted. Speak up during the first
                   week, especially if it's to announce you're
                   starting a new venture. Business travel is likely
                   during the first and third weeks, especially if
                   contractual issues need to be finalized. Travel is
                   actually enjoyable this month and can open your
                   eyes to fresh horizons. Aquarius. . . you've
                   dragged your tin cup across the bars long
                   enough. I smell a prison break. . . . "

AQUARIUS

                   For April 17-23: Travel plans shape up and
                   morph into much more. Every step you take
                   seems to branch out into a sea of possibilities --
                   especially lately. The old rules don't apply
                   anymore. The idea of signing up for something
                   and hanging in there until retirement doesn't suit
                   an innovator like you. Your developing success
                   will beget an avalanche of more success. Have
                   your bags packed in preparation for spur of the
                   moment opportunities and travel necessities.
                   Your wanderlust is starting to surface in a big
               way. You want to know more and experience life
               on a richer level. You're not the same person
               you were even a year ago. You understand more
               about yourself. Be open to travel, moving,
               advanced training, and additional contact with
               media and publishing. The word is out, Aquarius
                   -- and hard-to-pass-up offers are already in the
                   mail. . . ."

Subject: Re: Gas Sales on TW?  

FYI a little more background:  

The Amgas relationship began as a result of TW's efforts to unbundle under 
Order No. 636, whereby we assigned gas purchase contracts to Amgas.  In 
addition, we had them administer certain remaining gas purchase contracts as 
well as our de minimus sales function.  All Amgas does today is administer 
our sales function.  We never eliminated our sales function; we just 
transferred the administration of it to Amgas.  

The marketing affiliate rule requires that a pipeline's sales division be 
treated as a functional equivalent of a marketing affiliate.   Our standards 
of conduct provide that the Vice President of Finance and Accounting is 
advised of pertinent sales activities by Amgas but does not participate in 
any of the day-to-day operations of Transwestern's merchant function.  As a 
result, the VP is not a shared operating employee under Standard G.  FTS-2 
transportation service is the unbundled no-notice transportation service the 
(former and current) sales customers received under Order No.  636.   I think 
we should be able to file revised standards saying that the merchant function 
is even smaller than it was when we unbundled [true?] which is not enough 
work for an agent to perform and that we've brought it back in house and 
explain why the person with the sales function responsibility is not a shared 
operating employee under G.   Maria

Subject: Re: Gas Sales on TW?  

This sounds like a good candidate for a waiver application to FERC.  If we 
can save the $60,000/yr, it would be worth asking FERC for authority to 
simply use an ET&S market services person to administer the farm tap sales 
from time to time, without any functional separation or other junk.  We could 
even list the specific sales contracts we have so FERC would be comfortable 
that we are not going to expand the business.  The NN situation was different 
(I think) because NN had formally notified FERC that it was discontinuing use 
of its sales rate schedule.  Would TW use the FTS-2 rate schedule?  We have 
never formally discontinued the TW sales function, right?   What do you guys 
think about the likelihood that FERC would approve such a waiver?  Has it 
ever approved similar small-volume waivers?  DF

Subject: Gas Sales on TW?

I've been asked to look into whether TW may administer its farm tap sales 
contracts directly or whether we need to continue to use AmGas.  TW no longer 
has any gas purchase contracts, just a handful of sales contracts to persons 
who granted rights of way to TW.  Many of these parties don't even buy gas on 
a regular basis, but they still have the contractual right to do so.  We pay 
AmGas around $60,000/year to administer the contracts.  The AmGas contract is 
terminable on 30 days notice.

I know that last year NNG re-established its pipeline sales division to make 
occasional gas sales and for other economic reasons (i.e. the base gas 
deal).  Do you think it would be worthwhile for TW to do the same?  Looks 
like NNG had an easy time getting its filing approved, but would like to hear 
from you what all was involved behind the scenes -- in other words, was it as 
easy as it looked?  

Another idea that Maria suggested would be to apply to the Commission to 
waive the Section 284.286 requirements in this instance since the remaining 
sales contracts are so few and insignificant. 

Your comments would be most appreciated!

As per our discussion of this a.m., ENA IT has a ""program fix"" in Stage which 
will handle 
the generation of confirmations for Gas Daily swaps that may be booked as two 
legs in the
future.  This change effects both TAGG - Deal Capture and TAGG - Deal 
Clearing.

In order to be ready for the commercial people in case they use the two 
legged Gas Daily
deal, I am requesting that your Gas Daily team input maybe 20-25 deals in 
TAGG - Deal
Capture using the new guidelines.  Ron Nolte has outlined below how the input 
process 
should be handled for these types of deals.

I will be out of the office Monday and Tuesday of next week so I am 
requesting that the Gas 
Daily team have these deals in by next Wednesday.

Thanks for your help.

Bob,

Ricky is in the process of changing TAGG Deal Clearing to be able to combine 
the deal leg
containing the Nymex ( fixed )  price and the deal leg containing the Gas 
Daily( float )  price onto one
confirm.

In order for this as well as the changes to the Settlement process  to work, 
the following rules
must be adhered to when the deal is captured.

1) The fixed price must be entered as leg 1.
2) The float price must be entered as leg 2.

3) Leg 1 and leg 2 must be ""linked"" by clicking the ""Link"" button on the deal 
capture
 window and by inserting a row as follows:

 

 The ""Purpose"" above will be listed as ""Deal Link"" when the picklist 
displays.  The ""Link"" can be
 done from either leg 1 or leg 2.

 4) The  confirm can only be created/revised/viewed/printed/faxed  from leg 1.

 5) The clearing status of the deal can only be changed from leg 1.

 Please note that  any change to the status of either leg will be reflected 
on the other
 leg automatically; e.g., assume a confirm is created on leg 1,  the deal 
status of both 
 legs will display ""Generated"".  Then assume someone changes leg 2 in Deal 
Capture,
 the status of both legs in TAGG deal clearing will be automatically set to 
""Pending -
 Revised after Generated"".

Here is some preliminary research on the Commercial Group's question of 
whether we can have a tariff provision in which shippers pay cash for fuel 
rather than providing fuel in kind.  If you want the attachments (examples of 
other pipelines' tariff provisions) I will send you a hard copy.  Comments?  
Are there any rate case implications I should be aware of?

So Burton hits me with ""I hear you drink like a fish.  Supposedly you were 
slamming them back last night.""  When I asked where he garnered such 
information he told me ""From our friend on 28.""  I promptly sent the 
following message ""Nice...so do you inform everyone you come in contact with 
that I drink like a fish?""  Result, no response to me but he called Burton to 
lambast him for ratting him out.  And the eternal question remains, if no 
longer interested why care so much?"

Fellow Analysts and Associates,

A strong interest has been expressed in regards to forming a volunteer group 
within our program to do service/community work such as Habitat for Humanity 
and etc. 

Many of us already volunteer individually.  It would be nice if we were to 
volunteer together as well on a monthly basis.  In addition to contributing 
to the welfare of the community, this will also give us an opportunity to get 
to know one another better.  

Please respond to Gallin Fortunov via e-mail in order to be included in this 
volunteer e-mail list.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out.""
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my
coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"",
and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him
(no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a
bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out.""
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my
coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"",
and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him
(no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a
bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out.""
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta

 And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable

 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my

equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch

4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the

6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk

songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit

I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may

about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a

am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that

11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that

 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out.""
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my
coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"",
and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him
(no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a
bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the

Hi Lindy.  Sorry I've not yet set up the meeting on imbalances...I feel I am 
still lacking focus so thought I'd run this by you for your comments before 
inviting people.   
 
First of all, I believe the general topics we wanted to address were:

- imbalance netting & trading
- mandatory use of Park N Ride service for out of balance operators
- hourly determination of imbalances

Is this correct?

Next, the list of attendees:  you, me, Darrell, Richard Hanagriff, Sheila 
Nacey (or someone else she designates).  Anyone else?

As far as timing, I am very flexible, so let me know what works for you, and 
I'll get it set up.

Via a quick phone call to Little Woodrow's I was informed that the ""steak

Thus, our evening out is on.  See everyone there around 7:30 p.m.  If you 
can't make it till later that's OK we'll save you a seat.  Besides, most of 
you would probably put good money down on my being there until closing.

Via a quick phone call to Little Woodrow's I was informed that the ""steak 
dude"" (as nstepha has coined him) cooks come rain, sleet, snow or shine.  
Thus, our evening out is on.  See everyone there around 7:30 p.m.  If you 
can't make it till later that's OK we'll save you a seat.  Besides, most of 
you would probably put good money down on my being there until closing.  
Cheers."

Barring weather issues, it would appear as though we are on for Little 
Woodrow's tonight.  I don't believe a definite time has been set as of yet, 
but seeing as how they ran out of steaks last week I suggest we get there as 
early as possible.

Should we be rained out an alternative location will be chosen."

With the exception of Sunil no one answered the original question (Do we want 
to go somewhere we can eat?).  Given that the three of you sit within inches 
of each other, I'm going to let y'all discuss the matter and get back to me.  
Anything's OK with me so just let me know what you come up with.   If you get 
stumped I'd be happy to offer some suggestions."

Given that tonight's weather conditions may not permit dining alfresco, I was 
wondering if we should come up with an alternative plan.  I think the first 
order of business is whether or not we want to go some place we can eat or if 
everyone just wants to meet up post dinner.  Depending on everyone's 
preferences I have several suggestions.  Let me know your thoughts (regarding 
tonight)."

The quote speaks to so many in such personal ways...Obviously you identified 
with it's message.  Although, I'm not sure about the Dalai Lama comment as he 
does believe in a power higher than himself.

As for myself...

I am still measuring my powers.  They seem to lie in such varied arenas that 
I never know what I will discover day-to-day.

As far as tasting the fruits of my passion, you know what they say...the 
first bite is the sweetest.  And I must say I look forward with great 
anticipation to sitting down at the table when the time is right.

My place in the world is a combination of one of the guys and the ever 
idealistic, eternal optimist (i.e. I see what is and yet still hold out hope 
for more).
 * I don't believe the sentiment in Return to Me was pure fiction.

Given all of this I am very happy.

With regard to the Commission's limitations on the right of first refusal, 
Order 637 provides for grandfathering of discounted long-term contracts that 
are now subject to ROFR.  The Commission's rationale was that grandfathering 
gives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to 
re-execute current contracts.  The TW Commercial Group has asked whether we 
should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts.  In limiting the 
right of first refusal, the Commission has expressly acknowledged that if a 
customer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service, it is likely 
that its contract will be at the maximum rate.  Shippers that are not captive 
and have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of ROFR, 
and the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers 
upon expiration of the contract. 
 
In light of these conclusions, there should be no reason to grandfather the 
ROFR rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts.  Such shippers 
would not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective 
date of a pipeline's tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal 
(assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an ""as amended"" 
basis).  Consistent with the Commission's order, it would not be unfair to 
make these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of 
the contract.  "

As you will note from the email address, my last name is Scott.  If that is 
not enough information to derive my number I will have to question the level 
of intelligence I had previously afforded you.  However, as I hate having my 
illusions shattered, I'll save myself from possible disappointment and just 
give you the number...ext. 31455.

Subject: Order 637: TW Comment on Rehearing Request

With regard to the Commission's limitations on the right of first refusal, 
Order 637 provides for grandfathering of discounted long-term contracts that 
are now subject to ROFR.  The Commission's rationale was that grandfathering 
gives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to 
re-execute current contracts.  The TW Commercial Group has asked whether we 
should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts.  In limiting the 
right of first refusal, the Commission has expressly acknowledged that if a 
customer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service, it is likely 
that its contract will be at the maximum rate.  Shippers that are not captive 
and have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of ROFR, 
and the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers 
upon expiration of the contract. 
 
In light of these conclusions, there should be no reason to grandfather the 
ROFR rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts.  Such shippers 
would not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective 
date of a pipeline's tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal 
(assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an ""as amended"" 
basis).  Consistent with the Commission's order, it would not be unfair to 
make these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of 
the contract.

Hi Susan.  Hope you're feeling okay today.

There was a gas daily deal that didn't pull in yesterday.  I thought that it 
would come in with today's data (thinking it got booked late or something)  
but it didn't.  Could you look into it and let me know where it is.

Thanks,

Carrie

RE:     Southern Advice

ADVICE TO NORTHERNERS MOVING SOUTH:

The following is a pre-approved posting whose purpose is to offer insight
and advice to Northerners moving South.

1.  Save all manner of bacon grease. You will be instructed on how to use
it
shortly.
2.  Just because you can drive on snow and ice does not mean Southerners
can. Stay home the two days of the year it snows.
3.  If you do run your car into a ditch, don't panic.  Four men in the cab
of a four-wheel pick-up with a 12-pack of beer and a tow chain will be
along shortly. Don't try to help them. Just stay out of their way. This is
what they live for.
4.  You can ask Southerners for directions, but unless you already know the
positions of key hills, trees and rocks, you're better off trying to find
it yourself.
5.  Remember: ""Y'all is singular.""  ""All y'all is plural."" All y'all's is
plural possessive.""
6. Get used to hearing, ""You ain't from around here, are you?""
7.  Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone. They don't
understand you, either.
8.  The first Southern expression to creep into a transplanted Northerner's
vocabulary is the adjective ""big ol,"" as in ""big ol truck,"" or ""big ol
boy.""
9.  As you are cursing the person driving 15 mph in a 55-mph zone, directly
in the middle of the road, remember: ALL Southern folks learned to drive on
a John Deere, and this is the proper speed and lane position for that
vehicle.
10. If you hear a Southerner exclaim, ""Hey, y'all, watch this!"" Stay out of
his way. These are likely the last words he will ever say, or worse still,
that you will ever hear.
11. Most Southerners do not use turn signals; they ignore those who do. In
fact, if you see a signal blinking on a car with a Southern license plate,
you may rest assured that it was already turned on when the car was
purchased.
12. If it can't be fried in bacon grease, it ain't worth cooking, let alone
eating.
13. The wardrobe you always brought out in September can wait until
December.
14. If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the most
minuscule accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the local
grocery store. It does not matter if you need anything from the store.
It is just something you're supposed to do.
15. Satellite dishes are very popular in the South. When you purchase
one,it
is positioned directly in front of the house. This is logical, bearing in
mind that the dish cost considerably more than the house, and should,
therefore, be prominently displayed.
16.  Be advised that in the South, ""He needed killin'"" is a valid defense.

Wilson, I treasure your NY attitude.  I think part of the reason you find so 
few hotties in Houston/Texas is that travel and exposure add such an 
intangible element to a person and very few Texas girls have experienced 
either.

        I think everyone has a different definition of good, some more 
lenient some more stringent.  At least that has been my experience.

good to see your not to pist off at my NY attitude and my dicking around last

I was just busting balls for the hell of it..cause some of these texans are 
complitely uncultured .....makes me laugh.
And no all girls are not FAT in Houston...but there are not that many hotties 
Vs. the great cities of the world.
It was fun though and i value your good humour and attitude. 

How to define a good girl.....or rather how do we define ""good""

It occurred to me last night after you two had left that we never quantified 
what constitutes a ""good"" girl.  And, given that oversight I may have been 
remiss in stating that Wilson was not ready for said good girl.  Just as the 
opinion of women in Texas differed between you Yanks and the Texas boys at 
the table, I am inclined to believe that our definitions of a ""good"" girl may 
not be in line.  


P.S. -- A person in their nineties is referred to as a nonagenarian.  (We 
really should have figured that one out last night.)"

Susan,
 I find that you have a midly attractive sense of humor and a cynical side to 
you that separates you from the rest of the tribe.  Its funny you mentioned 
the Astros game.  I was actually thinking of inviting you (since I have two 
tickets to tonight's game and all) but you have turned me down so many times 
in the past I decided to go with a more conservative pick.  Anyhow, since I 
absolutely detest Woody's and all of my bold suggestions for other venues 
consistently gets dissed by the group's brain trust, please take me off of 
this distribution list.  Have a nice day.

Steve

Oh wait, I can't go to the ball game because I couldn't take a day off from 
work to stand in the Enron lobby (or send my secretary to do it for me).  

For all of you who have managed to snag tickets for tonight's game 
congratulations and you suck.  For the rest of us stuck out in the cold I 
suggest the only viable alternative before us is to drown our sorrows in a 
cold bottle of beer (or two, or three...).  I realize the mass email has been 
MIA the last two weeks.  For some this may have been a welcomed relief.  For 
others there may have been some concern that they had been cut-off from the 
distribution.  At present no one has been removed from the distribution, but 
it is undergoing an audit.  Should it be determined that it is necessary to 
remove an individual from the list for any reason that individual will be 
notified and given an explanation.  If anyone would like to know the causes 
for expulsion you can write to:  I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE CARES IF THERE ON 
THIS DISTRIBUTION OR NOT BECAUSE THE ONLY PLACE WE SEEM TO GO IS WOODY'S 
EVERY THURSDAY BETWEEN 9:30 AND 10:00.

On that note, see you guys at Woody's tonight around 9:30 or 10:00.

Subject: Take me out to the ...

Oh wait, I can't go to the ball game because I couldn't take a day off from 
work to stand in the Enron lobby (or send my secretary to do it for me).  

For all of you who have managed to snag tickets for tonight's game 
congratulations and you suck.  For the rest of us stuck out in the cold I 
suggest the only viable alternative before us is to drown our sorrows in a 
cold bottle of beer (or two, or three...).  I realize the mass email has been 
MIA the last two weeks.  For some this may have been a welcomed relief.  For 
others there may have been some concern that they had been cut-off from the 
distribution.  At present no one has been removed from the distribution, but 
it is undergoing an audit.  Should it be determined that it is necessary to 
remove an individual from the list for any reason that individual will be 
notified and given an explanation.  If anyone would like to know the causes 
for expulsion you can write to:  I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE CARES IF THERE ON 
THIS DISTRIBUTION OR NOT BECAUSE THE ONLY PLACE WE SEEM TO GO IS WOODY'S 
EVERY THURSDAY BETWEEN 9:30 AND 10:00.

On that note, see you guys at Woody's tonight around 9:30 or 10:00.

Subject: Acquisition of PNM capacity

Lorraine:  here's what we would have to show FERC, along with some of my 
comments.  Let me know if you have additional ideas, and I'll turn it into a 
draft to send around to the usual suspects.  

1.  Rate impact on TW customers; method by which TW would collect the costs 
of the acquired capacity.  

 -  I assume TW would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue 
associated with the PNM capacity; thus there is no cost-shift potential to 
other shippers.  
 - Net costs will be separately recorded.

2.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity enable TW to gain control over access 
to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit TW to 
limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to 
other pipeline services?  (I think Mary Kay will be able to help us explain 
the ""no tying"" part).

3.  Would TW's marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment?  

 - No TW marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction
 - Acquisition of PNM capacity will not result in any undue preference or 
advantage to any affiliated entity.

4.  Will TW as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over PNM's 
customers, to the detriment of PNM's customers?  

 - No.  PNM will be making the capacity available to TW only during periods 
in which it has unused capacity available on its system, so any impact on PNM 
shippers should be minimal.  
 - Service contract under PNM's tariff does not provide for unduly 
preferential treatment of TW.

5.  How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into TW's existing 
open access operations?  

 - TW will enter into service agreements with PNM from time to time to 
transport gas on the portion of PNM's line from Blanco, NM (i.e., the Blanco 
Hub operated by TW) to Rio Puerco, NM, where PNM's system interconnects with 
TW's mainline.  Resulting available capacity will be posted according to TW's 
tariff.  
 - The capacity will be used to serve customers under TW's FTS-1, LFT and ITS 
(right?) rate schedules from the Blanco receipt point to delivery points on 
TW's system.  
 - Lorraine -- we need to discuss our arrangement with PNM -- Would we be 
able to acquire on an as-needed basis?  Would it be an ordinary service 
agreement as provided in their tariff?  Which would come first, our deal with 
PNM or with our shipper?  It might be good to come up with some examples of 
likely scenarios.

6.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new 
facilities?  

 - Yes.  Demand currently exceeds available capacity on the San Juan 
Lateral.  Transwestern was unable to construct San Juan Phase II because of 
prohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on Navajo land.  Using the 
PNM Blanco to Rio Puerco line is one of the few remaining alternatives 
available to TW to expand this portion of its system.  It would enable TW to 
transport an additional ______ of gas for shippers from the San Juan Basin to 
delivery points on the mainline of TW's system without the need for expanding 
the San Juan lateral.  The acquired capacity would benefit customers by 
effectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of TW's 
system, at minimal cost to TW and no environmental disturbance.  Would enable 
both TW and PNM to use their systems more efficiently.

Hi Susan,

Not to make a nuisance out of myself.  But it is extremely important that we 
pick up the missing the Gas Daily Deals.  There are 8 missing deals from 
March 28 and 26 missing deals from yesterday.  This throws our deal count, 
volume and value off for the upper management report that people like Louise, 
Sally Beck and Skilling see everyday.  Attached are the 26 deals from 
yesterday.  I need to know which officialized Post Id that they are in.

Please get back to me as soon as possible.  I will appreciate any help you 
can give.



Carrie

Susan,

Can you change the Pub code on deal ND1381 to IF-ELPO/SJ.  It is currently 
IF-ELPO/SANJUAN, which we don't currently use.  If the deal needs to stay 
booked as it is currently, let me know and We'll set up the language for this

Thanks,
Joe

In the hospital, the relatives gathered in the waiting room where their
family member lays gravely ill. Finally, the doctor came in looking
tired and somber. I'm afraid I am the bearer of bad news,"" he said as he
surveyed the worried faces.  ""The only hope left for your loved one at this 
time
is a brain transplant.  It's an experimental procedure, semi-risky, and you
will have to pay for the brain yourselves.""

The family members sat silent as they absorbed the news.  At length,
someone asked, ""Well, how much does a brain cost?""  The doctor quickly
responded, ""$200,000 for a female brain, and $500,000 for a male brain.""
The moment turned awkward. Men in the room tried not to smile, avoiding
eye contact with the women, but some actually smirked.

A girl, unable to control her curiosity, blurted out the question
everyone wanted to ask, ""Why is the male brain so much more?""  The doctor 
smiled
at her childish innocence and then to the entire group said, ""It's a
standard pricing procedure.  We have  to mark the female brains down, because
they're used.""

You crack me up.  I was going to email you today and tell you about the Bruce 
Cockburn concert.  I am definitely interested.  Don't know what I'm doing 
this weekend, nothing scheduled as of yet so let's try and do something.  
Yes, I am interested in chipping in on a gift, just let me know what and how 
much.  I've heard that I-10 Chronicles CD is really good, I'll have to check 
it out.  Also, do you have Ray Wylie Hubbard's Crusades of the Restless 
Knights?  Every cut I hear from it on KPFT is so good.  Sorry so short with 
the email.  Even though they may be short I should be able to email 
throughout the day.

... hey you, are you interested in going in on a gift for Jessica and Clay
from Dished from the Past?  We want to get them something nicer that costs a
little more... Emily and Lisa and I are going in together so far...

It was so good to see you last night although when we're in groups like that
I feel like I don't really get to hear SCOOP... did you end up going to
Woody's?

I heard on KPFT this mornig that Bruce Cockburn is coming to Aerial Theatre
May 11th and that would be an awesome concert too... we may have to go to
that one too!  He sings ""Last Night of the World"" and then this amazing song
that was on around 7:40 this morning that you may have heard... so good!  Oh
my goodness Susan, I forgot to tell you about this new cd I bought
Wednesday... The I-10 Chronicles... I heard about it on KPFT and it is
awesome!!! It's a compilation cd with Joe Ely, Adam Duritz, Willie Nelson
and more... you of all people would love it! :o)

Okay, now that I've filled you in on all I have for now... let me know what
you're up to this weekend...maybe we can veg together...

Happy Friday!

Thanks.  Lindy and I are going to look at whether any changes will need to be 
made to the pro forma sheets we've filed, and will get back to you.

Subject: EFBH

In discussing the finer points of EFBH Service with our market services 
people, an issue has arisen with respect to allocation of FTS-1 and FTS-3 
capacity.  We are going to have to be able to put FTS-3 and FTS-1 capacity 
into separate buckets for purposes of allocation (that is, allocation due to 
circumstances such as, say, windowing by SoCal, &c.).  Here's why.  If 
capacity became constrained on a given day and we allocated FTS-3 and FTS-1 
together, FTS-1 service would essentially be enjoying the use of capacity 
created by EFBH.  This is all well and good until EFBH cancels at the last 
minute. Then you know what would happen:  FTS-1 would get cut because EFBH 
cancelled.  I am told that this would necessarily happen because once FTS 
schedules, it gets flowing gas rights.  To keep this scenario from happening, 
we feel that FTS-3 will have to be put in its own bucket and not get cut 
unless EFBH doesn't show up.

Obviously, there is more to it than this, and Lindy and I would like to 
discuss it with you.  The systems people can't continue their work until we 
get this resolved.  Can we discuss this on Monday or some other time next 
week?  

Thanks, 
SS

Susan,
 I find that you have a midly attractive sense of humor and a cynical side to 
you that separates you from the rest of the tribe.  Its funny you mentioned 
the Astros game.  I was actually thinking of inviting you (since I have two 
tickets to tonight's game and all) but you have turned me down so many times 
in the past I decided to go with a more conservative pick.  Anyhow, since I 
absolutely detest Woody's and all of my bold suggestions for other venues 
consistently gets dissed by the group's brain trust, please take me off of 
this distribution list.  Have a nice day.

Oh wait, I can't go to the ball game because I couldn't take a day off from 
work to stand in the Enron lobby (or send my secretary to do it for me).

cold bottle of beer (or two, or three...).  I realize the mass email has been

Sorry I've been MIA this week...new job and all.  Thought you might get a 
kick out of this email.  It's from that guy that is 25 but looks about 40.  
And yet he resurfaces again (read the email at the bottom first then his). 

Yes I will be attending the Taster's dinner this evening.  Look forward to 
seeing you there.

Susan,
 I find that you have a midly attractive sense of humor and a cynical side to 
you that separates you from the rest of the tribe.  Its funny you mentioned 
the Astros game.  I was actually thinking of inviting you (since I have two 
tickets to tonight's game and all) but you have turned me down so many times 
in the past I decided to go with a more conservative pick.  Anyhow, since I 
absolutely detest Woody's and all of my bold suggestions for other venues 
consistently gets dissed by the group's brain trust, please take me off of 
this distribution list.  Have a nice day.

Steve

Oh wait, I can't go to the ball game because I couldn't take a day off from 
work to stand in the Enron lobby (or send my secretary to do it for me).  

For all of you who have managed to snag tickets for tonight's game 
congratulations and you suck.  For the rest of us stuck out in the cold I 
suggest the only viable alternative before us is to drown our sorrows in a 
cold bottle of beer (or two, or three...).  I realize the mass email has been 
MIA the last two weeks.  For some this may have been a welcomed relief.  For 
others there may have been some concern that they had been cut-off from the 
distribution.  At present no one has been removed from the distribution, but 
it is undergoing an audit.  Should it be determined that it is necessary to 
remove an individual from the list for any reason that individual will be 
notified and given an explanation.  If anyone would like to know the causes 
for expulsion you can write to:  I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE CARES IF THERE ON 
THIS DISTRIBUTION OR NOT BECAUSE THE ONLY PLACE WE SEEM TO GO IS WOODY'S 
EVERY THURSDAY BETWEEN 9:30 AND 10:00.

On that note, see you guys at Woody's tonight around 9:30 or 10:00.

Remember those previous discussions about relaxation?  You know me well 
enough to know that I am not easily offended, and in fact have thoroughly 
enjoyed the preceding banter.  Still, I do appreciate your remembering that I 
am a lady. (I have a bad habit of forgetting.)

It is impossible to imply something when it has already been voiced so openly 
and enthusiastically.  (Tobin, you should watch how quickly you respond.)

The Commercial Group has asked whether they can sell daily firm for longer 
than a 3-month period.  This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily 
firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for 
consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.  The discount letter, on the 
other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a 
certain period of time (typically one month).  Steve Harris wants to be able 
to ""sell daily firm for a one-year period.""  In contractual terms all this 
would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual), 
and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.  I 
see no problem with this, do you?  (Apparently the current perception in 
marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month 
period.)"

Jen, you have no idea how appropriate that email was for me this morning.  I 
spent much of this weekend thinking the exact same thing.  I'm pretty sure 
the Monte concert is on a Saturday night, but I'll have to double check on 
that.  I got to see Mr. Smith Goes to Washington this weekend on the big 
screen at the old River Oaks Theater, it was wonderful.  And, Emily, Katy and 
myself went to Tin Hall Saturday night to see Earl Thomas Connally.  We met 
the three cutest, nicest real cowboys there.  It renewed my faith in the 
opposite sex."

Supposedly my phone is going to be switched over the weekend so I should be 
back in the world of reachable individuals next week.  I'm glad you 
appreciated my observation rather than taking offence.  I was afraid after 
two weeks of silence I may have pissed you off somehow, in which case that 
last email would have 
probably been the final nail in the coffin.  

As far as the new job goes it is looking very promising.  Turns out my trader 
went to college with my brother-in-law, sister, and brother so we have too 
many mutual connections for him to be mean or rude to me.  Even without the 
connections he seems like a pretty cool guy and is very supportive of my 
learning all I can about his book.  Hopefully, after I get the daily routine 
down he'll let me sit with him during the down times and watch him work.

You should definitely try and see the film Saturday and even if you can't 
pull yourself out of bed you should rent it, I really think you would 
enjoy/be inspired by it (at least I am every time I watch it).  I hope things 
are well with you although I am sensing some disenchantment.  If that is the 
case I can give you a few tips on how to overcome and once again appreciate 
your current position in life.  Believe me over the last two months I have 
had ample opportunity to do just that.  Just let me know if I can return the 
favour you once did for me.  

Have fun at y'alls Happy Hour tonight.

P.S.  How was Canada?  I heard through the grapevine you went the other 
weekend.

Main Entry: al?tru?ism
Pronunciation: 'al-tru-""i-z&m
Etymology: French altruisme, from autrui other people, from Old French, 
oblique case form of autre other, from Latin alter
Date: 1853
1 : unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others

We got to talking about you at lunch today.  Rudy mentioned that in effort to 
get your goat he often tells you your not being very altruistic towards him 
by consuming
so much of his time requesting reports.  My understanding is that your 
typical response to this is ""I am the most altruistic person.""  I am sure you 
recognize the hypocrisy 
laden in this statement.  If a true altruist is unselfish then he would not 
care if his acts are recognized or not.  In fact, the true altruist hopes 
only that his acts benefit
those to which they are directed.  We may have to downgrade you to ""concerned 
individual"".                       

But given your good-hearted and idealistic leanings I thought you would might 
like to know that the Landmark River Oaks Theatre is going to be showing Mr. 
Smith 
Goes to Washington Saturday and Sunday at 10:00 a.m.  If you haven't seen the 
film it's a black and white starring Jimmy Stewart as an idealistic, 
extremely unselfish
young man who takes on the corrupt political machines of Washington, D.C.  
The film ranked 29th on AFI's (The American Film Institute) top 100 films of 
the Century list,
and is tied for first place on the Sscott5 Greatest Films List..

FYI- Neither you nor Nick have been removed from the group email, I simply 
haven't sent one out in the past two weeks.  I will make sure you both 
receive my next 
brilliant composition.  I must say I was tempted to remove you given your 
complaints about receiving all of the follow-up commentary and a lack of 
appearances.

Skirts must be mid-calf length and of a synthetic fabric.
All clothing worn in FERC hearing rooms must be properly aged (12 years or 
more).
No solid-colored garments are permitted.  Exceptions:  mauve, pink, peach, 
teal, harvest gold.
Hair must be fuzzy, multi-colored and must partially conceal the face.
Suntan hose must be worn at all times.  
Open-toed shoes (preferably in a lighter color than the hem of the skirt) are 
preferred.
Those with a flair for fashion are permitted to wear inexpensive animal print 
garments, metallic accessories or clothing with fake fur trim, so as to 
attract attention to one's originality.

Jason, you can go ahead and remove my name from the email distribution list 
as I am no longer working in the controls group.  I've enjoyed working with 
you and will definitely pay you all a visit when I travel to London this 
fall.  Cheers.

After reading that did you all of the sudden feel as though your body no 
longer contained any organs and instead there was just a giant pit where they 
all used to be?  I never in my life imagined the intense impact an email 
could have.  They appear so harmless at first glance with no character or 
personality to the font or page, but upon closer inspection they have the 
ability to send you soaring or plummet you to the darkest depths.  

I really don't know what to say about the email.  If I didn't know what 
happened afterward I would have said it was very promising, but knowing what 
I know I must resort to my new tag line that guys in general are just 
confused.  I must say though that his quote was outstanding and if Ben and I 
had any semblance of normal communication between the two of us I would send 
it to him in a heartbeat.  But we don't so I'll just have to enjoy it solo.  

I fear today will be a very boring day so feel free to keep up an email 
dialogue throughout the day."

In my never-ending quest to expand myself both culturally and socially I am 
proposing a fun-filled Friday night to those of you who I feel would 
appreciate it most, or at least have any interest what-so-ever.  This Friday 
at 6:30 p.m. Pavel Kogan will be performing with the Houston Symphony at 
Jones Hall.  All of the tickets for this show are being sold at a set price, 
which means that we can obtain center orchestra seats for only $25.00 a 
piece.  My idea for the night is as follows, attend what I'm sure will be an 
outstanding performance, grab a late bite to eat at one of several excellent 
restaurants downtown (Mia Bella and Osteria D'Aldo come to mind) and polish 
off the evening by gracing one of the many hot-spots found downtown (Jones 
Bar, Swank Lounge, Deans, Mercury Room, etc.) with our presence.  Bear in 
mind that my plan is completely open to suggestions from each and every one 
of you.  While I realize such an early show may interfere with some people's 
plans (workout routines, etc.) I am sure things could be rearranged for one 
evening.  Please email back and let me know if there is any interest in such 
an outing.  

""And in the end it's not the years in your life that count.  It's the life in 
your years.""  - - Abraham Lincoln"

Sorry Toby, but honestly this is the first time I've seen such a request.
A lot of things get sent to Susan Scott of ECT by mistake; maybe that is what 
happened?
I would never ignore you on purpose.
I'll call Ms. Lee and give her the correct info.

Subject: Final Draft: GPG Order 637 Rehearing Comments

Thank you for all the comments.  Here is a last draft of our GPG rehearing 
comments.  Please forward any additional comments no later than noon, Friday 
March 10.

Significant changes from the last draft are as follows:
1.  We are asking the Commission to eliminate the peak/off-peak cost & 
revenue study, rather than clarify that the study applies only to excess 
revenues. (p.2)
2. References to the TW Global Settlement have been removed. The reference to 
existing settlements is more generic and included only to preserve our 
rights. (p.4)
3. A new argument on ROFR has been added.  We are asking the Commission to 
immediately apply the new policy that ROFR does not apply to discount rate 
agreements. (p.5-6)
4.Several reporting arguments have been deleted -- masking shipper names, 
clarifying that only senior employee names have to be posted and clarifying 
the Sept. 1 reporting date.  With respect to these last two arguments, we 
have decided that we can interpret it our way without further clarification.
5.New clarification concerning the date for which the lifting of the price 
caps on capacity release is to be implemented.

Hi!   Thanks for the update, it is good to hear from you.  Sorry Grayson is 
being a crybaby.  It is tough being a baby, I think.  How did the doctor's 
app't go?  Bet you are ready for the weekend so Jim'll be around all day.  
Every working mom I know could not wait to get back to the office after 
maternity leave.  I think the daycare arrangement is generally best for 
everyone.  Baby gets a head start on her social life, and the parents can't 
wait to see the kid at the end of the work day!  Most everyone I know is 
raising their kids that way, and they seem to be turning out fine.  Even the 
handful of stay-at-home moms I've met leave their kids with someone several 
days a week, for sanity's sake.

Had lunch with Mema on Wednesday at Treebeards.  I get the impression that 
she's gotten the message that you and Jim don't exactly want her dropping in 
for spontaneous visits, so that's good.  I always enjoy meeting her for 
lunch--for some reason she's always on best behavior, and we always run into 
my coworkers and friends who just think she's the greatest.  Thank God she 
can never remember their names, or she might start calling them for lunch.  

Bill and I saw a play at Diverse Works last night called ""Fucking A.""  It was 
a take-off on The Scarlet Letter.  I thought it would be funnier but it was 
actually pretty dark.  The bearer of the letter A was an abortionist in a 
strange land working to pay her son's way out of jail.  Despite the subject 
matter it was one of the best plays I've seen in a very long time.  Diverse 
Works is an art space in the warehouse district directly north of downtown.  
(Nancy Littlejohn (Worthington) has her art gallery nearby.)  They mostly 
sponsor dance, dramatic and performance art productions.  A lot of it is 
really over the top, but I've seen some cool things there.  One of my friends 
at work is trying to get me to serve on the board of directors, so I've been 
hanging out there to see whether I like the people.  

Work is driving me nuts, but that's what they pay me for, I guess.

Time to read more FERC cases.  I don't wanna FERC, I just want to bang on the 
drum all day.

Hang in there, and please send more news of little bug!

Love,
Susan"

The term of the FTS-1 agreement is for one day, and automatically renews from 
day to day.
The discount letter provides that the discount applies to the one-day term 
and each consecutive one-day term (if any).  The term of the discount letter 
is typically one month or 3 months.  The discount letter does not obligate TW 
to provide service for more than one day, but as long as the term of the 
service agreement renews, the same discount would apply.  

My point is that if we are already contracting for daily firm this way, it 
should not matter whether the discount is effective for one month or for 12 
months.  

If there is a problem with the current arrangement, we should discuss it.  
Nothing about the way we do these deals has changed since we discussed it 
last December.

Subject: daily firm on TW

The Commercial Group has asked whether they can sell daily firm for longer 
than a 3-month period.  This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily 
firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for 
consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.  The discount letter, on the 
other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a 
certain period of time (typically one month).  Steve Harris wants to be able 
to ""sell daily firm for a one-year period.""  In contractual terms all this 
would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual), 
and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.  I 
see no problem with this, do you?  (Apparently the current perception in 
marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month 
period.)

Part II:  FERC Writing Handbook

1.  ""WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED"" adds a note of authority to your 
pleadings.  In fact, some administrative law judges will throw your pleading 
into the special incinerator marked ""Nonconforming Pleadings"" (located on the 
west side of the FERC building) unless such language is present.

2.  Pronouns should be used sparingly, if at all.  With few exceptions, 
parties must always be named to avoid confusion, even if it means the name of 
the party will appear several times in one sentence.

3.  The verb ""request"" may not be used without the word ""to.""  Example:  
""Pipeline X respectfully requests the Commission to grant its motion.""

4.  ""In regards to"" or ""vis-a-via"" sound more intelligent than ""about"" or 
""concerning.""

5.  If you are not sure you've conveyed an important point effectively, 
repeat the statement verbatim at various other points in your pleading for 
emphasis.  Additionally, repeating a contractual provision several times in a 
contract will give your client greater rights than if you only include the 
provision once.

6.  Always recite the entire history of the proceeding in your pleading 
before stating the purpose of your pleading.  No FERC staffer ever remembers 
what happens, and the added pages will make your pleading really impressive.

7.  When in doubt, insert more commas.

gravity (GRAV-i-tee) noun

   1. The natural force of attraction exerted by a celestial body, such as
      Earth, upon objects at or near its surface, tending to draw them toward
      the center of the body. The natural force of attraction between any two
      massive bodies, which is directly proportional to the product of their
      masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between
      them. Gravitation.

   2. Grave consequence; seriousness or importance.

   3. Solemnity or dignity of manner.

[French gravite, heaviness, from Old French, from Latin gravitas, from
gravis, heavy.]

Ambigram: http://wordsmith.org/words/gravity.gif

GRAVITY
If it weren't for gravity, we wouldn't know which way was was up. Without
gravity to pull things ""down,"" there would be no such thing as up or down.
This is an excellent example of the yin/yang idea that nothing exists except
in relation to its opposite. The opposite of gravity is weightlessness. A fair
conclusion: Gravity is the soul of wt.

philosophaster (fi-los-uh-FAS-tuhr, fi-LOS-uh-fas-tuhr) noun

   A pseudo-philosopher.

[From Late Latin, philosopher + -aster, a pejorative suffix indicating
something that is inferior or mimics another.]

   ""I allude more particularly to you, O stolid philosophaster, who presume
   to style yourself a practical chemist, a good philosopher, and yet are
   entirely destitute of all knowledge...""
   Arthur Edmund Waite, The Hermetic Museum, 1893.

The pejorative prefix -aster (meaning something that is inferior, small or
shallow) gives us some delightful words when it comes to name-calling. A
reviewer brands a poet a poetaster (an inferior poet) and the reviewee might
return the favor by calling the former a criticaster (an incompetent critic).
In the same vein, we can have a politicaster, an astrologaster, and the bane
of writers everywhere--a grammaticaster. Lest we get carried away here, let's
remember that a grandmaster is not an inferior grandma. Well, enough of the
pretend-people. For the rest of this week, we'll review some other words to

   2. Exertion of vigor or power. Vitality and intensity of expression.

Ambigram: http://wordsmith.org/words/energy.gif

ENERGY
        Philosophers search for truth in much the same way that artists
do. They don't really expect to find any definite answers. They mainly want
to provide and investigate more ways of looking at the world. But scientists
differ slightly. Science strives to provide very definite, measurable and
provable truths. In the back of their minds though, scientists understand that
those truths are only temporary, and that they may very well be replaced
someday by another truth. So they're really not so different from artists
and philosophers after all.

        Einstein's Theory of Relativity has been accepted as a scientific
truth. But it has so far not been found to mesh with quantum physics. It
may very well be that the 21st century will modify one or both of those
truths as well. So for the time being, we can look at energy as mass times
the speed of light times the speed of light. From another point of view,
energy is the capability of a body to do work or produce an effect. It's
possible that the second definition will outlast the first.

picayune (pik-uh-YOON) adjective

   1. Of little value or significance.

   2. Petty, small-minded.

noun

   1. A Spanish-American coin equal to half the value of a real (a silver
      coin).

   2. A small coin, especially a five-cent piece.

   3. Something or someone of little value.

[From French picaillon, from Proven?al picaioun, a small coin.]

   criticism would be picayune and, I believe, wrong.""
   Hawley, F. Frederick, Terrorism in America: Pipe Bombs and Pipe Dreams.

   I've never been much for form. So, of the speaker, Gingrich's three
   recent personal problems - his mother, his historian and his book -
   the book is potentially, I think, the most serious.""
   Schorr - Reality Sets in for New Congress, Weekend Edition - Saturday
   NPR, Jan 14, 1995.

While Times, Journal, Post, Reporter, News, Voice, etc., are common as the
names of newspapers, there are many papers with rather offbeat words in their
titles, such as Crier, Bee, Pennysaver, and Reflector. The mergers and
acquisitions yield some remarkable names too. Q: What happens when the
Daily Reflector and the Sun News decide to merge? A: You get the Daily News,
and a sun reflector. The fact is stranger than fiction and there have been,
in fact, more peculiar fusions. In 1939, when two newspapers in Chattanooga,
Tennessee, combined, the result was perhaps a case of truth-in-advertising:
the News and the Free Press merged to become the News-Free Press. Well, maybe
it was a case of too-much-advertising.

In this week's AWAD, we have selected words from the names of newspapers.
Two examples of the newspapers with today's word in their names are the
Times-Picayune and the Picayune-Item. While the critics of some of these
newspapers may believe that they are so named because they deal in trifles,
we have different news. They are so named because they could then be bought
for a few cents, or because they originated from the town of the same name.
The former publication raises its flag in New Orleans, Louisiana, while the
latter calls Picayune, Mississippi its home. Incidentally, did you notice
the two newspaper names are near-anagrams?

While on this topic, let's clear a folk etymology along the way. No, the word
`news' didn't form from the initials of the four directions of the compass
(North, East, West, South). It came from the word `new' as in ""What's new?""
-Anu

sextet (seks-TET) noun

   1. A group of six.

   2. A group of six singers or musicians, or a piece of music composed for
      them.

[Alteration of sestet, influenced by Latin sex, six.]

   ""With the local hockey sextet locked in a Stanley Cup series it would be
   loyal to stop by and pick up a six-pack.""
   Dick Kreck, Raise a Glass to Avs, The Denver Post, May 18, 2001.

The word sextet has nothing to do with sex, unless of course, the six people
in question engage in some questionable calisthenics. That's what the English
language does--often leading us on only to make things limpid in the end.
There we go again. Take the word friable, for instance. All evidence leads
us to suggest this word could be used to refer to raw potato chips. But in
truth, something friable is that which could be easily crumbled. Well, it
could be used to refer to potato chips, after all. This week's AWAD visits
these red-herring words, words with meanings that are not the first things
that come to mind.                                                    -Anu

potatory (POH-tuh-tor-ee) adjective

   Pertaining to or given to drinking.

[From Latin potatorius, from Latin potatus, past participle of potare,
to drink.]

The word potatory has little to do with potatoes, unless the drink in

Ambigram: http://wordsmith.org/words/philosophy.gif

PHILOSOPHY
        My fondness for ambiguity in language and its graphic
representation hurtles me headlong into the hallways of heady philosophy.
Like ambiguity, philosophy tends to scare a lot of people, and it does so
for the same reason. Maintaining a single point of view on an issue is
often the easiest path, but it is not consistent with a philosophical
spirit. After all, ""philosophy"" is derived from Greek words meaning, ""the
love of wisdom"" not ""stubborn entrenchment."" In fact, if one loves wisdom
and searches after truth, then one is required to look at things from more
than one point of view.

   1. Everything that's needed or possible or appropriate: the whole nine
      yards.

[Origin unknown.]

   2. Complete nudity.

[Popularized by the 1997 movie of the same name where a group of unemployed
steel-workers turn to stripping.]

   ""However, I found it easy to get comfortable with the toolkit by building

   James Metzger, Using Windows NT Embedded 4.0, Dr. Dobb's Journal (San
   Mateo), Apr 2001.

A couple of weeks ago, the folks at the Oxford English Dictionary decided to
add a few hundred words to the dictionary. That would not be newsworthy in
itself -- the online edition permits incorporation of new words easily and
the editors of the dictionary continually assay new words alphabetically
and add them to the dictionary. What's unusual is that this time they decided
to add the words out-of-sequence, words that otherwise would have to wait for
their turn to be anointed into the lexicon.

Unlike French, the English language needs no nanny's nod to call a word
a word. If a word fills a need, it is a word, no matter whether it's in
a dictionary or not. Still, the inclusion of these words in the OED,
the most venerable around and a true lex icon, does help give writers
their editors' imprimatur to use these words. As can be expected, a
disproportionate number of these new words hail from the Internet. Many
of these terms may appear slang, but we should remember that today's
revolutionaries are tomorrow's conservatives. So use these words in your
writing and conversation with the official seal of approval from the OED.
This week's AWAD features five of these.                         -Anu

ambiguity (am-bi-GYOO-i-tee) noun

   1. Doubtfulness or uncertainty as regards interpretation.

   2. Something of doubtful meaning.

[From Latin ambiguus, uncertain, from ambigere, to go about : ambi-, around +
agere, to drive.]

Ambigram: http://wordsmith.org/words/ambiguity.gif

AMBIGUITY
        Ambiguity is one of a handful of English words whose meaning
describes itself. In other words, ""Ambiguity"" is ambiguous. It refers, on
the one hand, to a situation of imprecision, of obscurity, because more
than one interpretation is possible. On the other hand, something ambiguous
can be understood perfectly well - but from more than one point of view.
        We are amused at the fable of the elephant and the six blind men,
each of whom understood the elephant to be a very different animal. But we
seem to lose that good-natured perspective just in time to assume that our
own point of view on the world is more accurate than that of many of the
other human beings on the planet. We avoid ambiguity as much as possible,
feeling threatened that it may expose our own point of view as merely an
option.
        But we should embrace ambiguity. After all, each of our eyes sees a
slightly different, two-dimensional, view of reality. Those two images are
synthesized by the brain into a single three-dimensional image, which we
think of as ""more real"" than a 2-D view. The more points of view we are able
to see, the more clearly we understand the world around us. Reality is
ambiguous. Ambiguity is synthesis.
        I like to think that looking at everything - not only words -
from alternate points of view, can enhance our understanding of the world
around us.

AMBIGRAMS
Ambigrams are words that can be read from more than one point of view.
I have been creating ambigrams as visual meditations on language--as
commercial graphics and as fine art pieces--for almost thirty years.
Anu has invited me to share my unique point of view on language with
his A.Word.A.Day audience. I certainly appreciate this opportunity. I
hope you will enjoy looking at words in this new way and find it both
entertaining and thought-provoking.

Each day this week, your AWAD regular mail will consist of an ambigram, a
paragraph or so about a particular word, exploring some unorthodox points
of view regarding its meaning.  As it really makes more sense to view the
ambigram first, and in a format that allows you to invert it, I suggest
that you print it out, so you can enjoy its symmetry and reversibility
before and while you read.          -John Langdon (langdojw@drexel.edu)

(This week's Guest Wordsmith, John Langdon, teaches in the College of
Design Arts at Drexel University in Philadelphia. For more information

Pyrrhic victory (PIR-ik VIK-tuh-ree) noun

   A victory won at a too great a cost.

[After Pyrrhus, the king of Epirus, who suffered staggering losses while
defeating Romans.]

   ""With lawsuits multiplying like crazy and mutual accusations of stealing
   the election spiralling out of control, almost any result now looks as if
   it will be a Pyrrhic victory.""
   United States: Whatever Will They Think of Next? The Economist (London),
   Nov 25, 2000.

""One more such victory and we are lost,"" exclaimed Pyrrhus, the king of
Epirus, as he described his costly success in the battle of Asculum in
Apulia. With these words he gave us a metaphor to refer to a victory so
costly, it's hardly better than defeat. Yet, if we talk to those who lost
their sons, husbands, or fathers to war, every victory is a pyrrhic victory.
A war is perhaps the only occasion when killing  a person is not only
accepted but rewarded. If only we could learn to do war with words, instead.
Till then, let's look at a few words of war.                         -Anu

   urban centers. The Allied attack on Hamburg in late July 1943 was typical
   of the kind of spoliation that could be achieved. Half the city's

louche (loosh) adjective

   Of questionable character; dubious; disreputable.

[From French louche, cross-eyed, from Old French lousche, feminine of lois,
from Latin lusca, feminine of luscus, one-eyed.]

   ""They wanted her to be a dancer, but the teenage Bardot fell in with the
   louche and devious film-maker Roger Vadim, and became the notorious Girl
   In A Bikini instead.""
   Adam Sweeting, Channel Surfing: Zouzou Exposed, The Guardian (UK),

A popular admonition goes, ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" Yet we do it
all the time. We ascribe qualities of character to people based on their
physical characteristics. And our language takes shape to reflect that
attitude. Are cross-eyed people shady? I don't think so. At least not any
more than the straight-eyed ones. In this week's AWAD we look at more such
words.                                                               -Anu

   Tribune, Jun 27, 1999.

   ""Said Dr. Anthony Iton, director of health and social services for
   Stamford. 'We have window screens. We spend more time indoors. What that
   taught us was you can have a relatively intense epizootic in birds and
   mosquitoes and not have a human epidemic. Because of our behaviors, we
   protect ourselves from mosquitoes.'""
   Christine Woodside, Mosquitoes? Sure. Spraying? Unclear, The New York
   Times, May 27, 2001.

Author and humorist Mark Twain once observed, ""The difference between the
right word and the almost right word is the difference between lightning
and a lightning bug."" Open a newspaper or magazine and chances are you'll
read about the frightening ""epidemic"" of mad cow disease. Of course, it is
we who are mad when we feed these herbivore animals body parts of other
animals, including other cows, but I digress. With today's word we know
the right term to use when it comes to an animal disease. The root dem(os)
in the word epidemic, meaning `people' is the same root that gave us the
word democracy. Here are two other words with their animal equivalents:
endemic/enzootic and demography/zoography.

In this week's AWAD, we'll look at some other less-known counterparts of
everyday words.                                                    -Anu

anile (AN-yl, AY-nyl) adjective

   Of or like an old woman.

[From Latin anilis, from anus old woman.]

   ""The desire of AngloSaxon Australians to avoid `giving offence' through
   the spoken word is amply seen in compulsory speech codes in the ABC and
   the universities. They are, in (Robert) Hughes' words, `the anile
   priggishness of the Puritan marm, lips pursed, seeking nits to pick.'""

Five or seven messages in a week? That was a close poll. We received 4112
votes for five compared to 4049 for seven. This is your list and accordingly,
beginning with next week AWAD will go out five days a week.

Thanks to everyone for taking the time to voice your opinion. Your love and
concern shows--a good number of people sent their votes for five to indicate
that we, the people at Wordsmith, should take some time off.

Here are some selections from the comments that came with the ballots.
(Ballot, from Italian ballotta, a small ball used to register a vote.
So for this poll, maybe I should call these emailots).          -Anu

   If you go to five, you'll have to change the name of this valuable
   mailing to FWAW. Scott Murphree-Roberts

   I'd vote with the Beatles - eight days a week! Please don't stop AWAD at
   weekends! Barbara Cooper, Rome, Italy

   With so many words to learn, we need at least seven days a week.
   Helen Slade

   Oh, Like I'd Just Stop BREATHING on Weekends?
   More work for you, more fun for me. Seems like a no-brainer to me!
   Thanks for the great service! Hampton G. Miller

   In the Middle East, Thursday and Friday are the weekend. Here in New
   Zealand, our Monday is your (North American) Sunday. The ""weekend""
   therefore stretches from Thursday to Monday. Seen from a global
   perspective (which is the only reasonable view to take on a language as
   ubiquitous as English) the issue is therefore meaningless. Regards,
   Philip Gould

   I like 7. I enjoy the email, and use it to verify that my email is up and

   If, like the gallant little tailor, you're up to seven at a blow, so am I!
   Heartfelt thanks for 'A word a day' and AWADtalk -- the highlights of my
   day! Cheers, Paulb

   Take a break on weekends! Give me time to absorb all the wonderful new
   words you have sent during the week! Maddytg

   Take the weekend off. Although I will miss the extra two entries, I'd
   rather see you conserve your efforts. I would hate to see this wonderful
   service burn out because of fatigue. Jane Dinielli

   Have weekends free. I think AWAD is great, but I also think you deserve
   time off. I hope enough others agree! Art Funkhouser, Bern, Switzerland

   I say take a break but I really love your programme - even if it does
   spell the American way, eh? Rod Dawson, Canada

   I love wordsmith. I feel smarter, look smarter. But I want to be dumb on
   weekends and find that I don't pay attention as much. Please don't think

ahimsa (uh-HIM-sah) noun

   The principle of noninjury to living beings.

[Sanskrit ahimsa : a-, not + himsa, injury (from himsati, he injures).]

   ""As my conception of Ahimsa went on maturing, I became more vigilant
   about my thought and speech. The lines in the Anthem:
       Scatter her enemies
       And make them fall;
       Confound their policies,
       Frustrate their knavish tricks
   particularly jarred upon my sentiments of Ahimsa.""
   M.K. Gandhi, The Story of My Experiments With Truth, 1927.

Today is October 2, the day Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born in the year
1869. A man born some two centuries ago may appear irrelevant to our age,
but in reality his life and message are still applicable to our lives today.
As opposed to being a tale of great achievements, as most autobiographies
are, his `Story of My Experiments With Truth' is a collection of
introspections and experiences in his search for truth. ""Let us not reduce
the standards of truth even by a hair's breadth for judging erring mortals
like myself,"" he writes in the introduction.

In a world where success is measured by what kind of car one drives, how
lavish a house one lives in, can we learn something from a man who got by
with just a loincloth?

Subject: Palindromes

What a joy it is for me to see a palindromic theme to this week's words! Not
only am I huge and long-time A.Word.A.Day fan, but I am an avid writer of
palindromes. An example of one of my attempts at poetry goes --

See fondness drown me.
Lost, solemn words send no fees.

Subject: RE: A.Word.A.Day--strop

You might like to know that round these parts (England), 'strop' has another
meaning: to throw a temper tantrum, or act in a moody fashion. Also 'stroppy':
bad tempered, unco-operative. Interestingly, it means something similar to
another semordnilap: 'mard', a Midlands word meaning a mood or temper. 'In a
mard', 'mardy', etc.

   Also noted by a lot of other folks from UK and Australia. -Anu

In fact, Nancy, Viscountess Astor was not the first woman member of
Parliament in England. She was only the first woman to sit in Parliament,
in 1919. The first woman member of Parliament in England was Constance,
Countess Markiewicz who fought in the 1916 Easter rising in Dublin and was
imprisoned. She was elected in 1918 but did not take her seat.

Subject: Word question

If Misanthropy is the hatred of humankind, and Misogyny is the hatred of
women, what is the hatred of men, meaning specifically persons of male gender?

   This is the second-most often asked questions I get, right after the
   infamous angry/hungry/-gry one. The word you are looking for is misandry.
   Can you think of the perfect name for a woman who personifies misandry?
   Why, it has to be Ms. Andry. -Anu

Subject: Beetle Bailey

Hi Anu - The Sunday comics came through today and compensated somewhat for
the new, weekend emptiness at AWAD. Beetle Bailey lectured Sarge about
""aglets"" (shoelace ends), ""bibcock"" (faucet nozzle), ""punt"" (indentation at
bottom of wine bottles), and ""duff"" (decaying matter on forest floors). Was
this a subtle protest or perhaps divine intervention? And who will
""step-up"" next week to fill the AWAD weekend vacuum? Keep up the good work.

Band-Aid (BAND-ayd)

   1. A brand of adhesive bandage with a gauze pad in the center, used to
      cover minor abrasions and cuts.

noun

   2. A makeshift, limited, or temporary aid or solution that does not
      satisfy a basic or long-range need.

adjective

   3. Serving as a makeshift, limited, or temporary aid or solution.

[From the trademark.]

   ""A Maori health initiative to double immunisation numbers has been
   described as a band-aid solution by an Opunake doctor.""
   Amy James, Maori health programme branded band-aid, Daily News (New
   Zealand), Sep 19, 1997.

""I'll FedEx you these documents today!"" You have most likely heard people
say this when what they really mean is they will send the material by a
courier service, not necessarily the FedEx company. How many times have you
xeroxed documents without even checking whether the copier was made by the
Xerox company as it churned out the copies? Today I'm discussing a phenomenon
called genericide whereby a trademark becomes so popular that it is used as
a generic for the entire product category, not just as a specific brand name.

The success of a brand name is often a double-edged sword for the owning
company. Initially, a company's dream is to become so successful with its
product that customers use their brandname as a generic, ""Need to ship your
documents overnight? Just FedEx them!"" As the brand becomes more popular,
they struggle to protect it lest it gets watered down and becomes a generic--
a victim of its own success. Did you know the words adrenaline, aspirin,
celluloid, escalator, gramophone, granola, heroin, kerosene were all
trademarks once owned by companies? This week, AWAD will feature examples
of words that, once trademarks, now are dictionary entries: bona fide words
of the English language.                      -Stuti Garg (stuti@namix.com)

battology (buh-TOL-uh-jee) noun

   Wearisome repetition of words in speaking or writing.

[From Greek battologia (batt(os) stammerer + -o- + -logia -logy).]

   ""The different forms and uses of repetition range from amplification to
   battology. The rhetorical features noted in this paper constitute some
   of the elements that infuse a powerful oratorical force in classical
   Kiswahili poetry, and repetition is, in addition, an important element
   in the oral-written interface.""

hyperbaton (hye-PUR-buh-ton), noun, plural hyperbatons, hyperbata

   The use, especially for emphasis, of a word order other than the
   expected or usual one, as in ""Bird thou never wert.'

[Greek huperbaton, from neuter of huperbatos, transposed, from huperbainein,
to step over : huper-, over, across + bainein, to step.]

   ""`Out from him sprang the sun and the moon; from man, the sun; from woman,
   the moon.' This deliberate inversion of expected logic is one of many
   uses of hyperbaton in the essay.

   The technique of repeating a word or phrase for emphasis. Also, palillogy.

[From Greek palillogia recapitulation, equivalent to palin again, back +

   ""What Highet calls a tricolon we may today call a palilogy, the deliberate
   repetition of words and grammatical presentations, a sort of parallelism

hacker (HACK-uhr) noun

   1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems
      and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who
      prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.

   2. One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys
      programming rather than just theorizing about programming.

   3. A person capable of appreciating hack value.

   4. A person who is good at programming quickly.

   5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work
      using it or on it; as in `a Unix hacker'.
      (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them
      congregate.)

   6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy
      hacker, for example.

   7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming
      or circumventing limitations.

   8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive
      information by poking around. Hence `password hacker', `network
      hacker'. The correct term for this sense is cracker.

[Originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe.]

   ""When Emmanuel Goldstein, who runs a hacker magazine called 2600, posted
   Johanssen's software on a website, eight media companies (including Time
   Warner, parent company of TIME) sued Goldstein ....""
   Lev Grossman, Digital Divisiveness, Time, Aug 28, 2000.

With the growing popularity of computers, the spread of the Internet and Web,
and the success of Linux, terms from hacker jargon are increasingly going
mainstream, though not always in the correct perspective.

The New Hacker's Dictionary is a fascinating compendium of words from the
worlds of computing, computer networks, and the people who inhabit them.
Last week's citation of Murphy's Law brought enthusiastic responses with
requests for more examples from this book which is available at
http://www.fwi.uva.nl/~mes/jargon .

This week we have terms from this lexicon that give us glimpses of the hacker
culture. Enjoy this geek-week and remember - hackers, though often maligned,
are good guys, they are not crackers.                                  -Anu

Parkinson's Law (PAHR-kin-suhnz law) noun

   Any of several satirical observations propounded as economic laws,
   especially ""Work expands to fill the time available for its completion.""

[After Cyril Parkinson Northcote (1909-1993).]

   ""According to Murphy's Law, this column will have a mistake in it.

Murphy's Law (MUR-feez law) noun

   The facetious proposition that if something can go wrong, it will.

[Americanism, after a fictitious Murphy, allegedly the name of a bungling
mechanic in U.S. Navy educational cartoons of the 1950s.]

   ""In the original, Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis played the Kellermans from
   Ohio, a nice couple whose trip to the Big Apple becomes the ultimate
   fulfillment of Murphy's Law when they lose their luggage, their hotel
   room, their money and their good names.""
   Dann Gire, Get out & stay out!, The Daily Herald, Apr 2, 1999.

Here is a second opinion on Murphy's Law. This one is from The New Hacker's
Dictionary, Third Edition, compiled by Eric S. Raymond.            -Anu

   Murphy's Law /prov./ The correct, *original* Murphy's Law reads:
   ""If there are two or more ways to do something, and one of those ways can
   result in a catastrophe, then someone will do it."" This is a principle of
   defensive design, cited here because it is usually given in mutant forms
   less descriptive of the challenges of design for lusers. For example, you
   don't make a two-pin plug symmetrical and then label it `THIS WAY UP'; if
   it matters which way it is plugged in, then you make the design
   asymmetrical.

   Edward A. Murphy, Jr. was one of the engineers on the rocket-sled
   experiments that were done by the U.S. Air Force in 1949 to test human
   acceleration tolerances (USAF project MX981). One experiment involved a
   set of 16 accelerometers mounted to different parts of the subject's body.
   There were two ways each sensor could be glued to its mount, and somebody
   methodically installed all 16 the wrong way around. Murphy then made the
   original form of his pronouncement, which the test subject (Major John
   Paul Stapp) quoted at a news conference a few days later.

   Within months `Murphy's Law' had spread to various technical cultures
   connected to aerospace engineering. Before too many years had gone by
   variants had passed into the popular imagination, changing as they went.
   Most of these are variants on ""Anything that can go wrong, will""; this is
   correctly referred to as Finagle's Law. The memetic drift apparent in
   these mutants clearly demonstrates Murphy's Law acting on itself!

   Any of various versions of a paradox regarding the relation of the

Stockholm syndrome (STOK-hom SIN drom) noun

   A phenomenon in which a hostage begins to identify with and grow
   sympathetic to his or her captor.

[After Stockholm where a hostage in a 1973 bank robbery became romantically
attached to one of her captors.]

   ""Speaking of refugees, stories such as the Oct. 27 article reveal a sort
   of Stockholm syndrome among those imprisoned on our highways every day.
   We can only smile when we hear people explaining why they love their
   commute: `I focus on the day ahead,' `I listen to the radio,' or, our
   favorite, `I use the time to relax,' white-knuckle relaxation, no doubt!""
   Civilize our transport, The Providence Journal, Nov 5, 1999.

Consider the Stockholm syndrome if you have any doubt about the veracity of
the saying, `Fact is stranger than fiction'. In 1973, following a botched
robbery attempt, the perpetrator held four employees of a Stockholm bank
hostage in the bank vault. At the end of the five day captivity, police were
surprised to discover that the hostages were afraid of them and resisted
rescue. They had bonded with the robber, a prison escapee, and became
sympathetic with him. Later, they started a defense fund for him, testified
in his favor, and one of the female hostages even fell in love and became
engaged to him.

Of course, this phenomenon is not limited to the Swedes. Patty Hearst of the
US, heiress to the Hearst publishing fortune, was kidnapped in 1974 by the
Symbionese Liberation Army. She later joined her abductors and participated
in a bank robbery with them. More recently, an Indian Airlines flight was
hijacked and the passengers were holed up in the plane for more than a week.
At the conclusion of the drama, some passengers were heard saying about the
hijackers, `they were not bad people'.

Why do people turn around and begin to sympathize with their tormenters in
situations like these? It is one of the mysteries of the way the human mind
works. Perhaps it is a way for people to cope with the immense, immediate
stress of being in a situation where their lives depend on their captors. If
one threatens to shoot, and then doesn't, hasn't he done a favor to us the
mind apparently rationalizes. In a place devoid of external contact, the
view of reality becomes distorted and the victims may develop a fondness for
the only person in their life.

This week in AWAD we look at some of the syndromes, paradoxes, laws, and
principles that govern our minds.                                    -Anu

sophomoric (sof-uh-MOR-ik) adjective

   1. Of or pertaining to a sophomore or sophomores.

   2. Suggestive of or resembling the traditional sophomore; intellectually
      pretentious, overconfident, conceited, etc., but immature.

[Alteration (probably influenced by Greek sophos, wise, and moros, dull),
of sophumer, from obsolete sophom, sophism, dialectic exercise variant of
sophism.]

   South Park: Bigger, Longer And Uncut, Cineman Syndicate Jul 6, 1999.
   ""The story is too streamlined and dialogue is alternately sophisticated
   and sophomoric.""

With back-to-school season here, it is appropriate to address learning and
the learned. While the study of science, math and history and other worldly
pursuits is worthwhile, it is also important to remember that what really
matters can hardly be taught. I'll part with the words of Kabir, a medieval
Indian mystic poet, who never set foot in a classroom. Here is one of his
couplets, rendered in my less than poetic translation:

  The world passes while reading tomes, none any wiser;
  Truly learned is the one who learns the meaning of love.

So welcome back to school with the thought that the true purpose of education
is to realize that love counts most. And remember that school never stops at
AWAD. This week let's learn words from the world of learning.           -Anu

Risorgimento (ri-sor-juh-MEN-toh, ree-zor-jee-) noun

   1. The period of or the movement for the liberation and unification of
      Italy (1750-1870).

   2. risorgimento. Any period or instance of rebirth or renewed activity;
      resurgence.

[Italian, from risorgere, to rise again, from Latin resurgere.]

   ""Interestingly, Saba believed that his poetry would be understood only
   when a new Risorgimento took place, that is when `Petrarchan values
   (which are related to death) ... once again give way to Dantean values
   (which are those of life).'""
   John Taylor, Songbook: Selected Poems, Poetry, Jun 1999.

Apart from its massively dominant importance in the world of music, where
directions for form and expression are customarily written in Italian
(concerto, allegro, andante, rubato, etc.) and, more recently, the
shallower domains of popular movies, TV and best-selling novels, which
have given us a host of Mafia-derived terms, the contribution of the
language of Dante to English is far more useful and subtle than many of
us may realize. Whether the subject is philosophy, politics, diplomacy,
religion, sport, or even chess, we may thank the Italians for having
coined the just-right words we lacked in English until they came along
to help us out. Like their wonderful food -- there's another word-subject
for you -- we have merrily gobbled these words up and incorporated them as
our own, as English always does. This week's theme thanks the Italians for
helping up express ourselves more colorfully and precisely. Maybe we should
put that in italics.  -Rudolph Chelminski (RudyChelminski@compuserve.com)

dol (dol) noun

   A unit for measuring the intensity of pain.

[From Latin dol(or) pain.]

   ""Minutes later it was still a comfortable four dol--what did they do, shut
   off the steam? Finally I removed my hand and examined my fingers: great
   blisters on thumb and finger.""
   Richard Kopperdahl, Bettervue hospital, Village Voice, Oct 3, 1995.

One doesn't have to know the unit of pain to realize that the unit of joy
is not the dollar, or any other currency for that matter. We don't have to
look far to discover that some of the richest people on this planet are
not the most happy ones. Having lived in two not only geographic but also
economically antipodal places, I've met persons who were blissful and those
who were miserable, but their conditions were hardly a function of money.
Certainly it is good to have the means to pay for basic necessities, but
after that it's only a series of zeros in some account.

English author Samuel Butler once said, ""Words are like money; there is
nothing so useless, unless when in actual use."" We can't do much about
circulating money (which I hope you have plenty of), but we do try our best
to put words in actual use. This week it is those words that make one say,
""I didn't know there was a word for that.""                          -Anu

pandect (PAN-dekt) noun

   1. A comprehensive digest or complete treatise.

   2. pandects. A complete body of laws; a legal code.

   3. Pandects. A digest of Roman civil law, compiled for the emperor
      Justinian in the sixth century A.D. and part of the Corpus Juris
      Civilis. In this sense, also called Digest.

[Latin pandectes, encyclopedia, from Greek pandektes, all-receiving : pan-,
 + dektes, receiver (from dekhesthai, to receive, accept).]

   ""These phenomena were memorialized in the novels of Zola, themselves
   accumulations between covers of a vast aggregation of sedulously
   recorded trivia. Flaubert had his contemporaries' number, however.
   Looking askance at this pretence to pandects, the empirical mastering
   of all knowledge on a given topic and the boiling it down to easily
   swallowed doses, he reduced it to absurdity in his savant idiots
   Bouvard and Pecuchet.""

earth's surface relative to other matter; second, telling other people to do
so. The first is unpleasant and ill-paid; the second is pleasant and highly
paid. -Bertrand Russell, philosopher, mathematician, and author (1872-1970)

oniomania (O-nee-uh-MAY-nee-uh, MAYN-yuh) noun

  Excessive, uncontrollable desire to buy things.

[From Latin, from Greek xnios, for sale, derivative of onos, price, + -mania.]

   ""Usually, oniomania leads to financial problems, such as overspending on
   credit cards and bad credit ratings.""
   Just Ask Us, Current Health 2 (Highland Park, IL), Mar 2, 2001.

Oniomania is another word for the urge to shop till you drop, habit of the
debit, thrill of the bill. According to a pearl of ancient wisdom, we don't
acquire things, things acquire us. In the case of oniomaniacs, it is perhaps
the fun of acquiring things that acquires them. Imelda Marcos of the
Philippines could be one prime example of this category, also known as
shopaholics, though she could be better known as a shoeaholic.

avid (avid) adjective

   1. Having an ardent desire or unbounded craving; greedy.

   2. Marked by keen interest and enthusiasm.

[Latin avidus, from avere, to desire.]

   ""Global Exchange, for instance, is an outfit of 40 people based in San
   Francisco, and an avid believer in street protest.""
   Angry and effective, Economist, Sep 23, 2000.

A popular motivational saying goes, ""Desserts is stressed spelled backwards.""
This is an example of a reversible word, which when read from the right
yields another word. All of this week's words exhibit this quality. Just like
reversible clothing that changes pattern when worn inside out, reversible
words result in other usable words. A special case of reversible words are
palindromes, which spell the same when reversed. So palindromes are a subset
of reversible words which in turn are a subset of anagrams. Another name for
reversible words is semordnilap, a self-referential word coined by reversing
the word palindromes.

Some words coined in this manner have actually entered the dictionary. Here
are two examples: YOB (a rowdy youth), coined by reversing BOY, and MHO
(former unit of conductance), coined by reversing OHM, the unit of electrical
resistance.

Taking inspiration from the above desserts/stressed saying, can you coin a
pithy aphorism using some word and its semordnilap? Don your wordsmith hats
and send your gems to anu@wordsmith.org. Original entries only, please. I'll
publish selected ones here in a compilation next week. Here is a helpful
hint: you can elicit semordnilapic quality in many words by forming their
plural, past tense, etc. Also, semordnilaps are especially useful in creating
longer palindromic words. Here is a simple example, ""Devil Dennis sinned,
lived."" Can you come up with something more interesting? Email them to the
above address.                                                      -Anu

   An X-shaped warning sign at a highway-railroad crossing.

[From cross- + buck, from sawbuck.]

   ""The federal investigation could result in an upgrade of warning equipment
   at the crossing, which is marked only by stop signs and X-shaped railroad
   crossbuck signs.""

   Truck Driver is Charged in Amtrak Train Collision, The Houston Chronicle,
   Jul 13, 1999.

As a parent of a three-year old daughter, I'm constantly besieged with
questions. While on an after-dinner walk, the enquiry comes up,
""Where's the sun gone?""
""He's sleeping.""
""Why?""
""Because his mommy put him to bed.""

scart (skart) verb tr., intr.

   To scratch, scrape or scar.

[Metathetic variation of scrat, to scratch.]

   ""But despite extensive renovation, traces of barbed wire still scart its
   walls.""
   Lisa Nipp, Little Sisters, World & I, Jan 1996.

When you hear someone pronouncing ""ask"" as ""aks"" or ""pretty"" as ""purty"",
do you find yourself looking down your nose? Not so fast! What you're
witnessing is the English language busy at work, mutating, evolving, and
refurbishing its wordstock, making things easier to pronounce. Known as
metathesis, it is the same process that gave us dirt (from drit) and curd
(from crud!). If you ever used the word flimsy, you did it: the word is
the metathesized form of the word filmsy. It is somewhat like our friend
spoonerism, except that here the letters or sounds get transposed within
the same word. Many everyday words appear in a form created by such
interchange of letters: the word bird came from Old English brid, third
from thridda. Going back to ""ask,"" here is an interesting twist. The word
""ask"" itself came from Old English forms acsian and ascian that co-existed.
Eventually the former won over and became standard. So what we are seeing
here is history repeating itself. A few hundred years and who knows, we
may be exhorting, ""Aks not what your country can do for you ...""

This week we'll look at a few more words that are metathetic forms of
former words.                                                  -Anu

Subject: RE: A.Word.A.Day--syzygy

Regarding today's word of the day, also please note that syzygy is the
longest word in the English language the letters of which, used in any
combination, do not form a single other word.

From: Sheila McKenna (sheila.mckenna@uc.edu)
Subject: Syzygy

My father used to give me a word a day when I was little. Once he gave me
syzygy. In Kindergarten when Sister Mary Angela told us all about the
dictionary, she told us we could look up any word. Even Dog or perhaps Cat.
She asked for a word, and I, brave little 5 year old said ""Syzygy!"" She
smiled a controlled smile, and said, Ah, we don't know yet about a thing
called VOWELS. My dear, certainly you can think of another word."" Nope,
it's in there. S-y-z-y-g-y, Sister, I promise!"" It was, of course, and at
the early age of five I was branded a smart mouth.

So use the word carefully.
Thanks.

Subject: five or seven days

Since the poll was so close isn't there a possibility of arranging for those
who want to get your great service seven days a week to do so? Or would it
require too much work? For instance, what about newspapers which use AWAD?
Alternatively, those who want 'a dumb' weekend can just ignore AWAD or delete
it. And, also, is the majority always right?!
Bring back AWAD seven days a week, please!
Thanks,
Jean Sutherland,
Namibia

   Since the announcement of the poll result, I've received a large
   number of messages expressing disappointment at the reduced frequency
   of AWAD mailings. I'm thinking about making AWADmail a regular weekend
   feature. Consider this a small recompense for the two missing words per
   week. And as always, please keep me posted on what you like or do not
   like about AWAD.                                                -Anu

Subject: Number 13

Could you please give me the word that means a fear of 13 (the number 13)?
Thank you.

   Your question is timely as we just witnessed a Friday the 13th last week.
   The word is triskaidekaphobia (from Greek, triskaideka thirteen + phobia
   fear). Unfortunately (fortunately?), this past week was the only Friday
   the 13th to occur this year so you will have to wait until next April for
   the next.

   Another venue for posting your (and answer other's) questions is AWADtalk,

Your latest email arrived with a warning that it contained a picture. This
is the second time that this has happened. The first time I opened the email
and surprise! No picture. I did not open the second submission for fear of
vile (or viral) contamination. Has some dark force been diddling with your
server? Inquiring minds need to know.

   I've received similar messages from other AOL subscribers. We never send
   any attachments with the messages. Also we use a Linux server not Windows.
   You can't get a virus from us. AOL is not exactly known for following

Annie Oakley (AN-ee OK-lee) noun

   A complimentary ticket; pass.

[After Annie Oakley (1860-1926), U.S. markswoman, renowned for her skill at
shooting, from the association of the punched ticket with one of her
bullet-riddled targets.]

   ""If you're lucky, you've got an Annie Oakley.""
   Tom Rouillard, Big Top Goes Up Today, The Herald (Rock Hill, S.C.),
   May 1, 1996.

This is going to be an eponym week, where we'll see words derived from
people's names. In our quest for eponyms, we are going to visit, among
other places, 18th century England, World War II era, and the American
Wild West.

Phoebe Ann Moses, better known as Annie Oakley, showed sharpshooting
skills at an early age and earned the moniker ""Little Sure Shot."" Later
this shooting star and her husband appeared in the touring Wild West
Show, delighting audiences the world over. Annie was known for amazing
feats such as shooting a coin tossed in the air, and knocking the ashes
off a cigarette held between her husband's lips. I think it would have
been more spectacular if she had knocked bff the whole cigarette, not
just the ashes, but I digress. In another stunt, she would shoot at a
playing card thrown into the air, and before it touched the ground,
riddle it with holes. I wonder if chad came out. Someone figured this
matched the punched free ticket to an event, and soon all passes became
known as Annie Oakleys.                                           -Anu

Maginot line (MAZH-uh-no lyn) noun

   An ineffective line of defense that is relied upon with undue confidence.

[After Andr? Maginot (1877-1932), French Minister of War during World War II
who proposed a line of defense along France's border with Germany. Believed
to be impregnable, the barrier proved to be of little use when Germans
attacked through Belgium in 1940.]

   ""France has no shortage of linguistic generals who seek to regiment
   French and see an enemy lurking behind every new word or phrase. Yet what
   security do they bring? Franglais continues to infiltrate French ranks,
   despite a Maginot line of laws, word-vetting committees and diktats from
   the Academie Francaise.""
   Ado Cherche Appart, The Economist (London), May 11, 1996.

   ""Absent some sober rethinking, forward engagement is likely to produce an
   American Maginot Line around Asia's rim, as myopic demands to stay there
   automatically lead to costly missile defenses.""

syzygy (SIZ-uh-jee) noun

   1. Astronomy. Either of two points in the orbit of a celestial body where
      the body is in opposition to or in conjunction with the sun. Either of
      two points in the orbit of the moon when the moon lies in a straight
      line with the sun and Earth. The configuration of the sun, the moon,
      and Earth lying in a straight line.

   2. The combining of two feet into a single metrical unit in classical
      prosody.

[Late Latin syzygia, from Greek suzugia, union, from suzugos, paired : sun-,
syn- + zugon, yoke.]

Ambigram: http://wordsmith.org/words/syzygy.gif

SYZYGY
This curious word comes from the Greek language, where it meant the yoking
of two oxen. Over the eons, it came to mean the joining of any two entities
without losing the individual characteristics of either one. This idea brings
the yin/yang symbol to mind, and also the ambigrammatic phenomenon of two
letters being joined into one shape without loss of their readability. In
astronomy, however, ""syzygy"" is defined as an alignment of three heavenly
bodies in the solar system, more like the periodic alignment of the three Ys 
in
the word. How could a word that once implied the pairing of two entities come
to refer to the alignment of three?

        The answer comes in the fact that in science, no phenomenon can be
investigated without taking into account the presence of the investigator.
And when two heavenly bodies are seen to be in alignment, they are being
seen from a third, which is necessarily in the same straight line. So
no matter which way you look at the syzygy ambigram, it satisfies both sides
of its ambiguous definition.

Good morning my sweet sweet girl. 

I love you so much. I hope you slept really well last night. I think I may have to cave in and go see the doctor about my little problem. While I'm there I will inquire about the sleep disorder stuff as well. :-( ""Why are you putting that glove on Doc"" EEEWWW!!!

Really looking forward to that let me tell ya. 
I hope you have a relaxing day today baby. Don't strain yourself today ok, you need to heal still and I don't like that you are not taking care of yourself. I worry that you will hurt yourself. I love you so much and I don't like seeing you in pain. Maybe tonight we can go see Black Hawk Down if you want. Or we can just sit around like lumps tonight. 

I love you so much. It doesn't matter to me what we do as long as we are together, that's all I care about. You are such a wonderful person. I can't believe that it is me that gets to be with you. I got the best prize of all...

YOU!! 

I love you sweetie. 
I'll see you when I get home.

This is to inform you that on January 25, 2002 the Honorable Arthur Gonzalez, United States Bankruptcy Judge for the Southern District of New York, entered an order as follows:

It is hereby Ordered that until further Order of this Court, Enron Corp., its affiliated debtors-in-possession in these jointly administered chapter 11 proceedings (collectively ""Enron""), and Enron's employees shall preserve, and refrain from destroying or disposing of, any of Enron's records, either in electronic or paper form.

Obviously, any violation of this order will carry serious consequences.  We know that we can depend on you to comply with it fully.

Bus passes are available for the month of February so let me know if you want a bus pass.  As noted in previous emails from Julie, parking will be paid by Enron up to $89 per month for each employee, and employees make their own parking arrangements.  It's my understanding parking will be paid (reimbursed) for the month of February up to $89.  However, I think the WTC parking may be handled differently.  Please see Julie if you park in WTC since I am not in that loop.  Going forward beyond February, I am not sure if UBS Warburg will pay for parking/bus/Tri-Met, but I will let you know if I hear something.

Enron employees may find the current circumstances stressful.  We want to remind you that Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is still available and currently offering services to assist you and your family.

Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending. These sessions are designed to address the challenges employees may be facing and to suggest ways to minimize the impact of stress on employees and their families. These sessions will be held on Wednesday, January 30 and Thursday, January 31 at the following times in EB32C2:
	
	9:00 am -- 10:00 am
	11:00 am -- 12:00 pm
	1:30  pm --  2:30 pm

Good question, Bob, as this is new to me, too.  Here's my understanding.

While a ""path"" can be either one line or a group of lines, it has a
beginning and an end (a POR and a POD).  Example: Midway to COB.

A ""flowgate"", on the other hand, is a reference monitoring position
(which can physically be a collection of locations lumped into a virtual
point).  It can be used for scheduling as well as for metering and is
generally described as going ""into"" somewhere.  Example: You could
combine COB and NOB into a single flowgate defined as ""Into California
(Southbound)"".

""Granularity"" refers to the degree of detail in your model (i.e., to
what extent it is seen through a wide-angle lens vs. through a
magnifying glass).  So far, I've seen it applied to 
schedule changes (how many times an hour), transmission products (how
small a time increment someone can buy) and transmission grids.  With
respect to transmission grids, it can be used to describe both paths and
flowgates.  Here's a pair of examples: the Mc Cullough 500 - Eldorado
500 path (one line, 3000 feet long -- part of a model with small
granularity), and ""Into WSCC"" (a flowgate in a model with extremely
large granularity).  

When I wrote ""the more granular the flowgate model"" below, I meant ""the
larger the scale of your transmission model by flowgates""; in fact, I
had the ""Into WSCC"" example in mind at the time, whereby someone in the
Eastern Interconnection could conceivably purchase a transmission right
to send energy westward to a sink anywhere in the Western
Interconnection.

I'm cc-ing the rest of the ESWG on this message in case (as I suspect) I
owe our other colleagues the same clarification.

Your fellow student,
John

	John, I hate to ask dumb questions as I suppose I should
understand
this new terminology...but I don't.  You mention  ""the more granular the

between
flowgate and path models.  I hate to always burden you with questions,

you are knowledgeable on these issues and I need to get up to speed. I

I owe you a few beers now. Thanks - Bob

Business Practices

	John, I appreciate your giving the sublists a once-over.  I'll
reply
to
	your comments in the order you wrote them.

	BP 4 says, in essence, ""Before you sell a transmission right,
make
sure
	your grid can support it.""  The gist of BP 9 is: ""If your
Transmission
	Customer wants to move energy someplace not mentioned in the
purchased
	transmission right, but you can still fit it in, then let it
flow
	anyway.""  At the ESC meeting, I was looking past the linkage
statement
	about these two BPs, instead focusing on the fact that BP 4 is
really an
	""OASIS"" practice while BP 9 is about energy scheduling.  Now,
though, in
	the tranquility of my office, I'm inclined to agree that they
should
	still be considered together.  Both of these BPs give you a
choice
	between path and flowgate models (and the more granular the
flowgate
	model, the closer you get to a purely financial transmission
market), so
	how would you feel about calling both of them
""model-independent""?

	BP 25 discusses fragmentary scheduling (i.e., letting a group of
	entities in the transaction chain submit pieces of a schedule
which,
	when pieced together, form a complete and continuous schedule).
As
	written, the BP doesn't seem to tie us to any particular
transmission
	model, because the fragments could conceivably use any
combination
of
	physical and financial transmission rights.  So this BP would
appear
to
	belong in the ""model independent"" category.

	We in the West have suggested a rewording of BP 1, 10 and 12
(hopefully,
	soon to be shared with the ESC) to allow regions like ours to
minimize
	the operational impact of changing the frequency and duration of
	non-emergency generator ramping.  As drafted, these changes
would
have
	no effect on current practices in the East, so more than one
version
of
	each BP would be unnecessary.

	The ""Applicability"" section of BP 24 reads, in part: ""This
Business
	Practice addresses the implementation of a curtailment/reload by
(a
	Scheduling Authority).  It does not address the  process items
leading
	up to the curtailment ...""  I would say that BP 24 does not
depend
on
	the choice of congestion management method selected.

	By the way, I'm sharing these comments with ESC Business
Practice
Task
	Force Chair Mike McElhany, who is apportioning the BP
discussions
among
	a series of conference calls to begin as early as January 30.

	Thank you, John, for your valuable input.

	John, just a couple of quick comments. 

	First BP 9 is identified as an ""independent issue"" and BP 4 is
	identified as
	a ""dependent Issues"", yet both of these BP's work in tandem.  I
would
	think
	both of these should be ""dependent"",  unless I am missing
something.
I
	guess I would have the same comment for BP #25.

	The last page describes BP's (1, 10, and 12) that the WSCC is
asking
to
	be
	worked independently.  I am not sure what this means - a West
and
East
	proposal for each of these practices?  

	Does BP 24 (Curtailments and Reloads) assume a common
(nationwide)
	Congestion Management scheme, or is this BP totally unrelated or
	insignificant to any Congestion Management scheme (physical or
	financial)?


	Thanks John,

How are you doing this morning? How did everything work out with the house and everybody looking at it? 
Work is pretty boring today. I am trying to make a flow chart for the very first time. I'm using Visio to create the chart so it will take me some extra time because I don't know what I'm doing. 

I am so tired. I think it's because I haven't had any sugar in two days. Hopefully I will start to get used to this soon. I know it is going to be well worth the effort in the long run. I love you so much. Thank you for helping me get healthy. You are a wonderful person and I am so lucky to have you in my life. :)

I love you baby. 
I miss you and I can't wait to see you tonight. 

I Love You. 

Craig. 

P.S. 
Did I mention that I LOVE YOU?? :) "

Cara, 

	The pos0201 spreadsheet is out there.   We will use CRC as an upstream at Mead 230 HLH and El Paso Electric as an upstream at Four Corners LLH for wheeling to Pinnacle Peak.  AEP has been selected as the upstream for all other requirements.

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Hi Sweetie. 

I hope you slept well last night. I love you. 
things are pretty slow for me right now because I am waiting for my machine to finish it's thermal soak. I'm going to do some of my review stuff I think. What is on the planner for you today? I hope you plan on taking it easy.

Thank you so much for caring about me. It is so amazing to experience the love that you give me every single day. I know that I will never get tired of it. I plan on loving you for the rest of my life. I just want you to be the happiest woman in the world. :-)

I love you so much Cara. 

I hope you have a good day. I'll see you when I get home.

John, I appreciate your giving the sublists a once-over.  I'll reply to
your comments in the order you wrote them.

BP 4 says, in essence, ""Before you sell a transmission right, make sure
your grid can support it.""  The gist of BP 9 is: ""If your Transmission
Customer wants to move energy someplace not mentioned in the purchased
transmission right, but you can still fit it in, then let it flow
anyway.""  At the ESC meeting, I was looking past the linkage statement
about these two BPs, instead focusing on the fact that BP 4 is really an
""OASIS"" practice while BP 9 is about energy scheduling.  Now, though, in
the tranquility of my office, I'm inclined to agree that they should
still be considered together.  Both of these BPs give you a choice
between path and flowgate models (and the more granular the flowgate
model, the closer you get to a purely financial transmission market), so
how would you feel about calling both of them ""model-independent""?

BP 25 discusses fragmentary scheduling (i.e., letting a group of
entities in the transaction chain submit pieces of a schedule which,
when pieced together, form a complete and continuous schedule).  As
written, the BP doesn't seem to tie us to any particular transmission
model, because the fragments could conceivably use any combination of
physical and financial transmission rights.  So this BP would appear to
belong in the ""model independent"" category.

We in the West have suggested a rewording of BP 1, 10 and 12 (hopefully,
soon to be shared with the ESC) to allow regions like ours to minimize
the operational impact of changing the frequency and duration of
non-emergency generator ramping.  As drafted, these changes would have
no effect on current practices in the East, so more than one version of
each BP would be unnecessary.

The ""Applicability"" section of BP 24 reads, in part: ""This Business
Practice addresses the implementation of a curtailment/reload by (a
Scheduling Authority).  It does not address the  process items leading
up to the curtailment ...""  I would say that BP 24 does not depend on
the choice of congestion management method selected.

By the way, I'm sharing these comments with ESC Business Practice Task
Force Chair Mike McElhany, who is apportioning the BP discussions among
a series of conference calls to begin as early as January 30.

Thank you, John, for your valuable input.

Practices


John, just a couple of quick comments. 

First BP 9 is identified as an ""independent issue"" and BP 4 is
identified as
a ""dependent Issues"", yet both of these BP's work in tandem.  I would
think
both of these should be ""dependent"",  unless I am missing something.  I
guess I would have the same comment for BP #25.

The last page describes BP's (1, 10, and 12) that the WSCC is asking to
be
worked independently.  I am not sure what this means - a West and East
proposal for each of these practices?  

Does BP 24 (Curtailments and Reloads) assume a common (nationwide)
Congestion Management scheme, or is this BP totally unrelated or
insignificant to any Congestion Management scheme (physical or
financial)?


Thanks John,

Could Enron's Business Model Actually Work?

January 28, 2002 

By DANIEL ALTMAN


 

Is Enron (news/quote)'s business model still a good one?
With fuzzy financing and arcane accounting stripped away,
the answer may be yes. Despite Enron's collapse, its goal
of merging the best thinking in energy, finance and
information technology as an online commodity trader still
garners respect. 

""Enron failed because they were scamming, but the basic
virtual market part was fine,"" said Dale Kutnick, chief
executive and research director of the META Group
(news/quote), an information technology consultancy. ""There
is still a real market for virtual trading companies, no
question about it."" 

Enron traded contracts for electricity and natural gas and,
later, other products like rights to high-speed
telecommunications networks and financial hedges against
changes in the weather. It used a sophisticated online
platform backed by a financial apparatus meant to hedge the
company's bets. In the words of Kurt Launer, an analyst who
follows Enron for Credit Suisse First Boston, the company
had ""the pioneering online venture for real-time
availability of information"" used in trading commodities. 

*  
Enron's basic business model, in other words, may yet
serve as a model for other companies. In the wake of
Enron's bankruptcy filing, some of the best support for
that model model came from its competitors. 

Reliant Energy (news/quote) is one of several companies
that followed Enron in offering online exchanges for
electricity and natural gas. 

""Our commodity markets worked just fine the day after Enron
went away,"" said Joe Bob Perkins, president and chief
operating officer of the wholesale group at Reliant. 

""Everybody got gas, everybody got power, and prices stayed
basically the same,"" Mr. Perkins said. ""The loss of one
intermediary just proves that these competitive markets
work."" 

Other companies offering similar services rushed to fill
the gap after Enron suspended its trading. ""We've picked up
market share,"" said Stephen L. Baum, the chairman,
president and chief executive of Sempra. He noted, though,
that unlike Enron, ""our trading, although extremely
important and a big income earner for us, is not the
centerpiece of our business."" 

Another company that sees continued value in the Enron
approach is UBS Warburg, the Swiss investment bank, which
bought Enron's electricity and gas trading business in
bankruptcy proceedings and plans to restart them under its
own brand. 

""We're confident we can re-establish the business,"" David
Walker, a UBS Warburg spokesman, said. ""It is a first-rate
trading platform."" 

Similarities between UBS Warburg's financial derivatives
business and Enron's trading of energy contracts were one
factor that made the deal appealing, Mr. Walker said. ""The
characteristics of trading these types of products and
betting on interest rates, which is a core ability of UBS,
are similar,"" he said. ""They're kind of neighbors."" 

Mr. Kutnick, the research chief, added that Enron had
""outstanding"" information technology organization that was
backed by ""tremendous amounts of money."" In that way as
well, he said, the company ""was certainly comparable to the
best financial companies out there."" 

Because of Enron's technological advantage, Mr. Kutnick
predicted, UBS would have little difficulty regaining
Enron's market share. ""They were far enough ahead that it
shouldn't be an issue,"" he said. ""If you are a couple
seconds faster in terms of spotting and executing a market
inefficiency, obviously you're going to make money."" 

According to experts who consulted for Enron in the field
of finance, the company did not necessarily come up with a
lot of powerful new ideas. Its strength was in synthesizing
existing ideas, which sometimes led to innovative methods. 

""They took a lot of finance theory and applied it in the
context of their business,"" said Ramesh K. S. Rao, a
professor of finance at the University of Texas who once
consulted for Enron. ""There was no magic to what they were
doing."" 

Robert L. McDonald, a professor of finance at Northwestern,
advised Enron on the use of derivatives from 1993 to 1995.
He said the company needed advanced financial tools to
price its derivatives, which specified energy products to
be delivered at various times and sites while demand was
uncertain. ""That's a hard problem, so they were probably
breaking some new ground trying to deal with that,"" he
said. ""It's the kind of thing that's easy to describe and
may be hard to do."" 

Peter Tufano, a professor at the Harvard Business School
who studied Enron, said the company had been using what
would be considered ""best practices"" for using derivatives
by any ""serious financial firm"" in the early 1990's. 

Had Enron stuck to those practices, Mr. Kutnick said, it
might still survive today. 

""Enron could have done extremely well with betting on
market inefficiencies and hedging bets,"" he said. ""People
stop hedging because they get too enamored of their own
theories."" As a parallel, he cited Long- Term Capital
Management, the hedge fund, which failed in 1998 when it
could no longer cover the ever-higher risks it began
taking. 

Enron also betrayed its success, Mr. Launer said, by
throwing money at ventures that failed to generate cash
flow. For example, Enron spent around $2 billion on its
network capacity, or bandwidth, exchange, which never
turned a profit. ""The fact that Enron became a dot-com,
financed itself like a dot-com, and then suffered a demise
like a dot-com,"" he said, ""is one of the central parts of
this story."" 

But Enron's failed attempts to expand its online trading
system to products beyond electricity and natural gas might
not rule out future, similar endeavors. 

""In any commodity, there are always people who have too
much and others who have too little, so there's always
going to be a need for them to trade and exchange,""
Professor Tufano said. 

Mr. Launer suggested that Enron's efforts were simply
ill-timed. ""These things take a while to get going,"" he
said. He noted that the deregulation of electricity and
natural gas led to a long period during which the market
for energy products and their derivatives evolved. ""It does
take a while before users of a commodity get comfortable
with the idea that they should risk-manage and out-source
their use of that commodity.""

In anticipation of the imminent closing of the UBSW Energy transaction, please have all outstanding employee expenses in your possession filed through Enron's XMS system as soon as possible.   Note to approvers - please approve these expense reports quickly.   Enron will process and pay all pre-closing expenses.   After transaction closing,  payments  for expenses submitted before closing (and put into Enron's XMS system) will be sent to your last known address or direct deposited into your account.

Thanks John.

That reminds me there was a list of action items from our last meeting.
I've attempted to list here.  Any comments, additions, or corrections, let
me know:

*	split list of 31 business practices into market design dependent and
independent - done
*	participate in ESC conference calls - pending

*	distribute latest version of John Hormozi's white paper - ""what
makes WSCC so different"" - done
*	attempt a correlation of the differences to business practices
(small group) - pending

*	promote registration into the ESC sector voting through out the WSCC
- week of Jan 28th expected ESC sector registration begins
*	confirm meeting for election of ESC officers - done, election at
April meeting in Dallas
*	encourage nomination of WSCC members for ESC office positions - one
volunteer so far

*	Steve McCoy to contact SEGWIG and/or SEASIC (excuse my spelling)
regarding the 31 business practices (ideally the RTOs could review the
practices and cite problem areas) - pending
*	Others

Hi Baby,

The movie sounds good, nice and creepy! I am going to leave here around noon again ( such a slave ) and go home and work on packing. I can meet you at work or we can leave from the house when you get there.

I love you, I can't tell you how my heart leapt for joy when I saw your face again. I just wanted to hold on to you forever. Those 2 romps were not bad either! ;)

See you tonight, hope you get it all built today.

Love,

CF

Subject: !!! OATI Etag 1.7 Minimum Requirements !!!


Time is running very short.  Is your company prepared for Etag 1.7?  These are the minimum REQUIRED steps that must be completed prior to March 6, 2002:

---------------------------

(1)  All entities must update the NERC Registry at http://www.tsin.com.

(1a)  CA's and TP's must designate PORs and PODs that are valid on tags.

(1b)  PSE's must designate associated scheduling PORs and PODs.  See http://www.tsin.com or inquire with NERC for details.

---------------------------

(2)  All OATI Users must have functioning OATI Digital Certificates.

(2a)  Without the certificate you cannot access Etag 1.7 after March 6, 2002 at all.

(2b)  Inquire internally to determine if a supervisor has already contacted us.

(3b)  To begin the process of acquiring OATI Digital Certificates, please complete this document and send it to OATI:

http://www.oaticerts.com/repository/Company_Information.doc

---------------------------

Failure to complete these steps will result in a partial or complete lack of tagging access and capability!

For additional information on these and other critical Etagging issues, please visit OATI's Etag 1.7 Information Page at http://www.oatiinc.com/etag17.

Good morning sweetheart. 

I hope you slept well last night. I sure am happy that I got to be with you again last night. I missed you soooo much over the weekend.

I think we will be very happy together for a long time. :-) 
Do you want to go see a movie tonight? I was thinking about seeing ""The Mothman Prophecies"" at 4:35. How does that sound to you. Or we can just kick back and relax at home. I'm good either way.

I love you sweetheart. Have a good day and I'll see you when I get home.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

PHASE IIB AND IIA (2 STANDARDS) STANDARDS, AND DEFINITIONS OF TERMS

On February 20, 2002, the NERC Board of Trustees will consider the following Planning Standards and definitions of terms as used in the Planning Standards for approval. This posting is the 30-day (actually 26-day) notification prior to the Board's vote.

A.  Phase IIB Planning Standards (TTC and ATC)

The Phase IIB Standards (TTC and ATC) were approved by the Market Interface Committee at its January 10-11, 2002 meeting and by the Planning Committee by mail ballot on January 23, 2002. They include one Standard and three measurements and compliance templates as follows:  I.E.1 S1, M1, M3-M4 - Transfer Capabilities (TTC and ATC). They can be viewed or downloaded from the NERC web site.

http://www.nerc.com/~pc/standards/#PhIIB_TTCATC


B.  Phase IIB Planning Standards (CBM and TRM)

The Phase IIB Standards (CBM and TRM) were approved by the Market Interface Committee at its January 10-11, 2002 meeting and by the Planning Committee by mail ballot on January 23, 2002. They include two Standards and six measurements and compliance templates as follows:  I.E.2 S1-S2, M1, M3-M6, M8 - Transfer Capabilities (CBM and TRM). They can be viewed or downloaded from the NERC web site:

http://www.nerc.com/~pc/standards/#PhIIB_CBMTRM

C.  Phase IIA Planning Standards (Two reconsidered Standards)

The Planning Committee approved the Phase IIA (two reconsidered) Standards at its November 19-20, 2001 meeting. The Market Interface Committee also approved these Standards at its January 10-11, 2002 meeting.

These Phase IIA Planning Standards include two Standards and three associated measurements and compliance templates:

I.A. S3, M3 - Transmission Systems
III.A. S3, M3 and M5 - Transmission Protection Systems

These Standards can be viewed or downloaded from the NERC web site:

http://www.nerc.com/~pc/standards/#PhIIA_IAIIIA

D.  Definitions of Terms as Used in the Planning Standards

The Market Interface Committee approved 17 definitions of terms used in the Planning Standards at its January 10-11, 2002 meeting. It also chose to remove five proposed definitions that it believed to be unclear, circular, or inconsistent with terms in other glossaries. These five terms are:

1. Entities Responsible for the Reliability of the Interconnected Transmission System
2. Local Network
3. Regional Process
4. Radial Customer
5. User of the Interconnected Electric Systems

The Planning Committee approved the complete list of terms and their definitions by mail ballot on January 23, 2002.

These definitions and terms as used in the Planning Standards can be viewed and downloaded from the NERC web site:

http://www.nerc.com/~pc/standards/#definitions


Next Steps

If approved by the NERC Board, these Planning Standards will be the last groupings of Planning Standards that will have completed the 1997 NERC Standards Development Process, including field testing, and a re-review through the 1997 NERC Standards Development Process. Following Board approval, these Planning Standards will be available for formal implementation of reviews for compliance under the NERC Compliance Program. No further Planning Standards will be developed and approved under NERC's 1997 Standards process.

The Standards, if approved by the Board, will remain in effect until they are replaced by NERC Organization Standards.

Sincerely,

Angie Nicastro
Secretary-Engineering

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents. 

In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI. Thank you for your cooperation."

I just heard from Chris Lue, UBS HR, regarding the UBS New Hire paperwork.  All New Hire paperwork must be completed before 3:00 PM TODAY, Friday, 1/25/02 or UBS will be unable to process your payroll.  

These forms were distributed during the HR Benefit meetings held yesterday.  If you were unable to attend these meetings and are unsure about what forms need to be completed, please see either Grace or I ASAP.

Thanks!

Calif Attorney Genl Says Likely To File More Energy Suits
Dow Jones Newswires

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)--California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday
he is likely to file more unfair business practice lawsuits against energy
suppliers he thinks overcharged for electricity.

But Lockyer, in a telephone interview, said after a yearlong investigation
he has found no criminal wrongdoing by any energy suppliers. He said he has
discovered possible civil violations of California consumer laws prohibiting
overcharging - violations that carry no jail or prison time.

Lockyer's disclosure came a week after the state's top law enforcement
official sued Pacific Gas and Electric Corp., the parent to Pacific Gas and
Electric Co., for allegedly siphoning billions from its underling and
forcing it to seek federal bankruptcy protection.

The PG&E suit is ""the first of many I would expect in the energy area to
overcome overcharges,"" Lockyer told The Associated Press.

""We've devoted a huge amount of investigative and lawyering time to get back
the money...generators extracted from Californians,"" he added.

Lockyer declined to name other companies that he would sue, but his office
has subpoenaed records from Dynegy, Enron Corp., Mirant Corp. and Reliant
Energy - all of which have denied wrongdoing. In the interview, the attorney
general did mention Enron by name, saying ""we're still looking at the energy
overcharges,"" and he accused Enron of withholding documents.

Enron, a major energy trading concern, has filed for bankruptcy protection
following the disclosure that it misstated its earnings by hundreds of
millions of dollars.

PG&E, the only supplier Lockyer has sued, blamed its woes on a 1996
California law that left it unable to collect the full price of electricity
from its customers.

Lockyer's disclosure that he hasn't discovered criminal conduct, including
no evidence of a conspiracy to fix prices, comes nearly a year after he said
he wanted to jail Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman. Lockyer told the Wall
Street Journal in May that, ""I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8
by 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my name is
Spike, honey.""'

On Wednesday, Lockyer declared the statement ""rhetorical excess,"" adding,
""So far...we haven't found criminal behavior associated with pricing
policies.""

Still, the city of San Francisco has accused 13 energy suppliers of
manipulating prices in a suit that is pending in San Diego County Superior
Court.

That suit alleges the suppliers manipulated supplies to keep prices high.
San Francisco Deputy City Attorney Mark Slavin said the city doesn't have
proof of those allegations, but would uncover them as the lawsuit proceeds
in a process known as discovery.

""We think that the discovery process will uncover anticompetitive behavior,""
Slavin said.

The energy suppliers have denied the allegations.

A California legislative committee also investigating a spike in wholesale
energy costs has served additional subpoenas on Enron officials.

The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the
Wholesale Energy Market summoned Enron officials to appear for depositions
regarding destruction of documents. Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, and the
committee's chairman, said he's concerned that documents destroyed by
Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, were covered by a legislative subpoena
issued in June.

Dunn's committee on Wednesday also agreed to subpoena Andersen regarding the
Enron records.

Cara,

Can you please provide the latest contract terms we have with OATI for the West.  I would think that we too could reduce our # of users and Tags being printed every month.

Thanks for your assistance - MO

ENSE, MDEA and East Power was $5425 for last month.  I'm trying to reduce the number of users and services that we don't require.  In the end the cost should be significantly less than this number.

The west has their own arrangements with OATI.  

You will not require anything for the change over to etag 1.7 in march as OATI will take care of this as part of their services.

Kevin Burns from OATI will be in Houston on Feb 13th from 1-3 to discuss UBS services required and I would recommend that you have some one sit down and review the services that you will need going foreward.

Hope this helps. 

For passwords you can contact Don for MDEA & EPMIEA and Eric has the Genco ones.

Thanks.

Lloyd,

Paul and I are meeting with Bob Hall tomorrow morning to sort out what resources we need.  What is the cost per account for these and do these include Portland requirements as well?  Also, what do we need to do for the changeover to the new scheduling system in March?  

Tom.

Corry, Don, Theresa and Tom.

I have asked OATI to reduce the number of accounts from 40 to 10 to reduce the costs for the estate.  Therefore I recommend we go down to the following accounts Enron01-10.

Please reply ASAP.

Hi baby,
 
I sure did miss you last night. I can't wait to see you tonight and give you a great big kiss on the lips. I love our picture together, we are such a cute couple. I'm sure we are going to have tons of fun together.
How did you sleep? 
I'm worried about you on your trip tomorrow. We should go get you some chains tonight for the truck.
Work is going pretty good so far, hopefully it will stay that way. 
I love you and I can't wait to see you.
Have a great day honey.
 
I LOVE YOU!
 
Craig."

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay"

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

Subject: Pfthhhhhhhh Football


 
An old man and his wife have gone to bed. After laying there a few minutes
the old man farts and says, ""Seven Points.""
 
His wife rolls over and says, ""What in the world was that?""
 
The old man replied, ""It's fart football.""
 
A few minutes later the wife lets one go and says, ""Touchdown, tie score.""
 
After about five minutes the old man farts again and says, ""Touchdown, I'm
ahead 14 to 7.""
 
Not to be out done the wife rips another one and says, ""Touchdown, tie
score.""
 
Five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says, ""Field goal, I lead
17 to 14.""
 
Now the pressure's on and the old man refuses to get beat by his wife so he
strains real hard but to no avail. Realizing a defeat is totally
unacceptable, he gives it everything he has, but instead of farting, he poops
the bed.
 
The wife looks at him and says, ""What the hell was that?""
 
And the old man replied, ""Half-time, Switch sides.""

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, ""I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal.""

He added, ""My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."""

I missed you getting up with me too, but that's ok you needed to get some rest. Only a little while longer and I won't have to go anymore.

I probably won't leave tonight until 5:30 or so, so if you get done I would love for you to come to the grotto before we go get Cal and Marion.

Last night was very very wonderful. Being with you, hanging out with you, it all just keeps getting better and better. I love you.

I hope your meeting was a good one. I can't wait to hear all about it. 

I love you so much. I can't wait to see you tonight Ms. Freeland. :-)

Good Morning Honey, 

I wish that I could have pulled it together enough to get up with you and take care of you this morning, I really missed that.  Thank you for waking me up and giving me kisses and love. It was a sweet way to start the day.

Today there is a meeting from UBS, in about 10 minutes. I wonder what will be said. I will let you know everything. 

On the way to work I was thinking about us planning for our home. I love the sound of our home. I hated seeing all of your stuff packed away today, I like snuggling with your pillows when you have gone to work. Soon we will both just be home.

Hopefully I will be all done with my bullshit in time to meet you at the grotto before going to Stanfords, but if not I will meet you there at 6. If I make it to the grotto by 5, will that be enough time for you to pick them up as well?

I am calling the doctor when his office opens to complain about the medication. I hope he gives me some more meds, but he might tell me just to hang in there until the new lower level is stabilized.

Last night was wonderful, each time we are together I find something new to enjoy. I love being with you, holding you and feeling all of your touches and caresses. You make me so happy, and I want to make you happy. I love that little grin on your face and the tenderness in your eyes. You are a wonderful man and I am the luckiest woman in the world to have you in my life.

I love you, 

Cara

Not to be out done the wife rips another one and says, ""Touchdown, tie
score.""
 
Five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says, ""Field goal, I lead
17 to 14.""
 
Now the pressure's on and the old man refuses to get beat by his wife so he
strains real hard but to no avail. Realizing a defeat is totally
unacceptable, he gives it everything he has, but instead of farting, he poops
the bed.
 
The wife looks at him and says, ""What the hell was that?""
 
And the old man replied, ""Half-time, Switch sides.""

Subject: Pfthhhhhhhh Football


 
An old man and his wife have gone to bed. After laying there a few minutes
the old man farts and says, ""Seven Points.""
 
His wife rolls over and says, ""What in the world was that?""
 
The old man replied, ""It's fart football.""
 
A few minutes later the wife lets one go and says, ""Touchdown, tie score.""
 
After about five minutes the old man farts again and says, ""Touchdown, I'm
ahead 14 to 7.""
 
Not to be out done the wife rips another one and says, ""Touchdown, tie
score.""
 
Five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says, ""Field goal, I lead
17 to 14.""
 
Now the pressure's on and the old man refuses to get beat by his wife so he
strains real hard but to no avail. Realizing a defeat is totally
unacceptable, he gives it everything he has, but instead of farting, he poops
the bed.
 
The wife looks at him and says, ""What the hell was that?""
 
And the old man replied, ""Half-time, Switch sides."""

Cara,
We found a bug on EnPower Launchpad and will be fixed shortly. FYI - we created two buttons on the launchpad
for preSchedule workspace and Path Confirmation. ( as you always wanted ).

Donald / Diane,
I have temporarily granted you special permission for Path Confirmation until the new launchpad released.
Please try it again and let us know

Regards,
dluu

Good Morning, 

Here is the spreadsheet that you sent out with the access for the West Power Scheduling group. The users are now only me, Diane Cutsforth, and Donald Robinson.



 << File: EnPower Roles.xls >> 

I dont' know if you are aware, but we are having problems with accessing both PreSchedule Workspace and Path Confirmation. Donald Robinson and Diane Cutsforth have more details than I do, as I have been out on medical leave for a month.

Donald tried to login this morning and had problems, If you are aware of this bug let me know, if you need more details, please speak to him.

His number is 503/464-3902

Thanks,

Cara

Hi Cara.  How's it going? I left you a message the other day.  Just wanted to see if you are doing ok and/or needed anything... 

Emily loves that teddy bear you bought her.  Every morning I put it in her crib with her when she first wakes up and it's her best friend.  She gives the bear the biggest smile.  :)  She's growing fast.  4 1/2 months now.  She rolls onto her stomach all the time and is eating cereal with a spoon.   

Let me know how things are going. I'll talk to you soon.

Subject: Fw: Message from Marine Recon in Afganistan

Thought you might find this interesting ... got it from a friend at work. 

 The following was read on the Sully and Scooter (Radio KOGO in San 
 Diego) Show on Nov. 17: 

    Just outside of Ab Gach, in the northwest panhandle of Afghanistan 
 between Tajikstan and Pakistan, November 11, 2001. 

    Bizarre, It's (expletive) freezing here. I'm sitting on hard, cold 
 dirt between rocks and shrubs at the base of the Hindu Kush mountains along 
 the Dar 'yoi Pomir River watching a hole that leads to a tunnel that leads 
 to a cave. Stake out, my friend, and no pizza delivery for thousands of 
 miles. 
      
    I also glance at the area around my ass every ten to fifteen seconds 
 to avoid another scorpion sting. I've actually given up battling the 
 chiggers and sand fleas, but them (expletive) scorpions give a jolt like a 
 cattle prod. Hurts like a bastard. The antidote tastes like transmission 
 fluid but God bless the Marine Corps for the five vials of it in my pack. 

    The one truth the Taliban cannot escape is that, believe it or not, 
 they are human beings, which means they have to eat food and drink water. 
 That requires couriers and that's where an old bounty hunter like me comes 
 in handy. I track the couriers, locate the tunnel entrances and storage 
 facilities, type the info into the handheld, shoot the coordinates up to the 
 satellite link that tells the air commanders where to drop the hardware, we 
 bash some heads for a while, then I track and record the new movement. It's 
 all about intelligence. 

    We haven't even brought in the snipers yet. These scurrying rats 
 have no idea what they're in for. We are but days away from cutting off 
 supply lines and allowing the eradication to begin. I dream of bin Laden 
 waking up to find me 
    standing over him with my boot on his throat as I spit a bloody ear 
 into his face and plunge my nickel plated Bowie knife through his frontal 
 lobe. But you know me. I'm a romantic. 

    I've said it before and Ill say it again: This country blows, man. 
 It's not even a country. There are no roads, there's no infrastructure, 
 there's no government. This is an inhospitable, rockpit (expletive) ruled by 
 eleventh century warring tribes.  There are no jobs here like we know jobs. 
 Afghanistan offers two ways for a man to support his family: join the opium 
 trade or join the army. That's it. Those are your options. Oh, I forgot, you 
 can also live in a refugee camp and eat plum-sweetened, crushed beetle paste 
 and squirt mud like a goose with stomach flu if that's your idea of a party. 
 But the smell alone of those ""tent cities of the walking dead"" is enough to 
 hurl you into the poppy fields to cheerfully scrape bulbs for eighteen hours 
 a day. 

    And let me tell you something else. I've been living with these 
 Tajiks and Uzbeks and Turkmen and even a couple of Pushtins for over a month 
 and a half now and this much I can say for sure: These guys, all of em, are 
 Huns. Actual, living Huns. They LIVE to fight. Its what they do. Its ALL 
 they do. They have no  respect for anything, not for their families or for 
 each other or for themselves. They claw at one another as a way of life. 
 They play polo with dead calves and force their five-year-old sons into 
 human cockfights to defend the family honor. Huns, roaming packs of savage, 
 heartless beasts who feed on each other's barbarism. (Expletive) cavemen 
 with AK 47's. 
       
    Then again, maybe I'm just cranky. I'm freezing my (expletive) off 
 on this stupid (expletive) hill because my lap warmer is running out of 
 juice and I can't recharge it until the sun comes up in a few hours. Oh 
 yeah! You like to write letters, right? Do me a favor, Bizarre. Write a 
 letter to CNN and tell Judy and Bernie and that awful, sneering, pompous 
 Aaron Brown to stop calling the Taliban ""smart."" They are not smart. I 
 suggest CNN invest in a dictionary because the word they are looking for is 
 ""cunning."" The Taliban are cunning, like jackals and hyenas and wolverines. 
 They are sneaky and ruthless and, when confronted, cowardly. They are 
 hateful, malevolent parasites who create nothing and destroy everything 
 else. Smart. Pfft. Yeah, they're real smart. They've spent their entire 
 lives reading only one book (and not a very good one, as books go) and 
 consider hygiene and indoor plumbing to be products of the devil. They're 
 still figuring out how to work a Bic lighter. Talking to a Taliban warrior 
 about improving his quality of life is like trying to teach an ape how to 
 hold a pen; eventually he just gets frustrated and sticks you in the eye 
 with it. OK, enough. 
      
    Snuffle will be up soon so I have to get back to my hole. Covering 
 my tracks in the snow takes a lot of practice but I'm getting good at it. 
 Please tell my fellow Americans to turn off their TV sets and move on with 
 their lives. The story line you are getting from CNN is utter (expletive) 
 and designed not to deliver truth but rather to keep you glued to the screen 
 through the commercials. We've got this one under control. The worst thing 
 you guys can do right now is sit around analyzing what we're doing over here 
 because you have no idea what we're doing and, really, you don't want to 
 know. We are your military and we are doing what you sent us here to do. 
    You wanna help? Buy some (expletive) stocks, America. 
    Saucy Jack "

AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.  

For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 853-6457.  "

FYI

I inquired with Houston volume management re: SP and NP because the estate would like to terminate with these counterparties if they fail to pay.  This note indicates they are current but the December invoice has yet to issue.

Alan, both CP's paid on time for November activity (12-20-01).  December activity is currently being checkout with the customer and will be invoices when the checkout is complete.  The payment terms are Net 10, or 20th of the month.  As stated below I will confirm with Cara in Portland that we are delivering the power for January 2002.
If you have any other questions please let me know.

please forward this to a coordinator, have them reserach nov contract - if it was paid
Dec contract - if we have checked out - if it is a net payable/ rec
and let me know their remittance terms (net 10, 20th of month - whatever)		
ask them to forward what they find to Thresa and myself

Thresa - 
Are we delivering power to these folks in Jan? Is that a question for the West VM? It sounds like it - but I am a little surprised.

I am going into meetings the rest of the day - thresa - if they get some information, could you review it and try to start preparing an answer to this inquiry??

Any help you can throw my way is appreciated.
Thanks

Are you the person who can tell me if Sierra Pacific Power and Nevada Power Co. are timely paying their bills with respect to term power being sold to them by EPMI/OldCo?  I need to know for a complaint these parties filed at the FERC in which they are asking for relief from the terms of the deal.

I would be interested in knowing when power delivered in January '02 will become due and if they paid on that date.

Thanks,

Alan Comnes

I am going to send all of our File Migration compliance forms in one batch, so give them to me when you have signed the Document Migration Certificate. I will be sending this the evening of the 8th.

If you don't know who I am or what this is about, ask Dave Steiner or any of the Admins.

As you are all aware, Enron and UBS have entered into an agreement for the sale of certain assets of the wholesale gas and power trading organization.  As part of that agreement, the management of UBS may speak to you over the next several days about an opportunity in that new organization.  If so, we encourage you to consider such an offer. However, if you are not employed by UBS, you remain an Enron employee.  If you have specific questions regarding your employment arrangements and job responsibilities please contact Anne Labbe in Human Resources at 5-7809, or feel free to contact either Jim Fallon or Dave Delainey directly."

All --

In anticipation of the UBSWE migration, Tom May has requested that Estate accounts be set up for you, so that you may continue to work on the Estate contracts, even after you've been migrated (actual migration date TBD at this point). Please take time this afternoon to log in with the IDs and password given below (it will force you to change your password after the first login). Once logged in, please test your applications, etc. to ensure that you'll be able to work in the Estate environment. We don't anticipate any issue, as these are replicas of your current Enron accounts. Please contact me immediately should you have an issue.

Finally -- please send a note to Tom May and me after you've tested, and we'll consider your email a ""sign off"" that you are able to work in the Estate environment.

Please note that these accounts will be disabled on Day 1 (also TBD) of UBSWE.

thank you in advance for your assistance

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

Cara,

I have not received clarification on cell phone expenses.  Tim Belden will have to decide if and when they can be expensed.  I'll be sure to ask him when he gets back into the office.

Dear ESWG,

This is to notify you that Bob Harshbarger is going to be the new chair of the Electronic Scheduling Working Group.  Bob is taking over as I have accepted a new position with another company.  I have also had a change in plans for this week and will not be able to attend the ESWG meeting set for Thursday (1-5pm).  Bob will handle this meeting as well.

Bob's contact information is:

Thanks to all of you for your help as this group has started and I'm sure I'll see you around in the future.

Ray and ISAS -

Just going through the past four days of email, so please excuse this
response if it has been already addressed.

What was said at the Jan 17th meeting of the ESWG was, I (Bob Harshbarger)
was not prepared to address the issues surrounding voting, membership, etc.
at that meeting.  

ESWG will have to adopt some form of structure if we are to proceed as
quickly as the ESC.  The ESWG was formed at the direction of the Joint
Guidance Committee.  We have been asked to consider formalized or structure
membership based on the same guidelines that ISAS has been given.  The
intent is not to leave anyone out but to ensure we can address issues in a
timely manner.

There is no perfect solution.  A weighted sector voting structure does
appear to give broader voice to the masses, yet even within a single sector
the participants can opposing view points and still feel under represented.
What the ESWG adopts is to be seen.

Hello all!

We thought we would clarify the Parking & Mass Transit options:

1) Three options are available:

2WTC/Outside parking lots
- Those who park at 2WTC will continue to be set up with monthly parking deductions
- Those who park in outside lots pay out-of-pocket and submit reimbursement for up to $89.00 per month

Tri-Met
- No out-of-pocket expense or paycheck deduction.

Daily Validations
- Employees may park at any location and submit reimbursement for up to $89.00 per month.

2) You may choose only ONE of these available options.
- If you selected the mass transit option, you must pay out-of-pocket (with no reimbursement) for parking fees incurred on days you choose to drive into the office.

3) If you would like to change your parking/mass transit option, please contact Grace or Julie.

If you have any questions, please let us know.

Thanks!
Your HR Team

Subject:	Parking & Mass Transit Resolution

We have reached resolution regarding the parking and mass transit issue.  Until notified otherwise, the parking and mass transit subsidy will continue as an employee benefit. 

For those who have a payroll parking deduction, your deduction has been stopped.  No deduction should occur on 12/31/01 payroll.  In addition, you should receive a credit for the deduction taken for the 12/15 payroll.  

For those who incurred any out-of-pocket parking costs during the month of December, you may expense up to $89 for reimbursement.  

Beginning 1/1/02, parking and mass transit will continue as follows:

WTC Parking:  You should receive your parking pass in the mail. Payroll deductions will begin on the 1/15/02 paycheck. (No Action Req'd)

Outside Parking Lots:  Park at lot of your choice and pay out of pocket.  Request reimbursement of up to $89 per month. (No payroll parking deduction will occur)

Tri-Met and MAX employees:  Passes are available for January.  If you would like to pick up your pass, please see Debra Davidson.   

NOTE:  Extra Tri-Met passes are available.  If you would like to select mass transit as your parking option, please notify either Grace or myself before Friday, 12/21/01 EOB and we will insure a monthly pass is available.

Validations:  We will no longer validate parking passes, however, you are able to reimburse up to $89 per month for daily parking.

If you have any questions, please let us know!

John Lavorato confirmed that UBS is indeed the winner.  As I understand it, UBS has come to an agreement with Enron for the purchase of the North America Gas/Power Trading and Marketing organization.  We either have received or are expected to receive approval from the Creditors committee today.  Creditors Committee approval is considered likely as they have been in the loop on this transaction all along.  It will most likely go in front of the judge on Monday.  Approval from the judge is expected.  I have a meeting in the next couple of hour where I will get more details.  Stay tuned ...

When E-Tag 1.7 is activated on March 6, 2002 the OATI webTag (ETS) system will require secure access using an OATI Digital Certificate.  OATI Digital Certificates will be provided to our existing webTag customers at no additional cost under their existing ETS Agreement.

For those companies that have not yet acquired OATI Digital Certificates, to start the process, please download the Company Information document at the following URL:

Complete the form, and then e-mail it to OATI at support@oatiinc.com.  Please do not delay, get this service today to avoid access problems on March 6.

For those companies that have already acquired OATI Digital Certificates, our OATI webTag Administrator will be contacting your company shortly to activate this service with your current E-Tag 1.67 access.

The EnPower database will be down from 4 PM Friday afternoon (6 PM Houston) to 4 PM Saturday afternoon (6PM Houston).  The reason for this is the NETCO/Estate database and hardware split that is occuring this weekend.  

You must re-boot your machines following this shut down to access any EnPower applications.

Thanks,

Subject:	RE: Dec and Jan liquidations

Yesterday I was approached by Steve Thome who had been asked by Brandon Wax (who was asked by Don Miller?) looking for a cash forecast for deals that flowed in December.  While I'd like to be helpful, I have never done a cash forecast before.  We don't have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort of thing.  The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower.  A week ago the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update Enpower in ""Schedule"" for all of the deals that flowed in December.  Diana Scholtes sent an e-mail (below) to Leslie Reeves on January 3rd indicating that we were prepared to update Enpower.  We heard from John Postlethwaite that Leslie didn't want us to update Schedule -- instead they could work off of our trade sheets.

I don't care which way we move forward.  It just seems that we aren't all on the same page.  We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the right information to the right people.  Exerience tells me that we are better off doing it ""right"" the first time.  I am hoping that between Don, Leslie, and Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do.  As of now, there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a cash flow projection.

Regards,
Tim

Subject:	Dec and Jan liquidations

It has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.

What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Thanks,

John

Leslie,

I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  

I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  

If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.

It has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.

What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Thanks,

John"

For those people wanting to learn more about Var calculation and application, I've put a copy of JP Morgan's RiskMetrics documentation on the P: drive under \MidMarketing\RiskMetrics. Of the five documents, Part 2 probably gets most directly at the questions that were being asked in Matt's seminar.

Our new office supply house is Boise Cascade, and we just got the capability to place an order.  We plan to radically scale down the supplies we previously kept in stock, but we will maintain a rudimentary supply of the basics.  

If you need an office supply that is not typically stocked or if you would like to see the catalog, please ask Mollie or me."

Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan"

I spoke with Julie and asked her again as well....my only concern with UBS is that they are swamped at the moment, and these requests usually take a day or two to turnaround (I have put the request to UBS as well - so lets see who does it first!).

Let me know if you get it from Julie or if I receive from UBS first, will give you a call to fax.

Good morning Cara!  Hope that you had a good weekend - when do you move into the new condo?

1.  UBS payrolls are the same as Enron (isn't that nice - no change there)!

2.  Julie Kearney should have a copy (I know she was keeping copies in case something happened to the fed ex packages).  Let me know if she doesn't have for some reason.

Have a great day!

Good Morning Darling,

Do you know when the UBS paydays are?  We are just trying to figure out what to expect.

Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my new condo want it.  If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wait by the fax for it, I would be grateful.

Thanks,

Cara Freeland! ;)"

TO:  All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan


Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the ""Personal Data"" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

		4 tickets in the lower level, parking included

Package 2:	Blazers vs. Minnesota Timberwolves

If you donated money or a gift and were not able to enter your name into the drawing, please us know--we would be more than happy to add your name.  

Also, we have requested receipts from the Salvation Army for the cash donations that were received. If you would like a receipt for your donation, please contact Grace directly.

I spoke with Julie and asked her again as well....my only concern with UBS is that they are swamped at the moment, and these requests usually take a day or two to turnaround (I have put the request to UBS as well - so lets see who does it first!).

Let me know if you get it from Julie or if I receive from UBS first, will give you a call to fax.

Amy

Good morning Cara!  Hope that you had a good weekend - when do you move into the new condo?

1.  UBS payrolls are the same as Enron (isn't that nice - no change there)!

2.  Julie Kearney should have a copy (I know she was keeping copies in case something happened to the fed ex packages).  Let me know if she doesn't have for some reason.

Have a great day!

Good Morning Darling,

Do you know when the UBS paydays are?  We are just trying to figure out what to expect.

Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my new condo want it.  If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wait by the fax for it, I would be grateful.

Thanks,

Cara Freeland! ;)"

The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) on December 4,
2001, posted for public comment a proposed Wholesale Electric Standards
Model (WESM) -- an industry-based consensus process for developing,
maintaining, and publishing standards that promote reliable and
efficient wholesale electricity markets throughout North America.  Such
standards would address, in an integrated way, the whole spectrum of
reliability, market interface, and business practice standards through a
fair, open, balanced, and inclusive stakeholder process.

On December 19, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued
an Order Providing Guidance on the Formation of a Standards Development
Organization for the Wholesale Electric Industry (Docket No.
RM01-12-00).  That order directs the industry to reach agreement on the
formation of an organization to develop consensus standards for business
practices and electronic communications.  If the industry cannot reach
consensus on this issue by March 15, the Commission indicated that it
will either institute its own procedures to choose an organization or
will develop the standards itself.

To provide the NERC Standing Committees Representation Task Force
(SCRTF) as well as the NERC Stakeholders Committee and Board of Trustees
the broadest possible input, the Board strongly urges all interested
parties to comment on the WESM proposal in the context of the recent
FERC order.  Commenters should give particular attention to how NERC and
the recently approved North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB)
could collaborate in developing and overseeing a single, industry-based
consensus process to develop standards that assure the continued
reliable operation of the integrated North American electric
transmission grids as well as the development of business practice
standards and communication protocols needed to complement the market
design principles that FERC has announced its intention to develop.

NERC's SCRTF will use all comments received to help shape its final
proposal to the NERC Stakeholders Committee and Board of Trustees in
February 2002.  We also intend to provide the input we receive in this
public forum on the WESM model to FERC for its consideration. 

For additional information on the SCRTF and its membership, go to:
www.nerc.com/committees/scrtf.html. Please direct questions to David
Nevius, NERC Vice President, at 609-452-8060, or e-mail
dave.nevius@nerc.com.

The proposal is posted at the following NERC web site:
http://www.nerc.com/. The deadline for comments is January 8, 2002.

Sincerely,

""Christmas is a time of wonder and joy, of generosity and peace, that brings family and friends together in celebration and song. We sing old hymns and familiar carols, we show love for others in the giving of gifts, and we observe the hallowed traditions that make the season special. This year in the midst of extraordinary times, our Nation has shown the world that though there is great evil, there is a greater good. Americans have given of themselves, sacrificing to help others and showing the spirit of love and sharing that is so much a part of the Christmas season.

According to the Gospel of Luke, two thousand years ago, the savior of mankind came into the world. Christians believe that Jesus' birth was the incarnation of God on earth, opening the door to new hope and eternal life. 	 Picture of President and Laura Bush in front of Christmas tree at the whitehouse <http://216.157.79.171/christmas/presidentbush.jpg>	
At Christmastime, Christians celebrate God's love revealed to the world through Christ. And the message of Jesus is one that all Americans can embrace this holiday season -- to love one another.

This Christmas we remember those who are without their loved ones. They continue to be in our hearts and prayers. May they experience peace, and may they find hope. And as we again celebrate Christ's birth, may the glorious light of God's goodness and love shine forth from our land.

Laura joins me in wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. May God's blessings of peace be upon us and upon the world.""

GEORGE W. BUSH

Our President understands and 
believes in the real meaning of Christmas.  
Feel free to forward his meaningful Christmas 
greeting to all of your friends and loved ones

Hi There, 

I love you, I hope you have a good day.  Work is shaping up to be a real snooze-fest. There are only 9 of us on the entire trading floor right now. Normally there used to be about 65-70 of us!

Waking up with you is so nice, I am looking forward to many years of doing just that. I think we are going to settle in just fine together. I love you and enjoy being with you so much. You are the man I have waited all these years for. Thank you for being part of my life.

I will see you this evening, a little dinner, a little laundry action, maybe a little dominoes and sheet-she-me?  Woohoo!

I love you, 

CF

Enron Auction Formally Set For Jan. 10,Ct Hearing Jan.11
By Kathy Chu
  
12/20/2001 
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 


Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

   
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A federal bankruptcy judge here issued an order late Thursday formally allowing Enron Corp. (ENE) to auction off a majority stake in its energy-trading operations Jan. 10.

The sale is considered crucial to Enron's retention of key traders and customers - as well as to the company's restructuring efforts. 


The decision by federal Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, of the Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, follows a Wednesday hearing on Enron's motion for an expedited sale of the business. 


All bids must be received by Enron Jan. 7, and a court hearing to approve the buyer will be held Jan. 11. 


The bidders must submit a ""good faith"" deposit of $25 million, according to court documents, to be retained by the bankrupt company pending the January hearing. 


Enron will own 49% of the joint venture, New Energy Trading Co., while the buyer will own 51%. 


The bankrupt company expects bids for its hardware, software - including its online trading platform - and its intellectual property. But potential buyers have expressed little interest so far in Enron's trading contracts, which are valued at $5 billion to $7 billion, according to Martin Bienenstock, of Weil Gotshal & Manges law firm, which represents the company. 


J.P. Morgan Chase, UBS AG and Citigroup have all expressed interest in the energy-trading business, people familiar with the matter have said. 


J.P. Morgan and Citigroup also recently provided Enron with a $1.5 billion debtor-in-possession financing, and both institutions serve on the company's 15-member official creditors committee. 


At the Wednesday hearing, Luc Despins, of Milbank Tweed law firm - which represents the group - said some creditors on the committee may be ""interested"" in making bids. To stave off potential conflicts, any bidders on the committee will be excluded from discussions about other potential offers for the energy-trading operations, he noted.

In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

Confidential:  For Internal Distribution Only

The purpose of this e-mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible.  I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing.  My apologies for this.  Hopefully this e-mail will accomplish that goal.

A number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals.  As a result, we haven't been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money.  Our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check.  Instead, these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices.

We have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have.  We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre-petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money.  We have received approval from the Cash committee for purchases through December 27th (I think) and we will secure additional cash to continue on.

Here are the procedures as I understand them.  If you have any questions or modifications please me an e-mail or give me a call.

Cash Desk
Each cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated.
On a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term (next day to next week) deliveries with that counterparty are in the money.
If the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money, we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point.  We are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location.
The cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate (based on spot market prices) of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to Steve Thome.
The cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to John Postlethwaite via e-mail.
The cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring John current.

Marketing Desk
Steve Thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk.
The marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis.
The marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder.
Make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder at (503) 464-8058.
The marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis.  We don't necessarily care who buys it, but rather, we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated.
Whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to Steve Thome.

Deal Entry
The new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle.  After discussing the matter with Stacey White, she recommended entering the new deals in Enpower as zero price, non MTM, with an annuity equal to the prepay amount.
We should enter notes into Enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions.
This will allow settlements to match an annuity in Enpower with prepay out the door.  It will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice.

I'm sure that I've missed something.  Let me know.

Regards,
Tim"

Hello Cara,

Please see comments showing below in RED
BTW, if you need me to unroute all daily route & term route for June 22, i will be happy to do so.

Thanks for taking your valuable time and help us to test

Subject:	Testing the PSW

Good Evening,

We had agreed to just do a test to see what issues were still outstanding in the PSW and Path Confirmation.

I re-ran all the data for June 22 in the West, here are my findings:


Some little things seem to have changed, I am not sure why they changed

>PreSchedule Workspace - Pressing the Enter key makes the cursor go to the cell to the left, and no other way.  Enter+Shift moves the cursor to the right.  This function is different, the Enter key used to function much like it did in Excel, and I am not sure why this change has been made.
Problem fixed - in STAGE


>Path confrimation - The color Pallette is very different, and inferior. Did that get changed? Any color not on the main pallette is now grainy and difficult to read the path thru.
 also, the color on the path is the chosen color, but several fields show as dark grey no matter what color is chosen.  There also seems to be no pattern to why some cells are grey and some aren't.
We did not change color scheme, however, you can reset the default color by click on grid colors button on the tool bar

>The window for the error report now snaps up very small. It was defaulting to the same size as the PSW. This seems different and inferior.
Problem fixed - in STAGE


Functionality bug still to be fixed:

>I routed all of the deals for all the western points, and a spot check still shows that the Physical flag is not showing up properly in Deal Scheduling, although it does show properly in Path Confirmation. I checked many routed deals, not one showed the Physical flag checked.
Problem fixed - in STAGE


Pending features that I am not sure of the status on:

>The Real Time discussion that is currently part of Lotus, but spoke with Poston regarding and I believe he is heading up this effort with you all.
We are currently looking to the solution to this problem. If this feature prevent us from going live, i would suggest that Steve Nat, Dave Poston, you and i need to discuss. 

>The Executive report that will replace the AGGSchedVol report and the Daily Excel Summary.
Yes, the new application is available under EnPower launchpad -> Tools -> Executive Report.

In summary:

All other functions seem to be working, and as soon as we nail down the routing one, I can pass the testing off to real time for their final changes before going to production.
It is my intention that once we go to production we have one entire month of parallell testing before the Lotus system is abandoned.

Thanks for your work, let me know when you are ready for me to test again.  I would like to re-test June 22 again if possible.

Thanks,

Cara"

I ran the PSW for the East (6/22 data)  and also had problems with each of the following:
1)	Enter moves cell to the left
2) 	Colors changed
3)	Path with transmission did not go to confirmation sheet
4) 	Physicals were noted on the confirmation strips, but not on scheduling strips
5)	Confirmation strips were deleted, and new data added to the PSW.  Then, the confirmation button would not respond again.
6)	The first query for buildroute did not work.  Second query worked ok, data could be viewed.

What did work:

Only East power showing up!

I'll be testing again today, and D. Baugham will be looking at the PSC this week.

Thanks,
Corry

Good morning Cara!  Hope that you had a good weekend - when do you move into the new condo?

1.  UBS payrolls are the same as Enron (isn't that nice - no change there)!

2.  Julie Kearney should have a copy (I know she was keeping copies in case something happened to the fed ex packages).  Let me know if she doesn't have for some reason.

Have a great day!

Good Morning Darling,

Do you know when the UBS paydays are?  We are just trying to figure out what to expect.

Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my new condo want it.  If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wait by the fax for it, I would be grateful.

Thanks,

I ran the PSW for the East (6/22 data)  and also had problems with each of the following:
1)	Enter moves cell to the left
2) 	Colors changed
3)	Path with transmission did not go to confirmation sheet
4) 	Physicals were noted on the confirmation strips, but not on scheduling strips
5)	Confirmation strips were deleted, and new data added to the PSW.  Then, the confirmation button would not respond again.
6)	The first query for buildroute did not work.  Second query worked ok, data could be viewed.

What did work:

Only East power showing up!

I'll be testing again today, and D. Baugham will be looking at the PSC this week.

Thanks,
Corry

Subject:	Testing the PSW

Good Evening,

We had agreed to just do a test to see what issues were still outstanding in the PSW and Path Confirmation.

I re-ran all the data for June 22 in the West, here are my findings:


Some little things seem to have changed, I am not sure why they changed

PreSchedule Workspace - Pressing the Enter key makes the cursor go to the cell to the left, and no other way.  Enter+Shift moves the cursor to the right.  This function is different, the Enter key used to function much like it did in Excel, and I am not sure why this change has been made.

Path confrimation - The color Pallette is very different, and inferior. Did that get changed? Any color not on the main pallette is now grainy and difficult to read the path thru.
 also, the color on the path is the chosen color, but several fields show as dark grey no matter what color is chosen.  There also seems to be no pattern to why some cells are grey and some aren't.

The window for the error report now snaps up very small. It was defaulting to the same size as the PSW. This seems different and inferior.


Functionality bug still to be fixed:

I routed all of the deals for all the western points, and a spot check still shows that the Physical flag is not showing up properly in Deal Scheduling, although it does show properly in Path Confirmation. I checked many routed deals, not one showed the Physical flag checked.

Pending features that I am not sure of the status on:

The Real Time discussion that is currently part of Lotus, but spoke with Poston regarding and I believe he is heading up this effort with you all.

The Executive report that will replace the AGGSchedVol report and the Daily Excel Summary.

In summary:

All other functions seem to be working, and as soon as we nail down the routing one, I can pass the testing off to real time for their final changes before going to production.
It is my intention that once we go to production we have one entire month of parallell testing before the Lotus system is abandoned.

Thanks for your work, let me know when you are ready for me to test again.  I would like to re-test June 22 again if possible.

Thanks,

Cara

Cara,

We have unrouted all term & daily route for June 22 on pwrtestp and also emptied all path
confirmation records. We have also granted you access to the new application called
'Executive Report' and should be available under  EnPower - > Tools -> Executive Report

Let me know if you have any questions

Corry,

	As per Will, the understanding was that deals with transmissions were far and few in between and were currently being manually routed, and this was not a feature to be expected with the current version of Preschedule Workspace and so it will not route currently.

	Issue with Deal Scheduling not showing the correct 'physical route' status has been addressed and is currently being worked on and will be released within the next day or two. The ""Edit Strip Information"" bug has been forwarded also.
	
	Able to recreate the 'Edit' bug and fixed, a new version will roll out by afternoon containing the fix. 

	In regards to the West paths showing up when EAST criteria was selected, this issue was found out to be related to a database modification that was made to include the REGION code to all transactions. Creating the REGION field, NON-NULLABLE requirement, in the database required a default value to be inserted and 'EAST' was chosen; hence transactions which were for the WEST desk without an initial region fell into this particular problem.  The erroneous data within the PATH SCHEDULE CONFIRMATIONS has been deleted and all new confirmed paths will now correctly be displayed since our applications correctly state the REGION information associated with each USER.

	I will update everyone upon a new version of Preschedule Workspace being moved to Stage

thanks
Asem

Will,
I found about the same issues we had already discussed while running the PSW/PSC.

I ran the sheet for 6/19 since there were no ""West"" paths in the confirmations (I still see the West paths when ""View: East Trading Desk"" is checked).

Most of the paths ""routed"" in Deal Scheduling except for a deal that contained transmission with the correct Enpower number provided (Error: Capability not supported: Cannot route transmission deals)
The ""Routing Detail"" in Deal Scheduling did not contain a check mark for ""Physical Route"" on any of the physical paths.
Also, in scheduling, the ""Edit Strip Information"" does not contain the Path or comments in the Deal Scheduling Comments section as before.

The physical path that did not route in scheduling also did not go the the Path Confirmations.


Also, I found that when I chose ""Edit"" on the Pre-Schedule Workspace, it created a New Workspace.  It also occurred twice when the mouse cursor passed by the word ""edit"" without physically clicking on it.

That's about it for today,
Corry"

	Just got done talking with Corry, and Deal Scheduling showing the incorrect status of a physical routed flag is an issue. Corry will proceed and test against pwrtestp on Monday, no production rollouts will occur at this time.  
	Since we do have a major database migration process this weekend, our DBA's are currently tied up and our requests for production updates to the database have been slightly postponed till next week.

I had no idea that Corry was requesting the move to production yet.  I feel like the communication has been very one sided FROM me lately.

Won't the lack of proper flagging of physical paths in Deal Scheduling have an impact in the East?

Cara et all ,

	Deal Scheduling is what we are currently waiting on [physical routes issue], and the fix for it will probably take a couple of days till release. 

	Corry's request to move Path Confirmation to production by Friday COB can be scheduled pending database change requests which have been requested to allow for them. Upon approval the move for Preschedule Workspace to production can be done by Friday COB also? Cara is still testing the application and we will wait for her approval ..

Subject:	RE: Testing PSW and Path confirmation for Target date 6/20

Cara et all, 

	Following list of bug fixes are moving out to stage to address the recently reported issues: 

	New versions of both applications have been moved out to stage..


PreSchedule Workspace:
#1
Problem:
Uploading to the Path Confirm Area:*accepted Mid C-1:53   Rockies-0:22    Palo 1:11  COB 0:49 (Row 69 Generated a General SQL error message) 
This is showing Physical and non-physical right.

Solution:
Line 69 , the timezone value under column G was '6/20/2001-6/20/2001' when it should have been 'PDT' or any other valid timezone value.


#2
Problem:
Running Build Route Report:
	Criteria Selection-unable to select criteria for build route, got ""List index out of bounds (4)"" error *needs fix

Solution:
Fixed.. was losing track of which workspace was open

#3
Problem:
Daily Summary Function
*needs fix or workaround-Would not work at all, got 3 error messages. "" Unable to locate"" ""can't find last row!"", and ""Failed to export summary!"" this is going to create a csv file right to the AGG sched vol report now according to Mr. Poston, I am thrilled to hear it.

Solution:
Executive Report was just pushed to stage yesterday, the data is currently what we're focusing on with this release and will soon start shaping it to make it visualy look like the pre-existing excel-based Executive Report.

#4
Problem:
Error Checking - took 1:29, produced a line by line error sheet that is printable, *accepted
	BUT routing errors for lines 19-223 in the COB sheet produced a routing error that just states ""ERROR:"" no reason.  We need to know why an error is shown(was 	run after all routes were deleted) *needs fix

Solution:
Error Checking will not spit out any errors if there aren't any.



Path Confirmation:


#1
Problem:
One little housekeeping thing,  can we move the delete button away from the confirm button?  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button?  This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion?

Solution:
Dialog box included for deletion alert confirmation purposes and button repositioned.

Routing
Mid C-13:27   Rockies-2:23   Palo 7:56  COB 5:12 the time is fine.

**needs fix**The routes are still not showing designated Physical or Non-Physical Properly. All are coming through as Non-Physical.  This is must be fixed prior to release for production as our WSCC fee pulls directly from this data in deal Scheduling.


Path Confirmation:

Speed is very much an issue here,  I had Mark Guzman sit with me while I cut a path and when I confirmed a group of paths. The confirmation of 5 paths as a group took 70 seconds from the time I entered the name and hit the ""ok"" button until the confriming was completed. This is too long, we need this to be 20-30 seconds max. Currently, this process takes about 10 seconds in lotus. Confriming 2 paths with the 20th fully populated took 1:39.

Cutting a path went fast enough until I closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report. This also took over a minute.  This is another 10 second process in lotus.

One little housekeeping thing,  can we move the delete button away from the confirm button?  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button?  This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion?

All of the sorting looks great, the paths are represented properly, we are very very close!


Real Time Discussion:

Where are we on this?  I heard initial rumblings, but nothing lately.

Here are the sheets that I have used to create data for 6/20

 << File: COB_JUNE20_USEME.psc >>  << File: Mid_C_June20.psc >>  << File: Palo_June20.psc >>  << File: Rockies_June_20.psc >> 

I can do more testing or Net meeting stuff tomorrow until about 10:30, but after that I have to be a scheduler for a couple of hours.

Thanks,

PreSchedule Workspace:

Running Build Route Report:
	Criteria Selection-unable to select criteria for build route, got ""List index out of bounds (4)"" error *needs fix
	
Error Checking - took 1:29, produced a line by line error sheet that is printable, *accepted
	BUT routing errors for lines 19-223 in the COB sheet produced a routing error that just states ""ERROR:"" no reason.  We need to know why an error is shown(was 	run after all routes were deleted) *needs fix

Uploading to the Path Confirm Area:*accepted Mid C-1:53   Rockies-0:22    Palo 1:11  COB 0:49 (Row 69 Generated a General SQL error message) 
This is showing Physical and non-physical right.

Daily Summary Function
*needs fix or workaround-Would not work at all, got 3 error messages. "" Unable to locate"" ""can't find last row!"", and ""Failed to export summary!"" this is going to create a csv file right to the AGG sched vol report now according to Mr. Poston, I am thrilled to hear it.

Routing
Mid C-13:27   Rockies-2:23   Palo 7:56  COB 5:12 the time is fine.

**needs fix**The routes are still not showing designated Physical or Non-Physical Properly. All are coming through as Non-Physical.  This is must be fixed prior to release for production as our WSCC fee pulls directly from this data in deal Scheduling.


Path Confirmation:

Speed is very much an issue here,  I had Mark Guzman sit with me while I cut a path and when I confirmed a group of paths. The confirmation of 5 paths as a group took 70 seconds from the time I entered the name and hit the ""ok"" button until the confriming was completed. This is too long, we need this to be 20-30 seconds max. Currently, this process takes about 10 seconds in lotus. Confriming 2 paths with the 20th fully populated took 1:39.

Cutting a path went fast enough until I closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report. This also took over a minute.  This is another 10 second process in lotus.

One little housekeeping thing,  can we move the delete button away from the confirm button?  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button?  This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion?

All of the sorting looks great, the paths are represented properly, we are very very close!


Real Time Discussion:

Where are we on this?  I heard initial rumblings, but nothing lately.

Here are the sheets that I have used to create data for 6/20

 << File: COB_JUNE20_USEME.psc >>  << File: Mid_C_June20.psc >>  << File: Palo_June20.psc >>  << File: Rockies_June_20.psc >> 

I can do more testing or Net meeting stuff tomorrow until about 10:30, but after that I have to be a scheduler for a couple of hours.

Thanks,

Cara

Cara et all, 

	Following list of bug fixes are moving out to stage to address the recently reported issues: 

	New versions of both applications have been moved out to stage..


PreSchedule Workspace:
#1
Problem:
Uploading to the Path Confirm Area:*accepted Mid C-1:53   Rockies-0:22    Palo 1:11  COB 0:49 (Row 69 Generated a General SQL error message) 
This is showing Physical and non-physical right.

Solution:
Line 69 , the timezone value under column G was '6/20/2001-6/20/2001' when it should have been 'PDT' or any other valid timezone value.


#2
Problem:
Running Build Route Report:
	Criteria Selection-unable to select criteria for build route, got ""List index out of bounds (4)"" error *needs fix

Solution:
Fixed.. was losing track of which workspace was open

#3
Problem:
Daily Summary Function
*needs fix or workaround-Would not work at all, got 3 error messages. "" Unable to locate"" ""can't find last row!"", and ""Failed to export summary!"" this is going to create a csv file right to the AGG sched vol report now according to Mr. Poston, I am thrilled to hear it.

Solution:
Executive Report was just pushed to stage yesterday, the data is currently what we're focusing on with this release and will soon start shaping it to make it visualy look like the pre-existing excel-based Executive Report.

#4
Problem:
Error Checking - took 1:29, produced a line by line error sheet that is printable, *accepted
	BUT routing errors for lines 19-223 in the COB sheet produced a routing error that just states ""ERROR:"" no reason.  We need to know why an error is shown(was 	run after all routes were deleted) *needs fix

Solution:
Error Checking will not spit out any errors if there aren't any.



Path Confirmation:


#1
Problem:
One little housekeeping thing,  can we move the delete button away from the confirm button?  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button?  This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion?

Solution:

Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening;

I started working in June 22 to test path cut capabilities.  I was able to save a cut path.  

Please make sure that Bill Williams III and Whomever he designates has access to Enpower TestP so that I can walk them through the app when it is ready. Right now it looks like Mark Guzman and Kate Symes will be the voice of West Real time.

A Real Time Question:
When Enpower is taken down for maintenance, as it sometimes is at night, will this application still function?  If not, we need to find a way for the real time crew to be able to access this information when Enpower is being maintained.

Good morning Cara!  Hope that you had a good weekend - when do you move into the new condo?

1.  UBS payrolls are the same as Enron (isn't that nice - no change there)!

2.  Julie Kearney should have a copy (I know she was keeping copies in case something happened to the fed ex packages).  Let me know if she doesn't have for some reason.

Have a great day!

Amy

Good Morning Darling,

Do you know when the UBS paydays are?  We are just trying to figure out what to expect.

Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my new condo want it.  If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wait by the fax for it, I would be grateful.

Thanks,

Cara Freeland! ;)"

Cara,
	
	Looking at the Stage and Production versions of the deal scheduling application it looks like the stage version has some issues/differences.. [e.g being that check option for cross portfolio deals is in stage and not production release].  This issue will be addressed but the current workaround would be to make sure the checkbox is checked in stage for retrieving proper results.. 

	Please do let me know if you have any questions/concerns..

Subject:	Testing PSW and Path Confirmation done on 8/23

Good Evening,

I wanted to poke around a bit and see if I could find anything quickly so you all could proceed.

Path Confirmation:

I like the new way the confirm box pops up.  

Path Cut,

I tried to cut a path for 6/21, got through all the usual screens, and added my info,  I got the following error:

""Cannot be updated. Key Violation. ORA-00001: unique constraint (PWR.PK_SCHD_PATH_CUTS) violated""  no cut information was saved.


I still cannot get anything to show up in scheduling.  I tried West Wing for 6/21,  PV for 6/22, and Mid C for 6/23. The software says it is loading deals, but no results are showing in the filter or the schedule screen.
I have to be able to really test the routing, so  we need to get this resolved.  Most of the routing looked ok, except the deals changed in scheduling would not route and the Physical vs Non-physical flag was not being triggered properly. Because our physical and non-physical volumes are tracked through Enpower and recorded for the WSCC and NERC fees that we pay, this information needs to be correct.


I will stay late, come in early, or whatever it takes to get things tested.  


Thanks,

Cara

Subject:	Testing PSW and Path Confirmation done on 8/23

Good Evening,

I wanted to poke around a bit and see if I could find anything quickly so you all could proceed.

Path Confirmation:

I like the new way the confirm box pops up.  

Path Cut,

I tried to cut a path for 6/21, got through all the usual screens, and added my info,  I got the following error:

""Cannot be updated. Key Violation. ORA-00001: unique constraint (PWR.PK_SCHD_PATH_CUTS) violated""  no cut information was saved.


I still cannot get anything to show up in scheduling.  I tried West Wing for 6/21,  PV for 6/22, and Mid C for 6/23. The software says it is loading deals, but no results are showing in the filter or the schedule screen.
I have to be able to really test the routing, so  we need to get this resolved.  Most of the routing looked ok, except the deals changed in scheduling would not route and the Physical vs Non-physical flag was not being triggered properly. Because our physical and non-physical volumes are tracked through Enpower and recorded for the WSCC and NERC fees that we pay, this information needs to be correct.


I will stay late, come in early, or whatever it takes to get things tested.  


Thanks,

Cara

Cara, Corry,

I am trying to get data refreshed to pwrtestp from production, but there will be some delay due to some other testing against testp.  Until then the ""useful"" data will remain 6/24/2001 and earlier.  Cara, we are still investigating the issue with data not showing up in scheduling.  Are you not able to test Pre-Schedule if that issue is not resolved?

Keep in mind we are trying to get this version out to production as soon as possible so we can move forward on the Executive Summary report.

Let me know if there is anything you need from us.

Thanks,
Will"

There are new versions of Pre-Schedule and Path Confirm in stage.  Below is listed some changes to PreSchedule.

For Path Confirm:
Now in West Regions you can see Northwest which is R9
Closing the path cut is fast now
Annuity Id in path cuts can accept non numeric values (strings also)
Cut Hour is in 0000-2400 format
Added validation on Resupply deal#, it should be valid existing Enpower deal

Will

A couple of other things...

When double click a cell automatically go to the ""Editor"" edit box.
Allow show / hide of Editor.  Add to menu under View / Toolbars as well as popup menu.
Move copy from Workspace to File in the menu.
Add an icon for copy.  I believe there is an action list and image list you can use.
Rename ""Excel Utilities"" to ""Spreadsheet Utilities"" on the toolbar as well as the View menu.

Also please implement the Summary for ""WEEK"" following the rules from your previous email.

	Dont worry about the code for Ive taken the time to go through it and make it so that when you export from within our PreschedWS all it needs is a pre-existing  PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTTestP.xls file with at least one previous detail entry and it will automatically create a new entry for the day with totals in each region's category.

What I meant was I would run one day and put test data in the production sheet (since there is not a test sheet of that), and then go get rid of that day when it looks like it calculated right.

I know so little about that sheet, I am a typical user and just know what I want.  How long after the initial release into production do you all think It will be until we get the project cleared to have this data merged with the AggSchedVol Data? That is the ultimate goal.  Poston has his FSP data that will be part of this too.

NP-15				NP-15 (R10)

Cara,

We store the region from the path cuts in the database as a single EnPower Region.  That means that we can only map California to one of R10, R11, and R12.  Are you intending the regions within Path Confirmation to represent a group of EnPower Regions?  If so, we will need to make a database change to store those groupings.  I expect that the database change would take a long time because it will involve a Global database change.

Thanks,
Will

Good Afternoon,

I do want the regions to understand Enpower Regions, but at the same time not be so specific to the user.  Here is the breakdown that I would want:

California = R10, R11, and R12

Northwest = R9
	Enpower calls it MidColumbia, but many more delivery points than Just Mid Columbia are contained within it, and I don't want to list them all in the region choice or 	confuse the useres further by them looking for something in the northwest that is not MidColumbia.

WSCC-S=R7

Rockies = R7A

WSCC-N=R8

Please also see my notes below on the existing system. I am happy to provide any further explanation you would like.

It appears that some clarification on the Regions is necessary.  Vish has implemented the cuts to show regions as defined by the Regions table in EnPower.  This is the same table that is used in many of our reports.  Should the regions that you are speaking of be separate from EnPower's list of regions?  

Vish tells me that ""California"" equates to all of NP-15, SP-15, ZP-26.  Also he is unable to resolve ""Northwest"".    Should we not resolve your list of regions to the EnPower list?


Also, as an aside, I took a look at the West Discussion - Schedule Information in Notes and noticed that when looking at cuts the tree hierarchy was as follows

Hour Ahead / Real-Time
Region?  (e.g.  Montana, MARKETER, WSCC, NW, SW, FED Utility) This is why I want preset regions, right now they are user defined and a mess
Date
Path
Cuts

I think the best way is to have the sort selection as it is in the new system, by date primarily, and then the nifty sort tool you all have written

Is the second item in the tree related to the region selection for path cuts?  Yes

Thanks,
Will

Subject:	Testing PSW and Path confirmation

Good Afternoon,

Here are my findings for the latest Release of the PSW and Path Conf. I am re-running the date of June 22, as I see no data in the path confirmation for that date.

PreSchedule Workspace:

I tried to open the sheet ""PV_JUNE22_LIMITED""  and got this error ""Access violation at address 00000016. Read of address 00000016.  I could not save, close or do anything, I had to end task to get out of the sheet and the PSW.  I had run the COB sheet prior to opening the PV sheet, and had closed the COB sheet. When I re-opened the ""PV_JUNE22_LIMITED""  sheet, it was completely blank.  This kind of data loss would be catastrophic in production if we were not using an outside Excel spreadsheet. 

Error checking
The workspace seemed to get stuck on one deal not being a market deal (#657854.1) that was put in the market deal number area. It is an EPMICALPOOL deal that is a buy/resale.  This error is understandable in the rows where the deal is present, but the routing error check mentioned it in rows 69-192, where the deal number was not present. Can the sheet be made to understand that a buy/resale should be tolerated in either the Supply or Market deal number cell?

I also got just ""Error:"" with no explanation of what the error was for rows 3-6, 9-11 and 21-28.  Rows 3-6  and 9-11, has a NW delivered upstream and Portland General System Downstream, both identified as Portland General System on the sheet. Rows 21-28 I see no errors apparent. 

My second PV sheet gave me  routing error  ""Error:""  with no explanation on rows 2-45.  The only thing I see is that I have chosen R instead of X for the export.  I changed all rows to X, and still got the routing error with no explanation.  I have enclosed that sheet for your inspection. Could it be that the system already detects routes?

 << File: PV_JUNE22_LIMITED.psc >> 



Path Confirmation:

The Transmission information seems to be populating correctly, all trans looks good and has the -E- on each side. I can put my POR/POD info in the Oasis cell, and all the info looks great!
The Global ID Sorting is working just right.
The Tag Sorting is also working just right.
The expanded view is showing the entire path regardless of length.
I like the POR and POD sort capability, this will be very helpful.

In the Expanded View,  even though I know the counterparty, this view sometimes shows me a blank drop down box where the counterparty should be. Allegheney did not show a counterparty name here. This actually looks like it might be specific to Allegheney.

In the line view My counterparty on the sheet CPS shows Constellation Power Source, Inc.  but in the expanded view I see City Public Service of San Antonio. They both have CPS as their short name, but the second counterparty is an East Desk Counterparty. Corry, Can you get their short name changed to something else you like?

Path Cut:

The regions are not what I have repeatedly asked for.  I only want to see the following:  California   Northwest   WSCC-N   WSCC-S  Rockies.  If I need to provide more explanation on this, I am happy to do so. The current breakout is too detailed as well as incomplete, and will be cumbersome for real-time and settlements to use.  These regions will correlate with the same region choices in the Discussion Dbase that I am working with Poston to get done.

Closing path cut seems to take quite a long time even when no saving is done, just over a minute. Users will percieve this as something broken.

I think that Bill Williams III and the real time group here will have more to add on path cut, I will hand this off to them very soon.  



Overall Findings:

I feel that with this release we are very close to what we need for production.  We will definately have to get a handle on the data loss issue, but the functionality looks really good.  My goal is to release this and the discussion Dbase at the same time so that we are able to tell settlements that from ""X"" date previous the records are in lotus, and from ""X"" date forward they are in the new system. Those groups will have huge confusion if we overlap days in both.

Please let me know anything else that I need to do, and when I may test again.  Thanks

I love you very much sweetie. 

I'm sorry it's boring in there for you. I hope you can get out a little early today so you can get a little rest and get the things you want to do around the house done. It must be kind of sad to be there right now. How is the thing you were worried about Friday working out. Did you talk to Sean about it yet? I hope he feels the same way you do about it.

  
I love getting up with you too, scurrying around the house trying to get ready for work together and being late anyway, despite our hurry-up-ed-ness. :)

We are going got be very happy in our life together. It just feels so right. 
I was looking at the pictures of our place with somebody just a few minutes ago. I'm very excited about us in our place. I can't wait to be with you in there, entertain people and have years of fun there. 

You are the love of my life. 
I LOVE YOU. 
I'll see you soon baby. 

CV. 

P.S. 11 day to go. :)

Hi There, 

I love you, I hope you have a good day.  Work is shaping up to be a real snooze-fest. There are only 9 of us on the entire trading floor right now. Normally there used to be about 65-70 of us!

Waking up with you is so nice, I am looking forward to many years of doing just that. I think we are going to settle in just fine together. I love you and enjoy being with you so much. You are the man I have waited all these years for. Thank you for being part of my life.

I will see you this evening, a little dinner, a little laundry action, maybe a little dominoes and sheet-she-me?  Woohoo!

I love you, 

CF

As represented in the database Northwest would be MID-COLUMBIA.  Is this acceptable?

Are the other regions ok?   If the regions have to be NP-15, SP-15, ZP-26  and then Northwest, WSCC-S, WSCC-N, and Rockies,  that would be liveable to me.

Cara,

We store the region from the path cuts in the database as a single EnPower Region.  That means that we can only map California to one of R10, R11, and R12.  Are you intending the regions within Path Confirmation to represent a group of EnPower Regions?  If so, we will need to make a database change to store those groupings.  I expect that the database change would take a long time because it will involve a Global database change.

Thanks,
Will

Good Afternoon,

I do want the regions to understand Enpower Regions, but at the same time not be so specific to the user.  Here is the breakdown that I would want:

California = R10, R11, and R12

Northwest = R9
	Enpower calls it MidColumbia, but many more delivery points than Just Mid Columbia are contained within it, and I don't want to list them all in the region choice or 	confuse the useres further by them looking for something in the northwest that is not MidColumbia.

WSCC-S=R7

Rockies = R7A

WSCC-N=R8

Please also see my notes below on the existing system. I am happy to provide any further explanation you would like.

I could not save, close or do anything, I had to end task to get out of the sheet and the PSW.  I had run the COB sheet prior to opening the PV sheet, and had closed the COB sheet. When I re-opened the ""PV_JUNE22_LIMITED""  sheet, it was completely blank.  This kind of data loss would be catastrophic in production if we were not using an outside Excel spreadsheet. 

Error checking
The workspace seemed to get stuck on one deal not being a market deal (#657854.1) that was put in the market deal number area. It is an EPMICALPOOL deal that is a buy/resale.  This error is understandable in the rows where the deal is present, but the routing error check mentioned it in rows 69-192, where the deal number was not present. Can the sheet be made to understand that a buy/resale should be tolerated in either the Supply or Market deal number cell?

I also got just ""Error:"" with no explanation of what the error was for rows 3-6, 9-11 and 21-28.  Rows 3-6  and 9-11, has a NW delivered upstream and Portland General System Downstream, both identified as Portland General System on the sheet. Rows 21-28 I see no errors apparent. 

My second PV sheet gave me  routing error  ""Error:""  with no explanation on rows 2-45.  The only thing I see is that I have chosen R instead of X for the export.  I changed all rows to X, and still got the routing error with no explanation.  I have enclosed that sheet for your inspection. Could it be that the system already detects routes?

 << File: PV_JUNE22_LIMITED.psc >> 



Path Confirmation:

The Transmission information seems to be populating correctly, all trans looks good and has the -E- on each side. I can put my POR/POD info in the Oasis cell, and all the info looks great!
The Global ID Sorting is working just right.
The Tag Sorting is also working just right.
The expanded view is showing the entire path regardless of length.
I like the POR and POD sort capability, this will be very helpful.

In the Expanded View,  even though I know the counterparty, this view sometimes shows me a blank drop down box where the counterparty should be. Allegheney did not show a counterparty name here. This actually looks like it might be specific to Allegheney.

In the line view My counterparty on the sheet CPS shows Constellation Power Source, Inc.  but in the expanded view I see City Public Service of San Antonio. They both have CPS as their short name, but the second counterparty is an East Desk Counterparty. Corry, Can you get their short name changed to something else you like?

Path Cut:

The regions are not what I have repeatedly asked for.  I only want to see the following:  California   Northwest   WSCC-N   WSCC-S  Rockies.  If I need to provide more explanation on this, I am happy to do so. The current breakout is too detailed as well as incomplete, and will be cumbersome for real-time and settlements to use.  These regions will correlate with the same region choices in the Discussion Dbase that I am working with Poston to get done.

Closing path cut seems to take quite a long time even when no saving is done, just over a minute. Users will percieve this as something broken.

I think that Bill Williams III and the real time group here will have more to add on path cut, I will hand this off to them very soon.  



Overall Findings:

I feel that with this release we are very close to what we need for production.  We will definately have to get a handle on the data loss issue, but the functionality looks really good.  My goal is to release this and the discussion Dbase at the same time so that we are able to tell settlements that from ""X"" date previous the records are in lotus, and from ""X"" date forward they are in the new system. Those groups will have huge confusion if we overlap days in both.

Please let me know anything else that I need to do, and when I may test again.  Thanks

Cara,

	Not a prob, the application wont look at the prod summary file unless you log in against PWRPRODN, so if you are logging against the test db's yer safe.. and for the summary to work it does require at least one previous summary detail in that excel file to work.. it uses that excel's defined macros and such to calculate the totals.. so doing a complete purge wouldnt do good.. do let me know if you have any questions about this.. be more than happy to help.
regards

Hi Asem;


O:\Portland\WestDesk\SCHEDULING\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTPROD.xls
This is the right address.  I am reluctant to add data to the production model, as it will mess up my reports.  I might rename a test file with a strange date, and then purge it.

That should work, eh?


Thanks,

Since we're talking about locations of these summary files.. is the production report located at O:\Portland\WestDesk\SCHEDULING\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTPROD.xls ? unfortunately i dont have access to the directories to find out for myself.

Cara,

I apologize for not sending out an email last week; I have been busy with the Consolidated Position Manager.  I did release new versions of both Pre-Schedule and Path Confirmation.

According to Asem the new version of PreSchedule:
Dumps summary report to excel
Edit box shown for looking at cells with large values

	Outstanding issues:
What to do with records with  'WEEK' specified in SCHED_TERM field for there is no 'WEEK' section in the physicalandbookoutsummary excel report file.  I have fired off an email to Cara asking for assistance on this matter. - determined that should be treated as daily

	Notes:
The application will look in the follow places for the PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54.xls file if user launching app has no existing profile in pwr_user_default_settings (fSUMMARYLOCATION) 
		i.e. User is WEST trader and in following DB environments:
			pwrstage[n/p]:	M:\Electric\Schedule\Process\WEST\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54WestTest.xls
			pwrprod:	O:\Portland\WestDesk\SCHEDULING\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54WestProd.xls
A pre-existing excel report must exist in location for appending to occur



According to Vish the new version of Path Confirmation:
	Path Confirmations Report
Fixed, Press Enter or Select the date from the drop down Pulling up the proper date with the calendar is slow when there is data populated into the system. We need to make sure that the selection process does not get incrementally slower with each additional day of data that is added.
Log Text displays in clean format
POR/POD can be easy to pick up


	Path Cuts
Fixed  Need to filter Region list for cuts by trading desk (East or West).
Fixed Allow hour ranges in the Hour # field specifically in HE 0000 (military) format (e.g.  0200-0400 or 1000-1400).
Fixed In the cut view, the region is still the cumbersome drop down list. This needs to be a forced choice option, like the hour-ahead vs. real-time selection.  The choices for the west are : WSCC-S, WSCC-N, Rockies, Northwest, California. Corry will be able to provide his region choices.
Provided an option to easily create a new path cut by selecting Copy Path Cut button and change the values needed
Taking care of validation while cutting the hour


Let me know if you find any problems.

Thanks,
Will

Hi Awesome Asem!

Proper Mapping Should go as Follows:

COB:  COB, COB N/S, COB S/N

PV: Palo Verde

MidC : Mid Columbia

California: NP-15, SP-15, ZP-26

NW MISC: Everything contained within the R-9 (MidColumbia) group except for Mid Columbia, and everything from R8 (WSCC-N) except the COB grouping.  Do you have those lists available?  If not, I will go type them up.

SW Misc:  Everything contained in the R7A (Rockies) region, and everything in the R7 (WSCC-S) region except Palo Verde.

Let's go with the first draft being my extra CSV file, and we can upgrade to include the data in the AGGSchedVol report later after Poston gives me his part.

Thanks,

Cara

	Looking into the Physical and Bookout summary reports, upon recreating the functionality there are certain sections to the report which we aren't clear on.. we are still needing to know which delivery points to map the following summary sections to:

	COB
	PV 		[Currently mapped to PALO VERDE]
	MIDC 		[Currently mapped to MID COLUMBIA]
	NWMISC
	SWMISC
	California	[Currently mapped to  NP-15, SP15 and ZP26]


	We've recreated the reporting functionality [excel based]  from within our new application.. and upon obtaining these mappings we can push this out to production for ya'll  asap.  If you'd like to have the summary report information dumped into the 'Aggregate Schedule Volume Report' we can definitely do that; but, would require us more time to get that functionality to you.

 The ""California"" region choice will be a combination of R10-R11and R12. (NP-15, SP15, and ZP26 respectively)  

I do not know the desks that control anything on the list below, those all look just like emissions credit desks, which would not be handled by anyone here.

West Power is as Follows
California (as defined above) - EPMI ST-Cali and EPMI LT-Cali
WSCC-S and Rockies:  EPMI ST-SW and EPMI LT-SW
WSCC-N and Northwest: EPMI ST-NW and EPMI LT-NW.

Please note:  Any desk here can trade any point, so even though the STSW has primary control over the daily trades, the body of trades will have probably all desks represented in it.

Subject:	RE: Outstanding Issues with Pre-Schedule and Path Confirmation

Please see my comments in blue

What follows are known issues with the Path Confirmation Report.

Path Confirmation Report:
Fixed Need to enable text wrapping for Path field.  The Path field is the most important field of which to see all data. Right now some paths are wrapped, and some aren't.   
Fixed Can we add a ""master-detail"" setup when soring by Tag.  Provide a list of tags and show data for selected Tag.
Fixed  Sorting by Global ID - This needs to be able to be done in the upper Sort area.  This is unclear.  What is meant by the upper Sort area? The area where we can drag and shuffle sort criteria, up above the regular line view. 
Fixed Not able to see the entire path in the ""expanded view"".  Also, delivery points are not showing up. Yesterday, I found that if a delivery point on the sheet is not exactly what Enpower has (ie: Midway instead of Midway-PSC), the expanded view just gets rid of it completely. Perhaps this should be an error-checking point? 
Done Find out to what the greyed out name in the expanded view is related. Just getting rid of that unrelated name is enough.   
Fixed Extend the size limit of the path.
We need to find out if the existing data was blown away purposefully or if this was accidental. In the last release, only the data from 6/23 was preserved from the previous version.
The POR/POD fields are still the same. We would like the delivery point selection to mimic the same functionality as the delivery point selection we see in Scheduling. 
Fixed, Press Enter or Seelct the date from the drop down Pulling up the proper date with the calendar is slow when there is data populated into the system. We need to make sure that the selection process does not get incrementally slower with each additional day of data that is added.
Fixed  For some reason, a gobal ID is showing up in the expanded view in lines where there is not a Global ID provided. It is always the same one: CISO_EPMI_5001.

Path Cuts:
Need to filter Region list for cuts by trading desk (East or West).
Allow hour ranges in the Hour # field specifically in HE 0000 (military) format (e.g.  0200-0400 or 1000-1400).
Must allow string values to be stored in the annuity field.
Fixed Transmission should be optional (Confirm with Cara)
Fixed Make it easier to show all cuts for a path.
Added Copy Path Cut Button, it stores all selected path_cut ino, change the required hour and save it.   Allow incremental hours to a cut, as hourly cuts can go on for several hours but one hour at a time. A new tag might have to be made each hour of the cut.  I'm not quite sure what you are asking for.  Can you give a little more detail? If I create a cut for a single hour, I would like to show additional hours in the same cut at a later time. Kind of an 'add-on' to the original cut. 
This application will go through a final evaluation by the real time departments, and I expect that they will need features that I have not been able to anticipate. My plan is to get as many of their needs met as possible before turning testing over to them, they are aware of this and the time table that we all are trying to meet. I will also help them with their testing to articulate their needs to you in the most efficient way possible. 
In the cut view, the region is still the cumbersome drop down list. This needs to be a forced choice option, like the hour-ahead vs. real-time selection.  The choices for the west are : WSCC-S, WSCC-N, Rockies, Northwest, California. Corry will be able to provide his region choices.
Fixed The path that has been cut needs to be able to pull up the cut note without hunting for it in the Cut Path view. The suggestion of a ""Go to Cut"" button was made in an earlier e-mail.


Let me know if there is anything that I have missed.

Please see my comments in blue

What follows are known issues with the Path Confirmation Report.

Path Confirmation Report:
Fixed Need to enable text wrapping for Path field.  The Path field is the most important field of which to see all data. Right now some paths are wrapped, and some aren't.   
Fixed Can we add a ""master-detail"" setup when soring by Tag.  Provide a list of tags and show data for selected Tag.
Fixed  Sorting by Global ID - This needs to be able to be done in the upper Sort area.  This is unclear.  What is meant by the upper Sort area? The area where we can drag and shuffle sort criteria, up above the regular line view. 
Fixed Not able to see the entire path in the ""expanded view"".  Also, delivery points are not showing up. Yesterday, I found that if a delivery point on the sheet is not exactly what Enpower has (ie: Midway instead of Midway-PSC), the expanded view just gets rid of it completely. Perhaps this should be an error-checking point? 
Done Find out to what the greyed out name in the expanded view is related. Just getting rid of that unrelated name is enough.   
Fixed Extend the size limit of the path.
We need to find out if the existing data was blown away purposefully or if this was accidental. In the last release, only the data from 6/23 was preserved from the previous version.
The POR/POD fields are still the same. We would like the delivery point selection to mimic the same functionality as the delivery point selection we see in Scheduling. 
Fixed, Press Enter or Seelct the date from the drop down Pulling up the proper date with the calendar is slow when there is data populated into the system. We need to make sure that the selection process does not get incrementally slower with each additional day of data that is added.
Fixed  For some reason, a gobal ID is showing up in the expanded view in lines where there is not a Global ID provided. It is always the same one: CISO_EPMI_5001.

Path Cuts:
Need to filter Region list for cuts by trading desk (East or West).
Allow hour ranges in the Hour # field specifically in HE 0000 (military) format (e.g.  0200-0400 or 1000-1400).
Must allow string values to be stored in the annuity field.
Fixed Transmission should be optional (Confirm with Cara)
Fixed Make it easier to show all cuts for a path.
Added Copy Path Cut Button, it stores all selected path_cut ino, change the required hour and save it.   Allow incremental hours to a cut, as hourly cuts can go on for several hours but one hour at a time. A new tag might have to be made each hour of the cut.  I'm not quite sure what you are asking for.  Can you give a little more detail? If I create a cut for a single hour, I would like to show additional hours in the same cut at a later time. Kind of an 'add-on' to the original cut. 
This application will go through a final evaluation by the real time departments, and I expect that they will need features that I have not been able to anticipate. My plan is to get as many of their needs met as possible before turning testing over to them, they are aware of this and the time table that we all are trying to meet. I will also help them with their testing to articulate their needs to you in the most efficient way possible. 
In the cut view, the region is still the cumbersome drop down list. This needs to be a forced choice option, like the hour-ahead vs. real-time selection.  The choices for the west are : WSCC-S, WSCC-N, Rockies, Northwest, California. Corry will be able to provide his region choices.
Fixed The path that has been cut needs to be able to pull up the cut note without hunting for it in the Cut Path view. The suggestion of a ""Go to Cut"" button was made in an earlier e-mail.


Let me know if there is anything that I have missed.

What follows are known issues with the Pre-Schedule Workspace and Path Confirmation Report.

Pre-Schedule Workspace:
Generating Transmission confirmation records appears not to be working for second or third transmissions. The record makes a transmission line for the transmission provider, but does not insert the Trans2 name or Trans2 oasis data into the path. 
It appears that saving does not always work.
Getting ""list index out of bounds"" errors when attempting to run the Build Route.
QUESTION:  Can we just route the month long bookouts on the first, with the designation of Month in the sched term like we can now?  It will cut down on the daily routing.
Add (if possible)  error checking for missing Supply or Market deal numbers, Why would this not be possible?  So much is driven by the deal number that to omit it would be a problem.   and missing Physical or Non-Physical Designation.  If nothing is specified in the Phys? column, Non-Physical will be assume.
Questoin:  So far we have done nothing for the Daily Summary.  Is this something that can wait, or do we need to get it done for this release? Daily summary is a current function; creating data that I use to report our volumes to our traders, Belden, and Lavorato. This must be done for production, as they ask me for this often. 
Yesterday, I found another problem, If I re-type a hour range in the sched hour cell in PSW, it converts it to date format, and I get an ""invalid variant type conversion"" error.  Nothing I did short of deleting the cells, making the changes in MS Excel and re-pasting them worked.

Path Confirmation Report:
Need to enable text wrapping for Path field.  The Path field is the most important field of which to see all data. Right now some paths are wrapped, and some aren't.   
Can we add a ""master-detail"" setup when soring by Tag.  Provide a list of tags and show data for selected Tag.

What follows are known issues with the Pre-Schedule Workspace and Path Confirmation Report.

Pre-Schedule Workspace:
Generating Transmission confirmation records appears not to be working for second or third transmissions.
It appears that saving does not always work.
Getting ""list index out of bounds"" errors when attempting to run the Build Route.
QUESTION:  Can we just route the month long bookouts on the first, with the designation of Month in the sched term like we can now?  It will cut down on the daily routing.
Add (if possible) error checking for missing Supply or Market deal numbers, and missing Physical or Non-Physical Designation.  If nothing is specified in the Phys? column, Non-Physical will be assume.
Questoin:  So far we have done nothing for the Daily Summary.  Is this something that can wait, or do we need to get it done for this release?

Path Confirmation Report:
Need to enable text wrapping for Path field.  The Path field is the most important field of which to see all data.
Can we add a ""master-detail"" setup when soring by Tag.  Provide a list of tags and show data for selected Tag.
Sorting by Global ID - This needs to be able to be done in the upper Sort area.  This is unclear.  What is meant by the upper Sort area?
Not able to see the entire path in the ""expanded view"".  Also, delivery points are not showing up.
Find out to what the greyed out name in the expanded view is related.
Extend the size limit of the path.

Path Cuts:
Need to filter Region list for cuts by trading desk (East or West).
Allow hour ranges in the Hour # field specifically in HE 0000 (military) format (e.g.  0200-0400 or 1000-1400).
Must allow string values to be stored in the annuity field.
Transmission should be optional
Make it easier to show all cuts for a path.
Allow incremental hours to a cut, as hourly cuts can go on for several hours but one hour at a time. A new tag might have to be made each hour of the cut.  I'm not quite sure what you are asking for.  Can you give a little more detail?


Let me know if there is anything that I have missed.

Thanks,
Will"

Will,

Here new fixed list  to Path Confirmation, I moved the new version to P:\PowerSys\Stage


?	Fixed - Annuity still will not accept a number with a decimal. says ""Is not a valid integer value"".
?	Fixed - Resupply deal thinks its empty when it isn't.  Should also be re-labled Resupply or ReMarket.
?	Fixed - Transmission deal should be able to be empty. Does not tolerate that now. I have to put a zero in
?	Provided an option to Delete the path cuts created
?	Path Cuts show Deal Peer ID + Deal Leg ID 
?	Path text in view fits in more lines
?	Prompts for Default Trading Desk and displays records depending on the selection
?	Now Transmission Deal Number can be Empty  in Path Cut Dialog
?	Now Resupply Deal#  caption depending on the Path Confirmation Type


Thanks,

Subject:	Test Results for June 23rd 

Good Afternoon

I ran only the Mid Columbia Sheet data for June 23rd.  Here are my findings:

PreSchedule Workspace:

I was forced to choose East or West:  good.

The error-check feature found the following problems:
	Incorrectly spelled Counterparty short names
	Missing Sched term 
	Missing Border 1 
	Missing Sched Hour 
	Missing Supply or Market Price
	Missing Supply or Market  Cont. Term
	Missing Time Zone
	Missing Supply  or Market MW


Error Check did not see the following errors:
	Missing Supply OR Market deal numbers
	Missing Physical or Non-Physical designation

During my work, I exited once and decided not to save changes in my MidC sheet.  When i re-opened, there was no data on the sheet at all. I re-pasted my sheet data in, but when I tried to execute the build-route query, I got an error message saying ""List index out of bounds (2)"". When I resaved my data, closed and re-opened, my data was there, but when I tried to query build route again, I got the error message ""List index out of bounds (3)"". 

The confirm seemed to run very quickly, but I found no data populated in the June 23rd date of Path confirmation.

Routing took 13 minutes to run, acceptable speed for the amount of paths (all daily and all monthly for MidC). QUESTION:  Can we just route the month long bookouts on the first, with the designation of Month in the sched term like we can now?  It will cut down on the daily routing.


Path Confirmation:

Not forced to choose East or West on this:

Unable to test this with the new data as none was displayed.  I will test as soon as I get word that I can.

Please let me know what you find, here is the sheet that I ran.

Cara,

There is a bug in Path confirm that which will not allow you to select the Trading Region/Desk.  Vish is working on a fix and there should be a new version available in about thirty minutes.  I have checked, and your files are there; it's just that Path Confirm is always showing East.

Regards,
Will

Subject:	Pre-Schedule WS and Path Confirmation

Corry, Cara,

There are new versions have been released to stage.

What's new and what's fixed:

Pre-Schedule Workspace:
Now able to select a Trading Region/Desk (EAST or WEST) to separate path confirm records.
Confirm record creation should be significantly faster.  Let me know if the speed is still unacceptable.
Issues with Aliases should be fixed.  (This covers your problem, Corry).
Now able to Check for confirm errors without saving to confirm report.

Path Confirmation
?	Fixed - Provide an option to delete bogus confirmation records
?	Added radio button - Cut Type Code. is vague, I think we need a button here.  Now we have a forced choice button of Hour-Ahead or Real-Time which works well.
?	Fixed  - Scheduled path quantity is vague, this should be Cut Volume.
?	By default it shows the original path now, New Path Text - If we make the New Path cut part of the Expanded view of the original path, then we could show Original Path, New path, and the user could copy  and make small changes to the new path instead of typing the whole thing in.
?	Follows Deal Entry Standards - The Counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical. It should mimic the deal entry list.
?	Fixed - The Annuity field currently does not recognize any number. It also should be able to function with NO number in it, as a typical resupply will not need an annuity. 	
?	Resupply Deal # - This also needs a choice. It will either be a New supply or a New Sink. This should need a deal number to proceed. Right now it does not like the deal number plus decimal.  I think to be consistent we need to require it everywhere a deal number is required
?	Fixed - Reason Text-this is not spelled correctly,  and the text box could be much smaller.  Most Reasons are probably a sentence at most.

Good Morning Cara,

The changes you requested for the Buildroute report have been migrated to stage.  You can either test it in either of the test environments (pwrtestn or pwrtestp) or you can have Mike Tully create a temporary short-cut for you so you can run the report against production data.

Thanks,  Poston

Please disregard the previous email.  I accidently hit send.  Can you please add this to the log of enhancements.  Cara Sempberger wants to add DOW functionality to the Build Route Report.  I think this functionality is available if you run the report in some modes but not in others.

Cara,
I was out Friday, but totally agree on segregation of East and West Confirmations.  Also, I agree that there needs to be a method to delete confirmation records (either for mistakes on date, path changes requiring it, etc).  I didn't get any records to go to the confirmation table on Thursday, so I'll look at the information on the transmission cells uploaded today.

I don't think repeating some of the errors we find is too big of a problem.

Good Afternoon Everyone


PreSchedule Workspace:

I started uploading schedules last evening from the PSW to the Path Confirm Dbase.  The COB sheet took 1 hour and 12 minutes to run 40 lines, still around 2 minutes per line.  This is an improvement, still slow for usefulness in production.

I experimented with putting the transmission in the E column, to see if it will represent in the path or if it will blow up the app. The result of that was that it ran the lines and totally ignored anything extra in the E cell. 



Path Confirmation:

We will need to automatically make sure that only East users see East Schedules and West users see West Schedules.  I cannot comprehend the nightmare of problems we will run into if we are not completely segregated.

If I run lines into the wrong date, or for some other reason need to delete entire records, how do I do that? I assure you this will happen.

*Something seems to have changed in the transmission cell uploading, Any information I put in the first set of Transmission cells is ignored. (Trans1 Name, Trans1 deal, Trans 1 oasis).


That's all I am going to do for now,  we can pick things up again on Monday.  Do you think it would be good to do a quick rundown of what has been identified and what has been corrected ? I am worried that my testing might have to be repeated on some of the same items due to the volume of e-mails.

Thanks,

Cara,

Following issues are handled in this version.. 

Slowness - Overall optimization of handling all routines dealing with data extraction within sheets.

""Variant Conversion"" errors showing up upon routing. - this issue ended up being multiple issues but now dealt with.. 

""Copy Workspace"" functionality - Created under 'Workspace' menu option 

""Capability not supported: deal has multiple delivery points"" - handled as being a transmission deal which will not be handled in this version.

Print button on error form - Printing the error sheet functionality 

Font button within Excel utilities bar -  Allow change font properties (color, bold, etc) and cell properties (highlight color) 

Search button within Excel utilities bar - Allow searching in the sheets. e.g. search for a deal number.  

 'Clear Build Route' button - Ability to clear out Build Route worksheet 

regards

Cara,
I pulled several comments you made out, and dittos from here.

I agree with your following statements:

	Even though this path could be consolidated to be smaller, we have many paths that are a good deal longer.  The part of the path in blue is in the 	upstream cell and seems to be the holdup. The size limit of the path needs to be considerably larger, or we need a way to override that for exceptionally 	long paths. I made the path smaller and got the same error.

I notice that when we have values in the transmission cells, the big E is not on there. Enron needs to be shown as ""bookends"" on the transmission we use, or else it could be misconstrued as a purchase or sale.

Some really long paths might show better in line view if that could auto-size vertically

When I try to cut a particlar path, the action of the entire Path Cut screen coming up and then me having to choose New Path cut totally blocks my view of the existing path I am trying to deal with. I think instead this should pop up as an addition to the expanded view of the existing deal. I should be able to cut a path without having to deal with the whole sort menu.


I absolutely agree with the following:
	Region should be a button list that is driven only by the East or West designation of the person's Enpower Login.  As a West User, I should only get 5 choices for 	Region: WSCC-N, WSCC-S, Rockies, MidC, or California. The drop down list is time consuming,  confusing and can lead to too many errors.

	Reason Text-this is not spelled correctly,  and the text box could be much smaller.  Most Reasons are probably a sentence at most.

Regardless of your ""misc mind altering"" habits, I think Will did say that they would only be able to have path modifications/cuts modified in the notes part initially.  Then (whenever the ""next"" modification was implemented), they would add the capability to interact with Enpower deals (ie write notes to the deal record and then, provide an entry point for deal entry for new deals done).

The East Group does not need to see POR/POD in the path for ""transmission.""  My intent was to put a counterparty name in the TRAN1 NAME column (example: TVA), and Enpower deal number in TRAN1 DEAL#	(example: 236891.1) if available, and Oasis number + level of reliability in TRAN1 OASIS	 
(example:  30912345 F-7).  I thought the logic for ""Tag"" and ""Oasis"" should be a combination of text and numbers. The reasoning for Border 2 was to have an additional border point to query for (in confirmation) when we move from one place to another. What if you put the borders in the Oasis column (ie: WW/MEAD 123456 F-7)? The path would be: Generation-marketer-E-TRANS(T) WW/MEAD 123456 F-7-E-marketer-Sink.

Gotta run,
CB

Good Morning,

Did you read Will's last note?  Anyway, I am wanting to do one of two things and need to know which you like better.

The name and oasis number representation for tranny is not enough info for us.  We need POR and POD information as well. So,  I need the following capability

Either  

Put the transmission path in the E cell like we do now,

or

Put more information in the Trans name  ( ie:  APS-(T)PV/WW)  and in the OASIS cell  (ie:  23055 HNF)


Do you have a preference?  

We also need to be a united front about the design and intent of the Path Cut. They are not wanting to make it work all the way. I sure don't remember the conversations being that it should be just a replacement for the notes part, but because it's enpower everything should work together.  Am I on crack?


Thanks,

Good Morning All,

I will talk to Corry about how we need our transmission represented.  The format is ok, I just need more information in the path or the ability to put the entire block of the transmission we buy in the -E- cell. I am going to experiment with a couple of things to see how the output looks in the Confirm.

When I try to sort Global ID or tags, I can't drag the box up to the sort area.  I get a slash-zero icon.

Using a smaller set of data does not seem to change the relative speed of the confirm upload. It looks like each path takes roughly 5-6 minutes to do. I am only putting physical paths in the confirm upload, which reduces the data set dramatically.

I have routed MidC for 6/21, the BPA deals left unrouted are 486140.1 and 308337.1.  The original delivery point in the deal is NW delivered, and then we move it in scheduling every day to go where it is needed. This type of deal will always be done, and there are other deals that get moved in the Southwest as well.  There is a WALC transmission deal that is at Pinnacle Peak, and is changed daily in scheduling to West Wing.

The deals missing dashes seem to all be the same.  Here is one example: EPMI(G)SP15-CISO(T)SP15/PVD #CISO_EPMI_5001-EPMICALPOOAPS (22545)-VALLEYALL DAYS HLH DEAL-
Here is how the path should look if the dashes were placed correctly :EPMI(G)SP15-CISO(T)SP15/PVD #CISO_EPMI_5001-EPMICALPOO-APS (22545)-VALLEY-ALL DAYS HLH DEAL



I  still  cannot get my PV sheet to upload to the confirm dbase properly.  I got  the Access Violation errors yesterday, and so end-tasked to get out and logged off and went home.  today, it looks like it is running, but I got the access violation errors again today.  I am going to save the same data to a new file, and try to run it under a different name. The COB sheet seems to be running, so hopefully the error is imbedded in the one sheet.

4.  I know we discussed the possibility of tying the new path and path cuts to our other EnPower systems.  I apologize if I did not make it clear that this would be a complicated process involving changes to those other applications.  There is currently no plan for including those features in this release.  Our goal for the first release was to replace your existing Lotus Notes system.

I don't remember our discussions making this only a possibility. I remember it being an improvement to existing systems, and a reduction in redundant work because everything would be enpower now.  I would like to explore how to make this part of the release. It seems to me that it would be more work to make it half what we need now and then keep adding to it to get to our goal. 

I will keep testing today, and bring more findings this afternoon.

Thanks,

Cara

Cara,

PreSchedule:
1.  Concerning the path with transmission data...  The original format was based off of Corry's suggestion.  Perhaps the two of you need to discuss your needs.  However, I should tell you that your approach will require a database access for each transmission, otherwise there is no way for us to determine the POR, POD and firmness for the transmission deal. 

2.  Can you give Asem and me some deal numbers to look into regarding the Northwest Delivered deals with multiple delivery points?

3.  We will resolve the physical / non-physical in the next release, as well as add a ""Check for Errors"" button.

4.  Determining the cause of the speed issues with creating the confirm records can be time consuming.  We will work on it right away, but in the meantime try working with smaller sets of data.  We will get you a faster solution as soon as possible.

Path Confirm:
1.  Sorting...  Are Global ID and Tag sorting, just not in an order that you expect?  Our tools are sorting strictly by alphanumeric comparisons.  If you need the values sorted by numbers, putting the numbers ahead of the description will work better for you.

2.  Can you give me a specific example of a path that is missing dashes?

3.  I will have Vish change the New Path functionality to require both Supply and Market.  If the delivery points are different, should we require a transmission path record?

4.  I know we discussed the possibility of tying the new path and path cuts to our other EnPower systems.  I apologize if I did not make it clear that this would be a complicated process involving changes to those other applications.

Again, thanks for your testing efforts.  We have come a long way due to your diligence.

Subject:	Preschedule Workspace Testing-June 21 target date

Good Afternoon:

I have created PSW documents for all 4 of my regions for June 21, here are my findings today:

In PreSchedule Workspace:

What worked:
I was still able to successfully copy and paste large amounts of excel data into the PSW.
I was able to query build route successfully for each delivery point I needed.
I was able to change the color of text and fonts at will.
When running the Confirm function:
I was able to print the error log, which was helpful when I had to fix a few counterparty errors.
The routing speed was still very good.

What needs improvement:
The run time for the Confirm function is still far too slow to be useful in production. The rockies sheet alone took 2 hours to upload, the Mid C sheet took over two hours. I have not been able to populate the full data set because of this speed issue. I will continue uploading today, and try tomorrow to look at the full data set in confirm. I could not import the Palo Verde sheet in to confirm. I got this error message :ERROR:Access violation at address 004ED7E3 in module 'PreSchedWS.exe'. Read of address 00000000.
We need the ability to check for errors before running the sheet, I used another half hour fixing the errors and re-running the sheet.
A spot check of routing shows that the routes are still not showing the appropriate flag for physical vs non-physical. Everything shows non-physical.
Routing still did not happen on the Northwest Delivered deals that were moved in scheduling to multiple delivery points.

Question: Will the sheet support the capability of our transmission legs showing up where the E is now?  the weakness with having the path show from transmission 1, 2, etc, is it does not give the POR/POD or the firmness of the transmission.  
( The way a path should look is like this: SRP@PV-E-APS(T)PV/WW O#23305 F-WALC(T)WW/MEAD O#464521 MNF-EPMI-NEVP,  the way this same path would show if put in to the sheet as it is now will be :  SRP@PV-E-APS(23305)-WALC(464521)-NEVP.  This is incomplete information.)

OR, would it be possible to modify the sheet to accept the following information in the Trans and Oasis number cells? Instead of APS,  put APS(T)PV/WW and in the OASIS cell put 23305 F.


In Path Confirmation:

What worked:
I was able to choose and reset colors that help me read the information better.
The speed to pull up an individual path is MUCH BETTER.
I was able to select a group of paths in the line view and attempt to confirm them. The save takes too long, but it worked.


What still needs work:
I still cannot sort by Global ID or Tag number. Would a different tag logic work, instead of ""PWX Tag 123""  show ""123 (PWX TAG)?"" Some marketers use letters for tags.
The cell with the path in the expanded view must auto-size to contain all of the path.
The program needs to insert a dash in the path when each cell boundary is passed.Upstream-Supply-E-Trans-Trans-Trans-Market-Downstream.Right now some run together. 
The path cut needs work, it is cumbersome, unclear on some entry requirements, and does not seem to recognize any number I put in it. This app seems like guess-work.

New path needs work as well.  
	The POR and POD needs to be a type and complete field( like in build route selection) not a first letter drop down list.
	The Counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical. It should mimic the deal entry list.
	The new record should be three tiered.  Supply first, then market,(both mandatory entry), then transmission as an optional third. To allow a Supply without a Market 	record is going to create many problems.
	How are these new records going to be routed?
	Also, our original intent was that the new path and path cut would drive deal entry, not deal entry being done and then numbers populated into Path Cut.




I will continue testing tomorrow, the hotspots I see now are the upload speed to Path confirmation, and a close look at how we need the Path Cut and New Path to work.


We are getting there, I am very encouraged!

3.  I will have Vish change the New Path functionality to require both Supply and Market.  If the delivery points are different, should we require a transmission path record?

4.  I know we discussed the possibility of tying the new path and path cuts to our other EnPower systems.  I apologize if I did not make it clear that this would be a complicated process involving changes to those other applications.  There is currently no plan for including those features in this release.  Our goal for the first release was to replace your existing Lotus Notes system.


Again, thanks for your testing efforts.  We have come a long way due to your diligence.

Regards,
Will

Subject:	Preschedule Workspace Testing-June 21 target date

Good Afternoon:

I have created PSW documents for all 4 of my regions for June 21, here are my findings today:

In PreSchedule Workspace:

What worked:
I was still able to successfully copy and paste large amounts of excel data into the PSW.
I was able to query build route successfully for each delivery point I needed.
I was able to change the color of text and fonts at will.
When running the Confirm function:
I was able to print the error log, which was helpful when I had to fix a few counterparty errors.
The routing speed was still very good.

What needs improvement:
The run time for the Confirm function is still far too slow to be useful in production. The rockies sheet alone took 2 hours to upload, the Mid C sheet took over two hours. I have not been able to populate the full data set because of this speed issue. I will continue uploading today, and try tomorrow to look at the full data set in confirm. I could not import the Palo Verde sheet in to confirm. I got this error message :ERROR:Access violation at address 004ED7E3 in module 'PreSchedWS.exe'. Read of address 00000000.
We need the ability to check for errors before running the sheet, I used another half hour fixing the errors and re-running the sheet.
A spot check of routing shows that the routes are still not showing the appropriate flag for physical vs non-physical. Everything shows non-physical.
Routing still did not happen on the Northwest Delivered deals that were moved in scheduling to multiple delivery points.

Question: Will the sheet support the capability of our transmission legs showing up where the E is now?  the weakness with having the path show from transmission 1, 2, etc, is it does not give the POR/POD or the firmness of the transmission.  
( The way a path should look is like this: SRP@PV-E-APS(T)PV/WW O#23305 F-WALC(T)WW/MEAD O#464521 MNF-EPMI-NEVP,  the way this same path would show if put in to the sheet as it is now will be :  SRP@PV-E-APS(23305)-WALC(464521)-NEVP.  This is incomplete information.)

OR, would it be possible to modify the sheet to accept the following information in the Trans and Oasis number cells? Instead of APS,  put APS(T)PV/WW and in the OASIS cell put 23305 F.


In Path Confirmation:

What worked:
I was able to choose and reset colors that help me read the information better.
The speed to pull up an individual path is MUCH BETTER.
I was able to select a group of paths in the line view and attempt to confirm them. The save takes too long, but it worked.


What still needs work:
I still cannot sort by Global ID or Tag number. Would a different tag logic work, instead of ""PWX Tag 123""  show ""123 (PWX TAG)?"" Some marketers use letters for tags.
The cell with the path in the expanded view must auto-size to contain all of the path.
The program needs to insert a dash in the path when each cell boundary is passed.Upstream-Supply-E-Trans-Trans-Trans-Market-Downstream.Right now some run together. 
The path cut needs work, it is cumbersome, unclear on some entry requirements, and does not seem to recognize any number I put in it. This app seems like guess-work.

New path needs work as well.  
	The POR and POD needs to be a type and complete field( like in build route selection) not a first letter drop down list.
	The Counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical. It should mimic the deal entry list.
	The new record should be three tiered.  Supply first, then market,(both mandatory entry), then transmission as an optional third. To allow a Supply without a Market 	record is going to create many problems.
	How are these new records going to be routed?
	Also, our original intent was that the new path and path cut would drive deal entry, not deal entry being done and then numbers populated into Path Cut.




I will continue testing tomorrow, the hotspots I see now are the upload speed to Path confirmation, and a close look at how we need the Path Cut and New Path to work.


We are getting there, I am very encouraged!

Good Morning,

I will create another test day to look at all these changes, my target date is June 21.  

I will need routing records removed from the following points for that day:

MidColumbia
COB N/S
Portland General System
BPA Busbar
Palo Verde
Midway-PSC
Mead-230
Four Corners

Cara,

First of all, thanks for your input.  

Regarding the new issues with path confirmation, most of these are simple problems that we can fix easily.  Vish is already working on them.  
Concerning the colors, there are three sets of colors representing market, supply and transmission.  I have asked Vish to add a color key that allows you to change the colors to your liking.  This information will be saved are remembered the next time you run the application.

Regarding Pre-Schedule, adding print capability to the error log should be no problem.  Also, adding ""check for errors"" functionality will be done.  
Concerning ""Capability not supported: deal has multiple delivery points""; I believe this is raised when there are multiple strips (either term or schedule) for a deal, but the strips have different delivery points.  The routing process is not able to determine which strips to use.  I will confirm this.

We have already changed Path Confirmation so that it will display the longer description of the counterparty name.  I may have both the code and description displayed.  I believe Corry expects to see the common name in the path confirm records (Corry, can you confirm this?).

The information you have given us will keep us busy for a couple of days, but if you have more, please send it.

Thanks,
Will

Subject:	Continuing testing of Preschedule Workspace, Path Confirmation and Path Cut software

I am working in the target date of June 20th.  Today I added schedules from Palo Verde and the entire MidC sheet to the testing group. Once COB is added, we will have pretty much an average daily volume.

Here is my attached worksheet for Mid C    << File: Mid_C_June20.psc >> 


In Preschedule Workspace:

I added Palo Verde to the group of deals imported, and ran a total of 37 lines into the Path confirmation. The rest of the sheet was all bookouts, and so I marked them for routing only.  I do like the feature of being able to exlude the majority of deals from the path confirmation. This will make the app much faster and less cumbersome for Real Time and Settlements.

I would like the option of printing the error sheet when it comes up, as the lists can be long, and I have to make notes on what is wrong. Also being able to check for errors before running the sheet would save us lots of time.  We currently have a function that checks that all names are recognized before the sheet is imported to paths. This would give us the opportunity of correction before running the sheet, instead of cleaning up afterwards.

Routing functionality question:  If we change a delivery point in scheduling (BPA NW delivered gets moved and changed every day), do these changes not route because the deal entry strip has the original delivery point?  These types of deals route now, I would like to duplicate that existing functionality. I did get an error message on those lines, ""Capability not supported: deal has multiple delivery points"" Please see the attached sheet, there is a batch of them line 76 thru 86, but it is all deals that are our BPA Northwest Delivered.

The routing speed is EXCELLENT. One second per line or less all the way in Portland on Local Enpower! The megawatts also appear to split properly between mis-matched deal amounts! this is very encouraging. My Palo data was corrupted, so my primary focus for checking routing will be the other delivery points.

My plan is to attack the Alias stuff from a different angle. We are going to work with the team that sets the Enpower ""short name"" to something that is workable.  I would like to make a new path of approval where the schedulers help set that Enpower short name. 



In Path Confirmation

The early sorting looks good, things look very versatile and useable. 

Yesterday I identified several problems:

1. The entire path needs to be shown in Both counterparty paths. Currently only the upstream or downstream shows depending on if you are looking at the supply cp or the market cp.

2. The Alias list is not functioning properly.  The Enpower Long name needs to be shown in the Collapsed counterparty view, along with the phone number and a check box to indicate if we check out with the cp.

3. Confirming the deals needs to be done as a batch, not pulling up each deal line by line.


Today, I am finding the following:

1.  When a path is pulled up from the line view to the expanded view,  the system blows away the schedule term and the Delivery point.  These fields have to be re-populated before saving can occur.

2.I am not allowed to sort by Global ID,  even though global IDs are populated there. My idea is that if there is a global present it goes in one section, no globals go in another section, and then expaning on the global section gets the individual numbers. (just like the phys vs. non phys).

3. Pulling up an individual path from line view to expanded view takes over 2 minutes.  This is to long to be practical in production for real time. I would like to see this time go to 5 seconds or less.

4.  All paths are showing up as being cut (cut checkbox checked), even though none have been cut yet.

5. The grey on grey color scheme is not going to work, but that is a little thing. Lighter colors for the back ground are going to be preferable. Variations of the beige color are easier to read.

6. The path cut button and dialog boxes I think are going to need alot of work.  It looks like I will have to do all the Enpower work first, and then populate the cut. This is a bit different than we discussed.  My plan is to take this as far as I can, and then hand it over to Bill Williams III and his group for final 'tweaking'.

7. I also cannot sort by tag number.  We need that.



Thank you all for your work on this, it is really looking good. 
I have to schedule on Monday, but will jump right back in when I am finished with daily tasks.

Cara,
I agree that we should reduce the number of ""names"" from a global standpoint now while we can.  
The routing portion of the workspace seems to work well, I agree, but the major issues lie with the confirmation side of it.
On another note, it seems I am duplicating work here.  ie: I am using buildroute, transferring to excel (to get the font/colors, etc) then back to the workspace.
We'll see...I'll hit it again next week.
Thanks for all your ""documented"" input...it sure helps.

CB

Subject:	Continuing testing of Preschedule Workspace, Path Confirmation and Path Cut software

I am working in the target date of June 20th.  Today I added schedules from Palo Verde and the entire MidC sheet to the testing group. Once COB is added, we will have pretty much an average daily volume.

Here is my attached worksheet for Mid C    << File: Mid_C_June20.psc >> 


In Preschedule Workspace:

I added Palo Verde to the group of deals imported, and ran a total of 37 lines into the Path confirmation. The rest of the sheet was all bookouts, and so I marked them for routing only.  I do like the feature of being able to exlude the majority of deals from the path confirmation. This will make the app much faster and less cumbersome for Real Time and Settlements.

I would like the option of printing the error sheet when it comes up, as the lists can be long, and I have to make notes on what is wrong. Also being able to check for errors before running the sheet would save us lots of time.  We currently have a function that checks that all names are recognized before the sheet is imported to paths. This would give us the opportunity of correction before running the sheet, instead of cleaning up afterwards.

Routing functionality question:  If we change a delivery point in scheduling (BPA NW delivered gets moved and changed every day), do these changes not route because the deal entry strip has the original delivery point?  These types of deals route now, I would like to duplicate that existing functionality. I did get an error message on those lines, ""Capability not supported: deal has multiple delivery points"" Please see the attached sheet, there is a batch of them line 76 thru 86, but it is all deals that are our BPA Northwest Delivered.

The routing speed is EXCELLENT. One second per line or less all the way in Portland on Local Enpower! The megawatts also appear to split properly between mis-matched deal amounts! this is very encouraging. My Palo data was corrupted, so my primary focus for checking routing will be the other delivery points.

My plan is to attack the Alias stuff from a different angle. We are going to work with the team that sets the Enpower ""short name"" to something that is workable.  I would like to make a new path of approval where the schedulers help set that Enpower short name. 



In Path Confirmation

The early sorting looks good, things look very versatile and useable. 

Yesterday I identified several problems:

1. The entire path needs to be shown in Both counterparty paths. Currently only the upstream or downstream shows depending on if you are looking at the supply cp or the market cp.

2. The Alias list is not functioning properly.  The Enpower Long name needs to be shown in the Collapsed counterparty view, along with the phone number and a check box to indicate if we check out with the cp.

3. Confirming the deals needs to be done as a batch, not pulling up each deal line by line.


Today, I am finding the following:

1.  When a path is pulled up from the line view to the expanded view,  the system blows away the schedule term and the Delivery point.  These fields have to be re-populated before saving can occur.

2.I am not allowed to sort by Global ID,  even though global IDs are populated there. My idea is that if there is a global present it goes in one section, no globals go in another section, and then expaning on the global section gets the individual numbers. (just like the phys vs. non phys).

3. Pulling up an individual path from line view to expanded view takes over 2 minutes.  This is to long to be practical in production for real time. I would like to see this time go to 5 seconds or less.

4.  All paths are showing up as being cut (cut checkbox checked), even though none have been cut yet.

5. The grey on grey color scheme is not going to work, but that is a little thing. Lighter colors for the back ground are going to be preferable. Variations of the beige color are easier to read.

6. The path cut button and dialog boxes I think are going to need alot of work.  It looks like I will have to do all the Enpower work first, and then populate the cut. This is a bit different than we discussed.  My plan is to take this as far as I can, and then hand it over to Bill Williams III and his group for final 'tweaking'.

7. I also cannot sort by tag number.  We need that.



Thank you all for your work on this, it is really looking good. 
I have to schedule on Monday, but will jump right back in when I am finished with daily tasks.

Cara,

My comments...

Alias Tables:
Vish is making some changes to Table Edit.  As soon as he is done I will demo it for you.  Showing the counterparty name rather than the code is no problem.

Routing Errors:
Asem is looking into the ""Term Code"" errors.

Path Confimation:
1.  To alleviate some of the time issues, we will attempt to log all errors on a record rather than only the first error.  Also, we will be trying to find the bottleneck in the confirm process.

2.  Asem is looking into the ""Variant Conversion"" errors.

3.A.  I believe the full path is being displayed, but you are not able to see it because the column needs to be sized larger.  I will have Vish auto-size that column

3.B.  Vish is working on this.

3.C.  Vish is working on this.

Regards,
Will

Subject:	Testing PreSchedule Workspace-June20

Good Afternoon;

I have spent the last 3 1/2 hours working in the preschedule workspace dealing with June 20th, delivery points West Wing, Mead 230, Craig, Four Corners 345, Midway-PSC. These are small points that are complicated and use transmission for the paths.  Here is the completed PSW sheet for your analysis.

 << File: Rockies_June_20.psc >> 


What worked:

Routing worked at Midway, which was a shaped hourly schedule, expressed as a shaped hourly schedule on the sheet. Craig routed, and So did Four Corners. 

Path Confirmation: still took over an hour to run,  but data is populated in the system now.  Please see my notes below for what did not work. From my preliminary view, the data appears to be correct, but I am going to leave final determination of the usability of this format for the decision of Bill Williams III and our real time group.  I was able to do some sorting and things look really good. The speed of the sort and pulling up batch info looks great.



What did not work:


Routing: West Wing and Mead did not route,  I got errors on 46 rows ""Error: Invalid Routing Term Code"".  The Term Column says DAY.  Does this error message reflect some other error?

Alias Tables: We seem to have a major disconnect between our original intention and what is going on here.  The original intention  is that if the scheduler sheet says ""PINW"" instead of ""PINNACLEWE"", the program will understand that and populate all schedules with PINW in  the proper counterparty of Pinnacle West in the Confirm View.  Right now, the sheet is omitting the paths without the ENPOWER long name, and using the aliases as counterparty names in the Path Confirmation VIEW.  The Path Confirmation View should give the Long Name that we see in Table Edit Field ""Counterparty"". The Alias list is to help schedulers not have to use really long and cryptic acronyms when dealing with multiple paths.  Please call me so that we can talk about this ,  it seems like we are totally not understanding each other here.

Path Confirmation: 
	1.Each time I ran my confirmation button, it took an hour, I would find an error, and run it again, it took another hour, I would see another error, and it took another 	hour.  3 hours to run one little sheet is no good. 

	2. Path confirmation also omitted 4 schedules with the error of ""Invalid Variant Type Conversion"".  The common thread in all of these paths is that they are 	generated at one point, and have transmission deals, and end up at a different point.  All transmission deals are entered properly in the sheet. These are lines 12-14 	and line 35 in the attached sheet.

	3. The data that has populated into the Confirmation system has problems.  

		A.  For each Counterparty,  we need to see the ENTIRE path.  Not just what is in the portion that the marketer has above or below them.

		B. The confirming of each path must be able to be done quickly.  Double clicking the path, waiting two minutes and then populating a name is too long. 		Currently in Lotus, the operator holds down the shift key, and mouse clicks on each path that is confirmed with the counterparty.  This puts a check by 		each line. The operator then clicks ""Confirm"" and the dialog box with the time stamp and field for name appears.  When the name is populated and the 		operator clicks ""OK""  each path is confirmed as a batch.

		C. The name that appears when I look up ""Party"" should be the long name that appears in the table edit field ""Counterparty"".  The phone number should 		also populate on that line, as well as the check box if it is checked. This is consistent with what we have now. The name that appears now is the Enpower 		short name or the alias.

	
Other functions will be evaluated tomorrow.  I have a meeting for the remainder of the day, but will be available tomorrow for some testing.  I have committments until 9 am or so.  "

Cara,
I've sure enjoyed getting you emails to will regarding the Workspace/Confirmation programs... most of your comments have been right on.  I keep having small anxiety attacks when I realize all of the tweaking we'll have for a while.

Onward through the fog.

Aquila - agree
Dukeenetra - DETM
Morgan - agree
Edison - agree
Avista - agree
The rest we don't have any contracts with as far as I know.

I'll have everyone back next week and re-do some of my testing on the workspace.

Hi Corry,

Since the new sheets are going to be a little more fussy, and the alias thing harder to fix or maintain, I would like to get the enpower short codes changed to things that are more workable and make sense.

See how these grab you:


AQUILACORP -- AQUILA (The canadian ones can stay long for differentiation)

DUKEENENTRA- DUKE (But is there another Duke that is just Duke already?)

MSCAPGP - MORGAN

EDISONMISIM - EDISON

IDACORPENE - IDACORP

PINNACLEWE - PINNACLE

AVISTAENE - AVISTA


I have a few west specific ones, but wanted to check with you for these.

Lemmie know.

Hi Kim

Thanks for getting SCEM changed to MIRANT.  They started showing up right this morning.

How difficult is it to get them changed, and who all is affected by it?  I have a laundry list of codes that are cumbersome or confusing, and would like to see about changing a batch of them.  I will do all the leg work of finding out if certain ones are ok with everyone, but wanted your input and advice.

Thanks,

Vish has been working on it.  I checked with him this morning, and he is still trying to work out a couple of bugs.

I will contact you as soon as I know more.

Cara,

Data is cleared and should be ready to go.

Is there anything else you are waiting on?

Good Morning Fellas,

In anticipation of the next testing opportunity,  I am going to use June 20th as my target date.  Can you please clear out the routes for that date at all West Points, I am going to evaluate more complicated routing and pathing next.

I will wait to test until given the go-ahead by you.

I made a new sheet for the 18th of june, only 7 lines long.  routing took only  a few seconds. I changed all the counterparty names to match the Enpower extract

I don't have an accurate time, but the confirm seemed to take about 10-15 minutes to run., all ran and have an OK now in the J and N columns.

I am still unable to verify that anything is actually housed in confirmation.

Good Morning,

My target testing date today is June 18th,  I am running in Test P in Local=
 Enpower using actual data from our scheduling sheets re-arranged to meet t=
he new guidelines.

The daily deals I coded X in columns J and N,  the Month long bookouts and =
BOM bookouts I coded R. =20


What worked:

I was able to retrieve my saved workspace with all data intact. I had previ=
ously sucessfully copied and pasted my entire sheet from EXCEL to the PSW.

I was able to run the build route report with the criteria of ""Starting On-=
 June 18-PaloVerde-Day of week Mask Activated-Report Changes activated."" A =
check of deals actually scheduled vs. build route results showed that all d=
eals were extracted correctly from Enpower. Because I am working on closed =
dates, a cumulative test of this app will not be fully testable until produ=
ction. We are expecting to see the same functionality as the current incarn=
ation of Build route. The data extracted should be read only, time stamped,=
 and when run mulitple times additional data should be shown below previous=
ly extracted data.  The improvement we are expecting to see is the app shou=
ld not duplicate deal strips on dates that have no physical power flow. (We=
st Light Load currently does this in Start view, but not Active view)

Navigating around the scheduling sheet itself I was able to accurately exec=
ute the sort function on a single criteria at a time. Multiple sorting will=
 contunue to be done in excel, or we can do a series of single sorts in the=
 PSW to acheive the same result.

Routing deals: Will had deleted all routes for June 18th, starting me with =
a clean slate.  I made every path be for DAY. I was unable to confirm total=
 unrouted MWH, as the real time position manager does not seem to be functi=
oning in TESTP. The routing appeared to take 19 minutes with the status bar=
 showing steady progress during that time. This time is 15-17 minutes longe=
r than current speed using the Excel Macro system we have now. The error li=
st gave me a row by row description of what did not route, a very useful to=
ol.  OK was visible on all rows that the PSW believed that it had routed. I=
 had difficulty checking the routing results, as I kept getting BDE errors =
in Scheduling after routing had occurred (Local Enpower). Scheduling kept s=
tarting up in 1899.  I was unable to login to TestP through Terminal server=
 2, but was able to in Terminal Server 5. The results there were very encou=
raging! Most routing was done, and a spot check of deals shows that they we=
re routed properly. The deals that were not routed appear to be due to a us=
er error of deal number duplication in the sheet. This is consistent with w=
hat I would expect. I will further evaluate routing ability with our more c=
omplicated paths later. This routing was very easy, a large point with on p=
eak non shaped deals only.



Things I did not expect that I liked:

When I highlight a group of cells in Build Route, it stays highlighted when=
 I move up to the scheduling sheet to highlight a comparison group of cells=
.  This is very handy for double checking Build route against the scheduler=
's sheet.



What does not appear to be working at this time:

The physical or not physical flag of path does not seem to be showing up pr=
operly in routing.

Path Confirmation:  The running time appeared to be over one hour for one s=
heet, only 70 rows of the sheet being flagged for insertion into confirmati=
on. This current speed will not be sufficient to work in production. Also, =
many rows that were flagged for confirmation were not imported, and I canno=
t find an error log to help understand why deals were not imported to path =
confirmation.
When the path confirmation task was finished,  the application simply froze=
.  The status bar was no longer visible, leading me to believe that it was =
done, however the app was not able to be saved or closed or examined furthe=
r.


My conclusions:

The build route and routing functions work well enough to use in production=
, the copy-paste function works well for the West desk per our connectivity=
 issues.

Path Confirmation is not functioning at this point, and appears to be blowi=
ng up the app. No data was visible for June 18th even after the PSW ran thr=
ough its import function.


Please let me know when the issues I have named have been addressed and are=
 ready for further testing.

Thanks

Cara,

We have recently added to Table Edit the ability to create aliases for coun=
terparties.  Also you should be able to add extended information about each=
 counterparty.  The tab in Table Edit is ""Counterparty Extensions"" and when=
 you select New...

 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >>=20

Try creating a few aliases and see if they work.  Because the process takes=
 so long, you might limit it to a small number of Paths.  In the meantime, =
we will be looking into why the process is slow.

Regards,
Will

Subject:=09Testing Preschedule workspace

Good Morning,

My target testing date today is June 18th,  I am running in Test P in Local=
 Enpower using actual data from our scheduling sheets re-arranged to meet t=
he new guidelines.

The daily deals I coded X in columns J and N,  the Month long bookouts and =
BOM bookouts I coded R. =20


What worked:

I was able to retrieve my saved workspace with all data intact. I had previ=
ously sucessfully copied and pasted my entire sheet from EXCEL to the PSW.

I was able to run the build route report with the criteria of ""Starting On-=
 June 18-PaloVerde-Day of week Mask Activated-Report Changes activated."" A =
check of deals actually scheduled vs. build route results showed that all d=
eals were extracted correctly from Enpower. Because I am working on closed =
dates, a cumulative test of this app will not be fully testable until produ=
ction. We are expecting to see the same functionality as the current incarn=
ation of Build route. The data extracted should be read only, time stamped,=
 and when run mulitple times additional data should be shown below previous=
ly extracted data.  The improvement we are expecting to see is the app shou=
ld not duplicate deal strips on dates that have no physical power flow. (We=
st Light Load currently does this in Start view, but not Active view)

Navigating around the scheduling sheet itself I was able to accurately exec=
ute the sort function on a single criteria at a time. Multiple sorting will=
 contunue to be done in excel, or we can do a series of single sorts in the=
 PSW to acheive the same result.

Routing deals: Will had deleted all routes for June 18th, starting me with =
a clean slate.  I made every path be for DAY. I was unable to confirm total=
 unrouted MWH, as the real time position manager does not seem to be functi=
oning in TESTP. The routing appeared to take 19 minutes with the status bar=
 showing steady progress during that time. This time is 15-17 minutes longe=
r than current speed using the Excel Macro system we have now. The error li=
st gave me a row by row description of what did not route, a very useful to=
ol.  OK was visible on all rows that the PSW believed that it had routed. I=
 had difficulty checking the routing results, as I kept getting BDE errors =
in Scheduling after routing had occurred (Local Enpower). Scheduling kept s=
tarting up in 1899.  I was unable to login to TestP through Terminal server=
 2, but was able to in Terminal Server 5. The results there were very encou=
raging! Most routing was done, and a spot check of deals shows that they we=
re routed properly. The deals that were not routed appear to be due to a us=
er error of deal number duplication in the sheet. This is consistent with w=
hat I would expect. I will further evaluate routing ability with our more c=
omplicated paths later. This routing was very easy, a large point with on p=
eak non shaped deals only.



Things I did not expect that I liked:

When I highlight a group of cells in Build Route, it stays highlighted when=
 I move up to the scheduling sheet to highlight a comparison group of cells=
.  This is very handy for double checking Build route against the scheduler=
's sheet.



What does not appear to be working at this time:

The physical or not physical flag of path does not seem to be showing up pr=
operly in routing.

Path Confirmation:  The running time appeared to be over one hour for one s=
heet, only 70 rows of the sheet being flagged for insertion into confirmati=
on. This current speed will not be sufficient to work in production. Also, =
many rows that were flagged for confirmation were not imported, and I canno=
t find an error log to help understand why deals were not imported to path =
confirmation.
When the path confirmation task was finished,  the application simply froze=
.  The status bar was no longer visible, leading me to believe that it was =
done, however the app was not able to be saved or closed or examined furthe=
r.


My conclusions:

The build route and routing functions work well enough to use in production=
, the copy-paste function works well for the West desk per our connectivity=
 issues.

Path Confirmation is not functioning at this point, and appears to be blowi=
ng up the app. No data was visible for June 18th even after the PSW ran thr=
ough its import function.


Please let me know when the issues I have named have been addressed and are=
 ready for further testing.

Thanks

Cara

I have not used table edit in over 2 years, I really don't think I am a candidate to test it.  I have told someone this already when asked a couple of weeks ago.  I also am very involved in testing the Preschedule workspace and Path confirmation, and don't want anything to get in the way of that.

I agree with Corry's requirements, it is one of the most important defenses we have against human error.  We can always refer back to the build route report.

Can you unroute June 18th in TestP Sched so I can test routing again?  I don't want to do the same day over and over again, so we can compare. 

Thanks,

Cara,

I fixed the locking problem on the Build Route sheet.  Corry had asked that the application not allow anyone from deleting data from the build route grid.  This is to protect against deals being pulled in a second time and being accidentally duplicated in the workspace.  

Corry,

I know you asked if we could have a button to clear the build route data, so as to start from scratch.  I haven't forgotten... just haven't had a chance to implement it.

Subject:	New PreSchedule

Cara,

I am ready to release a new Pre Schedule Workspace.  I am hoping that the new version will get you started.  There are some problems that still exist and I have not resolved all of the issues/enhancements previously noted.

NEW:
Instead of ""X""  for Routing we now have...
""X""	Requires routing and path confirmation records
""R""	Requires routing only
""C""	Requires path confirmation records only
""OK""	All requirement tasks completed
"" ""	Do nothing.

Assuming success...
If you have entered ""X"" and route the deals, the ""X"" will change to ""C""
If you have entered ""X"" and create path confirmation records, the ""X"" will change to ""R""
If you have entered ""R"" or ""C"", the value will change to ""OK""

Known problems while creating path confirmation records.  Couterparty ""Aliases"" have not been implemented yet.  We need to take all of the extended counterparty information you have in Lotus Notes to our Oracle database.  In this case you will get the following error messages...

Notice below that to complete the path confirmation record creation took approximately 30 minutes for the file you gave me.  Let me know if this is completely unsatisfactory.  I would like to address basic functionality now and speed issues later.

I noticed some problems with the Path Confirmation Report application.  Another developer is working on fixing those problems.  It is not currently in a working state.

Hoping all goes well,
Will

Subject:	RE: One more piece of the puzzle to help me test

The problem continues,  I could pull up the schedules in Scheduling, but they are all routed, so I rescheduled the entire day of June 15, which is the day I will test, and when I did,  I queried scheduling for the 15th, and when the schedules came up they show no mw's but do show a route, but only for the 16th.

I don't know why that is happening. I am trying to get my sheet re-set up for the 16th of june, to try all over again.

Can you see if you all can get me clean unrouted Palo Verde data for June 16th???

Cara,

I had Tantra (our DBA) refresh testp.  All necessary data as of yesterday should be available.  Also, you should be able to run the application in any Terminal Server environment.

I verified that I could pull up a mass of deals for Palo Verde and June 22.  Let me know if you are still having trouble pulling up deals for Palo.

Steve,
I wasn't aware I was asking for anything additional.  Will asked us to test this application and it did not work (neither the routing feature nor the confirmation).
We discussed possible solutions and tweaking of his prototype.  In addition to possible ideas to get his application going, I reminded him that this is to replace an existing workspace (excel) that has many more features (such as the insert keys, font colors, shading, etc).  If the goal was to replace our excel workspace, this would be a good start.  Since ""buildroute"" has been, and will be, a fundamental part of East Scheduling we agreed that the new version should save in the same manner it does now, nothing more.

Thanks,
Corry

Cara, Yes, primarily due to some additional requests that Corry has surfaced during user acceptance testing.  (I copied Corry on this in case you want to discuss with him)  He is looking for a number of excel type features that are not part of Will's grid object.  Will is doing some additional research for me on this...

Give me a call if you want to discuss.  As always, thanks for your interest and engagement.

Cara, Corry,

Here is a consolidation of your input:

Border2 is not required for creating confirmation records nor for creating route data.
Include Transmission information in the path when creating confirmation records.  
The path should resemble:  UPSTREAM-SUPPLY-E-TRAN1(OASIS ID)-E-TRAN2(OASIS ID)-E- ... -MARKET-DOWNSTREAM
Make Build Route sheet read only to prevent removal of data.  Build Routes is dependent on the data staying in the sheet to determine if deals have changed.  Add an option to clear the sheet to start over.
The transmission deal number is not required for path confirmation records.
Add ""Prepare Next Day"" and ""Copy Workspace"" functionality.
Allow change font properties (color, bold, etc) and cell properties (highlight color).
Allow searching in the sheets. e.g. search for a deal number.  A simple search for string or number will do.
Daily Summary needs to be completed.
Neither Upstream nor Downstream are required for path creation.
Fix ""General SQL error.  ORA-02289: sequence does not exist"" problem.
""insert keys"" etc to tool bar.  (example: redo, insert row,...)  Although the sheets in this app are similar to Excel, there are some limitations.  Implementing things like ""redo"" can be complicated if not impossible.  
When you open ""path confirmation"" it defaults to your last user sort settings.  I don't know if this is possible.


Very Important:
We need to determine what is the very least requirements for this application to replace your current processes.  The goal of this application is to allow you to set your excel worksheets aside and work strictly within Pre-Schedule Workspace (PSW).  If with the current approach we are not able to achieve this goal, we need to take a step back are reevaluate our situation.  Also, I can provide some of the basic Excel functionality that is currently missing, but I don't want to get into a situation where I am rewriting Excel.  We need to determine what Excel functionality is a must and what functionality we can do without.

Let me know if you have any other concerns.

Thanks,
Will"

Cara / Corry,

Asem Atta will be helping out with this project, please include him on any further correspondence.

Also, I am releasing a new version that should have the Saving/Opening of files fixed.  There is still a problem with saving taking too long (about 1.5 minutes).  Asem will be looking into this.  Please keep the feedback coming.

Cara, let me know if you have continued problems with the new version.

Good Afternoon,

I have been unable to sucessfully test the Preschedule workspace, here are the problems I have run up against:

In the special Terminal server that Will sent me,  I was unable to copy from Excel and paste into the app

In the local system, I was able to copy from Excel and Paste into the app, but it would not allow me to save any data.  The app saved itself as a file, but none of my data were preserved in it. Here is the saved app file that was created.

 << File: MAY_O2_PV.psc >> 

Both locally and in Terminal server, I was unable to close the app.  I had to use the task manager and end task to get me out of the Preschedule workspace viewer.  I did get numerous dialog boxes with various errors, but did not log them all. I can do that if you wish.

I have a set of data re-designed to match the columns of the app, here is the data for May 2.  This will be the approximate size of the sheet if monthly deals are required to be included.

 << File: may2pvhlhdata.xls >> 
Please let me know what I can do to begin testing again,  I am very anxious to get started.

I tried opening your file and experienced some problems as well.  I will figure out what is causing the problem and hopefully have something for you to play with first thing tomorrow.  I may have to go ahead an make the changes required to fix the saving/loading that I described in my previous email.

I apologize for the inconvenience.

Cara,

I have completed most of the work on the Pre-Schedule Workspace.  It is time to get you to take a look at it.  I realize that there may be quite a few things that need ""tweaking"" and others may be missing altogether.  I am depending on you to help me identify any problems.  I am prepared to give you a demo some time today.  Let me know what will be a convenient time.  The Path Confirmation report is also done, and I can demo that for you as well.

Known problems:
Opening and saving large files is too slow. It will take approximately half a day to fix this problem.
The Excel Daily Summary is not done.  I would like to discuss this piece with you in more detail.
It is currently possible to create duplicate confirm entries for the Path Confirm application.
We are working with the Terminal Server guys to get the new app working on terminal server.  This should be done by the end of the week.

I am happy to annouce that we have completed the two new applications which will help scheduling group
with routing and path confirmation. Currently, it is in user STAGE for you to look at ( NOT FOR TESTING ) since
there are few minor issues that need to be resolved with terminal server folks and developers.

New applications are Pre-Schedule Workspace & Path Confirmation which are available under
Enpower Launch Pad -> Tools -> Pre-Schedule Workspace
Enpower Launch Pad -> Tools -> Path Confirmation

Note that new application will not work under terminal server since it requires a special MS office file
to be installed on TS.

Thanks to all enpower developers for their continued hard work, especially Will Smith's significant contribution
to this project

I am glad to discuss with both you offline for any issues / comments / concerns

Cara,

There have been a few delays, simply because I have not been able to dedicate my time toward this project.  In fact, Duong Luu's wife just gave birth to their second baby a week ago, so I have been filling in on a number of Duong's tasks.

However, to give you an update of where I am (as reported to Steve Nat)

Pre-Schedule Workspace 
Retrieve Unrouted Data  (90% complete)
Create Routes in EnPower (80%)
Create Path Confirmation Records (75%)
Aggregate Data Export (0%)
Path Confirmation
Main View Screen  (70%)
Edit Path Screen  (70%)
Cut Volumes Screen  (0%)
Table Edit
Add Counterparty Extension editor (0%)
Add Counterparty Aliases editor (0%)
Data Transfer from Notes To EnPower
This needs to be coordinated with the Notes team.  A tool (temporary) will need to be constructed to move the data from Lotus Notes to EnPower's Oracle database.



Welcome back,
Will

Cara,

I am pretty deep in the code right now.  Corry has helped me with a few questions that I had.  I hope to have something to test by the end of next week.  I am primarily focusing on the routing part of the project.  It is by far the most complicated part.  

I will give you another update at the end of next week.

Corry,

Who is the ""owner"" of the path?  My understanding is that the path only needs to be confirmed once, but which counterparty is the path confirmed with; the supply or market?

e.g.

Supply				Market
DUKE		-E-		ENTERGYPOW

Confirm with Duke?
Confirm with Entergy?

Thanks,
Will

P.S.
I will send a revised table structure sometime today for your review.

Corry, Cara,

I am ready to start translating the VB code in the Auto-Route spreadsheet to my EnPower application.  I need to get the latest copy of your spreadsheets so I can make sure I have the latest code.  Please send this to me ASAP.

1 week = 40 hours of work on this project.  Duong Luu ensures me that I will not have to deal with various distractions.
I expect that you will be able to play with the Workspace in test before Path Confirmation.  However, they will both need to be release to production at the same time.

I will keep you updated on the progress of this project.  If it looks like there are too many distractions and I will be unable to complete it in the designated time, I will let you know as early as posible.

Regards,
Will

I have a question-- The 3 weeks, and 2 weeks designation.  Is that 3 weeks of 8 hour days of your attention, or 3 calendar weeks if we are your only priority, or something different?

When I see 3 weeks, I look at my calendar and think that I will be testing something by April 26

I just want to manage my expectations.

Cara,

This is what I sent to Duong Luu regarding what needs to be done to complete ""Phase 1"" of this project.  Feel free to add more detail if you desire.

Prescheduling Workspace	Will Smith	(3 Weeks)
?	Replace Auto-Route Worksheet.
?	Create routes in EnPower.
?	Create ""Path Confirmation"" data.
?	Export MW information (for Aggregated Schedule Volumes?).
?	Maintain local/network copy of workspace data in case EnPower is inaccessible.
?	Provide auto save option.
?	Allow access to application even if EnPower is unavailable.
?	Include ""Build Route"" technology with auto-run feature.
?	Allow copy from and paste to Excel.

Path Confirmation			Will Smith	(2 Weeks)
?	Replace Lotus Notes database.
?	Provide screen to maintain extended counterparty information.
?	Allow flexible grouping of path information (by Date, CP, Border, etc)
?	Allow cutting MW, automatically updating routes.

Cheers,
Will

Murray,

We may need more logins if there are multiple people required to schedule.  These logins are to allw the ubs schedulers to continue to perform for us after there login is converted to the ubs system.  I would prefer that they have individual logins so we can audit who did what?

Tom & Mike,

To make this easier,  I spoke with Dave Steiner, (Local Portland IT infrastructure) today and told him that their should be 3 ID's established,  One for trading, one for Scheduling and one for Real Time  these ID would be able to access the estate and would not be user specific but would be role specific. This way anyone on the UBS team could use them and each person does not need their own ID.  

If you wish to change this please make sure that Dave Steiner is notified.

Thanks - MO

She also said I can do whatever I want, including the gym! Your ASS is MINE!  ;)  She said lifting etc is fine as long as I listen to my pain and lift things slowly. No jerky or quick lifting that could hurt me.

Time is running very short.  Is your company prepared for Etag 1.7?  These are the minimum REQUIRED steps that must be completed prior to March 6, 2002:

---------------------------

(1)  All entities must update the NERC Registry at http://www.tsin.com.

(1a)  CA's and TP's must designate PORs and PODs that are valid on tags.

(1b)  PSE's must designate associated scheduling PORs and PODs.  See http://www.tsin.com or inquire with NERC for details.

---------------------------

(2)  All OATI Users must have functioning OATI Digital Certificates.

(2a)  Without the certificate you cannot access Etag 1.7 after March 6, 2002 at all.

(2b)  Inquire internally to determine if a supervisor has already contacted us.

(3b)  To begin the process of acquiring OATI Digital Certificates, please complete this document and send it to OATI:

http://www.oaticerts.com/repository/Company_Information.doc

---------------------------

Failure to complete these steps will result in a partial or complete lack of tagging access and capability!

For additional information on these and other critical Etagging issues, please visit OATI's Etag 1.7 Information Page at http://www.oatiinc.com/etag17.

Re the Jan 28th NERC/NAESB mtg in DC:

Background:
NERC is in discussions with the North American Energy Standards Board
(NAESB, formerly GISB) and others on any needed changes to either NAESB or
WESM for determining how standards should be established for the Wholesale
Electric quadrant of the NAESB organization.  Future mtg dates are:
Feb 1 in NYC
Feb 12 in Atlanta
Feb 21 in the West, maybe Phoenix (per request by Dennis, at BPA/Western
Canada, etc. urging)
There is also a plan to provide telephone or electronic conferencing options
at these meetings.  I plan to participate by conference Feb 1 and 12, and by
attendance Feb 21st.

Some of the issues discussed at the Jan 28th mtg are:

1) relationship between the NAESB Board and the WESM Board
2) appropriate industry membership segments
3) relationship with FERC/Canada/State Commissions/RTOs
4) funding
5) standards development process and compliance 

There appears to be industry consensus on use of NAESB as the umbrella
organization for the electric/gas wholesale and retail quadrants and
somewhat less agreement on use of a modified NERC for the electric wholesale
quadrant.  Some still argue that NERC should only focus on reliability and
shouldn't set business/commercial practices, however many in the industry
understand that these are inextricably linked and there should be a single
organization for setting both reliability and business/commercial
practices/standards.
 
NAESB quadrants may use the NAESB prescribed/pre-approved ANSI process and
governance/membership criteria- which differ slightly from the new NERC
Organization Standards Process and WESM criteria - or may choose different
criteria and a different ANSI-approved process.  More info on NAESB can be
found at www.naesb.org . 

The FERC Order Providing Guidance on the Formation of a Standards
Development Organization for the Wholesale Electric Industry (RM01-12-000,
dated  12/19/01) requests the industry to ""agree on a single standards
organization to develop wholesale electric standards by March 15, 2002"".
The NERC BOT will take action on the revised WESM at their February mtg.

I have been told today that these folks will have to do all of our scheduling as of Monday, they are being trained today but will have to have working logins patterned after Donald Robinson by the end of business today.

Serena Bishop ( I do not know what she has access to, she was the California scheduler)
Mike Purcell (already has access to some things, but please check his access)

Lloyd / Corry,
 
Do you folks know what is driving the cutover for Monday morning rather than Wednesday evening as planned?  We have been planning on being ready for Wednesday morning and Monday will cause some unnecessary grief.
 
Bill,
 
Can you work with Erik and Dean in Houston and Cara and Mike in Portland to ensure that they have the required logins to estate systems to schedule next week.
 
Thanks,
 
Tom.

I will see what I can do about the cut-over.  Until the email this morning, I had been told that we had until Thursday morning.  The contingency plan in the east is to have Corry's folks come down and help the estate staff using estate logins.  Is this possible for you folks as well.

Hi sweetheart.

I love you.

I enjoyed sitting at the table eating breakfast with you this morning. Every day that I get to be with you is a special gift for me. I love you so much. 

Jorie sent an envelope with Dan for me to give to you. It says on the envelope that she looked for the house online (ERA.COM) and found it under the 150-250 range. 

I can't wait to see you tonight. I love you baby.

Have a good day.

Erik, Dean, & Mike,
 
Do you folks feel you will be able to schedule the east power contracts with some assistance from Jason and Lisa on Monday and do you have the logins that you will require?  If not, what do we need to get?
 
Tom.

I'm not sure. Corry came over and told me this was happening on Monday.  It shouldn't be a problem for me and Lisa to come down and help whoever is going to be scheduling.

Jason,
 
Why has this now changed to Monday from Thursday morning and who made this decision?
 
Will we be able to schedule Monday without the UBS folks?

Hi Shirley, the first 30 minutes or so were spent on going over the ground
rules that Mike sent out in his 1/30/02, 1:37 pm email.  Then we got into BP
2 on Reservation Timing Requirements and went down the bulleted comments
that Mike sent out with his ground rules, starting with the question of
whether all of the BP's under Order 638 should be in the new BP's.  This
discussion lasted about 30 minutes.  Most of the discussion focused on how
to deal with the various timing issues (granularity, submittals, approvals,
etc.).  Finally, it was suggested that a general statement be put in the
Applicability section that if 638 is superceded, a new rule may be needed on
this BP.

One of the suggestions was that you need to know what your products are
before you can determine the timing issues.  We know FERC will be coming out
with a replacement for the pro forma tariff, but Mike doesn't want to wait
to move forward on the BP's until then.  His goal is to focus on the core
elements of trading/tracking/utilization of rights and then add/subtract
once we know what the new tariff will look like.  It was also suggested that
we may want to set aside a conference call session just to deal with timing
issues to make sure all of the BP's are coordinated on that.

He agreed to clean up the inconsistencies related to resales/notice thereof
in the BP language.  I believe it was also agreed that the BP's for
Transmission should be separate from those for ancillary services (due to
fact that some anc services are purchased in bulk for multiple
transactions).  

Mike is planning the next conf call for next Wed, noon EST and another call
about a week later.  His hope is to go through as many of the BP's as
possible this way.  Today we just got through BP2.

That's about it, unless someone on ESWG has something else to add. 

thanks

Cara, 

Can you double check this deal for me.  Utah is saying that this deal did not flow after the 12/1/01.  I have looked at the SW sheet and it looks like it was cut, but I want to make sure.


Deal 533980.4

Thanks

How's you day so far Princess? 
I've been busy straitening things up around here. I can't finish my machine yet because I don't have some parts that I need. I feel so much better today since I didn't have to get up at O dark thirty. I loved waking up today. :-) fun fun fun.

I love you and I hope you are having a good day. 
Don't do to much heavy lifting at home Ok. I don't want you to hurt yourself. 

I love you baby. 
See you tonight.

Subject: RE: ESC Conference Call to discuss Business Practices


I have to caution against copying the S&CP 1.4, or the closely related
Order 638, into the OASIS Phase 2 business practices. They should merely
be reviewed to avoid missing anything.  Copying in parts of Order 638
have already created direct conflict between some of the business
practices.  It's important to remember that the S&CP 1.4 is the solution
to business needs that existed 2-5 years ago and that were a much
smaller subset of the business needs of OASIS Phase 2.  Slapping an old
solution onto a new problem is rarely, if ever, advisable.  

There is a lot of technical implementation detail in Order 638 that
should be avoided in the new business practices.  Instead the BPs should
focus on WHAT (business requirements). The HOW (design & implementation)
should be covered by the new S&CP.  For instance, instead of covering
the specific state change of ""COUNTEROFFER"", cover the general business
processes of negotiation.  Nothing in the BP's even says that
negotiation can occur, much less what can be negotiated. Is it just
price, or is it capacity and time as well, or is it something else?   

I'd suggest you start by defining what the transmission products are.
The existing definitions don't fit some of the BP's. 
Then cover the processes for obtaining them.  For instance:
- Buyers submit requests for what and to whom? (source to sink submitted
to many sellers all at once, or partial path to one seller at a time?
What data is required or optional?  Can they agree in advance to accept
the current posted price? Can they agree in advance to accept whatever
capacity is available?)
- Sellers do what with the request? (negotiate terms, approve request,
reject request according to what rules, etc)
- Buyers do what during negotiation process? (accept terms, suggest
other terms, match another buyers bid, reject the terms, etc.)
- Buyers do what with their transmission right? (use them as they are,
don't use them, use them on a different path, sell part or all of them
to someone else, reassign part or all of them to someone else, defer
them to a later time period, extend them beyond their original time
period, etc).

If these types of ""what"" questions are answered thoroughly, then the OSC
will be able to define the right architecture, communication structure,
state transitions, etc. to meet the business needs.

Patt,

I think many of your questions about Business Practice 2 could be
resolved
by including the definitions and state diagram from the OASIS 1.4 S&CP /
Order 638.  (I pulled out a copy of the definitions, but could not grab
the
diagram from the pdf file, so I attached the entire 1.4 document.  The
definitions appear on pages 26-28, and the state diagram is on page 29.)
I
also threw out my responses, for whatever they are worth, to your
questions
in the body of your email.

Mike,

Although the wording for these standards in BP 2 is taken directly out
of
Order 638, in looking at the State Diagram, it appears to me that
""SUPERSEDED"" should be included in Standards 4.6, 4.7, and 4.12 , and
that
""DECLINED"" and ""SUPERSEDED"" should be included in Standard 4.6.VI.

Is there a reason that we are trying to make this our stand-alone
document
instead of just endorsing the Standards as they appear in Order 638,
taking
exception or recommending changes where necessary?  Using Patt's email
as
an example, it seems like we are taking a big risk of missing something
if
we just take bits and pieces of a document.

Mike:

I won't be able to join the conference call on the 31st (due to being on
night shift).  I have a couple of questions on BP 2 and 3.

Regarding Business Practice #2:

1.  I don't see where there's an option to Pre-Confirm a transmission
request.

Are we still going to have this option?  Does it need to be specifically
addressed (I would think yes).  Is this supposed to be implied in
Standard
4.10?  The customer doesn't actually change the status to CONFIRMED, but
maybe it's just semantics (as in, if there computer is doing the CONFIRM
behind the scenes, and not actually changing the status manually)?



** Preconfirmed is not mentioned because it does not effect the timing
requirements.  When the tag is submitted, it is QUEUED and then must be
acted on by the TP within the specified time frame.  All preconfirmed
does
is remove the obligation of the PSE to respond after the TP ACCEPTS the
request, since preconfirmed automatically takes it to CONFIRMED.,


2.  In Standard 4.6, there is a state of INVALID.  But this is never
described, and there doesn't seem to be any further reference to it.
Should we describe what would be designated as INVALID?  What is
supposed
to happen when the request is in this state?  Should there be a
statement
included, such as if a request is found to be INVALID, the only way to
have
further consideration given to the request is by submitting a new, valid
request?


** Per the definition, INVALID is a Final State for the Request.


3.  What is the distinction between DECLINED and REFUSED?  Should this
distinction be included in this document?  Is DECLINED a refusal of a
REBID
(as implied in Standard 4.12)?


** See Definitions.  Refused is for lack of ATC, Declined says TP does
not
accept your terms.


4.  Depending on the answer to #3, shouldn't Standard 4.7 include
DECLINED?
In addition to ACCEPTED, COUNTEROFFER, and REFUSED?

**  No. The TP can DECLINE a request because the price is incorrect,
whether or not there is ATC available.

5.  In Standard 4.9, it talks about RECEIVED.  But RECEIVED isn't
mentioned
anywhere else.  How does the request get to the RECEIVED state?  And
what
happens to it from there?  And how is it different from QUEUED?

** RECEIVED is a ""placeholder"" state that simply means the TP has
received
the request.  The paths from Queued and Received are identical.

6.  Standard 4.11 says that the TP can move the request to RETRACTED.
Shouldn't this be included in Standard 4.6?

** RETRACTED should not be included in 4.6 because you cannot go from
QUEUED to RETRACTED

7.  Again depending on the answer to #3, should REFUSED be included in
Standard 4.12?  In addition to DECLINED, ACCEPTED and COUNTEROFFER?

** Again the answer is NO because you cannot go from REBID to REFUSED.
HOWEVER, SUPERSEDED should be included in this list.

Regarding Business Practice #3:

Under Detailed Practice, Reassignment:

I'm not sure that I understand the distinction between ""all rights"" and
""rollover rights"".  Or, wouldn't ""all rights"" include rollover rights?

1.  It states in the first paragraph that, by default, rollover rights
remain with the original rights owner.  This seems to contradict the
rest
of the paragraph, which states that the original transmission purchaser
is
removed from all obligations, and that all rights transfer to the
secondary
purchaser.  Wouldn't that include the rollover rights?  Should the
statements say ""with all rights and obligations, with the possible
exception of rollover rights, transferring to the secondary transmission
rights owner""?

2.  The first paragraph states that rollover rights can be transferred
by
explicit contractual determination.  How would this be conveyed to the
TSP?
Will the manner of communication be standardized (such as including it
in
the notification of reassignment of transmission rights)?


Thanks for the clarifications.

All,

  This serves as the announcement for the 1st in a series of Business
Practice Conference Calls.  I've setup this 1st call to discuss BP 2 and
BP 3, as I received no additional comments on the order or grouping for
discussing the BPs.

  Attached is the information for the call, as well as the current
outstanding items from the task list.  So that you have time to review
and comment on these particular BPs I've moved this call until Thursday
the 31th.   Please use the ""BP Conf Call One BP2 and BP3.doc"" to submit
your comments, and direct your comments to the 5 specifice areas of the
BP (i.e. Practice Summary, Associated Rules, Justification,
Applicability, Practice Details).  I will send out any updates that I
receive prior to the call.

Mike

This article has good quotes reponding to McCullough's claim that Enron manipluated forward markets.

Thanks to Dave Perrino, former Enron employee who is now a consultant, for bringing this to my attention.

Subject:	TAG 40700

Hey Guys - Well, I had to learn some Cod Scheduling fast this afternoon, (we really do need to exchange new cell phone numbers :-)). Anyway, tag #40700 was incorrect and BPA called about 3:45.  I cancelled that tag and replaced it with tag #40716
I hope what I did was okay, let me know if I should have done it differently.  On the NW sheet that tag number is highlighted in yellow in case there is a problem.  I assume the something needs to be corrected in the preschedule workspace, but I don't know what it is, so I will leave it to Cara or Donald to explain it to me in the morning.  Thanks again, Serena"

When E-Tag 1.7 is activated on March 6, 2002 the OATI webTag (ETS) system will require secure access using an OATI Digital Certificate.  OATI Digital Certificates will be provided to our existing webTag customers at no additional cost under their existing ETS Agreement.

For those companies that have not yet acquired OATI Digital Certificates, to start the process, please download the Company Information document at the following URL:

http://www.oaticerts.com/repository/company_information.doc

Complete the form, and then e-mail it to OATI at support@oatiinc.com.  Please do not delay, get this service today to avoid access problems on March 6.

For those companies that have already acquired OATI Digital Certificates, our OATI webTag Administrator will be contacting your company shortly to activate this service with your current E-Tag 1.67 access.

If you have questions, please feel free to contact us at (763) 553-2725 or support@oatiinc.com."

Hello.  How's life?  Mine is pretty good.  I have a face to face interview with Merch Pharmaceuticals.  I guess I did ok on the phone interview even though I didn't think they'd call me back. 

Question for you.  I was wondering if you could change the first sentence in my letter of recommendation because it talks about FMLA leave and the dates I worked at Enron, which I have on my resume, but I'd rather they didn't know that I have a little one because I don't want them to judge me by that.. or think I'll be a slacker because I won't, and I already have the same babysitter set up and ready to go.  (if I get lucky and get the job)...  :)  I could come by one afternoon this week to pick it up because my interview is Tuesday.  What do you think?  No big deal if not, just thought I'd try.   

Also, I'm taking Emily to Gymboree (a baby class) and Chris Calgar's(spelling???) wife and son are in it.  I just met her Tuesday for the first time.  I guess they are moving to Houston the end of March. 

Hope all is well and maybe we'll see you soon.  Emily is such a chunk now.

WSCC ESWG - 

Here's what we have been waiting for.  Its the sector voting registration
site.  You'll need a browser with 128 bit encryption to get in (guess I'll
have to go home to do that).

So go tell everyone you know who qualifies for one of the these sectors to
register.

John Canavan from Montana Power has put forth his name to be considered for
the ESC Vice Chair officer position.

Remember, in order to vote for the officers at the Denver/April ESC meeting
you need to be there and be registered.

Hey Guys - Well, I had to learn some Cod Scheduling fast this afternoon, (we really do need to exchange new cell phone numbers :-)). Anyway, tag #40700 was incorrect and BPA called about 3:45.  I cancelled that tag and replaced it with tag #40716
I hope what I did was okay, let me know if I should have done it differently.  On the NW sheet that tag number is highlighted in yellow in case there is a problem.  I assume the something needs to be corrected in the preschedule workspace, but I don't know what it is, so I will leave it to Cara or Donald to explain it to me in the morning.  Thanks again, Serena"

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge). "

DAILY BRIEFING -- Can UBS Tame Enron's Wild Traders?
Daily Briefing: NEWS ANALYSIS 
By Emily Thornton in New York, David Fairlamb in Zurich, and Stephanie Anderson Forest in Dallas 
Back in November, Dynegy (NYSE:DYN <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dyn&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dyn.html>) had what sounded like a great idea: Buy Enron's flagship trading business in natural gas and electricity, and immediately become the dominant force in those markets. Dynegy fled when Enron started to collapse under an avalanche of scandal. Now, Zurich [Switzerland]-based UBS Warburg (NYSE:UBS <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ubs&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/u/ubs.html>) is making the same bet, albeit for a lot less money. 
The question now: Will the conservative bank be able to impose Swiss order on the rogue Texas company's traders? On one level, the deal doesn't seem completely farfetched. Enron's gas and electricity trading actually seems to have made money. Other bankers who checked it out estimate the trading operations racked up $3 billion in pretax profits over the past two years [see BW, 2/11/02, ``Enron: How Good an Energy Trader?'']. 
Still, UBS had good reason to go for a deal that gave it 67% of future pretax profits for a pledge only to pay the salaries of 625 Enron employees. Obviously, the Enron name is mud, and getting people to trade with the company will be difficult enough. But managing Enron's swaggering traders -- its core asset -- could turn out to be even harder. 
CULTURE CLASH. Enron may be on its last legs, but its masters-of-the-universe culture lives on, say insiders. ``Even after going down in flames, a lot of these people have undiminished confidence in their ability,'' says a former Enron trader who asked not to be named. Competitors doubt that people who earned as much as $1 million a year in the freewheeling, high-risk Enron culture will be grateful to become a small piece of UBS's massive fixed-income business. 
Although many have signed contracts with UBS that prevent them from leaving Enron for an undisclosed period, ``they're all exploring their options,'' says one banker privately. Indeed, some traders are talking about trying to buy the trading unit back from UBS after it gets going again. UBS says it's not worried about rogue traders. ``We're confident in the people we have hired,'' says Michael Hutchins, global co-head of credit fixed income at UBS Warburg. 
For the scheme to work, however, UBS must persuade Enron's traders to accept its risk-management practices. And that will be tough: One reason Enron's traders made so much is that they took big risks. Analysts estimate that Enron was willing to put as much as $66 million at risk on a trade, vs. $12.2 million at Dynegy or $16 million at Duke Energy. UBS Warburg is willing to put up to $131 million at risk in all of its deals with a single trading partner, but insiders says its energy traders won't be allowed to risk ``anything like that'' on a single trade. UBS'ers abide by tighter controls than at Enron. 
``SMOOTHING ELEMENT.'' UBS officials insist that they have no rosy delusions about the investment. That's partly because they had been researching the energy-trading business for more than a year as a way of diversifying the bank's trading income. ``Earnings in the energy-trading business do not depend on developments in the capital markets, so they could work as a smoothing element,'' says UBS President Peter A. Wuffli. 
That's in fact what motivated UBS to send a small team down to Houston when Enron put the business up for sale after the bankruptcy filing. Even after federal antitrust authorities give the final go-ahead, the Swiss bank says it plans to take things slowly. ``We don't know how quickly this is going to start up,'' says UBS CEO John Costas. ``We'd be happy in the first year if this business is half as big as it had been historically.'' 
Still, anything associated with Enron is arguably fraught with risk at any price. ``It's not clear how successful UBS is going to be,'' says Jeff Dietert, an analyst at investment bank Simmons & Co. in Houston. ``And I think UBS knows that. That's why it wasn't willing to pay anything up front.'' 
Some industry insiders doubt that Enron's traders will prove to be exceptional under the new rules. But UBS isn't about to change its own way of doing business. ``Entering into energy trading does not mean extending our appetite for risk,'' says Wuffli. Swiss family Enron? Don't bet the chalet on it.

Cara,
Here is a list of updates:

Asem, Vish:
Please look this over to verify that I haven't missed anything.

Aug 14:
Pre-Schedule Workspace:
When double click a cell automatically go to the ""Editor"" edit box.
Allow show / hide of Editor.  Add to menu under View / Toolbars as well as popup menu.
Move copy from Workspace to File in the menu.
Add an icon for copy.  
Rename ""Excel Utilities"" to ""Spreadsheet Utilities"" on the toolbar as well as the View menu.
Contains also fix for looking up correct location for summary report.

Path Confirmation:
Now in West Regions you can see Northwest which is R9
Closing the path cut is fast now
Annuity Id in path cuts can accept non numeric values (strings also)
Cut Hour is in 0000-2400 format
Added validation on Resupply deal#, it should be valid existing Enpower deal 


Aug 3:
Pre-Schedule:	
Dumps summary report to excel
Edit box shown for looking at cells with large values

	Outstanding issues:
What to do with records with  'WEEK' specified in SCHED_TERM field for there is no 'WEEK' section in the physicalandbookoutsummary excel report file.  I have fired off an email to Cara asking for assistance on this matter.

	Notes:
The application will look in the follow places for the PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54.xls file if user launching app has no existing profile in pwr_user_default_settings (fSUMMARYLOCATION) 
		i.e. User is WEST trader and in following DB environments:
			pwrstage[n/p]:	M:\Electric\Schedule\Process\WEST\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v254WestTest.xls
			pwrprod:	O:\Portland\WestDesk\SCHEDULING\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v254WestProd.xls
A pre-existing excel report must exist in location for appending to occur

Path Confirmations Report
Fixed, Press Enter or Select the date from the drop down Pulling up the proper date with the calendar is slow when there is data populated into the system. We need to make sure that the selection process does not get incrementally slower with each additional day of data that is added.
Log Text displays in clean format
POR/POD can be easy to pick up

	Path Cuts
Fixed  Need to filter Region list for cuts by trading desk (East or West).
Fixed Allow hour ranges in the Hour # field specifically in HE 0000 (military) format (e.g.  0200-0400 or 1000-1400).
Fixed In the cut view, the region is still the cumbersome drop down list. This needs to be a forced choice option, like the hour-ahead vs. real-time selection.  The choices for the west are : WSCC-S, WSCC-N, Rockies, Northwest, California. Corry will be able to provide his region choices.
Provided an option to easily create a new path cut by selecting Copy Path Cut button and change the values needed
Taking care of validation while cutting the hour

Will,

Please forward this fix list  to Cara,

Here are the following fixes we released into Stage and Production today.

Subject:	PSW Day 2

Good Afternoon,

Here is my Laundry list for today:

My saved sheet does not save all of my criteria selections in build route.  When I re-open, I have to select the day of week mask filtering and report changes again.  It is defaulted to checked in the new sheet, but erases upon saving and reopening.
Fixed - Saved sheet will save all the selection criteria.

I also do not see where to find the changes to existing deals that I want to see reported.  How do I get to those?  In the original build route, it was a second tab in the excel sheet.  
You can see deal changes in Log tab, next to Route Data tab.

Routing does not show an OK on rows with the sched term of ""BOM"", but it does route them.
The workspace error log gave the following error on these rows of ""No Supply Data available for Term Routing.  Just have BOM equal Day in the logic of routing.


The workspace error log does not pop to the front of all active applications, nor does it have a space on the tool bar.  I thought the sheet was frozen again, and started minimizing applications until it suddenly popped up. Just clicking on the PSW does not bring the workspace error log to the front.



One problem with many other problems imbedded in it.

The Global ID column needs to be able to hold up to 30 characters, I had numerous rows with the notation ""IDACCISO0010 and SRP_WESC101P_CISO"" . 
Increased the Column Size to 50 in Stage, Will do the same changes in Production as soon as Production Freez ends.
 
This gave me an error ""General SQL error. ORA_01401: inserted value too large for column, but error check did not say anything. When I changed the cells and re-saved, I got the same message again, as if the rows are permanently embedded with these values.   I had to delete the rows and re-paste them in from the sheet to get them to work.  This would have been problematic had I not had my working sheet in Excel.

The rows that had this notation were not sent to Path Confirmation, but were changed from X to R in the PSW.
These are routed but, path is not confirmed. 


Please call me if these explanations do not make sense, I will be happy to explain myself further.

Thanks,

While Confirming the Paths Ignoes Supply Price and Market Price columns if there is no value in S PRICE & M PRICE Columns. In this case this price is stored as 0
Shows Counterpary Short Codes and Aliases for Active Counterparties only

Will,
I ran another quick test this morning (spanning 0730 to 1015 due to other events) for June 22.  The paths routed correctly and information went to the Confirmation area properly.  

Even though I had ""East Power"" checked in the confirmation area, all of the ""West"" paths also showed up too.
The only error message I got involved not being able to route transmission deals.

I will do a more extensive study this afternoon.

John-
For the testing of these deals as part of the Doorstep review, we will need the following from Risk Mgmt:
Deal ticket (system generated is fine)
Curve that deal was marked against (we can validate curves on day deals were booked to appropriate pricing index)
For open deals, we would like to test the current MTM value:  We will want to trace position / value to DPR .

Once we review the deals (via deal tickets) we can then get the additional info from the varying groups: 
Credit watch list for the day deals were booked (to verify that CP's are not on list) - Tracy?
Confirmation / Signed contract (on originated deals) - Joe Hunter
For liquidated deals (physical) - we would need to get scheduling support (verify transportation rates, nominations confirmations, invoice support, etc) - Murray, Cara?
Settlement of deal - I can contact Leslie Reeves group for support on this to verify through to G/L and cash apps. - Kim

Thanks,
Michelle

Those look fine to me, we also have one acronym conflict

Constellation Power is CPS  but so is City Public Service of San Antonio.

Can we keep Constellation as CPS and change the other to CPSSA or something?

Cara,

I can't get into Lotus Notes. However, looking at the scheduling file we quit entering Services schedules in the Lotus notes files early Jan. 2001 when the CALPX went away and we started doing unit contingent deals instead of Firm.

All deals are entered under the Services book and all went physical.

I'll be out next week on vacation.

The CARP IT people : hmmmm I don't know if they exist  - I got a kick out of that one!

Yes I do have a call into IT - they are working on a solution for CARP.
In the meantime when dealing with a Monthly Demand Charge - make sure only one strip contains the Demand Charge.
The reason we had the problem with April is because the system automatically created the 3 strips due to the time change.
So to avoid any problems until this has been fixed - if you have a deal with multiple strips - and have a Monthly Demand Charge / MW,
make sure only one strip has the Demand Charge Price entered.

I will keep you updated on this issue.
Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Subject:	DPR on your PMA's

Mark, Tom, and Holden,

In reference to the DPR impacts of $ 132,000 (WAPA) and $133,000 (SRP) that you were expecting, here is an explanation of why you will not be seeing that in your PMA's:

The 2 deals listed below were put in as a MW month, each with 3 strips in the deal separating out April 1, April 2, and the rest of the month.  The reason for the 3 strips was to catch the April 1 time change from PST to PDT.  

deal #  539126: 3 strips @ 2216 = 199,500 charge for the month in CARP (true value is - $66,500).
deal #  538832: 3 strips @ 2180 = 196,200 charge for the month in CARP (true value is - $65,400) .


Typically, I provide you with a report that tells you what $ amount to look for coming thru in your PMA's, according to the changes that I am making on the back end.  You then see the change in DPR come thru on a PMA report that Risk provides for you.  

When these deals hit Settlements, we recognized that the CARP was calculating both deals at 3 times their monthly value (and since we are purchasing, that is a negative three times against your books).  When the above + DPR impacts didn't come thru in your PMA's, we started looking at the deals to figure out why they didn't.


Here is a discription of the Risk - Settlements process:
Risk values a deal on the day of liquidation.  Any intra-month changes, even if they happen after the day of flow, get trued up by Risk and changed in the DPR.  Anything that gets changed after the end of the month, Settlements recognizes as a DPR variance and reports this to Risk and you see it affect your DPR as reported in the PMA report.

So the question was: When it came to recognizing a variance in Settlements, why weren't we seeing a + amount back to your books for 2 of the strips that I zero'd out? 

Houston Settlements looked into it and were seeing that these deals were originally valued at ($66,500) and ($65,400), even though CARP was showing that they were calculating at ($199,500) and ($196,200) ....

Heather Dunton and I did alot of searching for the answer and we found that:  When Risk flashed these deals in April, they flashed them according to a single MW month charge.  Regardless of how many strips there are, the deal is set up as a MW month and should, therefore, calculate as one single charge for the month. 

We found that CARP is reading these incorrectly and causing the confusion, (as I was seeing that the deals were calculating 3 times because that is how CARP and UNIFY were reading the deal). 

 The IT people in Houston are now working on fixing that glitch.

When it comes to DPR, your book originally recognized an impact of (66,500) and (65,400), which is correct.  Since your April DPR was correct, you will not see an adjustment in your PMA's.  

I recognize that this is not gratification for the + DPR impact that you were expecting and I apologize for the confusion and mis-information that I gave you in my report.  This has, however, helped us to hi-light a technical error that will save us alot of work in the future. 

Thanks for your patience while we figured this out.
Let me know if you have any questions.

 Thanks,

 Virginia

Amy -

That's the best news I've heard all day! Looks like we're getting this checkout process down to a science. As far as the new scheduling fee, I'm being told that we're still negotiating a way to enter this into Enpower. I'll let you know once I've talked with Cara and Greg to determine whether or not it will be a price adjustment per MW on each deal or a lump sum annuity each month. In the meantime, just let me know when you have more information on the buy-resale prices - I think I have an answer for you.

Thanks,

July for a scheduling fee of 25 cents per MWH associated with our
preschedules that Portland puts together for us.  This will continue from

Where will I see this?  I need it to be entered into EnPower in order to bill them  - also, will this be captured in the model?

Let me know - that is the only question I have for July - Except: the BR in the model is different fromt he BR prices in EnPower.  I am trying to figuire where they are off.  Once I do, that will be the only change (besides this annuity) that I will need you to make -THE RECONCILIATION THIS MONTH WAS GREAT!!!!!!  Thanks so much for your attention! - Amy

Hi Kathy,

I spoke with Greg Wolfe who is putting the final touches on the contract
ammendment, and the billing in his stuff looks a little different than
what we have discussed.

He is showing that when we transact directly with you,  we adjust the
price to fold the .25 charge into the deal.  This will have the effect
of lowering the monthly charge for the ""Schedule Bill"", and may help you
all with the PUC side of this service. This adjustment would also be
done on any deals that we enter into our system on your behalf. The
charge would not show up on the sheet, we can modify the formulas to
make sure that only the direct bill stuff gets charged there.

Is this going to work for you?

I explained that I billed July separately for everything, and do not
want to adjust all the July deals to do this, and he was OK with that.

Please call or e-me with your comments on this, I want to get things
flowing smoothly just as fast as we can.

Thanks!

Cara

I have not been notified there was a programming change.
We were concerned due to the April Time change how it created 3 strips to not include HE3; the 3
strips had the demand charge on each strip - 
Risk calculated this as the correct demand charge of 1330 * 50mw.
I wanted to verify with IT the way April would calculate - and their response was below.

Below confirms that the transmission deals in April did calculate the correct

Heather,

This particular Transmission deal is basically 1 strip of a 1 month long deal.
It has been broken into 3 strips because of the daylight savings in April.
The demand Charge Frequency is MW per Month -- That means that Demand Charge Price (1,330) will be applied only once for the entire time of flow (4/1 to 4/30)
The Demand Charge Volume is 50.

The Demand Charge Price (1,330) will be applied to the Demand Charge Volume (50).
So the final Demand Charge will be:
	1330 * 50 = 66,500

Will I don't know if you are the person to ask - but I thought I would start with you.
I have a Transmission deal 539126 which was entered w/ a Demand Charge.
Frequency: MW Month
Demand Charge: 1330

The deal was for April 1-30.
Since the Strip was for April under PPT Enpower created 3 strips 
1) 4/1/01 - 4/1/01 HE1-2  50mw  Demand Charge: 1330
2) 4/1/01 - 4/1/01 HE4-24  50mw  Demand Charge: 1330
3) 4/2/01 - 4/30/01 HE1-24  50mw  Demand Charge: 1330


Everyone was worried that this would take the 3 strips and calculate the demand charge for each strip.
It appears this did just calculate one strip: so 1330 * 50 = 66,500
It was assumed this deal was going to calculate (1330 * 50) * 3strips = 199,500


Will what are your thoughts on how the monthly demand charge would calculate.
Do you think it will just take the mw value of one of the strips and calculate the monthly demand charge?

Thanks for your help on this,

Steve/Christian:

Attached is a the commercial person's attempt at an amendment to our El Paso Services Agreement. From a legal perspective there may be a desire to make this a more legally palatable document. My advice is not to begin such an effort in futility and leave this about as plain and simple as it is. Now, therefore, taking into account the preceding sentence, can legal provide an Amendment that provides for the commercial terms and conditions in the attached?

Thanks

Schedulers,

There have been a few instances where it seems that there is some confusion as to who is responsible for what on the Services Desk.  So, I just wanted to make everyone aware of the break-down of responsibilities on the Services Desk.  Myself and Chris Foster schedule all the California generators, Les schedules for all other generators outside of California.  

There is one exception, I schedule for Valley Electric, who is outside of California.  If Les is absent one day, I will step in and schedule all his generators outside of California.

I hope this helps clear things up.  If you have any questions please let me know.

Thanks,
Stan "

First I hope that I have everyone's correct E-mail. I guess time will tell on that.

Second I want to thank all of you for participating in the SO Training Workshop in Phoenix. Your input to date will help NERC define its role in training, and we hope improve on the training that is currently available to system operators, schedulers, marketers, and planners.

As promised attached are the flip chart notes from the workshop for you to look at and hopeful you will add more comments. I know that some attendees refrained from speaking out so here is your chance. Also I have included the complied results of the questionnaire that you filled out in class. I included this so you can see what others felt of the workshop and of the effort that NERC is undertaking in regards to the future of training. Maybe these notes will stimulate further thoughts and ideas. These are unedited versions.

I intentionally did not want to present some formal recommendation or program at this workshop because NERC (not just me) felt that it was important to get your opinions before drafting any program. This workshop will become the basis of what NERC will be doing in the future. Training is important, that was oblivious from some of our discussions. Through your input I can start to draft an outline of what NERC's role will be, what training is needed, and who needs the training. I can see now that there are varying levels of training that will be required. Some wish simple overviews, others want details and structure. 

What is the next step? Each of you should review these documents and make comments, add other ideas that maybe you did not think of at the workshop. Talk about this with your fellow coworkers, seek their opinions and then send those comments back to me. I will then add any additional comments I receive to the flip chart document and try to define some of those thoughts and return them to each of you. After that I will start to draft a plan and/or program that will be posted for public comments. After public comments are received and reviewed, a second draft will be written and posted. This final draft may require approval (From the OC or BOT) before NERC rolls out any program.

Timeline:

Attached is the latest draft of the Portland Doorstep review.  The only open item is observation # 5 concerning the I/T system build for a scheduling system and the fact that the server would reside in Houston (and thus, potential exposure if link between Houston and Portland fails).  Tim Belden requested that I put your names as owners.  Therefore, I need for you all to give me a target date and we can revise or discuss the Action Step if you want.  I would like to turn in the final draft tomorrow if possible.
Thanks,
Michelle

Mark,

Can you re-clarify the policy for using the 3-4 character acronyms again.  There are assumptions being made that tags will be denied, starting Oct. 1,  if you don't use the new 3-4 character POR/POD list even if its prior to the implementation of spec 1.7.  References are being made to your clarification e-mail.  But I don't read anything that states tags will be denied.

Thanks,

Cara,

I have a dispute  from Pinnacle West for Sept 12 at $40.  I've checked the sheets and the deal is in the sheet, but there is no deal number.  This leads me to believe that there isn't a deal in Enpower.  The deal is PV HV and Staci remembers the problem.    

Let me know when we can talk about this

Hi,

I am sitting here at my desk talking contracts and energy, and in my
head I am thinking about kisses, caresses, and waking up with you. 
You make me feel so special, and beautiful, and cherished. I would
really like to play hooky all during your shutdown and just be with you.


I want to have a completely lazy day, just vegging, reading, snacking,
keeping my feet warm, petting cats, watching movies, and snuggling by my
fireplace. How does Christmas Eve sound? Do you have plans?


Bye my special one,

Friends and Co-Workers:

You are hereby cordially invited to a pre-holiday office lunch this Thursday at approximately 11:30 a.m, courtesy of the Trading Attorneys.

LEGAL NOTICE:  Christian Yoder and Steve Hall (hereinafter ""we"" or ""our"" or ""us"" ) intend to pay for the food (which will probably, but not necessarily, be pizza and salad) with post-petition Chapter 11 salary dollars that have already cleared our respective individual bank accounts and, therefore, by joining us in the meal (""Lunch"") you will not be exposed to any retroactive claw-back risk by way of the Cash Account Committee.  We are also investigating the possibility of providing a limited quantity of a certain kind of beverage (""Beer"") under a provisional waiver of the defunct pre-petition Company's drinking policies, subject to approval by the Estate's Liquor Control Board which is being sought on an expedited basis.       

We feel like making this modest holiday gesture for several reasons: 

1.  It has been a pleasure working with you all during the past year.
2.  We are optimistic about this office's prospects in the upcoming year.
3.  American Express forgot to cancel our Corporate Cards.

We hope you will join us for a free lunch as we look forward to a prosperous New Year.

Hi Sweetie,
 
I am doing fine, things are still wierd, but Dave has gone to stay with his parents and only comes to town to deal with his vending machines.  I went to the law store and got all the documents, but I find them very intimidating. I think I would rather pay the single fee to the lawyer so that I know it is all done right. I would like your advice on this matter.
 
I have been going to parties and movies and such,  having fun.  I have been on a date, and am currently enjoying the company of a man named Craig. He is a very sweet man, and we have just clicked.
 
Talk to you later, have a good long weekend off. I have a new cell phone number 810-1105

Hi There,

What a great e-mail!  I got a warm glow and a great laugh all rolled into one.  I am keeping that one in my palm pilot so I can read it anywhere I want.

I woke up thinking about you, took my bubble bath and looked at my pink toenails thinking about you, put on my lotion thinking about you, drove to work singing along with the radio to Steely Dan thinking about you, and am just about useless at my desk thinking about you.

I really enjoyed just vegging last night.  You have a good day too cutie pie.

Should we go ahead and separate our names on the credit cards?  I think it would be wise.

Also, If you want to transfer Pahio to our joint account that is fine,  I would like to have Pahio.

When you come up, if you want to come to work here and get the car and give me the truck keys, we can do that.  Just let me know.

Thanks,

Dear Mom,

I just want you to know that I love you VERY much.  You still mean as much to me now as ever. I am your family whether I am married to Dave or not.  You are an example of kindness and giving, and one of the most special women on the planet as far as I am concerned.

I have been kind of keeping quiet because I know how much Dave needs you right now, and I don't want to say anything that would diminish him in your eyes. Part of the reason that I waited as long as I did to do this is that I desperately wanted one last family Thanksgiving where nobody has to choose who can come or feel strange or anything. 

Dave has decided to stay with Bob and Sandi, and just come up to deal with the vending machines.  I am glad, things are very tense and weird.  I just want to get everything settled. He seems like he is getting angry, and I don't like that.  He told me he wants me to keep the truck instead of the car because everytime he looks at the truck he feels like it is a betrayal. I got him this truck to help him with his business. Wanna buy a brand new truck?

Anyway,  it will all work out and we will all get thru this .  I have a new cell phone number, please feel free to call me, and I will probably call you tonight just to touch base and let you know I love you.

503/810-1105


Love,

Hello all!

First, thank you for your generosity this holiday season, especially during this difficult time. Your gifts and donations will help bring holiday cheer into the lives of our three adopted families.

If you have chosen a gift tag from the tree: 
Please make sure your gift is clearly labeled with the recipient's name and a description of the gift. (We want to insure that all of the children have received gifts.) 
We ask that all gifts be wrapped and under the tree by Tuesday, December 18th. 
Also, if you have not already dropped the half of the gift tag into the red/gold box by the tree, please do so. This will not only allow us to keep track of who is purchasing what and for whom, but it will also enter your name into the drawing for Blazer tickets.

Once again, we appreciate your participation in our Enron Elves Event. If you have any questions or suggestions about ways we can help make our adopted families' holiday even more jolly, please let us know.

Happy Holidays!

I am so glad you got internet service at home!  Earthlink is good.

Have a wonderful time in Florida, I liked it bunches when I went.  Things are strange here, Dave is still very upset but is starting to trend toward anger now. He wants me to take the truck because he sees it as a betrayal that I got it for him a couple of months ago.  OK. I have a truck now and he has the car.  Wanna buy a truck?  He is also not wanting to be at home, which is fine with me. It is so tense and weird right now that I am glad to have the house to myself.  I don't really want to be there either.

I have been keeping busy with friends, they have been so good to me during this. I went to a Seattle Seahawks game yesterday at the University Stadium, and thought about those trips up there to sit with you all during Scotty's surgeries. Seattle was nice, but it was a long day and horrbile horrible rain. Our seats were in the upper stadium away from the wind so we were dry. I have a movie Tomorrow and a party Wednesday. Tonight is just being home catching up on my laundry and my sleep.

I love you very much! Thanks for keeping me in your heart.

I had to put all my OATI files in a secure non-UBS place, but it is 600 per month for up to 15 users, and 100 a month flat fee for faxing.

They are going to raise the rate to 750 per month to pay for the e-tag 1.7 upgrades.

My contact at OATI is Frank.Billington@oatiinc.com

or  kevin.burns@oatiinc.com

ENSE, MDEA and East Power was $5425 for last month.  I'm trying to reduce the number of users and services that we don't require.  In the end the cost should be significantly less than this number.

The west has their own arrangements with OATI.  

You will not require anything for the change over to etag 1.7 in march as OATI will take care of this as part of their services.

Kevin Burns from OATI will be in Houston on Feb 13th from 1-3 to discuss UBS services required and I would recommend that you have some one sit down and review the services that you will need going foreward.

Hope this helps. 

For passwords you can contact Don for MDEA & EPMIEA and Eric has the Genco ones.

Thanks.

I have asked OATI to reduce the number of accounts from 40 to 10 to reduce the costs for the estate.  Therefore I recommend we go down to the following accounts Enron01-10.

Please see the attached spreadsheet,   


I have added leg 2 to both annuities in red.  I looked at the spreadsheet that Diana forwarded me, and probably need for you and I to sit down and just walk me thru it.

Hi Mom,

I am amazed at those bear photos.  The entire office (what's left anyway) was around my desk looking at that.  That guy must have filled his drawers!

How is Natalie doing?  What shot do they think she reacted to?  I can't imagine how frightening that must have been for Monty and Jackie and the whole family.

Dave is staying at Bob and Sandi's for the weekend, I asked him to go or let me know if he wanted to stay and I would go somewhere. I need some space and he is still so upset that my presence is not helping. It would be easier on him if I just moved out now.  I can't because he can't afford to live in the house without me, and he can't leave because you can't get an apartment in this town without a job. We will be putting the house on the market no later than the first week of January.


I love you, thank you for your love and support for both of us during this very difficult time.

Hi Sweeties!

You are in my heart today, how goes the fight?

Dave has gone to his parents for the weekend to give me some space, and I am really liking being alone.

I love you and hope you all are well.

Dear Little Sister,

Thank you so much for you love and support during this difficult time.  I wish that I could make this easier on everyone, but this is what has to be done.  I have no intention of separating from you or the Rich/McPhersons, you all are more than family to me.  You will always be my little sister. I am going to work very hard to come through this with Dave and me as much friends as possible, so that the stress to us all will be minimized.  I see no reason to hurt people over what amounts to belongings.

I am glad you liked your gifts, you did save at least one to open on Christmas day, right?  I hope so.

I have the house to myself this weekend, Dave is at your folks to give us a little space.  He is still very upset, and I feel bad that I have made him so sad. I really didn't think he would be this upset. I am glad that the family is rallying support for him, and I have been kind of laying low with the family so that he can have that support. He has no real friends here, and that is a big problem.

I love you,

Cara

Victims and Champions of a Darwinian Enron
By DAVID BARBOZA
OUSTON, Dec. 7 - After an accounting scandal, a bankruptcy filing and mass layoffs, Enron (news/quote) has gone from model of management vision to case study for management obfuscation. Only one group of true believers remains: the people who worked there and just got burned there.

They may be in a minority. After all, 5,600 people have been thrown out of work in the midst of a recession. Most employees lost a huge part of their retirement savings as the value of their Enron stock evaporated. Many are furious at what they view as bungling or worse by top management.

Even so, a surprising number of former employees lament the end of an entrepreneurial culture that more closely resembled a start-up than a Fortune 100 behemoth. That culture encouraged creativity and rewarded new ideas that worked, they say, even though its dark side, an almost manic drive to experiment with new methods and conquer new markets, resulted in its downfall. Where, they wonder, can they go from here?

""Innovative is a clich?, but that's what Enron was,"" Brandon Rigney, who operated the company's Web site, said on Thursday. ""This is four days gone from the place, and I'm already in withdrawal.""

Enron, which began as a gas pipeline company and transformed itself into the world's largest energy trader in the 1990's, created an associate analysts program modeled after Wall Street investment banks. Each year, it tapped 450 college graduates, half of them M.B.A.'s, to spend three years in rotating jobs at all parts of its empire.

It also gave workers opportunities to start new business units. The company's energy trading platform, Enron Online, was created a few years ago by a 29-year-old gas trader. It quickly became one of the most profitable divisions.

In recent years, the company came to be dominated by young people like Jeff Shankman, a Wharton School graduate who joined the company at 24. By age 34, he had become president and chief operating officer of Enron Global Markets.

Mr. Shankman, who has just left the company, said Enron was special because it ""didn't have a corporate hierarchy to encumber creativity.""

Management experts like Gary Hamel praised Enron for breaking with convention and turning regular employees like the 29-year-old gas trader into corporate entrepreneurs. And Fortune magazine named it America's most innovative company for six consecutive years. The corporate makeover was largely the work of Jeffrey K. Skilling, who resigned as chief executive in August only six months after being promoted to the job.

Under Mr. Skilling, a former McKinsey & Company consultant, the company tested new strategies, like structuring its corporate culture to mimic the marketplace.

""You could come up with an idea and get people excited,"" said Janel Guerrero, 33, who worked in Enron's government affairs department, noting that a friend in the broadband unit went to top executives with an idea and Enron started moving on it quickly.

""You didn't ponder; it was about acting very quickly and it was about being a first mover,"" she added. 

Enron rapidly created ventures to trade everything from energy, paper, pulp and lumber to broadband and advertising. But quickness sometimes exacts a price. Some ventures went broke, like Azurix (news/quote), its spinoff water company. The broadband unit lost about $1 billion.

""When top management got into broadband, metal, steel, pulp, we thought it was innovative,"" Mr. Rigney said. ""When people said, `We'll trade water and waste water - that's the future,' we said, `That's cool.' I didn't hear dissent in the ranks. But I drank the Kool-Aid with everyone else, even though it made my head throb.""

Indeed, the expansion into new areas drained the profits of the successful energy trading operations, critics say. Undone by shaky accounting and too much borrowed money, the company collapsed last month. But even near the end, it was buzzing with new ventures.

""I just got here five months ago,"" said Fred Radvansky, 38, who was attending a Houston job fair. ""I was part of a group of about 70 people. We were rolling out a new Enron model. We were going to start trading freight.""

If inventiveness flourished at Enron, the freewheeling environment there also encouraged other and less agreeable impulses: cutthroat competition and management arrogance.

""It was kind of like a dot-com phenomenon,"" said Harvey J. Padewer, president of energy services at Duke Energy (news/quote), a big utility. ""They created a kill-and-eat culture.""

Mr. Rigney, the former Web site operator, remembers it well. ""People tried to take work away from you,"" he said. ""There was a Darwinism for ideas, for projects.""

That undermined the company's health, critics say. For example, it is widely believed that compensation for the people who negotiated deals with other companies was based on the size of the transactions rather than their long-term effect on the bottom line.

Annual reviews aimed at weeding out the least productive 5 to 10 percent of the work force damaged morale, and some longtime employees felt unwanted. ""There were all these M.B.A.'s coming in and they were evaluating things differently,"" said Becky Cantrell, who worked on regulatory matters. ""I was one of the oldest people at 55. When I saw someone my age it was a relief.""

For all the doubts some employees harbored, others reveled in the derring-do atmosphere even after Enron's financial fall, and cringed at the prospect of being acquired by Dynegy Inc. (news/quote), a stodgy Houston electric utility.

""They bragged about being a meat-and-potatoes company with people who went to the University of Nebraska,"" one former Enron employee said. ""We had all these hyperactive Harvard and Stanford types. It would have never worked.""

After the merger fell apart, Enron filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2 and laid off about 4,000 employees in Houston. Over the next few days, television crews filmed weeping employees streaming out of the headquarters and carrying boxes of personal belongings, even as construction workers put finishing touches on Enron's shimmering new 40-story headquarters office tower. Some got word of their dismissal via voice mail. Others are still packing up and wondering.

""I don't think Enron will ever be recreated,"" Mr. Shankman said on Thursday, sitting on a nearly empty trading floor that was built for 500 people at Enron. ""Maybe we got into some businesses too quickly and too early.""

Enron officials and management experts insist it was not the corporate culture that brought Enron down; it was accounting mistakes or the ballooning debt of hard assets, like projects in Brazil and India.

Those facts may now be plumbed by business school case studies. In the meantime, some former employees have created Enron alumni Web sites. Others are writing letters to The Houston Chronicle about how, for a brief time, they thought they were part of something special.

""Enron was what I thought epitomized a global `American Dream' of sorts,"" wrote Kathy Walthall, a former Enron contractor. ""By far the best days of my career were as a consultant for Enron. The environment was an extreme rush. Very busy, very progressive and innovative.""

But Ms. Walthall said she was also outraged at the board for allowing the company to fall so swiftly.

""I really hope the company turns around,"" she wrote. ""But I know it will never be the same.""

I spoke with Julie and asked her again as well....my only concern with UBS is that they are swamped at the moment, and these requests usually take a day or two to turnaround (I have put the request to UBS as well - so lets see who does it first!).

Let me know if you get it from Julie or if I receive from UBS first, will give you a call to fax.

Good morning Cara!  Hope that you had a good weekend - when do you move into the new condo?

1.  UBS payrolls are the same as Enron (isn't that nice - no change there)!

2.  Julie Kearney should have a copy (I know she was keeping copies in case something happened to the fed ex packages).  Let me know if she doesn't have for some reason.

Have a great day!

Good Morning Darling,

Do you know when the UBS paydays are?  We are just trying to figure out what to expect.

Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my new condo want it.  If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wait by the fax for it, I would be grateful.

Thanks,

Hi Frank,

Thanks for taking care of the password changes for our real time group.  

Things are still very up in the air here. We hear new developments nearly on a daily basis, and so much remains unknown. I am in kind of a wait and see mode.

Hi Mom,

Things are a little better here for me, Friday was a horrible day, we had layoffs of about 30% of our office.  Lots of crying and sadness on the floor.   The weekend was strange, Dave came back from Eugene un announced which was not what we agreed to, and I got the feeling that he was thinking he was going to 'catch' me doing something or having someone over.  He is still really struggling with the idea that I just can't love him like a wife anymore, and that is not enough to keep two people together.  I wish that I could make this easier on him, and I almost think that if I had been unfaithful it would be easier for him to accept.

I am just trying to hold on until he gets some kind of income so that we can sell the house and pay our debt. I do not have any desire for him to be forced to live with his parents, I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Just pray for him and for me.

School sounds wonderful, I am so glad you are happy dealing with your little ones. How fun!  

I love you!

AT&T may begin suspension of some Enron Corporate cell phone accounts beginning Friday, 12/7.  All remaining Portland cell phone accounts will be terminated no later than 12/11.  

Individual cell phone users may keep their phone and phone number by accepting financial responsibility for the account going forward.  You may convert your phone to a personal account and request the same phone number or request a new one.  Susan Nothnagel, AT&T Representative, will be here on Friday, 12/7, 1:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m. to answer any questions and switch your cell phone to a personal account upon request.  If Friday is not convenient Susan will stop by next week as needed.  AT&T will waive the activation fee to change the account.

Management approved cell phones are eligible for expense reimbursement, based on business need.  Please see your manager regarding cell phone reimbursement.

Good morning Cara!  Hope that you had a good weekend - when do you move into the new condo?

1.  UBS payrolls are the same as Enron (isn't that nice - no change there)!

2.  Julie Kearney should have a copy (I know she was keeping copies in case something happened to the fed ex packages).  Let me know if she doesn't have for some reason.

Have a great day!

Good Morning Darling,

Do you know when the UBS paydays are?  We are just trying to figure out what to expect.

Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my new condo want it.  If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wait by the fax for it, I would be grateful.

Thanks,

Cara Freeland! ;)"

Cara

I wanted to let you know you have read-only access to the CWI for viewing
your lossess, ancillary services and transmission information.  However,
when you log in now, you will need to use your current user id but your
password has been reset to default.  Type in default as your password and
then you will be prompted to enter a new password.  After you do this, you
will then have read-only capability.  If you have any questions, please let
me know.  I'm at 360.418.2009


Les

You also will have read-only access now but you will not be prompted to
change your password.  We did the change under a blanket authority so it
only requires Cara to change hers.  You should be able to continue to use
your current user id and password and be fine.  If you have any questions,
please let me know.  

Thank you,

Tara Exe

Hi Mom,

I am still here, there is so little work that pretty much all I do is talk to people, play computer games and read e-mail.  I still can't believe that this has all happened.  

Dave is doing better, he is calmer now and less upset. I am glad to see that, I felt really bad for how upset he was.
He is going to go stay with his folks for a few days, they had their insurance company call and tell them that if they didn't clean up the outside of the house that they would drop them from insurance. They had a gardener come out, but Dave is going to take the pressure washer down and wash the house. I personally think they need to move to a retirement apartment with some living assistance. They do not seem to have the ability to take care of anything anymore.

Work is winding down, folks are bored and working on resumes and stuff.  

I love you,

Cara"

Hi Sweetie,
 
I still can't believe all of this, we are laying off people here left and right, our traders are trying to call in favors to find jobs for as many people as possible.
 
We are still trying to deliver on contracts, and not all of our counterparties have cut us off.  I can't imagine for the life of me why anyone would continue to do business with us!
 
I love you, and Pat and Riley

Understanding Enron
FEUDALISM: You have two cows. Your lord takes some of the milk.
FASCISM: You have two cows. The government takes both, hires you to take care of them and sells you the milk.
PURE COMMUNISM: You have two cows. Your neighbours help take care of them and you all share the milk.
APPLIED COMMUNISM: You have two cows. You must take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.
TOTALITARIANISM: You have two cows. The government takes them both and denies they ever existed. Milk is banned.
MEXICAN DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. The government takes both and drafts you into the army.
EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking apply. If there aren't any, they invent some. They pay you not to milk the cows. They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down the drain. They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.
CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd multiplies and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the income.
ENRON VENTURE CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company. The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.

Good Morning,

I never got a copy of my UBS agreement, and Amy said you have been keeping them in case something happened to the FED-EX packages?

I can run up and grab it anytime.

Thanks,

Cara Freeland!  :)"

Thank you for your kind words.
 
This is the hardest decision and the most painful one I have ever had to make.  Dave needs his family so much right now, as he has very few friends. Please call him often and if you can invite him down for a visit please do that.
 
I am confident that if we are calm and peaceful through this process we can emerge on the other side as friends. 
 
I promise to do everything in my power to be kind generous and calm.
 
Love,
 
C

I called 1-800-297-3276 and navigated thru the automated menu.

Someone came on line and helped me, the confirmed my point balance and and asked me what I wanted to get.  I told them and they did it on the spot.

They also referred me to this website

www.americanexpress.com/rewards

I am not suggesting a course of action, but rather relaying my experience

Good morning Cara!  Hope that you had a good weekend - when do you move into the new condo?

1.  UBS payrolls are the same as Enron (isn't that nice - no change there)!

2.  Julie Kearney should have a copy (I know she was keeping copies in case something happened to the fed ex packages).  Let me know if she doesn't have for some reason.

Have a great day!

Good Morning Darling,

Do you know when the UBS paydays are?  We are just trying to figure out what to expect.

Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my new condo want it.  If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wait by the fax for it, I would be grateful.

Thanks,

BuildRoute report is ready for testing now.  Please see version 3.2.3.10 in enpower stage environment.  Two optional check boxes are created as requested: ""exclude DART"" and ""include DART only"".  Let me know if it works to your expectation.

Good morning!
BuildRoute Version 3.2.3.10 is ready for testing.  
I will try to help if you have any questions, but you will be better off calling Nikolay (713-345-7265) with any questions about this.  Please see Bill's email for all the details I know.
Thanks so much for your help.  Sorry I am not more so.

QA's:

	BuildRoute has been modified to allow the exclusion of DART deals.  Since they are waiting on it, it is difficult to test and Nik has done quite a bit of testing anyway, we promoted it to Stage.  Please contact Fran Chang about testing.  If it goes OK and she wants to, we can put it in as a production break fix.

Hi Cara,

I hope things are going well for you today and that you had an enjoyable
Thanksgiving.

I just wanted to follow up with you regarding your order.  I know you wanted
the basket with the lightbulb, but I wanted to know if there was anything in
particular that you wanted added or deleted from the basket.

Also, I am needing to know when you would like me to deliver these.  You can
email me addresses and the message for the cards.

Thank you for your order.
I hope you have wonderful Holidays.

Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my new condo want it.  If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wait by the fax for it, I would be grateful.

Donald was trying to sort by POR AND POD,  Donald gets a repeating error of ""invalid variant type conversion"".

I tried to do that and no problem, but I am using the app locally, and Donald for some reason still has to go thru the windows 2000 terminal server.  I really want him to be able to use the app locally like it was designed to be used.

Cara,
Did the error take place again, or did it just happen the one time.  If it
just happened the 1 time, everything is ok, the server that you were on just
restarted that piece of code.  If it is continually happening, please let me
know right away.  From the logs that I was able to look at, everything
looked fine so I think the server just restarted that piece of code.  Please
let me know if it keeps happening.

Is it possible that if the ""Get Now"" button is pressed twice BEFORE results are given that this is done?


It might help to grey out the GET Now button when it is pressed, and have it re-light when the New Data button has been pressed?

Please see the attached email below for what IT is planning to modify Build Routing report to accomodate and differentiate DART products.  From what we've discussed, you would like to have the default as with the ""exclude DART deals"" checked, right?  Also, did you also say you want IT to create another function for this report to run DART deals only (so the report will only show DART products) so real time schedulers can run it to see what he/she needs to pick up?

Fran,

We worked on excluding the DART deals from the BuildRoute report.
The report will look like that:
 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 
If you have the ""Exclude DART deals"" box unchecked then you will get a file like this:
 << File: BRtestP1_3Deals_Nov26.xls >> 
Deal 500056.1 is a DART deal.

If you have ""Exclude DART deals"" box checked then you will get a file like this:
 << File: BRtestP2_3Deals_Nov26.xls >> 

Please let me know if that's what you need to see.
I can send you similar files that show more then 3 deals.

Thanks!
Nikolay

	The change would not take long provided if we could easily identify DART deals.  At this point we will have to research identifying DART deals.  We don't know the answer yet.  There is a higher priority project (secondary legal entities) which we hope to complete next week.  We'll schedule this change after that.

Subject:	RE: Important! DART product

I think that if the Enpower guys can modify the Build Route Reports to have a check box that says Exclude DART deals, and have it default to the checked position.

That should take care of it.

 (Both versions of build route, Will Smith will know what I am talking about).

Sean:

Torrey Moorer in EOL IT group has created the Mid-C DART product on EOL.  In the future when a trade is done on EOL, it will be bridged into Enpower Deal Entry. However, although the ""DART flag"" will be on in deal entry, I believe for now it's informational only, and it's not doing anything to alert the schedulers.  I would like to know the rationale for creating this DART product and how you would like the schedulers in Day Ahead group (Cara's group) and Real Time (Bill's group) to see in their applications.  If I can get this info from you, I'll work with Enpower IT to put all necessary DART processes in place.  

Thanks,

Hi There,

I love you, I hope you have a good day.  Work is shaping up to be a real snooze-fest. There are only 9 of us on the entire trading floor right now. Normally there used to be about 65-70 of us!

Waking up with you is so nice, I am looking forward to many years of doing just that. I think we are going to settle in just fine together. I love you and enjoy being with you so much. You are the man I have waited all these years for. Thank you for being part of my life.

I will see you this evening, a little dinner, a little laundry action, maybe a little dominoes and sheet-she-me?  Woohoo!

I love you,

We need to be able to rely on the repeated running of the build route. Running a month long sheet from scratch is a huge problem for us, it forces us to do massive amounts of work over and over again.

I need you to find out why this is happening, and let me know when it is fixed.

None of us can get on the main site, and we are using their alternate site.

I had some difficulty making tags, but have finished. The problem I was having today is identical to my problem a few weeks ago where I could make the tag, but then everything would hang when I hit the 'confirm' button.

Subject:	Program Changes


As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Other deals is fine,

Build route has been selecting the hourly deals just fine, and including them in the off peak sections. We must be able to see these deals, as we have a great many deals with odd hours and shaped schedules.

Thanks,

Cara

Subject:	Pre Schdule Work Space - Including Other Deals Section in Build Route


Hi,

We are categorizing the deals in Build Route depending on type of the deal:

If the deal strip is during Peak hours, Build route includes theses deals in On Peak deals section
If the deal strip is during Off-Peak hours, Build route includes these deals in Off-Peak deals section
If the deal strip is for 24 hours, Build route includes these deals in 24Hour Section deals

 We are observing few deals strips only for few hours and not follows any of the above mentioned sections, they are not part of any Peak/OffPeak/24Hour section, and Build route is not selecting these deals.
I am proposing to add one more section called ""Other Deals"" and to include all these deals in this section. 

Please let me know, if you have any questions/suggestions/comments in this regard. 

Thanks,
Vish

Auntie Cara,
 
How are you?  I am doing fine, I guess.  I think I am passing through the shock stage and may be entering the exceptance stage.  I am still so dazed from this whole thing.  I am supposed to go back to work on the 5th and may not be going back at all.  This whole thing is so heartbreaking.  
 
I am attaching my resume just so you have it, if you think of anyone who should see it from you contacts please pass it on.
 
Take care and I will keep you posted.

Alan,

The forwarded message below contains an issue cited by Dick Ingersoll back in June of 1997 in which Control Areas were changing the properties of our submitted schedules/transactions (tags?) and not informing us.  In a subsequent letter in September 2000 Dick had noted an imporvement but with Enron still experiencing some minor problems.

My question(s) to you and the traders/schedulers are, are the problems noted above still occuring, is this still causing us problems and if so are there specific incidents that you can provide to me so I can pass them on to the WSCC?

Please accpet my wishes for a Happy Thanksgiving!

Kind Regards,

Dave

In New Filing, Enron Reports Debt Squeeze
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and FLOYD NORRIS
The Enron Corporation (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=ENE>) told investors yesterday that it faced debt repayments over the next year vastly in excess of its available cash. It said that if any of a number of things went wrong, its ability to continue as a going concern would be called into question.
In a delayed quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said that it would have to repay $690 million in debt by next Tuesday if it did not come up with collateral for a loan. 
Enron has about $1.75 billion in cash and credit lines now available but faces debt repayments and other obligations of $9.15 billion by the end of next year. The report for the third quarter, which was filed five days late, says the company faces immediate demand for $3.9 billion in debts if its credit rating is downgraded any further.
Enron's independent auditors with the firm of Arthur Andersen have not been able to complete their review of Enron's financial statements for the third quarter. Andersen already faces lawsuits over its audits of Enron's books related to Enron's disclosure this month that it had overstated almost $600 million in profits in the last five years. Enron has said that it will restate statements that Andersen certified and that those statements should no longer be relied upon.
Yesterday, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for an investigation into Arthur Andersen's handling of the Enron audits. A spokesman for Andersen could not be reached last night.
Enron, the nation's largest energy trader, has agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc. (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=DYN>), its smaller crosstown rival in Houston, and credit rating agencies have said that a failure of that deal to go through

would lead to a further downgrading of Enron, which is now at the lowest investment-grade rating. Any downgrades could lead to a collapse of Enron's core energy trading business, analysts say, as other energy trading companies might stop doing business with Enron entirely. 
The Dynegy deal is expected to close sometime next year, and the disclosures yesterday indicate that Enron may face challenges in meeting its obligations before then, particularly if the closing of the deal is delayed. Enron said it hoped to complete the transaction by the end of next September.
Enron is in talks to obtain $500 million to $1 billion in additional financing through an equity infusion from major banks and institutions. In addition, executives have said they are hoping to close deals to sell $800 million in assets by the end of the year, and perhaps a few billion dollars of assets next year. Enron is also set to receive a $1 billion infusion from ChevronTexaco, which owns a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, if the deal closes next year.
Still, even after factoring in cash flow from Enron's core energy-trading operations, Enron could be left well short of what it needs to satisfy the huge obligations due by the end of next year - meaning that Enron will probably have to work to persuade bankers to restructure debts or extend maturities.
Carol Coale, an analyst for Prudential Securities in Houston, said the new disclosures indicated that Enron's troubles had run deeper than what investors and analysts believed, even as the stock crashed early this month before the merger with Dynegy was announced.
""Our initial read was that this might have been like a run on the bank,"" Ms. Coale said. ""But now it sounds like Enron's problems were actually more inherent than perceived.""
Enron's deal with Dynegy calls for Enron holders to receive 0.2685 Dynegy share for each Enron share, but in trading since the deal was announced Enron's share price has lagged Dynegy's price, reflecting investor doubts that the deal will be completed at the announced terms.
In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, before the Enron filing was released, Enron rose 6 cents, to $9.06, and Dynegy rose $1.13, to $43.60. At those prices, the value of the Dynegy offer is 29.2 percent above Enron's share price, compared with a 20.6 percent difference when the deal was announced.
Some debts that Enron might have to pay quickly if its bond rating is lowered could be satisfied by selling shares, but such sales would probably reduce the stock price further. And the merger agreement with Dynegy provides that the exchange ratio would be reduced if Enron sold stock at prices below the implied value under the merger - currently $11.71 an Enron share.
In after-hours trading yesterday, after the release of the Enron filing, the share price slipped to $9.
Enron had previously said it was reducing its profits taken in previous years by more than $500 million. Yesterday's filing provided some additional details on Enron's relationships with various related partnerships whose debts Enron could be forced to pay, and it said that additional write-offs could come as early as the current quarter if it concluded that asset values in the partnerships had declined. It said that because Enron's stock value had fallen, one write-down could be $700 million.
The disclosures show that Enron erected complicated financial structures that in some cases seem to have been meant to allow the company to avoid taking losses on assets and in other cases were aimed at keeping debts off its balance sheet.
But the collapse of Enron's stock price has both worsened the situation for some of those entities and greatly increased the cost Enron would face if it needed to pay off the debts. 
""It is not possible to predict,"" Enron warned investors, whether its asset sales or debt refinancings would be successful. ""An adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern.""

We may need more logins if there are multiple people required to schedule.  These logins are to allw the ubs schedulers to continue to perform for us after there login is converted to the ubs system.  I would prefer that they have individual logins so we can audit who did what?

The PSEs in the Physical Path are not populated until the PSEs in the Market
Path are selected.  As promised in training, the PSE's in the Physical Path
will always be a short list derived from the Market Path, saving the person
who is entering the tag from wading through all unnecessary PSE codes, since
no PSE should ever show up in Physical Path who was not part of the
financial chain.

Good Afternoon,

I have attempted several times to make a test tag today, but the drop
down lists for the PSE's in the Physical path area have not been
populated.

I logged off and onto the system several times today to see if that
would help. It didn't.

Time is running very short.  Is your company prepared for Etag 1.7?  These are the minimum REQUIRED steps that must be completed prior to March 6, 2002:

---------------------------

(1)  All entities must update the NERC Registry at http://www.tsin.com.

(1a)  CA's and TP's must designate PORs and PODs that are valid on tags.

(1b)  PSE's must designate associated scheduling PORs and PODs.  See http://www.tsin.com or inquire with NERC for details.

---------------------------

(2)  All OATI Users must have functioning OATI Digital Certificates.

(2a)  Without the certificate you cannot access Etag 1.7 after March 6, 2002 at all.

(2b)  Inquire internally to determine if a supervisor has already contacted us.

(3b)  To begin the process of acquiring OATI Digital Certificates, please complete this document and send it to OATI:

http://www.oaticerts.com/repository/Company_Information.doc

---------------------------

Failure to complete these steps will result in a partial or complete lack of tagging access and capability!

For additional information on these and other critical Etagging issues, please visit OATI's Etag 1.7 Information Page at http://www.oatiinc.com/etag17.

I turned my computer completely off and back on to see if my connection would improve, It didn't.

My plain old data only no macro excel sheet still takes 30 seconds to save.

:(

Outlook also seems slow, but I never liked it anyway. :)

Hi My Man,
 
Yokos! mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm    I went to see Dr. Soot today, she told me my pain is from the 2 big knots where they started and ended the incisions, and it will only hurt for ...oh....3 months or so.  She also said I can do whatever I want, including the gym! Your ASS is MINE!  ;)  She said lifting etc is fine as long as I listen to my pain and lift things slowly. No jerky or quick lifting that could hurt me.
 
I can't wait to have some albacore sashimi and a little Craig on the sheetsheemi!  ;)
 
Love,

I am suprised at how little the bare bones employee and the full package employee trips differ in price!

I wanna do the 19 grand package. Employees and Spouses. Do for us but do the works.

I think it would be a welcome perk in a weary office right now.

Attached is a spreadsheet indicating pricing for a Customer Ski Trip, as well as several pricing options for an In-house trip.   

The dinner priced for the in-house trip would be either a pizza and salad buffet or a Mexican fiesta buffet.  The meal selected for the Customer event is a Western Bar-B-Que.

Mt.Bachelor is debuting a tubing hill this year, and I have requested a group price quote for that activity.  I'll let you all know what I find out, but it sounds like a blast.

If you have any questions, give me a call. (7698).

Hi

Donald is having an access violation when he tries to run the Path Confirmation Report. Vish is aware of this, and wants to do some investigating tomorrow, but I don't know if Donald will have time.  Maybe you can do this with Vish and Donald's Passwords?

Stacy still has performance issues running the report launcher locally.


I am just ducky.

Subject:	Problems with PSW

I found the following problems when using the preschedule workspace.

When I ran the error check for my sheet on the 17th, there were no errors to report.  I proceeded to run the confirmation  and route deals and noticed that on some of the rows my supply mws were not equal to my market mws.  This discrepancy should have been caught by the error check function.   The system allowed me to run my confirm anyway.  

Thanks,
Stacy

The old build route remembered what the user chose last for delivery points, and had it in the defaults each time Build route was opened.

Can this be duplicated in the PSW version of build route?

A Developmentor manager has an introductory VB class locally that he is trying to fill.  I took a COM+/2000 class from them in December, and they are first class.  How many of us would be interested (no commitment at this point)?
 
I believe this is Developmentor's 12/3 one-week course (see  <http://www.develop.com/dm/course.asp?id=10>)  It ordinarily goes for $1800 per person.
 
Mike N, can you give me some guidance regarding how much cost per person or how much cost total you would be prepared to pay.  Again, he is trying to fill up a class that is about to be cancelled, and I think he would be willing to negotiate.
 
Tim, would you or anyone on your floor have any interest in this?
 
Michael

Hi Mom,

I am so glad that Nathan seems to be responding, his well being and future are what is most important. I don't know what to say to the behavior of Beth not taking responsibility for the financial end, and kind of holding you both hostage with this unspoken threat to withold your grandchildren.  I have so little respect for her for treating people this way. If I didn't think she would punish you somehow, I would tell her so.

I am looking forward to seeing you next week!  woohoo!

Luv,

Cara"

MEAD HLH schedule for 5mw has a late downstream change.  Also, see Morgan tag #MS04315.  I could not access the new data base to change the path myself.

PAC(GEN)CH4-APS(T)CH4/WW5#1198(F)-APS(T)WW5/MED5#1197(F)-AZPS(T)MED5/MED2#1210(F)-PACE-EPMI-PNM-PPLE-MORGAN-PINW-APS(T)MD2/WW-PINW

The previous downstream was Morgan wheeling into SP15 from Mead.

Thanks, Donald, presched."

Please copy me on anything that you need to speak to the developers on.  DART changes to the build route need to be done in the PreSchedule Workspace version of build route, as that is what we are using now, we have been phasing out the old build route.

Noted about the changes need to go thru you.  For now I only forwarded the request for adding a check box for option to exclude DART products.  From what you wrote, seems like we need the report to be able to show DART deals only, so real time can see it.  So basically we have two requests:  one to enable us to exclude/include DART deals and one to enable us to run DART deals only (while excluding all other deals that are going to be scheduled day ahead?)

* when IT gets back to me on the addition of the check box I will let you know so you can play around to see if that's how you want it to work.

Build route is a very vital part of what we use every day. Any change to it must go thru me.

The change in the Build Route for DART deals is a minor one, a check box on the user interface. Real time can run the report to show only DART deals, and they would be captured that way.

Please see me before any changes to the build route are discussed.

Just so you know I have submitted a request to Bill Crook's group (Bill Crook took over Will Smith's old responsibilities).  I will keep you and Sean posted when IT made progress on this.  I am curious what this Build Route report is and how schedulers use it, generally speaking.  Also, I understand that you would like to see the DART products excluded (by a check box) in this report.  While they won't show up in this report in the future, where should the deal info show up in stead in order for Real Time scheduling to pick it up?  Do we need real time position manager modified accordingly as well?

Maybe next time when you run the Build Route report I can go over and watch a bit, if you don't mind.  Let me know.

I think that if the Enpower guys can modify the Build Route Reports to have a check box that says Exclude DART deals, and have it default to the checked position.

That should take care of it.

Torrey Moorer in EOL IT group has created the Mid-C DART product on EOL.  In the future when a trade is done on EOL, it will be bridged into Enpower Deal Entry. However, although the ""DART flag"" will be on in deal entry, I believe for now it's informational only, and it's not doing anything to alert the schedulers.  I would like to know the rationale for creating this DART product and how you would like the schedulers in Day Ahead group (Cara's group) and Real Time (Bill's group) to see in their applications.  If I can get this info from you, I'll work with Enpower IT to put all necessary DART processes in place.

I would like to know the rationale for creating this DART product and how you would like the schedulers in Day Ahead group (Cara's group) and Real Time (Bill's group) to see in their applications.  If I can get this info from you, I'll work with Enpower IT to put all necessary DART processes in place.  

Thanks,

Good Afternoon,

The last of our kinks has been worked out and we are going to go ahead with all schedules in the new system as of 11/15. We will then have a good couple of weeks under our belt before the start of a new month. The last date you will see any preschedules in Lotus is 11/14/01

Please see me if you have any questions.

Cara

Cara,

The Deals 576490.1 & 737863.1 are booked in strange way, we segregate these deals depend on the Day week Mask, 

If DOW is  -MTWTFS- (Monday thru Saturday, excluding Sunday & Holidays), for WEST desks we segregate them into  1-24 Hours category, if power flows Round The Clock (Hours 0000-2400) 
If DOW is S------H (Sunday and Holiday, except Monday thru Saturday), for WEST desk we segregate them into Off Peak Deals
If DOW is -MTWTFS--(Monday thru Friday, excluding Saturday, Sunday & Holidays), for EAST desks we are secreting them into  1-24 Hours Category, if power flows Round The Clock (Hours 0000-2400)  
If DOW is S------SH--(Saturday, Sunday & Holidays excluding Monday thru Friday), for EAST desks we are secreting them into Off Peak Deals

Where as 
Deal # 576490 DOW is -MTWTFSH,  that is  the reason Pre Schedule Work space is segregating this deal into Off-Peak Section
Deal # 737863 DOW is SM--TFSH, that is the reason Pre Schedule Work space is segregating this deal into Off-Peak Section

If you want to segregate the deal into OnPeak/24 Hours/Off-Peak  depending on the number of hours it is flowing, not depend on the Day Week mask, let me know I will make the changes required in Pre - Schedule Work Space an release it in the next version.


Thanks,

Good Evening

I ran a master download for December 1 so that over the next few days I can test the overwriting fix, and found two deals that are 24 hour deals, show scheduled hours of 1-24, but are segregated with the ""OFF PEAK"" deals. 

The deal numbers are:

576490.1	 
737863.1	 


Can you look and see if they are booked in a strange way that makes them fall into the wrong segregation category?

I have been told today that these folks will have to do all of our scheduling as of Monday, they are being trained today but will have to have working logins patterned after Donald Robinson by the end of business today.

Serena Bishop ( I do not know what she has access to, she was the California scheduler)
Mike Purcell (already has access to some things, but please check his access)

If this cannot be done, please call Murray O'Neil asap.  His Cell is 503-702-9846

Thanks for that laugh! I needed it.

Here's the deal:

A call swaption was sold to me by pollard for the intrinsic and extrinsic value of the desks on the floor times 3.50 per month.  I sold this put to myself and pocketed a next fixed premium of one million dollars. I took that six million dollars and used it to finance the new snickers plant that is going to be built in 10 years.  I divided the reesee's plant and the snickers plant, sold put-call parodies on the reesee's and put the snickers plant up for collateral on a 20 million dollar loan to finance potato chip options.

My net was 3.5 billion dollars, so I am the one buying Enron.

My new Company is called  ""Cara-land"".  I am working on the national anthem now.

I am sorry you have been so sick! That sounds just awful.  Are you all better now?

I can think of nothing worse than not being able to talk well! My head would explode!


Love,

Susie and I talked, she and I agreed that she would work 7-1 m-th,  and 7-5 on fridays.  We had agreed to that before she left.
 
I also filled her in on our situation as a company, she had no idea.  I didn't want her to get blindsided by any kind of decision.

Hi.  I talked to Julie Kearney about my hours.  She said 7 to 1 is 30 hours a week and I need to work 32 hours a week to keep my benefits the way I have them.  Would it be ok if I worked 7 to 1:30?  I'm pretty sure my babysitter can stay an extra half hour.  I'm also planning on making arrangements to work later on the last 3 days of each month to set up for the new month.

Everything that we use is located in P:/Scheduling.  You will find old sheets with tags and paths, documents outlining how the system works, how daylight savings time needs to be represented, there is also the Intranet site

P:\Scheduling\EnronWestSchedulingWebsite.html

On this there is the OATI links, and also the test site for OATI 1.7.  This will go live in April, and will be totally different than any tagging done before. You will need time to get familiar with the new format and practice, and I will be happy to help guide you when you are ready.

All 3 of us are here to help, and will be available to you until you are comfortable.

Good Luck!

When E-Tag 1.7 is activated on March 6, 2002 the OATI webTag (ETS) system will require secure access using an OATI Digital Certificate.  OATI Digital Certificates will be provided to our existing webTag customers at no additional cost under their existing ETS Agreement.

For those companies that have not yet acquired OATI Digital Certificates, to start the process, please download the Company Information document at the following URL:

http://www.oaticerts.com/repository/company_information.doc

Complete the form, and then e-mail it to OATI at support@oatiinc.com.  Please do not delay, get this service today to avoid access problems on March 6.

For those companies that have already acquired OATI Digital Certificates, our OATI webTag Administrator will be contacting your company shortly to activate this service with your current E-Tag 1.67 access.

If you have questions, please feel free to contact us at (763) 553-2725 or support@oatiinc.com."

Serena Bishop ( I do not know what she has access to, she was the California scheduler)
Mike Purcell (already has access to some things, but please check his access)

If this cannot be done, please call Murray O'Neil asap.  His Cell is 503-702-9846

Jason,
 
Why has this now changed to Monday from Thursday morning and who made this decision?
 
Will we be able to schedule Monday without the UBS folks?

Cara, 

Can you double check this deal for me.  Utah is saying that this deal did not flow after the 12/1/01.  I have looked at the SW sheet and it looks like it was cut, but I want to make sure.


Deal 533980.4

Chris and I would like to take this opportunity to update everyone on what =
has been happening on the floor(s) during the last couple of weeks and what=
 is likely to transpire in the weeks to come.  I'd like to begin by apologi=
zing for the lack of broad e-mail communications or floor meetings over the=
 last couple of weeks.  These have been very hard times and I know that peo=
ple have wanted information.  It has taken us nearly a week to sort through=
 who will be part of the UBS Warburg team and who continue with Enron. =20

In this e-mail I will explain: (1) who will be going to UBS Warburg, (2) wh=
o do the people working for Enron work for and what are they expected to do=
, (3) how will the physical separation between Enron and UBS Warburg happen=
, and (4) when will the sale of Netco to UBS Warburg be completed.  In addi=
tion to Chris Calger and me, the following Portland-based employees have ac=
cepted positions with UBS Warburg:

Last Name=09First Name=09Last Name=09First Name=09

While there are a few people who are still making up their minds, the rest =
of the people in our office will be working for the Enron estate.  It is no=
t entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power lo=
oks like for the Enron estate now.  As I understand it, there are two prima=
ry initiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.=
  The first is the disposition of our development projects that are already=
 well under way.  Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effor=
t together with the Portland asset development team.  This effort has been =
ongoing since December.  The second is the disposition of our west power co=
mmodity positions.  Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.=
  People working on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Ric=
hter, Ed Baughman among others.  I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul to=
 get advice on how people in Portland should proceed.  I would recommend ta=
lking to Ed, Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction.  I have placed a call to =
several of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response.  I =
am hopeful that they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinate=
 the power procurement and delivery efforts.

As most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron =
has already begun.  People who will continue to work for Enron will be loca=
ted on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor.  We hop=
e to make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week.  Moves within=
 the 3rd Floor will take place the following week.

The UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hur=
dle.  While I don't have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be on=
 or about February 6th.

Finally, I want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperation=
 over the last few weeks.  These have been really horrible times as the Enr=
on story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are f=
inding out about their future with Enron and UBS.  I know that this hasn't =
been easy for anyone.  I am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the a=
wesome team that we have put together.  Whether you are going to UBS, remai=
ning with Enron, or leaving the company, I wish everyone who worked on this=
 team the best in their future endeavors.  It has been a distinct honor to =
work with each and every one of you.

Regards,
Tim

Tim,

I just want to tell you how much I respect and admire how you have handled this situation. It is not lost on many of us that we owe not only our bonuses but also our jobs to you personally.

I am glad to be part of the new crew, and wanted you to know that I am grateful for all of your efforts on my behalf over the years. It is not often that an assistant is given the opportunities to advance that I was given.  

Thank you.

Hi Honey,

I hope you are having a good day, I sure enjoyed playing a bit this morning. (Although I had a little bout of blue bush) I just love having you around all the time. 

I don't want turkey for dinner, and since it's payday, I wanna take us out to dinner. Where would you like to go?  Or we can be turds again tonight and to to YOKO's tomorrow, or whatever.

I am suddenly actually busy figuring out the estate VS the newcompany stuff, it is fun to be busy and needed.

I love you very much and can't wait to see you tonight to show you the new license!

Love,

Cara Freeland"

Hi Sweetie,

Hopefully the visit to the Dr won't be that bad, do you want me to come hold your hand? (That would be pushing the envelope on intimacy, eh?) I saw a wrapper in the trash this morning and was sad to see it there. You need to fix that ( or those as it were). Please let me know what the dr. says.

The movie sounds good, but we will see how tired you are when you get home.  I wouldn't mind laying around like a turd this evening either. I need to vacuum but that is all.

I love you, and am so glad that I make you happy. I want us to be happy together for many years to come. I still feel like the luckiest woman in the world, to have such a caring and loving man in my life so suddenly.

See you tonight,

Good Morning Honey,

I didn't really sleep well last night, so I am tired and cranky today. However, the feeling of RFP is something to grin about. Today I am tying out our February positions with the traders so that they can pre-pay their trades for scheduling Feb 1.  Just spreadsheet and number crunching stuff.  

You are so important to me, I can't hardly articulate how much you mean to me. I love you and am so proud and happy to be yours. I can't wait till we share a home and I am 'out' to my family.  I want to tell them, ""this is done"" not ""this is what I am going to do"".  I love waking up in your arms and feeling your kisses first thing in the morning. The sleep thing will work itself out, I am not worried about it.

I am looking forward to forever with you.

Love,

Hi Baby,

The movie sounds good, nice and creepy! I am going to leave here around noon again ( such a slave ) and go home and work on packing. I can meet you at work or we can leave from the house when you get there.

I love you, I can't tell you how my heart leapt for joy when I saw your face again. I just wanted to hold on to you forever. Those 2 romps were not bad either! ;)

See you tonight, hope you get it all built today.

Love,

Hi Baby,

The movie sounds good, nice and creepy! I am going to leave here around noon again ( such a slave ) and go home and work on packing. I can meet you at work or we can leave from the house when you get there.

I love you, I can't tell you how my heart leapt for joy when I saw your face again. I just wanted to hold on to you forever. Those 2 romps were not bad either! ;)

See you tonight, hope you get it all built today.

Love,

CF"

Mine is all done, whiz quiz completed and Paperwork given to Gabrielle

Thanks.

Does this mean that the final stuff is done and we are all locked in for UBS? I understood that there was one final thing to happen before we were officially 'done'

I just heard from Chris Lue, UBS HR, regarding the UBS New Hire paperwork.  All New Hire paperwork must be completed before 3:00 PM TODAY, Friday, 1/25/02 or UBS will be unable to process your payroll.  

These forms were distributed during the HR Benefit meetings held yesterday.  If you were unable to attend these meetings and are unsure about what forms need to be completed, please see either Grace or I ASAP.

Thanks!

Hi My Love,

I have told Sylvia and Cheri about you, and how important you are to me. Phase 1 is complete!  I am leaving in a few minutes for Bandon, and will drive sooooo carefully that it will become the stuff of legend.

I miss you already, it's going to be a long lonely weekend without you!  But I will see you on Sunday, and you are a DEAD MAN! ;)

I love you,

Cara

P.S. Don't cheat on your cards................................ :)

OK, 
I'm going to send to each of the schedulers the EPE procedure. Services is not part of UBS's horizons so my status is unknown. EPE needs have thier schedule completed. I'll do it if I'm still here. I plan on doing it Friday. We'll see next week.

An old man and his wife have gone to bed. After laying there a few minutes
the old man farts and says, ""Seven Points.""
 
His wife rolls over and says, ""What in the world was that?""
 
The old man replied, ""It's fart football.""
 
A few minutes later the wife lets one go and says, ""Touchdown, tie score.""
 
After about five minutes the old man farts again and says, ""Touchdown, I'm
ahead 14 to 7.""
 
Not to be out done the wife rips another one and says, ""Touchdown, tie
score.""
 
Five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says, ""Field goal, I lead
17 to 14.""
 
Now the pressure's on and the old man refuses to get beat by his wife so he
strains real hard but to no avail. Realizing a defeat is totally
unacceptable, he gives it everything he has, but instead of farting, he poops
the bed.
 
The wife looks at him and says, ""What the hell was that?""
 
And the old man replied, ""Half-time, Switch sides.""

Good Morning Honey,

I wish that I could have pulled it together enough to get up with you and take care of you this morning, I really missed that.  Thank you for waking me up and giving me kisses and love. It was a sweet way to start the day.

Today there is a meeting from UBS, in about 10 minutes. I wonder what will be said. I will let you know everything.

On the way to work I was thinking about us planning for our home. I love the sound of our home. I hated seeing all of your stuff packed away today, I like snuggling with your pillows when you have gone to work. Soon we will both just be home.

Hopefully I will be all done with my bullshit in time to meet you at the grotto before going to Stanfords, but if not I will meet you there at 6. If I make it to the grotto by 5, will that be enough time for you to pick them up as well?

I am calling the doctor when his office opens to complain about the medication. I hope he gives me some more meds, but he might tell me just to hang in there until the new lower level is stabilized.

Last night was wonderful, each time we are together I find something new to enjoy. I love being with you, holding you and feeling all of your touches and caresses. You make me so happy, and I want to make you happy. I love that little grin on your face and the tenderness in your eyes. You are a wonderful man and I am the luckiest woman in the world to have you in my life.

I love you,

Cara"

Hi Dearie,

How are you?  I have been hearing your name more lately, and just wanted to touch base and tell you how much I miss you!  I have been buying that good Prosperity wine at Trader Joe's and always remember the party at your house.

Do you think that you will be ever coming here to visit?  How is your husband?  How is your dog-bite scar? Do you have any new Jewelry?  I am trying to sell my wedding ring, and am thinking instead that I will just get another stone to match the center stone and make earrings.

If you do come to stay, please stay with me. I am signing papers on my new condo this afteroon It is wonderful. 3 Bedrooms, backs right up to a greenbelt with a wetland.

I miss you,

Good Morning, 

Here is the spreadsheet that you sent out with the access for the West Power Scheduling group. The users are now only me, Diane Cutsforth, and Donald Robinson.



 

I dont' know if you are aware, but we are having problems with accessing both PreSchedule Workspace and Path Confirmation. Donald Robinson and Diane Cutsforth have more details than I do, as I have been out on medical leave for a month.

Donald tried to login this morning and had problems, If you are aware of this bug let me know, if you need more details, please speak to him.

His number is 503/464-3902

Thanks,

Cara

I spoke with Serena and told her how to roll scheduling forward.

Let me know if that doesn't do it.

Cara,

I need to talk to you about Jan, it looks like nothing has been auto scheduled.  Serena is going to start doing the California deals.  It looks like from the 1/2 on nothing is in actuals.

I was tickled to get such a cool card! Where did you find it?  I am thinking about taking the front off and putting it in a little frame.


I have decided to postpone the catchup Christmas party and instead have a housewarming party when I move into my NEW beautiful Condo that is right on a wetland/woods!  I go to sign papers today.

Thanks again,

She missed the tax deduction for 2001, and she missed being a New Year's baby, but we'll probably keep her just the same.  Mom and baby are doing fine.  Dad is still assessing.

Good Morning..........sir,

I am wearing my sweatshirt and my new boots to work, so my feet are warm and I feel like I have you wrapped around me. My roses are starting to really open up now, they are so beautiful.

I had fun at the party last night, danced my fool head off.  Good natured fun dancing with the buds from work.  One guy tried to dip me and failed miserably, I fell on my right hip, but not before I nearly knocked myself unconcious on part of the wall. I ended up sitting there for a minute with a packet of frozen soybeans on my noggin.  I told him no more of that stuff. On the way home from the party I almost just showed up at your house, but figured you needed a break from me for some rest.  

You have a good day, hope you are rested and feeling good.

:)

Subject:	New West Power Deal Info

Confidential:  For Internal Distribution Only

The purpose of this e-mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible.  I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing.  My apologies for this.  Hopefully this e-mail will accomplish that goal.

A number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals.  As a result, we haven't been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money.  Our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check.  Instead, these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices.

We have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have.  We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre-petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money.  We have received approval from the Cash committee for purchases through December 27th (I think) and we will secure additional cash to continue on.

Here are the procedures as I understand them.  If you have any questions or modifications please me an e-mail or give me a call.

Cash Desk
Each cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated.
On a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term (next day to next week) deliveries with that counterparty are in the money.
If the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money, we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point.  We are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location.
The cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate (based on spot market prices) of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to Steve Thome.
The cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to John Postlethwaite via e-mail.
The cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring John current.

Marketing Desk
Steve Thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk.
The marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis.
The marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder.
Make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder at (503) 464-8058.
The marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis.  We don't necessarily care who buys it, but rather, we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated.
Whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to Steve Thome.

Deal Entry
The new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle.  After discussing the matter with Stacey White, she recommended entering the new deals in Enpower as zero price, non MTM, with an annuity equal to the prepay amount.
We should enter notes into Enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions.
This will allow settlements to match an annuity in Enpower with prepay out the door.  It will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice.

I'm sure that I've missed something.  Let me know.

Regards,
Tim"

I got a smattering of information that the big E will probably go after us contract folks that attempt to defect.  So, I guess it's second jobs for both of us.  I am sorry I got you into this, buddy.

If Saturday or Sunday would be a better lazy day than Christmas eve, then we can do whatever. You are the only thing on my calendar after tonight, sir.

For your reference, the following counterparties have terminated deals with us. A separate portfolio has been set up in Enpower to handle these deals from Jan 2002 through the remaining term of each deal and will no longer be valued under the West Region.  The new deal numbers are listed under the Bank Deal column on the attached spreadsheet. The original deals will only have volumes until Dec 31, 01 in the west portfolio.

Please forward this on to anyone who made need it for their reference. Let me know if you have any questions.

John

I've entered a sale annuity (723265) between the Short Term West Hourly and Short Term West Services books to divide the July EPE scheduling fees. Also, it appears the original annuity billed to El Paso has been changed to physical, so that should be set to liquidate. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kathy had a meeting with Rodger and the accounting people at EPE, and they want to just show everything on the sheet and not do any billing changes in the individual deals.  I explained your point and validated that I thought it would help them later with the PUC stuff.  She told me that she is talking to our settlements person in Houston (Amy Clemons) and wants to show it as just part of the overall invoice number each month instead of breaking it out.  She said that would accomplish the same thing.

Pete is out of the office until Monday, but they are going to get his final blessing on this before the final OK is given on procedure.

Let me know if there is anything further I need to do on this.

Hi Amy!

I tried to return your call from yesterday this morning, but only got your voice mail.

The February bill for $341.90 was for two days:  February 9th and 14th.  February 9th (Tag No. 16259) was priced for 1 MW @ $207.99.  February 14th was a real-time transaction with no tag for less than a MW priced at $133.91.  I checked our records and saw no energy return for losses to WACM from Enron at any time during February.

Please call if you have further questions.

I have definatly missed you.  I have missed everyone.  I like my new job but Sean was right, it is very slow paced here.  I find myself fighting for things to do some of the time.  I live on my own, I really dig my new pad.  It's definatly different living by myself.  Please tell everyone I said hello and if they want my address or phone number you are welcome to pass it on.

I do have plans. I'm going over to my uncles for a little family get together. I'm not going until around 6ish. I would love to just spend the day with you. :-)

I don't think we are going to be able to go see Lord of the rings tonight, sold out. I haven't talked to sissy yet so I'm not sure what the plan is. I will let you know as soon as possible.

I am soooo tired today. It's a very good tired though. :-) 

Miss you. 

Sir.

Hi, 

I am sitting here at my desk talking contracts and energy, and in my 
head I am thinking about kisses, caresses, and waking up with you. 
You make me feel so special, and beautiful, and cherished. I would 
really like to play hooky all during your shutdown and just be with you. 


I want to have a completely lazy day, just vegging, reading, snacking, 
keeping my feet warm, petting cats, watching movies, and snuggling by my 
fireplace. How does Christmas Eve sound? Do you have plans? 


Bye my special one, 

Kitten

I just love the way you look at me. I can't wait to see you again. you've definitely got some cuddle time coming to you.

Good Afternoon,

Short-History
In case you haven't heard, our project to implement a high-bandwidth connection between Houston & Portland and remove our dependence on Terminal Server is a failure.  To make a long story short, the new DS3 allowed more data to travel back and forth but the time to get data between Houston and Portland was 10 times slower than running it through terminal server. 

Plan B (Thin-Client)
So where do we go from here.  We are now starting a process to re-architect our trading applications so that they will run just as fast over our WAN as they do through terminal server.  We will be using an architecture that minimizes the traffic over the WAN, utilizes specialized servers to do most of the processing, and implementing more back-end power.  To help us in the effort, we need your help to identify which applications should be converted first.

Good Candidates for Conversion
Listed below are some attributes for applications well suited for the initial architecture conversion.
1.  Runs flaky in Terminal Server (Access Violation errors, application locks-up, etc)
2.  Applications primary source of data is located in Houston 
3.  Mission Critical time constrained applications
4.  Mission Critical poor performing applications
5.  Heavily utilized applications

Feedback from you
Please reply back to the email or stop-by if you have any thoughts on which applications you think should be converted in the first-wave. 

Poston's list 
I've been hanging around for over a year and I think I have a pretty good idea of what might be some good applications for conversion.  Here's my first cut.
1.  Enpower Deal Scheduling
2.  Enpower Deal Entry
3.  Enpower Real Time Position Manager
4.  Enpower/FSP Schedule Blotter
5.  New Auto-Routing Application
6.  CARP report
7.  SAR report
8.  Forward obligations report


Thanks,  David Poston

Concur Expense (XMS)
Common Questions


1.  Where can I find online documentation on Concur Expense?
Answer: Documentation on Concur Expense is stored in the ISC Document Library.   Go to the following link:
http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/default.asp  and click on the XMS - Concur Expense folder on the left.

2. How can I sign up for Concur Expense training and how much does it cost?
Answer: Go to the following link: http://iscedcenter.enron.com/docentlm/login.htm.  Log in using your Enron email address.  Enter your birth date as the password in the following format: MMDDYYYY.  Under the Courses section, select Concur Expense (XMS).  This will show the training schedule.  Click the Enroll button to sign up for a class.  The cost is $250.

3. Will old XMS expense reports be converted to the new Concur Expense system?
Answer: No.  History data was not converted to the new system because of our move to an Application Service Provider (ASP) solution for Concur Expense.

4. How can I view my old expense reports?
Answer: Call the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727.  The ISC will be responsible for printing out old expense reports and forwarding them to you.  Other options are being reviewed to allow you to view old expense reports.

5. Are there any Enron specific help instructions for Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes.  If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Enron Help on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also you will see a button for Enron Help at the top of the screen when entering expense reports.

6. Is Enron's Travel Policy available in Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes. If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Travel Policy on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also you will see a button for Travel Policy at the very top of the screen when entering expense reports

7. What if I am unable to see any of my credit card charges in Concur Expense?
Answer: Since there are a number of factors that could cause this problem, it is best to call the ISC Customer Care group first.  The ISC will research the problem and get back to you with an answer.

8. Does Concur Expense have a time-out feature?
Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense will automatically time out after 20 minutes of inactivity.

9. How do I enter foreign currency into Concur Expense?
Answer: Go to the ISC Document Library described in #1 above.  Go to the XMS - Concur Expense folder.  Next go to the Special Procedures folder and following the directions stated in the document called Add a Foreign Currency Expense to an Expense Report.

10. Are there any other sources to quickly get me started using Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense provides a Quick Tour for new users.  Log into Concur Expense and click the Help button in the top right corner of the screen.  Then click the button labeled Quick Tour at the top of the help screen.  The ISC intranet home page also contains some helpful information.  The following link summarizes some of the topics discussed above:  http://isc.dev.corp.enron.com/site/XMSchange.htm.

11. Can you quickly describe some of the internal changes in the new Concur Expense system?
Answer:  There are minimal changes in the new upgrade.  Here is a list:
?	The first screen only has one tab instead of two
?	New expense types were added
?	Attendees and approvers will now be printed on the expense reports
?	Manager and receipt dunning notices will be sent out
?	The statistical order and statistical WBS element fields have been separated out


Please direct all other questions to the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727."

Dear Cara,  I can not speak for the other two but I want you to know that
I love you very, very much. The only way I could love you
more/differently is if you were my own offspring. It has been my
privilege to embrace you as part of our family. I was so happy to learn
that you were going to marry Dave and make it official. I love you very
much and will continue to love you for all time and eternity. You are a
special lady.

You have helped me in many ways. You came to my side when I had the
overwhelming job of caring for my Mother. Your wisdom and experience made
that part of life a lot easier. The help you gave Christine was
priceless.  Many times you have given me words of encouragement that gave
me that little bit I needed to go ahead and try what ever it was that I
was so unsure of. You comforted me when we lost Mom and Chip. You were
there for me when we nearly lost Cheri and when Dad took his turn hurting
me. Then there was the church crap that you listened to and helped me to
understand that I was not all the things they said I was and that we
could do better than to bury ourselves in 'that'. You cared for Nathan
for me so I could go and take care of Cheri. I was able to go without
having to choose between two people that I love. You are helping me in
other ways now that I will not discuss, but you know. Last but not at all
least is your humor. That has gotten me through untold hard times. You
will never know the half. I am not even sure I know all what a blessing
you have been to me.

I knew that when I started this list I would forget something and I am
sure I have. These are the things that pop into my mind when I think of
you. I love you very much and I Praise the Lord that He brought you into
our lives.    

Mom

		 Subject: HEDGE FUND NAMES/ meeting next week

I look forward to meeting with you both on Tuesday.  Here's a list of the 
funds we have in the pipeline and the status:

MACRO FUNDS-
1.Harvard (Docs done)- We have been dealing with them in crude, products, and 
natural gas- we just need to keep track of their credit line.

2. Tudor- we have docs with Ospraie, Tudor Proprietary, Tudor Offshore 
(Bermuda)- dealing regularly.. 

3. Catequil (Negotiating) docs with Offshore and Onshore- waiting for 
response from Brent and Paul on their latest comments to the ISDA.  Confirms 
from all the deals we have done have been returned to Carol.  They are set up 
in the system; we hold margin.

4. AIG (Negotiating)- Offshore, Onshore- need to get documents out to them- 
credit work sheet in legal.. still have not gotten out a confirm to them on 
the trades they have done....we have them set up in the system and hold 
margin.

5. Union Spring (Negotiating)- Offshore, Onshore- should be done on this one.

6. SAC Capital - possibly only one vehicle in Anguila- need to get the 
document to them- credit work sheet in legal.

7. Quark Power (Negotiating)- 2 entities- Quark Power and Amaranth.  Held by 
Paloma Partners- waiting for their comments on a few points.

8. Valentis and CD Holdings- Held by Wexford Capital - need to get document 
to them- credit work sheet in legal.  They want to proceed with the 8 year 
deal Monday.  

9. Global Advisors- trade through Cargill.. Frank Sayre working on POA.. 
waiting for this back.

10. Argonaut- onshore, offshore vehicles- sending documents.. no credit 
assessment yet.

11. SOROS- brought through system by credit derivative group.. but need a 
credit opinion for ENA (to do energy trades).


PROGRAM FUNDS- 
12. Renaissance - credit worksheet in legal- need to get docs to them.
13. Campbell+ Co - will likely want to look at a three way transaction 
between Enron, themselves, and a bank
14. Sunrise Capital - getting documentation.

Caroline:

I am in the midst of preparing these annexes now.
You should take special note of the credit that Paul is insisting upon (seems 
to be similar to AIG).  This is all credit - but note his Additional 
Termination Event if the ISDA is not executed within 60 days.  You must 
discuss all of the items with your counterparty.

Also, if you do the deal(s), give me the name, phone/fax numbers, email 
addresses of all commercial and legal for your counterparties.

		 Subject: Valentis

Here are the credit worksheets for Valentis (25% of the trade and Independent 
amount should be allocated here) and CD Holdings (75% allocated here).  This 
will work for the ISDA, and I am hearing from Caroline that they are ok with 
posting this up front amount in cash.  So, for purposes of the Deemed ISDA, 
we may as well include all of the credit provisions, but make the $2MM a 
""Special Independent Amount"" applicable to the counterparty, which may be 
increased by Enron up to $5MM. This Special Independent Amount should be 
added to the Independent Amount as that term is used in the ISDA in order to 
give us the ability to demand more collateral at will with respect to the 
long term hedge.  Given the fact that the c/p can post cash instead of LC's I 
see no reason for us to always have the Special Independent Amount in cash.  
That is, if we are $2MM out of the money on the position, I do not have a 
problem returning their cash, so long as it is in increments of the rounding 
amount. 

So I think we should just go ahead and put credit into these Deemed ISDAs, 
and require that the failure of the parties to execute an ISDA within 60 days 
will constitute a termination event.

Caroline, again, the c/p will have to verbally agree to Loss instead of 
market quotation, to the special margining provisions with respect to this 
particular long term trade, etc.  Let's discuss how this will work, since it 
is different from what I proposed on the phone.

Sara, after you have had a chance to look at these, give me a call so we can 
discuss.

Thanks.
Paul

Caroline:

You should have already seen the two ISDA's (Valentis, CD Holdings) emailed 
yesterday evening per your instructions.  I am still waiting for you to send  
information regarding inhouse/outside legal counsel for both parties.

The Schedule and Paragraph 13 sent to Valentis et al is very much like the 
hedge fund template which legal is refining.  We are reviewing the first 
draft and commenting.

FYI - I will not be in the office on Friday, April 27.  Also, the Enron legal 
conference is next week and the lawyers will be in San Antonio from May 2 
(afternoon) through May 4.  And finally, I will be on vacation during the 
week of May 7 - May 11.  Please try to make plans (conference calls, 
counterparty comments, etc.) accordingly.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.

Sara- this looks OK with me..

The major difference between this draft and the last is that instead of Enron 
monitoring the credit line, Global will... Global will be able to deal with 
Enron if the credit line with Cargill has not been breached or if they have 
gotten prior approval from Cargill to breach the line.

If Global trades with Enron without Cargill consent, Cargill will notify 
Enron and Global that the trade is not valid and Global will have to unwind 
the trade at current market rates..  

Please let me know if you have any problems with this.

Kind Regards,

Subject: Re: Cash Collateral


Dear Carol

Under Bermuda law, there is no real concept of ""perfecting"" security since it 
is not necessary to ensure the enforceability in Bermuda that a charge be 
registered in Bermuda.  However, although it is not necessary for a security 
interest to be registered in order for it to be valid, the charge document 
itself can be registered in Bermuda in the Register of Charges in accordance 
with Section 55 of the Companies Act 1981 in order to ensure the priority in 
Bermuda of the charge.  On registration, any charge evidenced in the charging 
document will have priority over any unregistered competing charge or any 
subsequently registered competing charge in respect of the assets which are 
the subject of the charge (i.e. the cash).

If the agreement will be governed by either Texas or New York law, it will be 
a matter of the laws of either Texas or New York as to the actual nature of 
the security interest which is created by the charge.

If you would like us to effect the registration of the charge, we would need 
an original (or a certified true copy) of the executed document which creates 
the security interest.  There is no time limit on such registration.  
However, please note that, in addition to our professional fees, there is a 
filing fee of $446 which is payable in respect of the registration.

I trust that the above is of some assistance.  If you have any questions 
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards.

We have done a trade with a Bermuda hedge fund and have negotiated
collateral provisions that may require them to post csah to us.  The
agreement will be governed by either Texas or New York law.  We need your
advice on how to perfect our interest in any cash posted to us that we
would hold in an account in the United States.  Could you please call
either me or Sara Shackelton (713)853-5620 if possible tomorrow or you can
send me an e-mail if that is easier.  I'm hoping that our possession of the
cash is enough.  Sorry for the short fuse on this.  If you need any
additional information, please contact me or Sara.  I will be unavailable
from 9-11 and 2-3 tomorrow Houston time.

We are trying to do a deal with Valentis Investors LLC (we have an LLC 
agreement for this entity) and CD Holdings (I do not have the LLC agreement 
for them- do you need?).  Valentis is part of Wexford V- a fund owned by 
Wexford Capital.   Paul Radous has all these linkage documents- he originally 
sent them up to Carol.

Valentis and CD Holdings jointly own some oil and gas properties. They would 
like to transact a hedge of these properties- they would like to sell natural 
gas forward for 8 years.

The total notional on the deal is about 34M.. I have discussed this with Paul 
Radous.. he has suggested that we do this deal as a stand alone for the 
Valentis and CD Holding entities.. he is requesting initial margin of 
2million with a cap of 5 million.

They wanted to do this deal today (actually for the last week)... but we need 
to know if there are any legal objections... we will need a deemed ISDA like 
AIG.

Please give Paul and I a call when you have a minute.

Thanks,
Caroline"

in the system; we hold margin.

4. AIG (Negotiating)- Offshore, Onshore- need to get documents out to them- 
credit work sheet in legal.. still have not gotten out a confirm to them on 
the trades they have done....we have them set up in the system and hold

Sara,

Please advise the status of this deal.  

Rod Nelson did confirm that deal should not reference a Master Agreement 
since we do not have one with this entity.   I think I did give you a copy 
last week.  Let's discuss when you have time.

Subject: Re: RMT/EI Master Swap  

Pat, 

I don't think the authorization issue relates to ""entering into a swap"" but 
rather ""holding a position"".  I think that as long as EI is not holding open 
a position, they are in compliance with authority controls.  Basically, this 
means that as long as EI does every trade back to back, they are not 
violating any controls. So, if EI enters into a swap with a third party, they 
must immediately offset that risk with an identical (but opposite position) 
swap with ECT. In this manner, EI never takes market risk, only ECT does. We 
may need to verify this with Ted, but this is my understanding. The confirm 
desk may be able to tell us if any deals were confirmed under the RMT/EI 
master, but I don't think we would know since we do not monitor intercompany 
exposure.

Thanks,
Tanya

Subject: RMT/EI Master Swap

Sara called Friday and advised that there is a Master Swap agreement between 
RMT and EI.  Since Ted Murphy advised that EI should not be entering into any 
swaps, she is wondering about this ISDA.

Is there a way to check to see if we have any existing transactions done 
under this ISDA?  It looks like this was set up so that EI could back to back 
a trade with a Polish affiliate and RMT did a back to back trade with Merrill.

Pat

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among 
other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its 
jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) 
made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades 
through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact 
on our standard reps relating to the ""trade options exemption"" and as to the 
parties being ""eligible swap participants"" (are they still required)?  Is 
there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact 
on our standard reps relating to the ""trade options exemption"" and as to the 
parties being ""eligible swap participants"" (are they still required)?  Is 
there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

Sara, I just the message you just left about playing phone tag with Anna at 
Bear Stearns.  As the lotus notes and the attached correspondence indicates, 
I was proactive today in contacting Anna to follow through since she did not 
return my last call a few days ago.  Since we already have a meeting set up 
for tomorrow at 10, I guess her message to you must be old (unless she is not 
the person responding to her email).  I also spoke this week with the 
attorneys representing the other brokerage firms and resent comments to them 
after they confessed that they had misplaced the previous ones.  Thus, from 
my perspective, we have been diligent in trying to open the accounts.

I too would like for us to discuss the other tasks that have to be done.  
However, I cannot meet today to do so at all.  I am troubleshooting several 
ABSOLUTELY URGENT tasks that have to get done today for ITG and for the CYNET 
deal.  I am available to meet tomorrow at my earliest convenience.

 As you may or may not know, we had two other ""EMERGENCIES"" with respect to 
brokerage accounts having to do with Frost, Cynet and another -- I cannot 
even remember which.  And, aside from these, we just executed four agreements 
in the past week.   

I want to reassure you that I believe to the best of everyone's ability we 
are as diligent as possible in getting these things done.   I will contact 
Keegan to set up a meeting as soon as possible tomorrow to talk about Enron 
Credit Inc.

Rawleigh White is the CFO for the tribe.  The ""broker"" intermediary is Jeff 
Fuller with Power Resources Managers (425-451-9123) who told me that the

Subject: Request for ISDA and Other Documents for Warm Springs Tribe


Stewart, effective 1/1/2002, the Warm Springs Tribe will be purchasing a 1/3
share of PGE's Pelton/Round Butte Project.  They will be selling the output
to PGE at prices indexed to the Dow Jones Mid-Columbia Index, and are
interested in executing financial swaps to manage their market price risk.
Would you please forward on to me drafts of the legal documents that will be
required to execute financial transactions (e.g., ISDA, legal opinion,
etc.).  As with my previous request pertaining to the public utilities we
are working with, I ask that Sara Shackleton be assigned to this.  Thanks
for your help.  I think we are interested in moving fairly quickly to get
the necessary documentation in place.

Jeff

To:  Enron North America Corp.

From:  Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon


In July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, the=20
implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the=20
continued growth of ENA including: 1) accelerate the development of our=20
people, 2) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets=
,=20
and 3) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups, both=20
within ENA and across Enron. Consistent with these objectives and with the=
=20
corporate goal of fostering =01&One Enron=018, we would like to announce th=
e=20
following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the=
=20
Commercial Transactions Group within ENA.

1) Coverage/Origination:

To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product=
=20
technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream=20
businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated=
=20
under the leadership of Dave Delainey :
a) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals,=
=20
co-ops, energy service companies and IPP=01,s;
b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a=
=20
broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers=20
including  pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals an=
d=20
mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation,=
=20
textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream=20
Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries.

Downstream Coverage/Origination

As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha=
t=20
the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both=
=20
ENA and Enron Corp.  Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand=
=20
its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20
solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron=
=20
Corp.  Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function=
=20
will expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener=
gy=20
commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti=
es=20
but also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic=
als,=20
plastics and refined products risk management capability.  These additional=
=20
capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels=
=20
groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper=
=20
will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg=01,s=20
leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three=
=20
sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering:
a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage=
=20
activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible f=
or=20
the provision of innovative=20
products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio=
n=20
of paper risk management products;
b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello t=
o=20
lead the coverage activities in this business.  This group will be=20
responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the=20
chemicals and refined products industries;
c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers=
=20
Trust=01,s global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to lead=
 the=20
coverage activities in this business.  This group will be responsible for t=
he=20
provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining,=20
heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textile=
s=20
and glass manufacturing industries.




Midstream Coverage/Origination

a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01, activities will focus o=
n=20
energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern=
=20
Interconnect. We have asked  Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of thi=

group;
b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will focus =
on=20
energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. The=
y=20
will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring=20
opportunities in the Western U.S.  We have asked Chris Calger to assume the=
=20
leadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from=20
Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination effort=
s;
c) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will f=
ocus on=20
the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the=20
emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio=01,s of merc=
hant=20
power generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked =
=20
Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group.  In addition, Mike will=
=20
continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern=20
Interconnect;
d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructur=
ing=20
opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing=20
restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets.  We hav=
e=20
asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair,=20
formerly of Enron Asia=01,s development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of=
=20
Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join=
=20
this newly formed business.

2) Commercial Transactions:=20

The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20
Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of=
=20
transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex=
ecuting=20
transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity=
=20
of client coverage.  CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20
Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20
Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical=
=20
Analysis and Upstream Asset Management.

The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,=
=20
execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction=
=20
with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of=
=20
which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.  This=
=20
dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service=
=20
and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20
resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to=
=20
the highest value transactions across the coverage functions:

a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and=
=20
Western Coverage/Origination Groups.  The senior members of this group=20
include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy=
=20
Lemmons joined Enron in 1992.  Most recently, he was the Vice-President of=
=20
Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today=
=20
from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power=20
origination.
b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA=01,s industr=
ial=20
origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining,=20
Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is=
=20
established.  The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay=
=20
Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.  We anticipate announcing=
=20
two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks.
c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant=
=20
Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups.  The seni=
or=20
members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud a=
nd=20
John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the=
=20
Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix.  We=
=20
anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few=
=20
weeks.
d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20
Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.  The senior members of this team inclu=
de=20
Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.  We hope to announce the addition=
=20
of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.

Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and=
=20
Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary=
=20
responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.  Andrea Reed will=
=20
continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior=
=20
commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua=
l=20
responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the=20
Capital Structuring Group.  The remaining four groups within CTG will remai=
n=20
largely unchanged.  In addition, the Origination and the Transaction=20
Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located=
=20
together.

We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag=
e=20
and industry knowledge in all ENA=01,s markets particularly in the industri=
al=20
markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe=
en=20
the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups.=20

Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor=
th=20
America by working with us to implement these changes."

Hey Sara, thanx for your words of encouragement.  It is very important to me 
that you think that I am doing a good job, the positive feedback offsets all 
the frantic calls from the people downstairs.  

The Authroized Traders List for Enron Credit Inc. is done -- we really just 
need to finalize the agreements with the brokers which i think can happen 
quickly since we are not trying to reinvent the wheel.  

I just realized that my conference call with Anna is 10 New York time and 
then I have a conference call with Claude on his deal. So, I am going to get 
on your calendar tomorrow but it might not be until late morning, not first 
thing.  At the meeting, I can let you know where we stand with the other 
tasks.

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was ""too old"" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. (""ECI"").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

Stewart:

I spoke with Rawleigh White (Tribal CFO) and the Tribe's outside counsel the 
other day.  Pending receipt of Tracy's credit worksheet, I'll send the 
Tribe/lawyers a ""sample ISDA without credit"" which is not specific to the 
Tribe.  The lawyers will begin to determine if the Tribe is an ""eligible 
contract participant"" for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.

Rawleigh wants to know if Enron is interested in helping the Tribe finance 
the purchase of the two dams.  Can you please address for West Origination 
and respond to Raleigh?

Thanks.

""Per our recent conversation, please find attached a sample Schedule to the 
ISDA Master Agreement (and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex - 
Susan, can we send?) which is not tailored specifically for the Tribe.  We 
will be able to provide a specific Schedule and Paragraph 13 after our credit

Elizabeth:
I had a question about a recurring provision that I have seen in your Power 
Contracts.  Looks like our credit group accepts a Guaranty from a 
Counterparty's Credit Support Provider as a form of Performance Assurance to 
satisfy any collateral posting requirements.  On the financial side, 
Guarantys always supplement the colateral requirements such that we require 
them to post cash or LC's to us even if we are holding a parent Guaranty.  
Why is there a different approach on the power side?  Alos, how does credit 
value a parent guaranty?  For example, if the parent's financial condition 
worsens, does the value of the Guaranty drop?  Let me know what you think.

Subject: Re: BEAR Guarantee letter  

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was ""too old"" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. (""ECI"").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

I should have the amendment completed by end of next week.  I had a 
conversation with Mike Beebe, President CSC Energy Services, earlier today, 
and the only issue they have with the attached amendment (I am forwarding you 
the amendments under separate cover) is the changes to the termination on a 
change of control by CSC.  I don't think there will be any additional room 
for further changes, but we have incorporated the majority of changes 
requested by the monetization team.

Call me with questions/concerns.

Jimmie -- we are proceeding with the securitization.  Wanted to get an update 
on the Amendment.  

(1) How far along are you with CSC?  Has CSC signed-off on the draft ?
(2) Will the Amendment be executed by year-end?
(3) Is it likely that the termination payment amount (for the Premium Payment 
tranche) stay as it is currently drafted?
(4) Do we or the banks have any room to suggest changes?


Please let us know how we can help.   Thanks.....Scott  (3-7661)

Cheryl:  You may want to mention to Anna (Bear) that ENA would like to 
transfer the Securities Loan Agreement to Enron Credit Inc., retrieve the ENE 
guaranty for ENA and have Enron Credit Inc. guaranteed under a new ENE

Subject: Re: BEAR Guarantee letter  

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was ""too old"" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. (""ECI"").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

I would reword the first sentence as follows:

In response to your e-mail dated March 21st and based on all of the 
information that we have received from you thus far which essentially has 
only demonstrated that the debt of our Reference Entity's affiliates has been 
repudiated, we still lack proof of the repudiation by our Reference Entity 
(and the guarantor of such debt) of its obligations under the Guaranty that 
supports such debt.  Please provide us such information to demonstrate that a 
Credit Event has occurred.

I will be out of the office tomorrow but will be checking my voice mail.  If 
you need to consult with someone right away, please contact Sara Shackleton 
who is familiar with this deal.

In response to your email dated March 21st, you have not proven whereby the 
guarantor( ie. the reference entity) has repudiated its obligations under the 
guarantee for the obligations mentioned in the documents sent to us, in your 
notice of Publicly Available Information..

We are still awaiting a copy of the Prospectus for the ISIN XS0109296011 
US$22.4MM floating rate notes due 2000 and a copy of the guarantee.  Again, 
we do not believe a Credit Event has yet ocurred.

Hi Aneela, 

I have agreed to have my assistant work with me to send updates for the Legal 
Agreement Status memo to you.  I have gotten several of the Agreements on the 
list in ""executed"" or ""sent for execution"" status and you will get an updated 
memo next week confirming this.

In cleaning up our lotus notes this week, I noticed that several agreements 
were not on your list but remain unexecuted.  Can you let me know whether or 
not they remain a priority or interest?  If so, let me know so I can proceed 
on them during the first week in April (at which time I predict ALL of the 
other Agreements will be executed).

They include:

RBC Dominion Securities Corp.  (ECTI)

Sakura Dellsher, Inc.  (not sure which Enron company)

Societe General  (ENA)

BuySideDirect (ENA)

Merrill Lynch (ENA)

Sara:
In the unlikely event taht you are called tomorrow and they can't reach me 
here is where things stand.  After several internal discussions with Paul, 
Akasha and Denis O'Connell and based on the information that we have received 
from DB thus far, it appears as if our Reference Entity's subsidiaries have 
declared a standstill/moratorium with respect to all of their debt.  Our 
Reference Entity is the Guarantor of such debt.  We have taken the position 
that since the Credit Event must occur with respect to our Reference Entity, 
we need proof that our Reference Entity has repudiated its obligations under 
its Guaranty.  We feel fairly certain that it has, but DB has not shown us 
any proof of this.  Paul is calling the paying agent on the defaulted bonds 
to try and find out and we have sent another e-mail to DB requesting proof.

All of the other requirements have been met with respect to the obligations 
that DB plans to deliver to us next week to settle the contract.  I just need 
to quickly review the Guaranty that supports such obligations to make sure 
that it is unconditional.  I expect to see it sometime today.

Hi Sara, since I will be out of the office for a chunk of the day to attend 
the funeral, I wanted you to know what is going on with this.  I had 
completed the legal review of these documents but we needed some technical 
information from Julie.  (See attached).  Julie had provided all of the 
information except one task.  I have asked her and Stephanie to coordiate 
getting this information and to get it to Selena's assistant for execution.

Julie, the agreements are ready for Gary Hickerson's signatures.  Can you 
pick them up from Stephanie Panus, Senior Legal Specialist (I have left them 
on Stephanie's chair), and walk them down to Gary for signature  -- please 
turn them over to Selena's assistant.  Selena is at EB3072. Selena is out of 
the office today but her assistant will help get the documents executed, as 
per Selena's instructions before she left.  We have to get this done today.  
Gary has to initial at every tab I have marked.

But before you walk them down, there is one piece of info I need you to fill 
out and one that I need Stephanie to do; this is probably why it is a good 
idea that you guys hook up.

Julie, as per my email, I need the answer to question 2 on page 17: List the 
URL address locations of the NASDAQ Subscriber Agreement for any sites that 
you support.

Stephanie, can you insert the tax i.d. number for ECT Investments- this 
information had to be placed on the NYSE agreement.

I will be back in the office tomorrow morning between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m., 
then I am leaving to attend a funeral.  I do not know what time I will return 
but I will call in to make sure that these agreements get executed.

I think that this transaction is called ""Project Moosehead"".  I have a 
meeting on it this morning.  Please comment to the draft I sent to you 
yesterday.  I don't know if the structure works.  I couldn't decide upon the 
format; it also looks like a cap.  Thanks.  SS"

Sheila:  Thanks for the message.  I spoke with Mike Schneider (who contacted 
me - he's at 212-648-1164) to confirm our agreement and wanted to let you 
know that he was apologetic for having not having ""better rates"" to charge 
ENA.  He said he's been after Enron's business for some time and hopes to 
reduce rates in the course of business, if possible.  I thought you might 
want to have this bit of information.  Regards.  Sara

Theresa and Greg,
The rates from JP Morgan for the Futures account appear to be competitive 
(acutally better) than the terms for our other current agreements.
With 90 day t bill at 4.41%, 90% of this is 3.969% on the credit side vs 4.16 
using JP morgan's less 25 bp.
On the debit side it is competitive.  
Therefore, I am okay with the rate schedule from JP morgan and we can go 
ahead unless anyone can see an objection.
Thanks. Sheila

Sheila,
 Below is the information I received from Joe Hunter's group regarding 
funding rates for some of the exchange brokers.  For comparison JP Morgan's 
Futures funding rates are:

  Credit rate     Debit rate
US Dollars 90 day US TBill auction rate less 0.25%  JP Morgan Overnight 
Borrowing Rate plus 0.25 %

Theresa and Greg,
The rates from JP Morgan for the Futures account appear to be competitive 
(acutally better) than the terms for our other current agreements.
With 90 day t bill at 4.41%, 90% of this is 3.969% on the credit side vs 4.16 
using JP morgan's less 25 bp.
On the debit side it is competitive.  
Therefore, I am okay with the rate schedule from JP morgan and we can go 
ahead unless anyone can see an objection.
Thanks. Sheila

Sheila:  Thanks for the message.  I spoke with Mike Schneider (who contacted 
me - he's at 212-648-1164) to confirm our agreement and wanted to let you 
know that he was apologetic for having not having ""better rates"" to charge 
ENA.  He said he's been after Enron's business for some time and hopes to 
reduce rates in the course of business, if possible.  I thought you might 
want to have this bit of information.  Regards.  Sara

Paul, enclosed please find versions of the ECTRIC forms of Schedule to Master 
Agreement and Paragraph 11 to the Credit Support Annex, red-lined to show 
suggested revisions.  I have taken the versions of these documents sent to me 
by Matt Dawson of your office and inserted changes to reflect language we are 
currently using for Enron North America.

I think we should schedule one hour for a conference call to discuss which of 
these revisions, if any, present problems under English law.  I apologize in 
advance if I have suggested any revisions that you have already analyzed and 
rejected for English law reasons.

Please let me know when you would be available to discuss these.  Thanks --

The enclosed doc contains two clauses from our ISDA schedule that I feel 
would need to be substantively revised for ag products.  There are a few 
other suggested changes I have as well (e.g. footnote references w/ 
instructions on drafting).  Finally, there are some conceptual points that I 
believe should be discussed w/ relation to the unique structure for ""softs"" 
trading we have been planning.

I will ask my assistant to schedule a 30-min. meeting with the four of us for 
sometime next week.  -- Bob

Hi Mary,

It is my understanding that Cassandra is out on vacation until Monday.

Thank you for passing the Morgan Stanley brokerage account agreement and 
Officers and Authorized Trader List on to Cassandra to sign.  As per the Deal 
Sheet attached, we need to open the account immediately so that Enron 
Investment Partners, Inc. can meet the Securities and Exchange Commission 
requirements and sell-dribble the stock on the planned date.  

Enron Investment Partners has requested that we have the documents executed 
before they meet with Cynet late Monday morning.

If possible, please help me insure that Cassandra signs the documents first 
thing Monday morning.  I will call to follow up.  Thank you again for all of 
your help.

I'm forwarding ECT Canada's top 15 counterparties. We will use this list with 
the exception of J. Aaron, BP Amoco, PG&E, Morgan Stanley and Bank of 
Montreal as our target list for the USD/CAD products. Please ensure that a 
GTC is drawn up to allow EOL trading of these currency products. I would like 
to have the legal work done by March 6 in order to meet Gary's deadline.

David: I talked to Goldman today. They have developed a mechanism to feed 
live rates from their website into Excel. They will be here in 2 weeks to do 
a demo.

    OR  
Well, which one is it?  You want to share some information with the rest of 
Enron, but you don't know whether it belongs in the ThinkBank or in eMeet.  
Here is a handy quiz to help you make the decision.  Answers appear just 
below the quiz.  
What kind of information do you want to share?
A.  A well-developed idea or suggestion for something that will affect 
Enron's bottom line, either through revenue or savings.
B.  A question or a statement that you want someone else at Enron to answer 
or discuss.
C.  None of the above.
D.  Both A and B.
If you chose ""A,"" deposit an idea in the ThinkBank's Idea Vault.  If you 
chose ""B,"" eMeet is the place for you.  If you chose ""C"" or ""D,"" send an 
e-mail to ethink@enron.com and let us know what you're trying to share.  
We'll help you find the right place for it in eThink.

Caroline Abramo has initiated a new hedge fund family for financial trading.  
I am anticipating up to 4 separate masters, but likely only one series of 
negotiations (the others will likely duplicate the terms of the first one).  
The paper has started flow in.  Would you please advise which attorney will 
handle this?  The group is Wexford.  I need to start forwarding up to you 
copies of the offering memoranda.

Thanks."

Sass,

I know you hate this sort of thing, but this is just too funny to pass up
and I didn't want to leave you out in the cold.

Have you heard from Anita?  She emailed me about whether or not I was going
to be at the wedding.

How does the attached work for the BOFC/NDF?

I am not necessarily proposing that we use this for the EOL deal.

Hey, Jason:

Hope you're doing alright.  I received a call from NY and before I called 
back, I checked the infamous Lotus Notes.  It seems that you were going to 
send a letter to NY summarizing the outstanding issues (I think there was 
only one issue).  Please let me know if this was ever done.  Thanks.

On a sad note, I don't know if you heard but Samantha's 19-month old daughter 
(adoption not final) was killed in a tragic car accident last week.  The 
child managed to crawl under the car while it was in the driveway and Sam 
didn't see her.  Did you really get to know Samantha?  If so, and if you 
would like her home address, please let me know.

Sorry to take so long to respond.  A few things:

(1)  What is the correct legal name of the entity you are inquiring about?  
Is it the unregulated marketing arm of the regulated utility?

(2)  There has not been a commercial push from the ENA perspective to set up 
a new agreement with FPL which explains why I cannot get our credit  goup to 
react.  I'll broach the topic again when  I hear from you.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Maria:

I was waiting to see if Jason Peters ever sent a ""position letter"" to you 
when we brought this negotiation back inhouse.  Absent that information, it 
appears that we had at least one issue remaining and it concerned the 
disruption fallbacks, in particular, your request for both you and ENA to 
each obtain two quotes and then average those quotes (the ultimate 
fallback).  We cannot agree to your request.  The last database entry I 
reflect was in October, 2000, when we were having difficulty obtaining your 
response.

Given the lapse of time, we could try to generate a blackline and review the 
status.  Please let me know what you would like to do.

I anticipate that Samantha will be out of the office for a time.  In order 
that Samantha's work in progress be covered in her absence, please take the 
following steps.  The attorneys should retrieve from her desk and files those 
current file matters for which they are responsible.  To the extent you and 
your administrative assistant can cover the file matters, please do so in 
order to maintain a reasonable workload for the other paralegals.  If some of 
your file matters need further paralegal assistance, please advise me so that 
reassignments to other paralegals can be coordinated based upon the workloads 
of Susan, Stephanie, and Tana.  Thank you.

Sara: The second FPL entity is ""FPL Energy Power Marketing Inc.""  It is
the FPL entity that handles all trades for the non-regulated business
units of FPL.    We completed the ISDA agreements between Florida Power
& Light Co. (the regulated utility) and ENA in early January and I then
sent you on January 9th a red-line of the FPL Energy Power Marketing
Inc./ENA drafts vs. the final executed Florida Power & Light Co./ENA
agreements for ease of review, since the agreements were near twins
though you may also recall that we had added a guaranty of FPL Group
Capital Inc  (FPL Energy Power Marketing Inc. debt is unrated, FPL Group
Capital Inc debt is single A).  I appreciate you assistance in helping
to move this along.  Regards, -Serge

I am anticipating up to 4 separate masters, but likely only one series of 
negotiations (the others will likely duplicate the terms of the first one).  
The paper has started flow in.  Would you please advise which attorney will 
handle this?  The group is Wexford.  I need to start forwarding up to you 
copies of the offering memoranda.

Thanks.

Does anyone remember working on an ISDA Master between ENA and Nicor

However, our database shows that we received comments from them but nothing

Subject: Re: BEAR Guarantee letter  

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was ""too old"" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. (""ECI"").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

Sara,

If it's a Cap, is the Fixed Price then the Strike Price?  I think the format 
looks good.  I would prefer a ""Notice of Exercise"" provision, but it's not 
necessary.

I think that this transaction is called ""Project Moosehead"".  I have a 
meeting on it this morning.  Please comment to the draft I sent to you 
yesterday.  I don't know if the structure works.  I couldn't decide upon the 
format; it also looks like a cap.  Thanks.  SS

Subject: Re: BEAR Guarantee letter  

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was ""too old"" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. (""ECI"").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

Hi Theresa, 

I promised you an update today on the Goldman Sachs International Terms of 
Business Letter.  I am in contact with Sarah at Goldman Sachs daily and am 
trying to get her to set aside a time to discuss any outstanding issues and a 
time table for quickly getting the account executed.  I anticipate that she 
and I will speak to try to wrap things up tomorrow or Wednesday.  I willl 
keep you posted.  Until then, you can know that I call or email over there 
every day or every other day.

We're glad to hear that you are coming and we're looking forward to seeing
you again.

You can fly into any one of the three Washington area airports.  Reagan
National is the closest (about 35 minutes by car in non-rush hour traffic),
Washington Dulles is about 40 minutes away and BWI is about 50 minutes away.
That is generally our order of preference in looking for flights.  However,
flights into BWI in general may be cheaper than flights into Dulles or
National, and National tends to be the most expensive.  You need to check all
three as to price, because airfares change frequently and sometimes USAir or
another airline will quote a decent price into National.  Once you have
decided which airport you will be using, let us know and we will e-mail
directions.

Love - Anita and Steve"

Tom,
The day i received this I responded to Sara and cc'd richard that I was okay 
with transferring the Stock Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI.  The ENA was 
executed and the ECI piece is what is in process.  

Sara,
Any update?  How far are we away from exectution?  Do you need anything from 
anyone?

Thanks. Sheila

Elisabeth:

I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among 
other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its 
jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) 
made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades 
through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact 
on our standard reps relating to the ""trade options exemption"" and as to the 
parties being ""eligible swap participants"" (are they still required)?  Is 
there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

In response to your question, there is no internal memo but we do have copies

to provide for the ""eligible contract participant"" rep and line of business.  
I'll verify with Susan Bailey as to whether these changes have been subnitted 
to ECTRIC.  

Rather than bombard you with lots of paper, please let me know what you would 
lilke to see regarding the new legislation.  Please note that the act is very 
broad, extremely confusing (even to CFTC ""know-it alls"") and addresses many 
types of derivatives (ag, equity, etc.) with some specificity.

some answers since Cheryl is in a meeting.

Can we execute the ECI agreement today?  
Have we agreed on the assignment?
Does the assignment also provide for the transfer of the Master Securities 
Loan Agreement?
Regarding the new ENE guaranty, Cheryl has told me that this was already 
requested.  I'll check on the expedited delivery date.

Please call me when you receive this email.  Thanks very much for your

I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among 
other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its 
jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) 
made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades 
through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact 
on our standard reps relating to the ""trade options exemption"" and as to the 
parties being ""eligible swap participants"" (are they still required)?  Is 
there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

Martin

Subject: Update List

Hi Aneela, 

I have agreed to have my assistant work with me to send updates for the Legal 
Agreement Status memo to you.  I have gotten several of the Agreements on the 
list in ""executed"" or ""sent for execution"" status and you will get an updated 
memo next week confirming this.

In cleaning up our lotus notes this week, I noticed that several agreements 
were not on your list but remain unexecuted.  Can you let me know whether or 
not they remain a priority or interest?  If so, let me know so I can proceed 
on them during the first week in April (at which time I predict ALL of the 
other Agreements will be executed).

They include:

RBC Dominion Securities Corp.  (ECTI)

Sakura Dellsher, Inc.  (not sure which Enron company)

Societe General  (ENA)

BuySideDirect (ENA)

Merrill Lynch (ENA)

Sara, nothing has changed since yesterday, I don't think.  

ECI Brokerage Agreement: Anna and I completed negotiations on the agreement 
and she agreed las t week to implement the changes by today.

Assignment: Anna and I have a scheduled conference call today to resolve any 
outstanding issues.  If you talked to her today, please let me know before I 
initiate the call.

Guaranty: To be discussed today during our call.

Anna:

I know that you have been negotiating with Cheryl Nelson about the new ECI 
account.  I am receiving urgent calls from ECI traders and hope you give me 
some answers since Cheryl is in a meeting.

Can we execute the ECI agreement today?  
Have we agreed on the assignment?
Does the assignment also provide for the transfer of the Master Securities 
Loan Agreement?
Regarding the new ENE guaranty, Cheryl has told me that this was already 
requested.  I'll check on the expedited delivery date.

Please call me when you receive this email.  Thanks very much for your

What do you think about Russell's request for a confirm here?  I think this 
is really confusing for our Canadian team.  There must be requirements for 
the LC if it's an upfront LC, we would need a zero threshold.  I just don't 
think this is very straight forward for these poor Candadian girls to figure 
out.  What do you think?

Hi Sara & Tom,

Sara, I stopped by your office to discuss ECI but you are in a meeting.  

As per our discussion yesterday, I had a scheduled conference call with Anna 
Meytina of Bear Stearns to discuss ECI.  (Sara, the call was not at 1:30 but 
rather took place before noon today).   In light of our calls with Anna, here 
is where we stand:

1. Brokerage Agreement: I asked her how we are doing on getting the final 
draft of the Agreement to me.  She indicated that she was trying to send a 
redlined version today as promised.  She still has get approval on the 
arbitration provision and limited liability provision from her Managing 
Director.  this is what is manily holding up the process, not any lack of 
diligence on our part.

2.  Assignment: Anna and I discussed my comments to the Assignment Agreement 
-- she agreed to make all of the changes and to do so by the end of the day.  

3.  Guaranty: Anna and I have a scheduled conference call to discuss my 
comments to the redlined guaranty she sent back to me.

Anna represented that, in light of the hold-up from her Managing Director, it 
was unlikely that she could get any agreement signed by the end of the day 
today but agreed that Wednesday was a realistic possibility.

My primary job responsibility is to online trading, and right now EnronOnline 
is quite a beast of a customer.  Because of that I please ask that you direct 
any future questions you may have with respect to confirmations to our two 
paralegals who handle the day to day trading, Susan Bailey at x34737 and 
Stephanie Panus at x53249.  

With respect to the two current Canadian confirmations, Sara Shackleton, an 
attorney in our Group, is working with Credit to resolve the questions on the

Sara,
     Here is the last email exchanged with Jason.  My notes below state the
last status I had:

10/6/00 -Attorney conference call with Jason Peters - transfer, arbitration
and fall back - finalized but Jason must check with Enron counsel.  Called
Jason for status 10/27/00.  Susan Baily called to say their attorneys are
backlogged (Sara Shakelton) and not pushing the IDSA remaining comments
(arbitration, transfer) until we are doing business again 11/20/00.
Emailed Jason for status since trading swaps 12/8/00.  Left voice mail
message for Jason 1/5/01 for status.  Contacted Sara for status 3/26/01 -
left message.

     Suggest we set up a conference call with our Attorney Janine Huber to
finalize any remaining issues.  What is your availability this week?

Maria

Tana,

I have a favour - Jon McKay of our office is wondering if you have any record 
of a deal with TMG Financial Products Inc. that is a one-off transaction 
dealing with ""credit sleeving""?

All we have here is a copy of an ISDA with them - not what he's looking for.

Thanks

We're glad to hear that you are coming and we're looking forward to seeing
you again.

You can fly into any one of the three Washington area airports.  Reagan
National is the closest (about 35 minutes by car in non-rush hour traffic),
Washington Dulles is about 40 minutes away and BWI is about 50 minutes away.
That is generally our order of preference in looking for flights.  However,
flights into BWI in general may be cheaper than flights into Dulles or
National, and National tends to be the most expensive.  You need to check all
three as to price, because airfares change frequently and sometimes USAir or
another airline will quote a decent price into National.  Once you have
decided which airport you will be using, let us know and we will e-mail
directions.

Love - Anita and Steve"

Subject: Re: BEAR Guarantee letter  

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was ""too old"" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. (""ECI"").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

Sara, tks for your swift response.  I'll follow up with Mark E. on the memos, 
but would very much like to see the new ""eligible contract participant"" and 
line of business reps (or perhaps just a copy of ENA's revised ISDA 
Schedule).  Tks

FYI, I won't come to San Antonio; hope instead to see you at the autumn

How are things going?

In response to your question, there is no internal memo but we do have copies 
of external lawfirm memoranda.  Yes, ENA has changed its ISDA Schedule form 
to provide for the ""eligible contract participant"" rep and line of business.  
I'll verify with Susan Bailey as to whether these changes have been subnitted 
to ECTRIC.  

Rather than bombard you with lots of paper, please let me know what you would 
lilke to see regarding the new legislation.  Please note that the act is very 
broad, extremely confusing (even to CFTC ""know-it alls"") and addresses many 
types of derivatives (ag, equity, etc.) with some specificity.

Will you be in San Antonio?

I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among 
other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its 
jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) 
made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades 
through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact 
on our standard reps relating to the ""trade options exemption"" and as to the 
parties being ""eligible swap participants"" (are they still required)?  Is 
there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

RECAP:  This is Project Moosehead.  After the meeting, we determined that the 
transaction should be structured as a cap and not a swaption.  The Fixed 
Price is the premium.  The Strike is the Cap Price (remember, strikes are for 
options and strikes are cap/floor in those deals).  We'll need to revise 
today to send in the morning.  CP is ""Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc."".  
Enron party normally is ENA but we may change to EPMI and create a new ISDA 
Master for the deal.  There must be a zero floor (ie, no negative payments in 
the other direction).  Don't worry about weekend quotes yet because we may 
eliminate weekends and extend the term of the deal. 

Could you begin revising?  Also, do the calculations work?  Please feel free 
to call me as I'm buried in my office today and things change as the day goes 
on.  SS

If it's a Cap, is the Fixed Price then the Strike Price?  I think the format 
looks good.  I would prefer a ""Notice of Exercise"" provision, but it's not 
necessary.

Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was ""too old"" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. (""ECI"").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

In response to your question, there is no internal memo but we do have copies

to provide for the ""eligible contract participant"" rep and line of business.  
I'll verify with Susan Bailey as to whether these changes have been subnitted

Rather than bombard you with lots of paper, please let me know what you would

I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among 
other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its 
jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) 
made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades 
through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact 
on our standard reps relating to the ""trade options exemption"" and as to the

there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

don't have the resources right now for handling all of Sam's load

FirstEnergy Services Corp - please have your assistant redline changes since 
this is also one of Sam's items

City of Palo Alto and Macquarie Inc. (or ""Bank Ltd"") -  neither of these are 
on anyone's radar screen so please proceed as you wish

Proctor & Gamble - please return to me for further handling.  Ed Quinn is 
leaving Enron

Allied Waste North America -- Samantha has this marked ""sent for execution"" 
as of 2/13; can I get one of the other specialists to follow up on this?

FirstEnergy Services Corp -- Very close to finishing this (I hope); I owe 
them another redline that should reflect agreement on all issues

Select Energy -- this has recently been revived after a long dormancy.  Ed 
Sacks is revisiting credit issues.  Meanwhile, I am plodding through minutiae 
with their very detail-minded attorney

City of Palo Alto -- recently received an e-mail from their assistant city 
attorney stating that they are internally discussing what needs to be done to 
their city code to allow for derivatives trading; he also said they will not 
be ready to discuss this w/ me for a couple of weeks

Macquarie Bank Ltd. -- this is an ag ISDA (although there is no specific 
trade for it at this time).  I am waiting for our meeting to discuss 
ag-related changes to our ISDA forms.  Once that is settled, I will send them 
an updated draft

Proctor & Gamble -- I sent Libby Rutherford a letter in December, outlining 
the issues to be discussed.  I think I also put in a few phone calls to her 
at that time.  I never heard from her.  I haven't heard any pressure for 
movement from the pulp & paper desk since I met w/ Ed Quinn and some other 
people in January (although I did happen to get a call yesterday from an EES 
person working on a deal with them; he was just curious as to what we were 
doing w/ them and the status of things; I put him in touch w/ Ed)

still happy to meet w/ you on these if you wish -- Bob

Thank you again for reviewing the Equity Swap ISDA Confirmation the other

Hi Sara and Sheila, 

By way of update, I was able to get the guaranty to Clem and am working on 
his getting it back to me by the end of the day.  I talked to Bear Stearn's 
lawyer today about whether we could get the other agreements (account and 
assignment) executed today and she represented that (1) she is still waiting 
for her Managing Director's approval of her final draft in order to forward 
it to me (2) but that she is working with me to check in with the MD every 
hour or so for a status update.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

Sara, I am on hold on a conference call but wanted to talk with you about 
some questions/issues re: the assignment agreement.  (My questions are not 
holding us up since Anna is proceeding to try to get a final draft as we know 
it executed).  But for my own understanding:

1. Is ENA assigning to Enron Credit Inc. any agreements other than the 
Securities Loan Agreement?  If so, let me know.  If not, then would we need 
an assignment agreement as opposed to just having Enron Credit Inc. sign a 
Securities Loan Agreement?

(1)  The only agreement that ENA is assigning is the Securities Loan 
Agreement.

(2)  Remember, ENA is also assigning the ""credit book"" (identified in 
Sheila's earlier email and more clearly identified in Tom Doukas' email of 
yesterday which I forwarded to ;you yesterday).

Hi Sara and Sheila, 

By way of update, I was able to get the guaranty to Clem and am working on 
his getting it back to me by the end of the day.  I talked to Bear Stearn's 
lawyer today about whether we could get the other agreements (account and 
assignment) executed today and she represented that (1) she is still waiting 
for her Managing Director's approval of her final draft in order to forward 
it to me (2) but that she is working with me to check in with the MD every 
hour or so for a status update.

Tom,
The day i received this I responded to Sara and cc'd richard that I was okay 
with transferring the Stock Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI.  The ENA was 
executed and the ECI piece is what is in process.  

Sara,
Any update?  How far are we away from exectution?  Do you need anything from 
anyone?

Thanks. Sheila

Subject: Re: BEAR Guarantee letter  

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was ""too old"" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. (""ECI"").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Hey, DUDE!  Have you forgotten to read your Lotus Notes today?  Looks like 
this one filtered through lots of people (since you left, multiple people 
fill your shoes).  And where did you hear it was nice over in Houston?  It's 
raining with a high of 54 F.  But it is supposed to reach mid-70's over the 
weekend.

I'll ask Susan B. to send you a copy.  Stay tuned for the mad cow email.

Hi Sara.  Who set the credit terms for this one?  Let me guess ... me.  I 
actually would like a copy for our files over here.

It's raining.  Again.  I hear Houston is nice.

Sass,

I know you hate this sort of thing, but this is just too funny to pass up
and I didn't want to leave you out in the cold.

Have you heard from Anita?  She emailed me about whether or not I was going
to be at the wedding.

Please disregard the confirm attached below. Per ongoing conversations, they 
now want for us to create a confirm that allows them to add or delete shares 
at any time without having to create a new confirm for any new trade. They 
expect the volume of trades will increase in the near future. I will revise 
the confirmation to include language to ths effect for your review. I will 
send it to you shortly. I would like to meet with you along with Aneela 
Charania, who is the transaction, to ensure  the confirm captures what is 
intended. Once you receive the revised confirm I will call Kaye to schedule a 
meeting with you.

Thanks for your patience.

Good Morning Sara,

Thank you again for reviewing the Equity Swap ISDA Confirmation the other 
day. They now want to capture the trades in question as a basket equity swap. 
I have modified the confirmation to accommodate the basket and included Annex 
I. Please review and advise if any changes should be made.

Hi Theresa, 

Here is our daily update since we are trying to move quickly on this:

I had a conference call with Sara Stowey in London.  We actually had two 
legal issues outstanding as of yesterday.  One she agreed to.  The last one 
has to do with arbitration and she says that hopefully she will have an aswer 
by Friday.  If not, then on Friday, I could seek approval from our General 
Counsel to deviate from our standard legal policy on the issue so that we 
could move forward.

We have a borkerage account meeting today and I will forward to you a written 
status report at that time.  As I mentioned to Aneela this morning, most of 
the agreements on her list have been executed.

Hey Sara, Keegan stopped by my office right before lunch to indicate that you 
had requested from her the updated brokerage list.  But reminder that I have 
the updated list and have an updated version.  Reminder that Keegan will not 
start updating the list until after today's meeting.  When I talked to Aneela 
by phone today, I gave her an update and reminded her that she would get a 
formally updated list after today's meeting.  Also, as I indicated yesterday, 
most of the agreements on the list -- the vast majority -- have been executed.

I stopped by your office a few times but you seem to have gone to lunch so I 
am leaving a version on your chair.

I see so, in another words the ""credit book"" consists of -- or is considered 
--- ""obligations"" etc. but there are no other agreements.  Thanx for 
reiterating.

(1)  The only agreement that ENA is assigning is the Securities Loan 
Agreement.

(2)  Remember, ENA is also assigning the ""credit book"" (identified in 
Sheila's earlier email and more clearly identified in Tom Doukas' email of 
yesterday which I forwarded to ;you yesterday).

Sara, I am on hold on a conference call but wanted to talk with you about 
some questions/issues re: the assignment agreement.  (My questions are not 
holding us up since Anna is proceeding to try to get a final draft as we know 
it executed).  But for my own understanding:

1. Is ENA assigning to Enron Credit Inc. any agreements other than the 
Securities Loan Agreement?  If so, let me know.  If not, then would we need 
an assignment agreement as opposed to just having Enron Credit Inc. sign a 
Securities Loan Agreement?

Hello Team, 

I have good news.  Clem Abrams approved the guaranty and will have it 
executed first thing tomorrow.  (None of the requisite officers are in today).

I am still contacting Bear Stearns every couple of hours to get the final 
drafts of the agreements in our hands.  I'll keep you posted.

Hi Sara and Sheila, 

By way of update, I was able to get the guaranty to Clem and am working on 
his getting it back to me by the end of the day.  I talked to Bear Stearn's 
lawyer today about whether we could get the other agreements (account and 
assignment) executed today and she represented that (1) she is still waiting 
for her Managing Director's approval of her final draft in order to forward 
it to me (2) but that she is working with me to check in with the MD every 
hour or so for a status update.

The day i received this I responded to Sara and cc'd richard that I was okay 
with transferring the Stock Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI.  The ENA was 
executed and the ECI piece is what is in process.

Any update?  How far are we away from exectution?  Do you need anything from

Subject: Re: BEAR Guarantee letter  

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was ""too old"" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. (""ECI"").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Thank you very much.

Do we know if they intend to apply the guaranty to the account same day or 
will that take some time?

Since the guaranty is on ECI, and we are doing the assignment and assumption 
is it fair to assume the account might have to renamed/positions transfered 
to some new account before they will give us relief?

Sheila,

Are we going to flip out the Morgan account straight to the ECI entity?  Will 
this delay the split?

Thanks,

Tom

Hello Team, 

I have good news.  Clem Abrams approved the guaranty and will have it 
executed first thing tomorrow.  (None of the requisite officers are in today).

I am still contacting Bear Stearns every couple of hours to get the final 
drafts of the agreements in our hands.  I'll keep you posted.

Hi Sara and Sheila, 

By way of update, I was able to get the guaranty to Clem and am working on 
his getting it back to me by the end of the day.  I talked to Bear Stearn's

Wednesday, March 28 is the target execution date for the ECI customer 
agreement and assignment (from ENA) of the Securities Loan Agreement/credit 
book.  I am not certain if Cheryl was able to expedite delivery of the new 
ENE guaranty.

Tom,
The day i received this I responded to Sara and cc'd richard that I was okay 
with transferring the Stock Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI.  The ENA was 
executed and the ECI piece is what is in process.  

Sara,
Any update?  How far are we away from exectution?  Do you need anything from 
anyone?

Thanks. Sheila

Subject: Re: BEAR Guarantee letter  

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was ""too old"" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. (""ECI"").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

Sara -

I would like to discuss with you a potential opportunity at WAPA Sierra 
Nevada.  We have just sent them an EEI and would like you to send them an 
ISDA.  Basically in the near future they might find themselves quite short 
due to a PG&E contract being invalidated.  If that happens they will either:

1. Buy physical power from the market (use our EEI)
2.Do a financial swap with the market and continue to do the physical index 
with PG&E (there are some reasons for this which I am not 100% sure on).

The lawyer we have dealt with is Koji Kawamura and his email address is:

kawamura@wapa.gov

Thanks for your help - If you have any questions please let me know.

Good Afternon Sara,

Here is the revised confirmation that I believe captures what they are 
looking to accomplish. They are looking for us to create one confirmation 
that is open ended to allow additional trades as well as deletions along the 
way. I believe this language accompishes this concept.

Please review and advise should any changes be required.

Thanks again!

Subject: Equity Swap ""Basket"" ISDA Confirmation

Good Afternon Sara,

Here is the revised confirmation that I believe captures what they are 
looking to accomplish. They are looking for us to create one confirmation 
that is open ended to allow additional trades as well as deletions along the 
way. I believe this language accompishes this concept.

Please review and advise should any changes be required.

Thanks again!

Jorge

Sara,

the chances of my finding this stuff before the Act is repealed are 
considerably less than zero. 

With abject apologies, could I ask you to resend the details of the Act to me 
and to Martin.

Hope you are well.

Thanks

Hello London, this is Bob Bruce -- I will be joining Sara on the conference 
call you have scheduled for Friday (3/27).

If Sheila Glover is still in London, I think her participation in the call 
would be very valuable if she is available.

p.s.  if either of you run across Sheila prior to the call, could you ask her 
to call me re Japan?  thanks, Bob

Attached are the two (2) final version GTC's.  The legal terminology is 
identical for each product.  However, Stuart needs to provide a title for 
each product which will also appear in the Paragraph 1.

The former Paragraph 2 has been deleted (it contained the ""confirmation 
terms"") and the remaining paragraphs renumbered.

Justin:  Will you circulate the revised long description (since your 
conversation with Stuart yesterday afternoon)?  Also, will you let us all 
know when we are competely done?

Please call with comments as soon as possible.

Subsequent to our swap group meeting with Clement last week, I have discussed 
the issue further with Jeff Hodge, Peter Keohane, Russell Diamond and Clem.  
In addition to ENA, ECC is feeling the pressure of delays for obtaining 
corporate guaranties caused by increased guaranty requests, too few signers 
and insufficient legal staffing to handle the volume.

Although Clem will have assistance soon, we concluded that it would be 
prudent to begin negotiation of a guaranty immediately rather than wait for 
the conclusion of the master agreement (or confirmation) negotiations.  
Please try to incorporate this approach, particularly with Canadian 
counterparties. 

Credit will continue to push our internal form of Enron Corp. guaranty.

Hi Stephanie, 

I thought the execution process was complete on this one but actually we are 
still in the process of executing.  DBAB has sent to us two copies signed by 
them and hence, ready for our signatures.  I am forwarding to you so that you 
could get the signatures and prepare the Authorized Officers List and the 
Consent Form for signatures as well.  

Cassandra wants an explanatory blurb about why the account is necessary, 
please check in to get some justification from Aneela, Sheila or Theresa.

Thank you,

Sara -

I would like to discuss with you a potential opportunity at WAPA Sierra 
Nevada.  We have just sent them an EEI and would like you to send them an 
ISDA.  Basically in the near future they might find themselves quite short 
due to a PG&E contract being invalidated.  If that happens they will either:

1. Buy physical power from the market (use our EEI)
2.Do a financial swap with the market and continue to do the physical index 
with PG&E (there are some reasons for this which I am not 100% sure on).

The lawyer we have dealt with is Koji Kawamura and his email address is:

kawamura@wapa.gov

Thanks for your help - If you have any questions please let me know.

Stewart Rosman

That is wonderful.  However my Prime Broker contact at Bear has still not 
been advised of the pending changes.  It would seem to me it will still take 
time for Bear to make the adjustment to the account.

This will likely delay getting the margin relief we so desperately need.

Could you please confirm that they are ready to fully enact the agreement and 
lower the margin requirements as of tomorrow?

Thanks,

Tom

All:

Attached are the two (2) final version GTC's.  The legal terminology is 
identical for each product.  However, Stuart needs to provide a title for 
each product which will also appear in the Paragraph 1.

The former Paragraph 2 has been deleted (it contained the ""confirmation 
terms"") and the remaining paragraphs renumbered.

Justin:  Will you circulate the revised long description (since your 
conversation with Stuart yesterday afternoon)?  Also, will you let us all 
know when we are competely done?

Please call with comments as soon as possible.

Dear SARA,

Beginning May 1st, ShareBuilder will introduce a new fee structure for our 
basic services.  Single recurring transactions will cost slightly more, while 
other prices will drop.  Many of you have asked us to cut our prices for 
Real-Time Trades and I'm pleased to announce that we're doing just that.  In 
addition, we are cutting the fee for one-time (non real-time) ShareBuilder 
transactions as well.  And later in May, we will introduce a new ShareBuilder 
subscription option, where for only $8 a month you can take advantage of 
unlimited ShareBuilder purchases!

WHAT'S THE NEW PRICE STRUCTURE?
On May 1st, the standard recurring transaction fee will change from $2 to $3 
(and from $1 to $2 for custodial accounts).  We are also reducing several 
fees directly.  To simplify our structure, we are cutting the fee for 
one-time (non real-time) ShareBuilder transactions from $5 to just $3.  We 
have also listened to you about Real-Time Trades, and have reduced the fee 
from $19.95 to $15.95.  Here is a summary of the changes:

* All you can Build - New! $8
* ShareBuilder transaction - from $2 to $3
   (Individual, Joint or IRA)
* ShareBuilder transaction - from $1 to $2
   (Custodial)
* One-Time ShareBuilder transaction - from $5 to $3
* Real-Time Trades - from $19.95 to $15.95

Not only are we offering you a less expensive way to diversify your 
portfolio, we've also lowered our prices for those investors who purchase on 
a one-time basis or trade Real-Time.  All you can Build will be the least 
expensive way to build a portfolio of stocks anywhere.  While we want to 
encourage diversification and recommend the subscription plan, paying per 
transaction can still make sense for investors purchasing just one or two 
stocks in their ShareBuilder Plan.

STAYING THE COURSE
The market has been incredibly tough for all of us during the past several 
months, but we all know that we still have to invest money to get ahead in 
the long run.  While the effect on our portfolio values has been depressing, 
cycles are normal, and the prudent way to smooth the effects is to keep 
investing equal dollar amounts.  Holding to a strategy of dollar-cost 
averaging across a diverse group of stocks is exactly what investors should 
do to minimize their market risk over time. In a market rebound, today's low 
prices will look like bargains in comparison.  We hope that giving you the 
best tools possible to invest wisely will position you and your investments 
to succeed. I believe the All you can Build feature will be a big help.

Sincerely,


Jeff Seely

Hi Stephanie, 

I thought the execution process was complete on this one but actually we are 
still in the process of executing.  DBAB has sent to us two copies signed by 
them and hence, ready for our signatures.  I am forwarding to you so that you 
could get the signatures and prepare the Authorized Officers List and the 
Consent Form for signatures as well.  

Cassandra wants an explanatory blurb about why the account is necessary, 
please check in to get some justification from Aneela, Sheila or Theresa.

Tracy:

The Allegheny swap side letter provides that the parties will make a good 
faith effort to negotiate the ISDA master by April 6.  I am waiting with the 
firrst redraft of the agreement but can't get a response from anyone as to 
whom and where to send (via email).  I've left voice mails for Yair and Kate

Due to a delay with the printing of the direct deposit advices for the March 
30th payday, the advices will be distributed later than normal.  We 
anticipate the majority of the advices will be received by Friday 
afternoon.   Please be assured this does not impact the deposit of funds to 
your bank account.  Your funds will be available on payday, Friday, March 
30th.

 It has become customary to prepare Unanimous Consents of Directors for many 
transactions even if such actions are not required by the relevant By-laws 
and/or Certificate of Incorporation.  Please consider carefully whether 
Unanimous Consents of Directors are necessary or appropriate in a particular 
transaction, i.e., the transaction is a significant transaction or evidence 
of authority is required for a legal opinion.  When in doubt, please review 
the By-laws and Certificate of Incorporation of the relevant entity and 
discuss the matter with a member of the Office of the General Counsel.

Thank you."

Mark, we are trying to have everything completed so we could launch this 
product to go live on April 9th. Sara has already given us the approval on 
the GTCs for these FX products for external counterparties. The products do 
not have names as yet, but the FX team is working on it. Can you go ahead and 
review the GTC's for these products in the mean time and I will contact you 
with the names of the products as soon as we get them.
Thanks

Hi Selena, 

I received a phone call today from ITG indicating that their business persons 
overlooked a step in the procedural/legal process of getting Quantex 
installed.  As you know, I executed the NASDAQ, AMEX etc. agreements that 
accompanied the Quantex agreement itself.  ITG indicated that they never 
faxed to us one more of these such agreements that has to get done and that 
they are going to fax it on Monday when the requisite operations person 
returns.  Once this last statement is executed on Monday they will be able to 
stall the equipment.  

They further indicated that, in practical terms, there overnight should not 
cause any further delay because they are just shipping the equipment today 
for installation on Monday or Tuesday.  I will keep you posted.  

Feel free to call me Monday afternoon for an update and to insure that we are 
getting this last agreement executed.

Julie, if I have any business-IT questions, I will call you on Monday.  I 
anticipate that in light of all the other agreements, everything will be 
straight forward and I will get the agreement reviewed and executed pretty 
quickly.

Hi Sara, Anna and I have recommended that you call her to give your 
perspective on an outstanding concern that Anna maintains with respect to the 
Assignment Agreement.  Anna and her MD want specifically to discuss the 
substance of the Exhibit that you would like to attach to the Agreement.    
Call me first so that if I am not at lunch (I am leaving for a late lunch in 
the next fifteen minutes) I can join in.  Otherwise, please call Anna 
directly at 212-272-2727.

Sara,
Apologies for the delay.  The JPM salesperson has been traveling and I needed 
to
make sure that the commission schedule was complete.  I am told that it will 
be
completed by Monday morning, so Thomas Alterson from our Client, Credit and
Control group will be sending you the final agreements by e-mail today.  For 
the
sake of time, you can execute the agreements by fax with originals to follow.

Tom's fax number is (212) 648-5347.

Regards,
Corinne 6-4292

Sara,
Thank you for your fax.
Section 180.3 of the CEA prohibits us from agreeing to any settlement
procedure/forum ahead of time.  JPMFI, in accordance with 180.3, will offer
3
forums - which will include AAA.  If Enron chooses AAA, the arbitration
will be
subject to the provisions specified in your fax dd 2/26/2001.

Attached is JPM's proposed language for the arbitration agreement.

(See attached file: ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.doc)

If you are in agreement with the language, please forward Enron's proposed
language (detailed in your 2/26 fax) electronically (if available).

Thank you and Regards,
Corinne

I have asked that you be placed on the distribution list--the system is down, 
or I would attach copies of the other documents; however, we expect new 
drafts from A&K tonight and I do not think it would be profitable for you to 
review the drafts we have of the other documents, unless you have a lot of

The Allegheny swap side letter provides that the parties will make a good

Sara, I confirmed with Mike Bruegel  that he will be opening the account for 
us and has understood this since Tom Doukas and I addressed this issue 
yesterday.  I will edit your lotus notes entry to reflect this correction.

Also, he asked me whether I knew what documents have to accompany the 
agreement.  I told him yes, since I do this all the time.  I have in my 
electronic file folder the blank account form and tax form.  If you would 
like for me to send electronic copes to you if you do not have copies then 
let me know.

That is wonderful.  However my Prime Broker contact at Bear has still not 
been advised of the pending changes.  It would seem to me it will still take 
time for Bear to make the adjustment to the account.

This will likely delay getting the margin relief we so desperately need.

Could you please confirm that they are ready to fully enact the agreement and 
lower the margin requirements as of tomorrow?

Thanks,

Tom

I don't know if Enron has any ISDAs with Sumitomo or Sakura, but I thought 
I'd forward this to you just in case.

Floor and Clearing Members
________________________________________________________________

The expiration date for the May 2001 options contract for Platinum (POK1) is 
Friday, April 6, 2001.

GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options

engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options 
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized 
representative present at their normal work station promptly at 5:30 p.m. 
until released by the Exchange staff as specified below.  All adjustments 
and/or corrections, must be accompanied by relevant supporting documentation 
prior to being incorporated into expiration processing, in essence making the 
expiration processing an extension of the afternoon trade resolution 
procedures.  All input to the NYMEX Clearing Department will conclude no 
later than 30 minutes after floor representatives are released.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110), Floor Trade Correction (299-2068 and 299-2169)

available to assist with the processing of notices of Exercise and 
Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other questions or 
problems you may have.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

via transmission for that contract series will be disregarded.

ALL POSITIONS ARE DEEMED FINAL
Upon completion of all PCS input, all positions will be deemed final.

EXERCISE/ASSIGNMENT INFORMATION

E-Mail and by Fast Facts. This should occur within 1 hour of the last PCS 
input.

All Clearing Members are required to have an authorized representative(s) at 
their C21 workstations in preparation for any communication during the 
expiration process.

FAST FACTS
Clearing Members should call the Fast Facts information service 301-4871,
